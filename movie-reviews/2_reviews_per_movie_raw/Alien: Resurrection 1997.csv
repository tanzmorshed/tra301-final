"laika-lives","6","138","195","10 August 2007"," Some perspectives on Alien: Resurrection
","The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine."

","Although it's got major flaws and some plot holes, I find myself liking Alien Resurrection a lot. First of all, I'm a sucker for horror and sci-fi movies. Second, I LOVE the Alien series, although Alien³ was a bit offbeat in the action department. Third, Sigourney Weaver is incredibly menacing as a cloned Ripley. She's always great to see on screen but this was truly something to behold. and last but not least, I loved the storyline, how they brought the genetic aspect so cleverly. It was truly a new twist on the series, although I wouldn't qualify A:R as a REAL episode in the Alien series but rather a new begining. Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a great job in bringing his fantastic style to Hollywood. The creatures were cool and scary although I wish we had seen more of the Queen; we still had the horrific Newborn which was truly demonic. Anyway, despite it's flaws, it's still a great film, although it will never be a classic like Alien and Aliens are. Now if only there could be a fifth one with a better script, more character development and more firepower."
"LordBlacklist","6","238","357","9 February 2006"," The Fatal Mistake.
","Review 4 of 4<br/><br/>With Alien 3 closing the story arc of the Alien trilogy, this film begins with a fresh slate. The Alien films have always been a director's series but in this film it was the writing that ultimately killed it. Resurrection tries to be too many things at once. It has a very artistic and dynamic visual style, but cardboard characters. It has a very overt sense of humor, but it is all done in a very juvenile manner. Much of the maturity and restraint of the previous three films is thrown out in favor of a more comic book style. The cinematography and set design is gorgeous to the point of decadence. Sigourney Weaver has been given an interesting character to play and does it with a strange sense of detachment that lends more depth to the proceedings than the script ever could. Thinking back, the first three films all had very solid overall stories and well developed characters while Resurrection has a very solid concept but can't seem to build a coherent movie around it. If you follow the overall themes of the series with the first, second and third being birth, life, and death respectively that leaves Resurrection on shaky thematic ground. Since this is Alien: RESURRECTION obviously the filmmakers wished for rebirth to be the theme, but somehow it never quite works. The characters are basically action movie clichés, and the action sequences of the movie are hopelessly contrived. Why does the Alien always stop to snarl before it attacks giving people just enough time to shoot it? Alien 3 did not have this problem and it reinforced how dangerous the creature really was. Resurrection turns the Aliens into monsters from a B-movie. Very few scenes in the film are particularly memorable. Sure, the underwater chase is a nice bit of action derring-do, but there's no real sense of danger...except for the supporting characters you barely know who get killed in the reverse order they appear in the credits. Two fantastic scenes that I wish there were more of in the film are the doctor's examination of the Aliens where he ""plays"" with them. Now that was a scene of inspired genius. The other scene was when Ripley wakes up in her circular chamber. It is interesting to note that neither of these scenes have any dialogue, because the dialogue is pretty atrocious. Ron Pearlman is always fun to watch and makes a good comic duo with Dominique Pinon, but Winona Ryder absolutely kills this movie with her nonperformance. The effects look less realistic this time out and the score at times seems to try too hard to emulate the second and third films with Goldsmith's original Alien theme being used on several occasions. The film is a brilliant exercise in dynamic visuals but the story really does not go anywhere. Unlike the first three films this one does not take itself seriously at all so the danger level becomes nonexistent. I believe Jean-Pierre Jeunet was an excellent choice for a director but the script served him very badly. This is an interesting film to watch for an interesting scene here and there but not in the same league as the previous films."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","153","234","30 May 2008"," ""Was it everything you hoped for?""
","Alien Resurrection was released about six months after I graduated from high school, and at the time I wasn't very familiar with the series. I took my first film class about six months later, at which point I learned to really appreciate the great films and filmmakers, and one of the first things I learned was that the first three Alien films are spectacular achievements of science fiction cinema and the third sequel is a sad, ridiculous mess. This happens all too often with sequels and yes, part four is not yet another amazingly impressive Alien film, but come on, it's not THAT bad. <br/><br/>I watched it last night for the first time in almost ten years, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's strange that I liked it so much, because it shows all the signs of a botched, modernized sequel of a series that should have been left alone long ago. The characters, most of all, are almost all goofy caricatures with preposterous dialogue and routine motivations, and some just don't belong at all. Personally I am a pretty big fan of Winona Ryder, but only in roles that suit her, and she has had a lengthy list of roles that suit her, but Annallee Call in Alien Resurrection is just not one of them. Too often she comes off as a tough talking teenager in this movie and it just gets hard to take her character seriously. She's like Ja Rule in Half Past Dead, but less ridiculous.<br/><br/>Then again, this could just have been a result of her starring alongside Sigourney Weaver, and that woman is just awesome. Dan Hedaya is suitably over-the-top in his role as the gleefully neurotic General Perez, and I have to admit that I was curious to see the performance of Gary Dourdan as Christie. Lately I've been watching countless hours of CSI on DVD, and it's amazing to see how different his role is in this movie from the most serious role he would play later in that show. I prefer the later performance, myself.<br/><br/>The resurrection implied in the title refers to Ripley being borough back to life 200 years after her death for the purpose of creating one of the alien queens, and then breeding the animals for twisted scientific purposes. They decide to keep Ripley alive for observation after surgically removing the alien from her chest, only to discover that she and the aliens are clearly more than they are prepared to handle. There is a negligible subplot involving a group of shady characters headed by the wonderfully sinister Michael Wincott as a Frank Elgyn, who promises his men won't start trouble or get into any fights if they are allowed to stay on board for a few days and nights. <br/><br/>I also have to mention Ron Perlman, who just has a face for this kind of movie. Probably most recognizable lately as Hellboy, this has to be one of the least appreciated actors of the last few decades. In just over 20 years he has acted in more than 150 films and TV shows, and at the time of this writing he has 18 projects in the works. Unbelievable! He also has one of the best lines in the movie (""Why the waste of ammo?! Must be a chick thing"").<br/><br/>The aliens are probably the thing that will make or break this movie, and in my opinion they were impressive enough. The occasional CGI effects are never convincing, but then again they never are, so luckily they didn't overdo them. Even the aliens swimming underwater was not too much for me to accept, perhaps given the automatic tension that is immediately generated in almost any movie where someone has to hold their breath for a long time. This went on far too long to be anything remotely realistic in this movie, but it was a good scene nonetheless. <br/><br/>I would also argue that this is the goriest of all of the four alien movies, particularly at the end, but also contains some of the best comic relief. This combination makes the movie highly entertaining, even following in the long shadows of its spectacular predecessors. There is a high energy scene in the third act of the film where Perlman's character performs a daredevil stunt to shoot one of the pursuing aliens dead which is followed by what has to be the funniest spider killing in film history. I haven't laughed out loud like that at a movie in a long, long time. <br/><br/>In browsing through the posts on the message board for Resurrection I have been inspired to raise my rating for the movie from a 7 to an 8, if only because it is so obvious that everyone is jumping on the bandwagon about bashing this movie. I see nothing but whiny, pouting little brats whimpering and griping about little nitpicky details in the movie, condemning the third sequel in the Alien quadrilogy as a travesty and an embarrassment and a pathetic way to end the series. <br/><br/>Stupid people in large numbers, man. It's sad to see such a clear mob mentality slamming a movie that is about 100 times better than most people say. No, it's not up to the same level as the first two films and it definitely has its drawbacks, but it is definitely a good installment in the series, and you could certainly do a lot worse for some fun popcorn sci-fi on a Friday night. I'll admit that my judgment might be a little skewed because I watched the staggeringly awful Eaten Alive just before seeing this, but it is clear to me that Alien: Resurrection has yet to receive the respect it deserves."
"DelfinoD","7","10","12","11 September 2010"," Not as good as the classical Aliens, but still a bit underrated
","Alien: Resurrection is much different than classical Aliens. As a result many Alien-maniacs are disappointed and give it bad notes in the reviews. In my opinion one should look at the movie in a different way. It is not a clear continuation of the story, but rather a variation on the subject.<br/><br/>Alien 4 is not perfect, not even great, but still it is a good science fiction movie. The story is very well written. Many people criticize the idea of cloning Ripley along with the alien inside. Of course I agree that this is completely naive and unrealistic (even the general asks how it is possible), but we have to accept this as a convention. There was no other way to have Ripley back in Alien 4. Well I can imagine Ripley waking up and saying 'Hey, it was just a dream, I didn't jump into the burning lead', but this would be even more ridiculous to me. In Star Wars for example there are many naive and unrealistic things but it doesn't stop it from being a great movie. We accept them just as a convention.<br/><br/>Other people note that Alien 4 is not scary at all. I agree. But I still think that it wasn't supposed to be very scary. In Alien 1&2 Ripley was scared as hell and so were we. In Alien 3 she wasn't scared as much, as she knew from a point, that the Alien wouldn't kill her. We were not scared that much either. In Resurrection Ripley is not scared at all, as she is a bit of alien herself. Why should we be scared then? In my opinion this confusion, whether Ripley is more a human or a alien and who to chose, is the best feature of the movie. It is not a pure action but also a bit of psychological drama. The newborn alien is a masterpiece to me. Ripley, who has strong maternal instinct (see Aliens) feels that it has some of her DNA, that it is her own child. She has real doubts whether to kill it or not. And what is even more interesting is that she probably kills it only to save Annalee. I think she would not kill it just to save a human, which were shown in the movie as beings not really better than the aliens themselves. She did it to save the robot, who in her opinion was probably much more of worth. And that is how I actually felt while watching the movie. ""The newborn alien is so cute, maybe let him kill those freaking human beings."" But then I would be sorry for Annalee...<br/><br/>In my opinion this is a very good movie, with nice climate and many philosophical questions asked. But if you care only for good action or horror, then you might be disappointed."
"triskellion","Null","89","143","13 September 1999"," Meaning in the chaos
","Jeunet is a unique visual genius, and purveyor of rare pathos. What may be truly unique about Alien: Resurrection is the scene wherein Ripley discovers the 7 ""mistakes"" that preceded her. It is one of the most powerful, terrifying and ultimately beautiful scenes I have ever experienced in a film.  The ""please kill me"" segment pops up in other scenes, perhaps other films in the series, and certainly other films in general, but where has one witnessed the great suffering of a version of oneself and the ""chance"" to end that person's suffering? Weaver plays the scene with just the right amount of emotional chaos.  Jeunet typically softens the end of the scene with Ron Perlman's ""must be a chick thing"" comment, but thankfully that humorous interjection is no more jarring that a slight Shakespearean comic relief.  Another terrifying-poignant-grand guignol, and perhaps a unique situation in film (mother killing son and being a hero for it) with the Newborn getting sucked out of the cargo window, one glob of flesh at a time, is also a visually stunning and beautiful realization of the ultimate, primal connection between Ripley and the beast, and the uncomprehending shock and horror the beast experiences when he realizes his own ""mother"" won't save him. I think Jeunet perfectly handled the movie: the humor, goofier than any in the previous episodes in the series, shows a very European director confident enough in his own style to inject a sacred cow with some sweet cream."
"AMIO-PatricioMunoz","6","101","165","29 September 2005"," It might disappoint you and here's why...
","The first three Alien films have a unique kind of ""magic"" about them that I think make up the ideal Alien experience.<br/><br/>It is the ""ALIEN"" atmosphere: The first three films depict a very real world around a mysterious and terrifying ALIEN creature that you feared along with the well developed characters.<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection has a very different flavor. Although it has some serious moments, there are several areas of this film that are out-of-place in both the film and the saga: Alien Resurrection has a number of humorous scenes which I feel take away from the above described overall ALIEN experience. The director goes straight into the action very quickly in this film so the only well developed character is Ripley. I think that the Alien creature loses a lot of its majesty in this film mostly because of these two critical factors.<br/><br/>It is still a must-see film for any Alien fan. It is full of strong cinematic sequences that resonate in your head long after the film is over. <br/><br/>But go in expecting something different.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"my_name_is_aoshi_of_the_oniwaban","8","126","211","5 March 2005"," Alien Resurrection is Slightly Underrated
","Audiences are automatically drawn to dislike sequels, which is understandable. I had the fortune to see all four movies in one sitting and this movie was just another part of the series, as it should be. I can see some of the arguments against it. It has some weak parts and is definitely different than the others but this one has its own powerful message and actually ends on a happier note.<br/><br/>While I agree its the weakest of the series I don't believe it ""sucks"". It's not scary like the original and isn't as action-packed as the second. It's most closely related the the third one but it's its own story. I think it adds a whole new depth to the character of Ripley.<br/><br/>If you like the first three Alien movies there's no reason why you should not enjoy Alien Resurrection."

","This is an abomination. Classic stories work best in 3 acts, and the Alien Trilogy worked fine. Why was this necessary? If a 4th was to be done, it could have been good, had it explored the origins of the aliens, the boneship, and the ""space jockey"" species. The plot appears to have been drawn from a Dark Horse comic story, about breeding Aliens for profit. 20th Century Fox could have developed a great screenplay. Instead, Joss Whedon is brought in to create one of the lamest scripts in movie history. Definitely on par with ROBOT MONSTER. The dialogue is appalling. Cringe inducing one-liners and throwaway wisecracks abound. Worse, they are delivered by the actors in pantomime style. ""Must be a chick thing"", ""Who do I have to f*** to get off this ship?"" and so on. Terrible visual ""larks"" are thrown in for good measure. There doesn't seem to be anyone who isn't overacting. Except maybe Ryder, who turns in a plank-like performance. However, Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon, take the arm-flapping and mugging to extraordinary levels. Perlman, as Joner, the ""tough guy"" Space Pirate, shouts, grimaces, and demonstrates that he is the badass of the story. The X-treme Badass. Pinon as the ""physically challenged"" character, annoys from start to finish. He whines, pouts, and plays the underdog part with the subtlety of a pipe-bomb. A pity, some fine actors were involved- Brad Dourif, Michael Wincott, Leland Orser. All wasted here. There are goofs throughout- blasting an alien head, through it's mouth, then extracting a pristine tongue/jaw. Christie has his hands by his side. Then not. Then back again, etc. This movie can be viewed, just to spot the many goofs. There are too many ""hijinks"", and extroverted attempts at ""comedy"". Jeunet and Weaver had too much ""creative control"" and appear to have made the film by constructing it around set piece shots and scenes: ""Let's have Ripley dreaming that she is covered in cheesecloth"". ""Wouldnt it look brilliant to have a pit of squirming tentacles?"". ""What about an Alien pushing the punishment button with it's inner jaw? Not it's hands, it's dripping jaw!"". ""A robot in a Chapel! How very subversive, and avant garde!"". The end result is forced, and seems to serve only these ostentatious ""artistic"" scenes. Logic is nowhere to be found in this tale. Christie cuts himself loose and thereby sacrifices himself, for his little buddy, for no apparent reason. He isn't incapacitated, the acid on his face looks little worse than a bad case of acne. Is he so vain, he would prefer death, to a future without a modeling career? Joner displays his edgy, in-your-face disposition, by blasting a spider, whose web he is inconvenienced by. Spiders on space ships? What do they catch to eat? Never mind, it is symbolic of their struggle against the aliens. Spider, bugs, aliens... get it? Tres anarchistic! The production itself blows chunks. The movie starts off well enough, but soon descends into a gaudy, psychedelic style. There appear to be lights that serve no function other than to provide a multi-coloured wash. The sets look far too big and are more ""Poseidon Adventure"" than ""Alien"". The bombastic score reminds the viewer this is a suspenseful movie, with a melodramatic- Dun, dun, dun ...DUNNNN! In over the top leathers, Weaver seems to meander through the part, falling back on a role she used from her last production. The characterization of Ripley-clone, and ""The Queen"" from Snow White, are awfully similar. There is actually a scene, where Weaver repeats the same ""signature"" hand gestures, with Ryder, that she used in ""SNOW WHITE: A Tale of Terror"", which was shot just prior to this. Perhaps she was channeling the Evil Queen through Ripley? Or telling us that Call is really a banished Princess? There is at least one dwarf. ""What were you expecting? Santa Claus?"". No, but I wasn't expecting this piece of ****, either. It makes Armageddon look cerebral. Buffy the Alien Slayer. Fox really should have hired a director who spoke English. Jeneut is not entirely to blame. Weaver and Whedon did little to help. Was going to give it 2x stars. But just thinking about this mess, makes me angry. It takes a dump on the Alien Trilogy. <br/><br/>Ripley: ""We did it. We saved the Earth"". Call: ""What do we do, now?""... <br/><br/>Make another multi-million dollar, crappy rip off, from a now violated, cinematic legend, of course!"
"CDallas","10","75","125","15 March 1999"," Although most would view it as an attempt to revive what is called an already dead series, it is actually a great movie with true intrigue and innovation.
","First off, let me say that I LOVE the Alien series, so please acknowledge that.  Here's what I think:  The first two Alien films were outstanding. The first is the scariest movie of all time, and the second is the best action film of all time.  I think the third was okay, because it did achieve the dark and creepy feel it was going for, but was also a bit of a disappointment.  What I think everyone didn't acknowledge about the film was the fact that it did a damn good job of resurrecting the aliens.  Think about it.  How else can you make a story that takes place after the third one and still star Sigourney Weaver?  Don't say to say the third one was a dream, because then that would be corny and immature.  I thought that the story was very good.  The characters, although slightly wooden, were very well drawn.  Several people say that the old Ripley was gone, but by the end of the film, she was acting just like the good ol' gal we all know and love. And something that only one critic acknowledged was this:  the newborn alien.  WOW!  That thing was ugly and scary as hell!  That's the type of alien you need for the ending.  You've been seeing the same old alien for 3.75 films now, and you've pretty much gotten scared by the creatures as much as you could, why not bring some fresh meat on the scene?  And plus, you have to include the alien tradition of battling a new alien at the end of each film.  In the first one, Ripley battled a normal alien.  In the second one, Ripley battled a queen.  And in the third one, Ripley battled a dog alien.  To continue the tradition, Ripley battled a human alien.  And if I may say, that thing is the scariest of them all.  What I don't understand is that everyone says that this series ran out of steam by the beginning of the third one.  I disagree.  The Alien films still have a flare going, but a fifth one would be all that you could have before the flame burns out.  I expect the fifth to be REALLY good, but also tie up the entire story and give an accurate epilogue to the series.  And think about this:  You're not going to resurrect a series like this just so that you can end the series again just before the credits of the said film.  Alien Resurrection was a good movie, and I think that it was as innovative as a third Alien sequel could be."
"siit","6","61","100","21 January 2006"," Oh dear... what a mess !!!
","Budget constraints were a major issue at the beginning, throughout and in post-production- and it shows. As an avid admirer of the Alien saga, I am thoroughly disappointed with Alien4. And there are two major reasons; one they did a very poor effort in explaining Ripley's presence and Sigourney Weaver struggled to promote credibility to the resurrection. And two, and most importantly, the image, the sound and presence of the 'alien' was so removed from the past three movies it was atrocious.<br/><br/>The general idea of how hosts for the queen were obtained were interesting as was the 'biological weapon' angle. Apart from that I could almost weep when comparing this trash to the first three. 6/10 in hindsight is extremely generous and is more to do with the love of the franchise than any true indication of this movie's worth.<br/><br/>The last half of this movie is so bad I am embarrassed for the producers. The new alien is terrible and diminishes the power and chill of the alien. The supposed claustrophobic feel they were looking for was not realised, the aliens seemed pathetic in their tenacity to destroy human life and was opposite to what was established.<br/><br/>The producers tried to be too clever and ended up not being clever enough."

","Alien Resurrection is the most radical departure in the series that has now spanned centuries in its own universe and nearly twenty years of our own earth time.  Gone is the meticulously constructed suspense of Ridley Scott's 1979 original.  Gone is the heart-stopping pulse of uncannily staged action from James Cameron's 1986 sequel.  Gone is the Ripley who cried and fought and bled and sacrificed her own life to save the world from the horror she very nearly unleashed in David Fincher's atmospheric and underrated Alien 3. Instead, we get the all-new Ripley: cynical, sardonic, and ready with a wisecrack or a fist for anyone who crosses her path.  Director Jeunet unfortunately seems to bask in self-parody, and this is where the film goes wrong.  He serves up plenty of nasty evisceration and gruesome chest-bursting, but by now we have seen so much of the creatures that they are no longer terrifying.  Still, I have a lasting affection and fascination with this series -- and Jeunet Alien is better than no Alien."
"harryplinkett14","1","59","103","22 September 2014"," Moronic film
","Where does one even begin? I guess the first thing I want to say is that this film has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. There is not a single line of dialogue, a single shot, a single performance or detail that is actually good.<br/><br/>So let's get to the bad things, then.<br/><br/>The director. That deranged, surrealist Frenchman should never have had anything to do with the project. <br/><br/>The script. It is as though it was intended as a kind of parody of the Alien films, which was a horrible idea. But in the hands of the aforementioned director this would-be parody becomes a surreal mess that is simply unwatchable.<br/><br/>The cast/characters. Winona Ryder's character is irritating and irrelevant for the plot. Come to think of it, all of these characters are irrelevant. They just run around while we wait to see how many will make it until the end of the film. Sigourney Weaver is now a psychotic bitch, which means she talks nonsense and none of her actions seem to have a discernible motivation. Dan Hedaya plays a general whose character is straight out of a cartoon. Seeing him do these comedic bits is probably the first shocking thing. A film that starts like a straight horror in space takes a strange turn as soon as he enters the stage, and the confusion thus created never ceases. Of course, the confusion and incredulity are exacerbated by further...<br/><br/>...Nonsensical moments. A guy fires a gun at an angled surface on the ceiling, thus shooting an adversary. This is straight out of Looney Toons. To make it more baffling, that same character cannot hit an alien from three feet away, even after unloading an entire clip at it. Then he falls into a pool of water and everyone assumes he is dead. Why is he dead? Can he not swim back to the surface? Who knows. And who cares? The director certainly doesn't care, so why should we? But let's look at the very basics: They are running this super secret, expensive project... which relies on services provided by space pirates. They breed aliens that bleed acid... in containers that are not resilient to acid. They are a military facility, crawling with troops, yet they never even attempt to contain the escaped aliens. For some reason, they just run for their lives without even taking the time to assess the situation. Was that their emergency plan from the start? Run for your life? And just to make things even more interesting, the ship is programmed to return to Earth... in case deadly aliens break loose, making the entire garrison flee in disarray. Great idea. By the way, although the ship is supposed to be far away, far from sight of the various government agencies, it makes the trip to Earth in a matter of hours. I guess it makes sense the crazy Frenchman took the job as the director - no one else would touch it, while he clearly couldn't care less about plausibility and saw the whole thing as a way of shoving in some of his favourite implausible plot elements. I'd like to point out another inconsistency here: the plot only seems to remember aliens bleed acid when it needs the acid to be used to make the aliens escape or to help Ripley cut something open with her own, acidic blood (the result of cloning). In other situations, aliens that have been shot dead do not bleed acid. The script simply doesn't care. <br/><br/>The alien hybrid. Apparently alien has been fused with human DNA and is now being born like a human baby, and looks like Pumpkinhead. You don't know whether to laugh or just feel uncomfortable watching that thing.<br/><br/>The lesbian overtones. Ripley is not only psychotic, apparently she is now a lesbian as well. I guess they thought that they could score some points for that. But Ripley looks godawful and frankly watching her make sexual advances towards that little twerp Wiynona Ryder is just creepy.<br/><br/>Boring. Yes, it's boring. We couldn't care less about the characters - in fact, they are quite unlikable so we might find ourselves cheering for the aliens to get them. And when they do get them, it doesn't involve suspenseful scenes. The only action scene people will remember from this film is the one where they are being chased by aliens under water. It's interesting to see aliens swim, but then again, they do not look convincing at all. They are being chased by CGI. <br/><br/>Ending. I have no idea how it ends. I have seen this film several times and by the time Pumpkinhead makes its appearance I am sick of it. By the time we get to about ten minutes before the end I can't take it any more. I know how it ends, though, but only because I have seen some reviews of the film on Youtube. I literally cannot endure to watch this nonsense until the end.<br/><br/>So there you have it. You still want to watch this thing? It just occurred to me that I somehow still haven't been able to explain just how awful the viewing experience of Alien Resurrection is. I guess that final touch of awfulness comes from the French auteur himself. Think of Alien Resurrection as a cinematic turd with an attitude."
"chaos-rampant","Null","12","17","15 November 2012"," Threepenny Opera
","I admit I like this quite a bit, having seen it four times now. I think to get into this, it helps to have some appreciation for dissonance, for music not quite melodious. Cogs in a machine that you are not quite sure what they do. This one works, just not every part in congruity with the others - that would be Cameron's way of doing things, this is closer to the original despite the radical shift in tone.<br/><br/>This was first and foremost intended as a parody in the operatic manner, an exaggerated cartoon, you can see that in the opening scene (special edition) with the bug being spat out on a windshield. It is very clearly a staged product, any allusions to organic development long gone. Ripley is manufactured for the purposes of the mission, the opening shot in essence is of her character being unveiled as the protagonist of this operatic show. The aliens are constructed from her. The situation where they will breed is similarly staged, victims carted in.<br/><br/>Someone like say Verhoeven could pull this off clean through, Starship Troopers-style, gleeful, sardonic, tongue-in-cheek from beginning to end. The dissonance here is between writer, filmmaker, and lead actor, each one pulling in a different direction.<br/><br/>Whedon wrote a black comedy of sorts. He satirizes action heroics, masculinity, leadership (Perez and Vriess are the first to go), the military is not only inept (compared to Cameron's marines), but basically involved in shady , unethical business. He wrote what he thought would be a few memorable one-liners, to be delivered with a wink to the audience. The first part until roughly the alien breakout is closer to his idea of the film.<br/><br/>Enter Jeunet. He wants to do the best blockbuster money can buy, a new gamble this, the most exciting and intense firecracker toy, one of those 'big' Hollywood films that we all enthused about as teenagers and you'd have to be a joyless macaroon to say no to. He has studied a lot of Spielberg and Cameron and, daresay, meets them in equal terms. He bends Whedon's vision to his, and because he hardly spoke any English at the time, he directs actors in a perfunctory manner - some of them areonboard with Whedon's idea, others not.<br/><br/>And you have, quite apart from the other two, Sigourney Weaver who always felt an emotional attachment to Ripley, and who is by this point as much a shaping force as everyone else. Amidst competing visions, she insists on a heavy emotional center, which just so happens (as it did in Aliens) to emphasize a damaged personality, nightmares, schizoid tensions between motherhood and her more conventional action/hero role.<br/><br/>So, when this spins, it spins in three directions at once. I think it is a great joy to be able as a viewer to accommodate all three visions, you will have a helluva time I guarantee.<br/><br/>You will never more clearly see this rip-roaring dissonance in the Newborn being sucked out through a tiny aperture, sent out guts flying into space.<br/><br/>The scene is at once meant to be hilarious, gruesome, and, as you shift to Ripley's point-of-view, emotionally devastating. The scene is so appalling because it IS those three things at once, and they are simply not emotions that as humans we can easily juggle.<br/><br/>Jeunet was brilliantly inspired in moving the aliens underwater, this scene was a long time coming."
"dee.reid","10","57","101","4 December 2002"," The resurrection of a popular series
","Let's recap.<br/><br/>The first alien film, which was directed by Ridley Scott is the film that started it all.  Scott's direction was sharp and ""Alien"" had the most tension-filled setting of the series and it brought to life a truly horrifying creature.  But that was twenty-three years ago.  ""Alien"" since it was released in 1979, has become seriously dated and seems to have lost some of its potency.<br/><br/>""Aliens"", which was directed by James Cameron, is the most well-known film in the series and the most successful.  This time instead of Ripley going up against one alien, she must now go up against an entire nest of the deadly creatures, but with the help of a few good marines added to the bunch.  The ultimate question was of course, would excellent firepower be enough to combat the aliens?  Cameron focused a lot on action and tension, which transformed ""Aliens"" into a war movie of sorts.  I liked ""Aliens"" the most and hasn't lost any of its ability to still shock its audience.<br/><br/>""Alien 3"", directed by David Fincher, is the most underrated of the series. Fincher changed the series by doing something new with it by adding his trademark dark settings to the film.  Instead of continuing the trend that was pioneered by James Cameron, he went back to step one, while still taking the series in a new direction.  He created one of the most dark and depressing horror films ever brought to life.  Though for some odd reason, audiences missed that entirely.  Fincher had originally intended the film to be much longer and with more character development, but executives at Fox had cheated him out of his own vision by removing most of said footage.<br/><br/>Now we have ""Alien: Resurrection"", released in 1997 and directed by acclaimed French film maker Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Set two-hundred years after the events of ""Alien 3"", Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned from a sample of her DNA and must continue her ongoing fight with the deadly alien this time with the help of a group of futuristic space pirates and a mysterious woman named Call (Winona Ryder).  <br/><br/>It goes without saying that Jeunet is a visual genius.  He has a real sense of bringing life into his scenes and giving the movie a fantastic look.  The gore here is pretty extreme and some scenes will certainly make your skin crawl, turning the movie into a freak show of sorts.  But that could ultimately be what Jeunet was trying to do, I'm not quite sure.  That is no reason to hate this film however.  An excellent addition to the series that is not to be missed."
"Elswet","8","47","84","22 January 2005"," Superior to Alien 3
","While this is commonly thought of as the weaker installment of this line, personally, I believe it to be superior to Alien 3 in many important ways.<br/><br/>200 years after Ripley's death, she is cloned and brought back to life. The cloning process, however, also involved the DNA of the Alien Queen, giving her superhuman powers and abilities. After several failed attempts, they finally make good with a humanoid Ripley/Queen with superior intelligence and talents.<br/><br/>According to the Making of documentary, this installment was very unlike the disorganized mess which was Alien 3 in that this attempt was together and ready to go a year before they actually started shooting. The story was polished and perfected, and was a unique and creative story in comparison. It was a big script in Hollywood. The buzz about it was that it had elements which made it a worthwhile successor to the first two, completely ignoring the third installment all together.<br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection takes the Alien franchise to places fans would never have dreamed, without compromising the key elements of the Alien world, and does it successfully.<br/><br/>The studios did not want a typical Hollywood popcorn movie to be part of this franchise, and therefore hired Jean-Pierre Jeunet (City of Lost Children, if you can dig it) to bring in a unique interpretive eye to the direction of this project. His visual style is quite distinct and permeates this work in a pro-active way. It was, perhaps, the most shrewd move Fox could have made in that his unique perspective was the single-most saving factor of this attempt.<br/><br/>The action sequences are quite rousing, the story here is once again solid and convincing, and the performances are still the top row quality you expected from this line. <br/><br/>The fight sequences are well choreographed and executed; beautifully done, as is the rest of this movie. While I cannot rate it as high as I did the first two, it is obviously superior to Alien 3 in all ways that matter.<br/><br/>It rates a 7.9/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"jimbofletch","1","80","152","14 July 2001"," Oh Ridley, where art thou? (or even David Fincher?)
","Why? I'll ask that question again. WHY? Why was this film ever made? The original Alien is a masterpiece. No doubt. Aliens is the perfect sequel. Alien 3 is flawed, but visually inventive and it makes some interesting developments from the first two films in terms of drama and character. Alien Resurrection is a cash-in. Of course, most sequels are, but this one doesn't even attempt to hide the fact that it is one. It feels, lazy, hackneyed, tired and lethargic. There is no tension, not even in the underwater sequence that everyone raved about (simply because it was too difficult for the fans to believe that an Alien film could be utterly devoid of merit, suspense or interest). The Ripley character looks bored, and is now so outrageously arrogant as to become a cheap parody of her strong female status. Now she is so overwhelmingly macho it just looks stupid. The other characters are pitifully written. The first two Alien films had characters you cared about, and even the third film managed to make some of the victims (tough job considering they were all murderers) sympathetic. But here, all they do is make bad jokes and totally dispel any possible tension by spouting ridiculous dialogue. And for a film in which all the characters do is run away, there is no atmosphere of tension or sense of danger. This is<br/><br/>due to a lame script and uninvolved direction. The special effects are mostly poor, especially in the end, and is a further testament to the overall badness of CGI.<br/><br/>There is only one mildly diverting sequence, when Ripley sees all of her clones in the laboratory and burns them down in a moment of grief. Some attempts of character development, but in retrospect, the sequence just feels throwaway, just a bit of filler in between the next inevitable death. It is also doesn't help that the emotion of the scene is ruined by the line ""Women..."" by the stereotypically mysognist bonehead played by that moron out of Beauty and the Beast.<br/><br/>Finally. Winona Ryder. She is terrible in this! Of course (SPOILER), she's a robot, but that's just something defenders of her unexplainable star status say to avoid admitting the fact that she is bad in this. Very bad.<br/><br/>If Alien 3 was a pale imitation of Alien (albeit not a bad one), then this is a TV movie copy of Aliens. It looks rubbish, has no reason to exist, and completely destroys the credibility of one of the most interesting SF film series ever. For what once was a classic trilogy, has now become a franchise.<br/><br/>As stupid as Alien Versus Predator seems, it can't be as bad as this."
"MaximumMadness","6","3","3","26 November 2017"," ""Alien: Resurrection""- A fun big-budget 'B-Movie.' Trite and a bit mindless, but ferociously entertaining!
","One of the longest running modern day horror franchises, ""Alien"" is a fascinating beast in the world of entertainment and media. With its humble origins as a quiet, slow-burn sci-fi thriller, the series evolved through sequels and spin-offs into something else entirely. Whether it be through James Cameron's exquisite action-extravaganza ""Aliens"", or the Paul W.S. Anderson schlock-tastic crossover ""AVP: Alien VS Predator"", or even series co-creator Ridley Scott's own pseudo- philosophical quasi-prequel ""Prometheus""... ""Alien"" has changed and evolved quite a bit over the past forty years.<br/><br/>But one release in particular has attracted an almost unanimous scorn and unending ridicule from all over the fanbase. A film that's so reviled, it's almost become a prerequisite that you're just expected to hate it. That being 1997's ""Alien: Resurrection""- a strange little footnote in the series that tries its hardest but never quite comes together into much of anything. An attempt to turn the series around after the mixed reception garnered by ""Alien 3"", this fourth film aims for the stars, but stumbles and falls flat on its face. Although, if I am to be completely honest... I actually don't mind it too much. It's silly, but quite amusing and thrilling, with stylish visual direction and plenty of laughs and thrills to go around. Yes, ""Resurrection"" might be a mindless and trite exercise in style over substance... but it's also bold and extraordinarily entertaining. It's a ton of fun, even if it is objectively a ""bad movie.""<br/><br/>Two-hundred years after the events of the previous film, scientists working for the military successfully clone Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the queen embryo she had been impregnated with, intent on allowing the alien life-form to reproduce so that they might study its race. This ""new"" Ripley has retained some faint memories of her former life thanks to genetic memory, but as a result of the cloning process, has also taken on some characteristics of the dreaded ""xenomorph"" species. When the offspring of the alien queen manage to escape, however, Ripley is forced to team up with a group of mercenary space-pirates (including Ron Perlman, Winona Ryder) in order to escape. Along the way, she will uncover startling and deadly revelations about the project that brought her back to life, and come face to face with a devilish new threat...<br/><br/>Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet from a script by the world-renowned geek-god Joss Whedon, ""Resurrection"" does so much right that it's frankly a shame it's so routinely dismissed without much thought. It's essentially an incredibly slick and exceedingly well-made crappy B-movie. The plot is ridiculous. The characters silly and archetypal. And it's filled to burst with nonstop gore and effects. But it's made with a massive budget, an A-list cast and comes from a wildly talented director with a clear vision. Even on a pure aesthetic level, it's one of the most striking films of the franchise, with Jeunet's wonderful eye for flow and composition delivering many incredible set-pieces and designs that'll stick with you. It's just a gorgeous film all around.<br/><br/>The cast is an absolute blast, with Weaver once again knocking it out of the park. Especially as this ""new"" Ripley also goes through some fascinating changes that both allow Weaver to stretch her acting chops... and have some fun chewing the scenery from time to time. Perlman and Ryder are good fun as members of a space-pirate team, with Perlman in particular being a good fit for the franchise. He's a criminally underrated performer and it's a joy seeing him on- screen. We also get small but fun turns from the likes of Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Michael Wincott, and all serve the film quite well. The effects and action are top-notch for the time, with many sequences still holding up quite well to this day. An underwater chase-scene and a trippy climactic battle against a potential new threat in particular being eye-popping and absolutely jaw-dropping. And the wonderful cinematography and almost amniotic musical score add much to every single scene.<br/><br/>But yeah... despite that praise, the film does have a lot of problems. Like I said above- it's basically a big-budget B-movie filled with the tropes and archetypes you'd expect, and it doesn't fit in with the rest of the series quite well. Unless you're willing to forgive a lot and go with the flow, you're not gonna have a good time with ""Resurrection."" There has been a lot of talk of how Whedon disowned the film and felt his script wasn't translated properly to screen, and I could definitely see shades of that. For all the amazing things he does, Jeunet seems less interested with story and more interested in increasingly psychotic visuals. And if you're looking for anything more than surface-level entertainment, you'll be sadly let-down.<br/><br/>But me? I take movies for what they are and what they aspire to be. It's clear everyone involved on-screen is having a lot of fun. It's clear that Jeunet is trying to build a wild thrill-ride of a monster-movie. And it's clear that this is a film more concerned with crazed displays of gore and effects than a cohesive story. And you know what? I had a lot of fun with it. It's technically a ""bad"" movie, but to me... it's a FUN bad movie. And I'm giving it slightly above average 6 out of 10. Give it another shot with an open mind. It just might surprise you how enjoyable ""Alien: Resurrection"" really is."

In my opinion there is no reason to see this one. Actually, if you've seen the others, it's even more reason to skip this one as it takes some of the ""glow"" from the others by bringing down the franchise.<br/><br/>It's not so strange though...

Me being a big fan of Firefly/Serenity and his Astonishing X-Men comic book series loved this film dearly. Yes it may require some thinking to understand, due to the cloning and cross-breeding stuff.

","I am one of those older (mature) reviewers who can claim to have seen this series in real time, in theatres.<br/><br/>First I will share my recollection of what that was like at the time.<br/><br/>Alien 1 was magnificent. If you were to make a list of the greatest films of all time (and all reviewers do this, if only subconsciously) Alien 1 would be make the list. Alien 2 was doubly astonishing because it was almost as good as Alien 1 and, as any film buff knows, the sequel is rarely if ever that good.<br/><br/>Expectations were high going into Alien 3, the prison planet movie, but the entry was disappointing and for the first time fans started to wonder if the franchise was going to self-destruct.<br/><br/>For this reason, Alien 4, Resurrection, was disappointing in every possible way. It was a weak concept, poorly timed and poorly executed. The template for the story was more ""haunted house"" than sci-fi. Not only was the story flawed but at the end of the day it ran out of steam after the first 30 minutes and became tedious for the audience, a sin no film should ever commit. All the characters were so unlikable -- including to a large extent Weaver's saucy clone -- that even if the audience WANTED to root for a character, there was no one worthy of the effort.<br/><br/>I got hold of the director's cut and re-reviewed this film because another member posted a review saying this film was unappreciated.<br/><br/>OK, so let's appreciate it for what it is -- a flawed entry that almost destroyed the franchise. The IMDb rating is solid -- in other words, this is really a very weak film.<br/><br/>(To date Alien 1 and 2 remain the best of the series. AVP is a remarkably perky little entry that somehow manages to polarize reviewers who either love it or hate. I have re-watched AVP more than any other entry. It is not elegant but it is very very entertaining.)"

Unfortunately they made a mess of it <br/><br/>!!!!! SPOILER TO ALIEN 3 !!!!!<br/><br/>First of all did they have to bring Ripley back ? She was seen plunging to her death in ALIEN 3 and by a totally unconvincing plot device involving cloning she's back . There's another problem with this and that's her character has been altered , she's no longer capable of showing much in the way of sympathy as in the previous two sequels and therefore the audience find it hard to sympathies with her <br/><br/>William Gibson wrote a script for ALIEN 3 set on a space station dealing with modified aliens and space commies but was eventually turned down because there was little substance to the story which was basically just a series of action set pieces . RESURRECTION involves a space station where space villains battle modified aliens . The first half is set up to introduce the wafer thin characters while the second half is a non stop auctioneer featuring set pieces of humans against aliens . I was just wondering why Gibson's ALIEN 3 script wasn't good enough to be produced this rather similar script was ? I guess it's all down to box office considerations . Unfortunately by trying to make money at the box office the studio have ruined the franchise with this movie <br/><br/>I haven't seen ALIEN VS PREDATORS yet and to be honest have little inclination to , but ALIEN RESURRECTION is by far the worst of the first four ALIEN movies I've seen"

","Following the disappointment of alien3's performance and the death of Ripley, it was thought that the alien franchise was finished, going out on a high - the completion of the films and Ripley, with Ripley dying in the struggle to kill the alien that had become her whole life.<br/><br/>Once the potential earnings had been calculated, it probably didn't take very long to decide to piece together a sequel.  This was always going to be messy - can you do an Alien movie without Weaver? How can you bring your main character back to life? Alien v's Predator anyone?!  Once they pieced together a script and got Weaver on board it was all set to go.<br/><br/>Let me lay my cards on the table - I don't like this film.  Yes, the direction is brilliant visually with some great set pieces.  The story is good  for some of the film, turning the conspiracy story up to 10 with aliens being bred in captivity, but after the aliens get out the story is mostly a chase and kill deal and then goes onto some nonsense about a new breed of alien that looks like milky bars!<br/><br/>Apart from the visuals and the conspiracy angle this is pretty ordinary stuff, it doesn't deserve to be part of such a classic series.  As a stand alone film it is OK but an Alien movie can't be just OK.  The performances are so-so, Weaver enjoys the fact that her character is allowed to be more powerful than usual but this doesn't actually make it a better performance, the fact that Jeunet fills the film with the French actors from his other films makes it slightly more interesting but no less average.<br/><br/>Just because Jeunet put the guns back into the Alien series doesn't make it good.  There isn't anywhere near the tension of the other movies and there's certainly no horror.  A good sci-fi movie but it could be any movies, there's nothing that really means it could only be an Alien movie here."

","Alien Resurrection is more than just a bad installment to the Alien franchise. It is a horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE film from top to bottom. The script, the effects, the cast, and especially the acting are all unbelievably bad.<br/><br/>The script: The whole concept is contrived, disjointed, and completely 'deux ex machina'. Bringing Ripley back from the dead via cloning, even 350 years in the future, is ridiculous. She wouldn't retain any memories of her past life, and the alien parasite inside her at the time of her death could not have 'inserted' itself into her DNA allowing it to be cloned with her. Bringing her back any of the other ways, making it her grand daughter, making her an android, even making all of Alien3 having been a hypersleep hallucination, any of those would have been better.<br/><br/>The effects: Not only were they not used to the advantage of the story in any way, in some ways, they were downright bad. Everyone always goes on about how 'cool' the swimming aliens were. Number one, it was little more than a neat little gimmick. And two, it was poorly executed. The CGI aliens looked, well, like CGI aliens. In other words, they looked fake. They weren't quite photo-realistic in their appearance & movements. And they were on screen for all of about 3 seconds. Also the final scene reentering Earth's atmosphere was awful. It looked like they ran out of money and hoped no one would notice. And most of all the, ahem, newborn. The achieved something here alright. They found a way to make H.R.Giger's alien, the scariest movie monster ever, look like something out of a Lucy skit. When that thing appeared I sunk in my seat in embarrassment.<br/><br/>The cast: I really like Winona Ryder, but she never was & never will be an action heroine. It should have been obvious from the start that she was a completely wrong choice. And Sigourney, well, she got her 10 million dollar check and sleepwalked thru the role, if not deliberately sabotaging the film because she's sick of her association with them. As far as the rest of the cast, they were all completely forgettable. So I've completely forgotten them. Other than Dan Hedaya and Ron Perlman, who serve as nothing more than comedy relief.<br/><br/>The performances: I can sum them up thusly- The director didn't speak or understand English. And it shows. Didn't it occur to anyone that that might be a bad idea?! In all seriousness, I've watched lots of MST3K and Roger Coreman has made better movies than this.<br/><br/>Alien Vs. Predator, a seemingly more derided film, just came out on DVD and while not up to the standard of either Alien or Aliens it was about a million times better than this one."

","This is a visually impressive and exciting Sci/Fi following plenty of thrills , action , chills and many other things . The story takes place in 2379, 200 years after ""Aliens"" and ""Alien 3"" (2179) and also takes place 257 years after ""Alien"" (2122). As 200 years after her death, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is revived as a powerful human/Alien hybrid clone who must continue her war against the Aliens . Meanwhile , military and scientists (Dan Hedaya , Brad Dourif , J.E. Freeman) are carrying out strange experiments . As Aliens escape and then the Earthlings (Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Kim Flowers , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott) have a hard time figuring out the whereabout of the heinous beings that are running amok . <br/><br/>This horrifying as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , chills , profanity , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s , 80s and 90s. The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . However , this time H.R. Giger was openly displeased that he wasn't given a credit for his alien designs and fired off a letter of protest to 20th Century Fox . Interesting as well as twisted screenplay by Joss Whedon , though he has commented on his dissatisfaction with the movie , fans had speculated that the finished article deviated from his original script in some fatal manner, however he put such rumors to rest ; his dialogue, action and plot were essentially intact . However he had written with a playful, tongue-in-cheek tone, which didn't work when the director decided to ""play it straight"". Sigourney Weaver breathes fire into Ripley and remaining actors are all magnificent as the crew of a futurist starship . This is the only Alien movie not to be shot in England , one of the reasons for this was that co-producer Sigourney Weaver didn't want to travel . Sigourney Weaver was paid $11 million to come back as Ripley, which was the entire budget of Alien ,(1979) . The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien and with exciting underwater scenes that took three weeks to film . The underwater segment was shot on a specially constructed sound stage on the Fox lot, which was converted into a permanent water-tank . The production had trouble finding enough studio space as major productions like Titanic (1997), Starship Troopers (1997) and Jurassic Park (1997) were all taking up most of the available studio space in Hollywood . This ¨Alien: Resurrection¨ by Jean Pierre Jeunet has an extraordinary cast such as Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott . The picture packs an original music by John Frizzell , plenty of thrilling and moving sounds . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Darius Khondji . The $50-60 million budget was significantly lower than the director Jeunet and writers originally imagined , being filmed at Fox studios in Los Angeles, California . Therefore, sets were toned down in scale and a more claustrophobic shooting approach with a lot of close-ups to characters' faces was taken . <br/><br/>The gaps between the four Alien films steadily decreased. There was seven years between the release of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), six between Aliens and Alien 3 (1992), and five between Alien³ and Alien resurrection (1997). The original and the best was ¨Alien¨ by Ridley Scott , it was starred by Weaver , John Hurt, Lance Henriksen , Ian Holm , Tom Skerrit , Harry Dean Stanton , Ian Holm , John Hurt ; it is followed by ¨Aliens ¨, also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Bill Paxton , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; Alien 3 ¨ in which the alien regenerates and causes wreak havoc on isolated planet prison , being directed by David Fincher with Charles S Dutton , Paul McGann , Charles Dance . All of them starred by the great Sigourney Weaver who performed one of the best female leads created in years . Furthermore, ¨Alien vs. Predator¨ (2004) by Paul Anderson with Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Lance Henriksen , Colin Salmon , Tommy Flannagan and ¨Aliens vs. Predator 2¨ (2007) by Strause Brothers with Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis and Robert Joy ."

","I think J.P. Jeunet is the best director in history of filmmaking. I realized that when the grenade was thrown in this movie (if you thought it was good you know what I´m talking about), I´m really amazed that he was able to add his style to a movie so different from his earlier work. I can admit that the plot in this movie was not as strong as in the other three and Winona Ryder didn´t really act very well, which can also be said about Sigourney Weaver, I´m sad to say considering the brilliant acting in the other three, but the overall acting was really good, with the performance of Dominique Pinon and Ron Perlman. Dispite of all the bad elements in this movie the good ones made it up and this is without a doubt the best Alien movie."

","*SPOILERS* The first one was ""good"" (better than the second one, in my opinion), the second one was ""great"", the third one was ""huh?"" and with Alien Resurrection the franchise has taken a sharp left off of AIDS Allegory Boulevard onto Freddy Kreuger Way.  Even the third movie had enough style and suspense to at least leave you able to take it somewhat seriously as a film.  Instead, ""Alien Resurrection"" looks for new ways to disgust you, and it's pretty good at it.  A baby alien bursting through a man's head, heads squished and bitten off, and Ripley watching helplessly while her half-alien child is sucked into space backwards through a tiny hole, squealing with pain, fear, and agony while she mouths ""I'm sorry"" comes to mind.  It's also good at being funny, which I'm not sure was intentional.  The human/alien hybrid is extremely stupid looking and disappointing for what could have been an interesting idea (just like how I feel about this film as a whole).  And the whole thing is drenched in urine-yellow cinematography.  Enjoy."

","Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the makers here basically stick safe to the formula of the series. This time it's a space station with space pirates and a cloned Ripley (Siggy Weaver of course) - yes! A cloned Ripley, only this time she's devoid of human compassion - kind of... The gore quota is significantly upped, which makes for some serious sci-fi terror, and some of the imagery crafted is outstanding (a clone lab sequence is shatteringly unforgettable). A tip top cast featuring Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Winona Ryder, all give good shows, whilst the photography (Darius Khondji/Se7en) and art design (Steve Cooper, Andrew Neskoromny and John M.

","The fourth installment in the Alien Franchise was Alien Resurrection which had Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), cloned after she died 200 years ago in Alien 3. The cloned Ripley had in her, the DNA of the Alien so what they company had ""CLONED"" was a hybrid, a human and the alien DNA mixed.<br/><br/>The new Ripley had in her chest the Queen Embryo, which was removed as soon as the cloning process was a success, and she was studied and she bred a new kind of Alien.<br/><br/>Well, the company also had Alien eggs and they captured men in hyper-sleep and used them to breed the Alien. They caged them and tried to train them but soon the Aliens got smart and broke free and again all hell broke loose.<br/><br/>What makes this last installment to the franchise good was the suspense, in every turn there is something you thought you had figured out till it changes the next second making the story also dynamic. Written by Joss Whedon, who had worked on Buffy the Vampire slayer before this, the story and screenplay had enough action to keep you on the edge of your sit.<br/><br/>The actors were on their toes delivering their lines and their interpretation of character with finesse. Another thing that did it for me was the idea to use the Alien's blood as part of the script, not much about this acid blood has occurred in the previous two installments. But here it played a vital role in the story.<br/><br/>It was also directed by another director, a French director Jean-Pierre who I have to give kudos to, as he did a fine job in delivery. The CGI and the effects in this installment was better than all previous 3 put together, and it has to be said even though this is not better than 2 (Aliens (1986)), it redeemed the image of the franchise.<br/><br/>All in all, it is not a bad re watch."
"TheEmulator23","7","4","5","14 January 2006"," Better as time goes
","I am probably biased, OK not probably... I am, but this film was better when you see the directors cut as part of the Alien Quadrilogy, with half-assed special effects and all. Is it a classic, well no it it is not, but compared to all the crap that came out in 2005, well yeah it could be considered a decent film. I am willing to be that Joss, (Whedon that is who wrote the screenplay I believe) has had many more ideas of what else he could have changed and/or added since he wrote this many years ago. All in all if you are a fan of what Ridley Scott's original 1979 ""Alien"" was or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and even David Fichners ""Alien 3"" you will enjoy this film. I know myself and others would go and watch every single ""Alien"" film even if they made 50 of them. Sigourney seemed to kind of phoned this one in as well as Winona, (even though Winona really seemed to try, she was just not suited and or believable in her role.) The main problem to me seemed that there were way too many throw-away characters. Granted in a film like this we know that most of them are not going to make it, but it just seemed like they weren't trying to give any sort of personality at all. I have seen much worse and all in all this is not a bad film, hell the whole mutant ""Ripley"" lab thing as been made fun of and teased to death, so obviously people enjoyed parts of this film at the very least! If the ever do make a 5th film, it needs to be focused more on the ""Aliens"" and have very little to do with Ripley's character, if at all. If you love the original, at least see the sequels, (especially the sequel ""Aliens"") so you know what else is left in this franchise so it can be possibly resurrected. It is looking less and less likely now that it has been almost 10 years since the last film. I just hope that this isn't abandoned because there are so many more stories that we have not explored yet. But when in doubt thank the original director Ridley for welcoming us to a new type of film and has had a bunch of copycats since, but no one can come close to this original."

"BrandtSponseller","10","24","47","8 February 2005"," Another excellent film in a series of solid 10s
","Series note: It is strongly recommended that you watch this series in order, as each entry is a direct continuation of the story, as if chapters of a book. The previous films, in order, are Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), and Alien 3 (1992).<br/><br/>Taking place 200 years after the events of Alien 3, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is now a clone living on a military ship as the subject of scientific experiments. Unfortunately, they also get a hold of specimen of the titular malevolent aliens. Shortly after a ship of ""space pirates"" docks to complete a deal with the military ship's shady General Perez (Dan Heyda), things start to go haywire, and once again, humans are fighting for their lives.<br/><br/>Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's series entry is most similar in tone to Aliens, James Cameron's action-heavy take on the alien mythology. The primary differences are those rooted to each film's place in time--Aliens is a typical mid-80s actioner, this is a typical late 90s actioner--and distinctions due to James Cameron's style versus Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, although in some ways, this is a more unusual film for Jeunet, who has leaned more towards surrealism and ""art films"" throughout his career.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the script for Alien Resurrection, which was written by Joss Whedon (of television's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly fame), can be easily seen as more surreal than the other entries in the series, if not darker (the tone of Alien 3 makes it difficult to call anything darker). After all, Ripley is a clone here, there are lots of bizarre almost X-Files like government conspiracies and experiments going on, and on a subtextual level, the whole film is a very disturbing take on motherhood. So even though both Aliens and this film are primarily action flicks, there is less of a focus on firepower here, and more of a focus on sci-fi weirdness. I love both, so it's nice to have different films in the series with different focuses.<br/><br/>We also get ""Super-Ripley"" in this film, which for me was a hoot. Sigourney Weaver was always one of the best things about the series--she presented a deep, intelligent, resourceful character, and in Alien Resurrection, she gets action hero-like physical prowess to boot. She is also able to add a slightly sinister, slightly inhuman edge, which brings a whole new dimension to the films. The rest of the characters were almost as enjoyably over the top as Cameron's Marines in Aliens. My only complaint on that end was that I would like to have seen both Brad Dourif and Dan Heyda much more.<br/><br/>Jeunet gives us some of the more haunting scenes of the series, one of the best being an extended underwater trek through a flooded deck, as our heroes attempt to escape. Alien Resurrection's climax also features what very well may be the most disturbing creature in the series, and no, I'm not referring to Ron Perlman.<br/><br/>It shouldn't take much to recommend this entry. You should have watched the first three films before you get here, and if you've watched that far (which surely means you've enjoyed the films more than not enjoyed them), you may as well check out the fourth, too. Don't forget to also see Alien vs. Predator (2004) after watching Alien Resurrection. It's of a similar quality to anything in either the Alien or Predator series."

","French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen (1991), The City of Lost Children (1995)) directs this pacy science fiction-action-horror film set purely in space. The film has a solid cast of actors.<br/><br/>Plot: Alien Resurrection takes place 200 years after Alien 3. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned on the outer space military science vessel USM Auriga using ""blood samples from Fury 16, on ice."" The United Systems Military wants to extract the Alien queen embryo that was implanted in her before her death in Alien 3. After successful extraction of the embryo, the scientists decide to keep the Ripley clone alive for further study. They raise the Alien queen and collect her eggs for further use. As a result of the cloning process, during which Ripley's DNA was mixed with the Alien's, she develops enhanced strength and reflexes, acidic blood, and an empathic link with Aliens.<br/><br/>The Betty, a ship full of mercenaries, arrives delivering several kidnapped humans in hypersleep. The military scientists use them as hosts for the Alien facehuggers, raising several adult Aliens for study. The mercenaries encounter Ripley, and their youngest member Call (Winona Ryder) recognizes her name. She attempts to kill Ripley, believing she may be used to create more Aliens, but Call is too late; the Aliens have already matured and quickly escape their confinement, damaging the ship and killing most of its crew. Dr. Wren (J. E. Freeman), one of the ship's scientists, reveals that the Auriga's default command in an emergency situation is to return to Earth. Realizing that this will unleash the Aliens on Earth, Ripley, the mercenaries, Wren, a marine named DiStephano (Raymond Cruz), and a surviving Alien host, Purvis (Leland Orser), attempt to escape on the Betty and destroy the Auriga.<br/><br/>As the group makes their way through the damaged ship, several of them are killed by the Aliens. Call is revealed to be an android after Wren betrays the group. Using her abilities to interface with the damaged ship's systems, they set it on a collision course with Earth, hoping that the Aliens will be destroyed in the crash. Ripley learns that the Alien queen has gained a human ability from her DNA as well: now possessing a womb, it can give birth to live offspring without the need for eggs and human hosts. The resulting offspring, which bears a mixture of human and Alien traits, recognizes Ripley as its mother and kills the Alien queen.<br/><br/>Ripley and the surviving mercenaries arrive at the Betty. As they launch, the human/Alien hybrid attacks Call. Ripley kills it by using her own acidic blood to burn a hole through a viewing pane, causing the creature to be sucked violently through the small hole and into the vacuum of space. The survivors escape in the Betty as the Auriga collides into Earth.<br/><br/>10/10 points.

"jarnov","9","11","19","25 June 2010"," The Alien series comes full circle.
","I won't write a start-to-finish review, as there are already plenty on here. What I *will* write, is about the experience this fan of the franchise had watching this movie for the second time in many years (shortly after the first three).<br/><br/>For me, this is just the perfect little ending to the Alien quadrilogy. Aside from being a perfectly badass sci-fi action movie on its own, with a ridiculous amount of referenced subplots like the relationships between the pirate crew members and their individual stories, the crazed scientist who is ultimately killed by the absolute peak of his life's work and the timid general forced by his corrupt superiors to deal with criminals, it takes every classic theme from the series and does something cool with it.<br/><br/>First, obviously, the aliens. Ripley, who died trying to exterminate them, is mercilessly resurrected, once again pregnant with a queen. The cloning process that in a way ""revived"" her, however, has fundamentally fused her physiology with that of the aliens. She has become that which has dominated her life for as long as she can remember. Ultimately, we learn that this has happened to her ""child"" as well, enabling it to give birth to a perfect cross between Ripley and the queen. In a truly moving homage to the end of the first Alien movie, Ripley ends the quadrilogy by once again blasting the final surviving alien into space, except this time the action is infinitely more profound, the alien being a confused child and Ripley being one of the mothers. Out of the blue, I literally wailed during that final moment. Never before have I seen the main antagonist in a series become so intertwined with the object of her struggle, literally *becoming* it, actually having given birth to it and personally destroying it. Weaver plays the role no less than perfectly.<br/><br/>The synthetic. We went from the malevolent, corporate, heel android working against Ripley in the first film to the empathic ""good guy"" android saving Ripley twice in the next two films to the oddly completely and utterly logical successor to these, a ""second generation"" (ie produced *by* androids) synthetic human initially intending to kill Ripley (in a really neat reversal of the Ripley/android story from Alien) but ultimately working with her and saving her life (by noticing her on Betty's monitor). Call is a tormented synthetic, much more so than Bishop, and Jeunet pays a great deal of attention to this all through the film, from Joner's incessant stigmatizing comments to Call's reluctance to go to the ""dark place"" that is the cyberspace part of her belongs to.<br/><br/>Finally, of course, the company. While Weyland-Yutani apparently doesn't exist anymore by the time this story takes place, everything the army and their scientists do is perfectly in line with the spirit of this evil corporation. More than in any previous film, human dignity is spat on completely, from the dozens of failed Ripley clones (including the one featured in one of the most haunting visuals of the film, the killing of which, incidentally, is also a neat precursor to Ripley's ultimate act of destruction) to the kidnapped ""hosts"" consciously being impregnated. In the most perfect ending I can imagine for ""the company"" (at least for the purposes of this quadrilogy-closer; I am excluding the AvP films from the story arc), the last host first beats Wren, the only surviving ""company man"" half to death in a fit of blind, superhuman rage, then holds him in front of his chest, just in time for the baby alien to burst through his brain (before the baby and its host are blasted to pieces).<br/><br/>How people defecate on this so vehemently, I fail to see. Continuity errors? Every movie has some. Unexplainable plot elements? It is sci-fi. You've already accepted that a spider crab can make love to someone's face, have a small creature grow in their chest, burst out of it and within hours transform into a huge slimy predator. I would think a clone with memories isn't such a gigantic leap."

But I went to see the (apparently) last installment of the Alien series with no expectations whatsoever.<br/><br/>Better than expected:<br/><br/>The Ripley of Resurrection is - in a word - dangerous. Her character changes quite a few times dring the film, from brooding to laconic to furious to distraught to plain nasty: all with an undercurrent of something menacing beneath the surface, like a dorsal fin on a heavy sea. This is the best performance that Sigourney has ever done in the entire series. Her support is also quite good - from the Gucci-ceries carrying a hijacked crew in suspended animation to use as carriers for the Alien young to the Conscienceless Scientists and Military aboard the Warship. And now to the important part - The Aliens themselves. After the god-awful obviously computer animated alien of the last film, we are finally back into Geiger-esque territory - and none too soon. The Alien warriors have undergone yet more modifications. They are more streamlined and inhuman looking. More importantly they move in a realistic fashion which does'nt look as if the camera was merely overcranked. (They're a bit more intelligent also!) The genetic prequels to a successful Ripley were Truly horrific and the discovery of the same was one of the few moments in film that have honestly put a shiver down my back. The storyline was a tad simplistic but perhaps that was for the best, with fewer gaps showing and allowing the film to progress at a fluid pace.<br/><br/>As good as hoped?<br/><br/>No. But considering the impact and flavour of the original film, (which despite the effects looking dated today, it is still the most powerful and believable film of the four) I certainly was not disappointed - In fact I think I'll see it again - Soon.<br/><br/>Dan"

","I've just read a fanzine review of this film which was quite swingeing. Someone else's comment was that the film was worthless.<br/><br/>This annoyed me though I don't know why I haven't learned by now.<br/><br/>One way to see the four films of the Alien series is that the Aliens are presented with different kinds of human opposition.<br/><br/>In Alien we have a competent but unprepared crew of a merchant ship. In Aliens we have space marines who are built up as ultimate hard men equipped with state-of-the-art fire power. In the unloved but worthy Alien 3 we have the opposite of the space marines, unarmed convicts. Most of them turn out to be British character actors. It is fun to slowly sort them out, identify them and see them throw harsh language at the beastie. In Resurrection, the main opposition for the Aliens is not the soldiers, but a motley group of pirates. The soldiers run away, but the pirates die hard.<br/><br/>The review that angered me said that this pirate crew did nothing. I think the contrary. If you know your film and your TV series, you will recognise all these guys, you will positively enjoy seeing them get as far as they get. <br/><br/>I am not a complete enthusiast for the film as whole, though it deserves plenty of credit. But I think this is one of the best crews in film. Most films haven't a clue how to present any kind of team so that each makes his mark. This crew is up there with the guys in Deep Rising, the gang in Game of Death, the team in Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead."

","With Resurrection, we finally get to have fun with both the story and the characters, thanks in large part to fine performances by Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, and Ron Perlman.

In the special edition, there's a funny new opening scene and an even better ending, along with added scenes which go a long way towards making this a better movie.

"nmholland","1","7","11","9 May 2016"," An Awful Film With Near Nothing Going For It
","Alien Resurrection is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and once again stars Sigourney Weaver, this time as a clone of Ellen Ripley. 200 years after the events of Alien 3 (1992), Ripley is resurrected, hence the title, so that scientists can extract the alien queen that was inside of her. However, this Ripley is a hybrid of Ripley and an alien queen, so she has a few extra perks, such as super strength and acid blood. When an alien breaks loose on the ship she's on, she must team up with space pirates to ultimately stop it from killing everyone on board.<br/><br/>Simply put, this film was trash. I found nothing good about Alien: Resurrection; even Sigourney Weaver's acting was pretty bad.. Not a single thing in Alien: Resurrection was good, and I could barely force myself to keep watching it. The direction, the script, the characters, the acting, and even the special effects were bad. Everything about Alien: Resurrection was completely awful.<br/><br/>The worst thing about Alien: Resurrection was the characters and the actors that portrayed them. Sigourney Weaver doesn't do bad, but she's far from good. All of the other actors are pretty bad, and were disappointing in every single way, especially that of Winona Ryder. Both her acting and character, Call, was horrible. Her character was annoying and got in the way of any productivity, and Ryder didn't even play the part well. All of her lines were delivered as if a 9 year old child was delivering them.<br/><br/>The script and direction are both incredibly lazy. Not a single shot in the entire film stands out, and the lines written are either boring or bad. The few lines that aren't complete garbage are bland, and feel like a premature script writer with no experience had written them. The saddest thing is, Joss Whedon wrote the script. His abilities have obviously matured since that of Alien: Resurrection, but that doesn't excuse the bad writing. All of the direction was pretty boring and grim, and didn't provide the film with a decent atmosphere.<br/><br/>The special effects, while not as bad as in Alien 3 (1992), still aren't that good. Most of the shots of an alien swimming, or climbing a ladder, or running on walls looked really fake and inexcusable. Most of the ""suspenseful"" moments with the protagonists running from the aliens were completely tensionless, mostly due to the audience not even caring about the characters. Even Ripley's character has no feel to her, because she's not even Ripley; she's a clone of the actual Ellen Ripley, who was killed 200 years prior to this film's setting. All dynamics were stripped from the characters by the poor script, and left the characters as nothing more than names and bad acting.<br/><br/>The worst part of Alien: Resurrection is the main antagonist towards the end of the film. I don't want to go into details and end up spoiling it, but the alien that Ripley is forced to fight at the end of the film is just awful. Nothing about this villain was compelling, or even scary. Not only was the character in itself bad, it also looked terribly unpleasant. Although the aliens are regularly grotesque, this particular antagonist was just horrible in every single way.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Alien: Resurrection never should've been made. Not only is the script lacking, the characters are appalling, and aren't portrayed well. Alien: Resurrection is a step down from all three of its prior films in every single way, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

"plpregent","6","2","2","18 April 2016"," Flawed yet underrated fourth installment in one of sci-fi's most notorious franchises
","Alien:Resurrection divided audiences from the day it got released in theatres. To this day, even many studio execs and producers of the earlier films don't even dare watch this film or even consider it as part of the Alien franchise (so glad the Alien anthology Blu-Ray Boxset includes making-of featurettes for each of the four films - pretty awesome stuff). Among the franchise's fanbase, it's not unanimously appreciated either. I can understand why. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, I still think it deserves to be watched, as despite its weaknesses, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film offers its share of interesting moments, all wrapped up in a technically-sound package.<br/><br/>Now, for anyone who has seen all four films, it's pretty obvious that each one of them has its own respective flavour, so to speak. Each film comes from a different director (and all four directors are extremely talented guys), and the difference in tone is quite noticeable, as the first film is a true, nightmarish, slow-paced sci-fi horror film ; Aliens is more action-oriented ; Alien 3 is a blend of thriller and horror film. Alien:Resurrection is no rupture to this thread of changing tones, as it has its share of dark humor, it's far more gory and graphic than all the previous installments, and it picks up (only) 200 years after Alien 3, in a spaceship, with our favourite monster-slaying female protagonist, none other than Ellen Ripley. Yes, she died in the third film, but writers have found an unoriginal and somewhat far-fetched way of bringing her back, which surprisingly ends up being perhaps one of the most interesting subplots in the whole movie (and one of the only ones too), as it leads to one pretty haunting scene later at the mid- point of the feature.<br/><br/>The script certainly isn't the film's strongest asset, as it serves no purpose other than getting the spaceship crew to confront the notorious alien creatures through all areas of the spaceship, with plenty of bloody and gooey fun throughout. My synopsis might not do the script justice, as there are a few subplots that I will not spoil, some interesting, some just plain silly. It does borrow elements from the previous films: Ripley develops a relationship with one of the characters that's a bit reminiscent of that she had with Newt in Aliens; there is a lot of action and gun play, just like there was in Aliens; it follows the tradition of featuring a robot character; the crew of the spaceship is composed of a few macho characters that might remind you of those in Alien 3, etc. All these elements are nice inclusions, but have a tribute feel to them more than anything else. <br/><br/>Anyhow, we do get good performances from the likes of Ron Pearlman, Brad Dourif, Wynona Ryder, Dominique Pinon and, of course, Sigourney Weaver. <br/><br/>Directing and cinematography rank among the highlights, along with the tremendous makeup and practical effects. Jean-Pierre Jeunet definitely brings a humorous touch here and there, but it never amounts to any overly distracting silliness. The aesthetics are true to the genre and look better in this film than in any of the previous ones, especially the creatures. They're more fluid in movement, the costumes are very detailed and gorgeously textured, and some of the set-pieces bring the gooey madness to a whole new level. Cinematography has a distinct feel to it, and the work on lighting is somewhat reminiscent of that in La cité des enfants perdus and Delicatessen, two of Jeunet's previous films.<br/><br/>The soundtrack by John Frizzell also works very well, and adds a nightmarishly majestic tone to the film, especially in those moments featuring plenty of organic imagery. <br/><br/>Overall, Alien:Resurrection, despite its fundamental flaw of suffering from a linear and quite predictable script that might borrow too much from the previous outings, is still a welcome (yet maybe unnecessary) addition to the franchise, and a technically competent film which profits greatly from Jean-Pierre Jeunet's approach in visual storytelling. While it is not nearly as good as either one of the first two films, it's still a worthwhile 100 minutes in the Alien universe."
"lee_eisenberg","6","2","2","29 October 2007"," dichotomies in life
","While ""Alien: Resurrection"" continues the story of extraterrestrial monsters going after humans, there's something of a dichotomy with Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). Certainly she's in control and as much of a bad-ass as she was in the previous movies; hell, she beats the men at basketball. Which makes it all the more surprising when she utters ""How many men do I have to f--- to get out of here?"" If you're going to all the trouble to turn a woman into Rambo, why have her say that? Maybe it was partly that around the time when this movie came out, Sigourney Weaver also starred in ""The Ice Storm"" (and played an icy character), so it was a little perplexing as to why she chose to continue playing Ripley when each successive movie focused more on the gory aspect.<br/><br/>Truth be told, I can't fully explain why Ripley does what she does, and I don't know whether or not the movie would qualify as sexist. I did find it pretty enjoyable. Weaver, Winona Ryder, Dominique Pinon, Ron Perlman, Leland Orser, Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif play some neat roles. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet more recently directed the Audrey Tautou vehicles ""Amelie"" and ""A Very Long Engagement""."

","Oh, what a rancid waste of film.  Alien: Resurrection is pure garbage, plain and simple.  The dialogue is awful, the acting is awful, the plot . . . well, if there actually was a plot, it would've been awful, but since one never existed, it's a moot point.  Yet again, humanity is being threatened by the Alien menace, and since humanity has apparently spent the 500 years between Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection doing nothing but picking the collective lint out of its navel, scientists decide to clone the charred remnants of Ripley into an ultimate Alien killing machine.  Of course, these same geniuses somehow don't notice that they've alos included some Alien DNA in their new Ripley clone, making her equally dangerous to both humanity and Aliens alike.  Gratuitous, badly directed combat scenes ensue.<br/><br/>
Sigourney Weaver gets to chew some scenery by playing the Ripley clone, who's far more aggressive and violent that the Ripley of past Alien films. At least she was fun to watch, even if the character made absolutely no logical sense.  And then there's the latest android/human fascimile of the series . . . Winona Ryder, as Annalee.  Hee, hee; she's unwatchably bad. She pouts and whines her way through the film, trying to act tough but ultimately looking nothing short of pathetic.  Bring back Lance Henrickson as Bishop.  Hey, bring back Ian Holm as the homicidal Ash, at least he'd be better than Ryder.  How Winona Ryder got into this film will probably go down as the greatest mystery of the Twentieth century; she's THAT bad.<br/><br/>About the only saving grace of the film are the sets, which faithfully recreate the moods and claustrophic creepiness of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" . . . unfortunately, by reminding you of those films, you're also constantly reminded of how bad ""Alien: Resurrection"" really is.

"tedg","Null","8","14","27 June 2001"," Different Worlds
","Different Worlds<br/><br/>Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I've just rewatched `Alien,' `Aliens' and `Alien Resurrection.' Considered simply as films, each is a fine film but they come from worlds that are more different from each other than the normative world of now is to the world of any of them. Just viewing them is a course in filmmaking.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's `Alien' is the most impressive, knowing that it was only his second film, that every effect is physical, and that the budget was so low the spacecraft is cobbled together from used aircraft parts. Even at this early point, Scott has the ability to create a unique look and has the mastery of craft to coordinate every element (acting, score, movement) to reinforce that look. That he chose Giger to base the look on was brilliant. Organic darkness -- evil embodied in living things. The alien ship, though only briefly shown, is a sequence that will live way past the time that the monsters of the series are forgotten; that blending of beast, environment and narrative is unique in all filmdom. Really amazing that the sequels didn't go back to that ship. Scott has grown to be one of our best and most original filmmakers -- Alien and `Blade Runner' (with `Forbidden Planet') are the very best `real' scifi films we have, meaning films that are not just adventure films.<br/><br/>Where `Alien' is scifi in the service of horror, `Aliens' is scifi in the service of action. Aliens is a war film, and equally impressive as one of Cameron's earliest. Movement and conflict. More emphasis on the familiar is necessary for this approach, so we see the sets and costumes less adventuresome. This is a thrill which uses the trappings of scifi only as another thing with which to impress. The mood created is projected not into the image as with Scott, but into the theater as something to amaze. Cameron hasn't evolved at all from this film, only been given ever bigger effects with which to amaze. So one might consider this his most `genuine' film.<br/><br/>`Resurrection' seems to not be as admired by the fan base. But I think it every bit the equal of the other two. In this case, we also have a new director, a European with two fantasy tales under his belt. But those set a tone that is strikingly weird: the tone not in the setting, but in the psychological space in the story. And that's what we have here. In Cameron's film, every character is a stereotype. Here, every character is an anti-stereotype: the black guy isn't jive; the cripple is the toughest; the sex kitten is a robot... even the hero isn't really. This is also the most cinematic use of the camera, using the psychological eye. Scott dwells, Cameron moves, Jeunet examines. He doesn't mind annotating the past films (rather like Van Sant's `Psycho' annotates Hitchcock's).<br/><br/>The only negative thing I note in the sequels is that Weaver isn't adaptable enough to understand and get behind these diverse visions. She understands Scott. Cameron doesn't really care, but she is outclassed by Jeunet.<br/><br/>Seeing any one of these enhances the appreciation for the other two."
"mindbullets","1","11","21","22 January 2002"," Pointless and awful. Guess that makes it awful pointless.
","I feel sorry for Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Obviously a talented director with an eye for spectacle, he has been saddled with one of the most hackneyed and downright groan-inducing scripts ever. Basically a haunted house movie set inside a spaceship (two, actually) full of the eponymous Aliens, writer Joss Whedon scraped the bottom of the cliche-barrel, bringing us not-at-all-lame scenes of people wandering down dark hallways and sticking their heads into acid-burned holes for no particularly good reason (other than to be eaten, of course). The movie liberally steals ideas and scenes from Jim Cameron's Aliens, which is okay, I guess, in an incestuous and cannibalistic kind of way. The sets, the characters and the banter are all pale, inept imitations of stuff we've already seen in the series. Too bad they couldn't have stolen a speck of intelligence from the previous three Alien movies.<br/><br/>
This is a noisy, ugly and boring movie... but like a train wreck, it's worth seeing, if only to awe in how someone could manage to louse up a movie about shooting aliens and wearing leather pants. But my hat's off to Whedon, Jeunet & co.; they loused it up royally."

","When people think of the worst movie in the Alien saga, automatically what comes to mind is ""Alien: Resurrection."" While it is true that it is among the lesser Alien movies (Resurrection, Alien 3, Alien vs. Predator 1&2), it is honestly kind of a dumb masterpiece. What that means is while this movie may be really weird and off the rails and bloated at times, it has a certain charm and awesomeness to it that Alien 3 doesn't have. While I actually don't hate Alien 3, it is easily the worst of the main 6 Alien movies (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection, Prometheus, and Alien: Covenant). And I feel fine saying that, even though many people might disagree with me. Even though Ripley is pretty bad in Resurrection, Winona Ryder makes everything better (I have a fairly big crush on Winona Ryder). So, haters, back off. Alien: Resurrection is a movie worth your time."
"johnnycage10","10","7","12","30 August 2005"," Excellent movie
","I'm always surprised at the critics to this great film who claim that it's as bad as the theatrical version of Alien 3 or worse than Alien. Truth is that AR is one of the best films ever made, second only to the nearly perfect Aliens and much better than the decent Alien. It's just too bad that the mass audiences did not agree, letting this $70 million gem make $140 million worldwide, and thus securing that the AR genre would not continue. <br/><br/>*****SPOILERS****** First, for the positives. That starts with Jeanet's direction, which is artistically and visually beautiful. Then there's the writer, in Joss Whedon (back when he used to be good and before he sold out to maximize his profits). That's proved in the fact that no one could've ever predicted how the aliens initially broke out of their containment. Add to that surprises aplenty (underwater scene was gorgeous) such as Winona Ryder's initial ""death"", the infected miner getting his revenge against the evil doctor, the overall dialogue, and this is one of best-written films anywhere. <br/><br/>Add to that the acting, which is excellent on Sigourney Weaver's part, and pretty good on the part of everyone else, with special mention to Ron Pearlman and Michael Wincott's unfortunately-limited presence. And last, the special effects, which are awesome. Granted the CGI doesn't look as good in some places, but truth is that one could not tell this story by using people in suits (such as the ultra-cool scene where the alien jumps out of the water and latches on to the ladder above). <br/><br/>But there is one negative, and that's the Newborn. Not that I disliked this monster. In fact, it was impressive indeed, and its death scene was another shocking scene to watch open-mouthed. But the Newborn was unnecessary. We still had plenty of story that could've revolved around the facehuggers, xenomorphs and the Queen, that could've been developed without bringing a new monster into the genre. Personally, I would've had the Queen have a child-like attachment to Ripley, and have the Newborn's death be the Queen's death, which would've made this movie perfect. <br/><br/>Overall, it's such a shame that this film wasn't accepted by the masses, and it's also a shame that Winona Ryder made a stupid decision by shoplifting a few years later. I heard rumors that her off-screen behavior is partly what convinced Fox to do the horrible AvP and not do a fifth Alien movie with her character as the lead. Instead, we got Paul Anderson's garbage. What a waste."
"martijn-56","9","6","10","28 October 2011"," Very artistic and almost brilliant gore...Far too underrated!
","As one reviewer put it: Alien was about suspense, Aliens was an action movie, the third was a tragedy and this final one is gore. But just like Alien 3, for which Sigourney Weaver should have won the Oscar, also this fourth installment is underrated – even by James Cameron, who ranked Alien Vs. Predator as the number three in the franchise. I think the same happened to the Matrix sequels; the second and third were incredible movies with lots of new stuff, but nobody particularly liked them. Why? The Matrix, as Alien, and Aliens were just some of the best movies ever made and probably Aliens is, with The Godfather 2, the only sequel I know that is equally good as the first (or better). The reason that sequels are still made is therefore commercial, not a director's ambition to leave his artistic mark. Still, Aliens, the first sequel in the series became a classic, why? The success of Aliens was due to the fact that James Cameron realized that for now only an action movie would do, making a totally different genre of his sequel. So how about Resurrection? If you ask me, I think this is a good sequel since it flowed naturally from the first three movies: we have the Ripley character and a bunch of people being hunted by the Aliens trying to make their way out into space. That part is familiar (= what we go to see an Alien movie for); the rest is new to make it a movie strong enough to stand on its own (that is why we still go to see a sequel). Resurrection had a comic book style script with humor, and beautiful decadent sets, almost futuristic Art Deco. Ripley herself was the perfect mix: she had something familiar, and lots of new stuff, since she was Ripley and yet, being cloned 200 years later with an Alien inside her, she wasn't Ripley anymore. Ripley being different was probably the thing many fans had problems with, but had she stayed the same helpful brave woman, the same fans would have complained it was all too repetitive. I think the fact she was and wasn't the same helped me to adjust to a new formula, which after three movies was inevitable. I thought this new Ripley and Alien-queen-in-one was a great find (albeit with disgusting consequences, making a smart anti clone statement at the same time); she was almost like a predator herself, with a humoristic and unpredictable tweak, still keeping her strong character alive that made her an extremely credible protagonist in the first three movies. Still, this movie got less than a 7 score. For me this is the paradox of sequels: when we get the new stuff we have not seen before we think the movie deviates too much from the original, and yet, too many familiar things make any sequel too repetitive. But to be fair: I have never seen a more disgusting movie, and I had problems with that. That is the reason I could never give it a 10 like the first two. But visually it was a pleasure to watch, making this director just as much an artist as Cameron or Scott were. Let's just say Alien and Aliens were classics and I am happy we got Alien 3 & 4, since I enjoyed them more than I was disappointed that they were not as good as the first two (impossible anyway). Resurrection had lots of new stuff, beautiful sets, and effects, and the acting acting, especially of Sigourney, was great: definitely 9 out of 10!"

The anger,confusion,frustrating,and so and so forth.

","Starting at the begining... I saw the movie ""Alien"" for the first time ever in 1997.  Slowly the viewer approaches a ship that looks almost like a city. We are taken inside.  Breezes and small sounds fill the inside of the ship. We are taken on a silent tour, and then watch as the computer wakes the few passengers up and the movie begins. After watching the movement and feeling that Ridley Scott (the director) put forth for all us ""movie goers"" my curiosity was stirred.  Honestly, as a woman myself who lives a complicated human life I could relate to Ellen Ripley.  Whether it was her struggle to keep alive even while all those around her are destroyed, or just a struggle to stay in her status position or responsible position.   All of us feel all that way at some time.  So, after Alien, I saw Aliens.  The sequel was well written and believable. That is something one doesn't see very often at the theater.  Ellen wakes up after 57 years and seems just as human as before.  The journey in that sequel is filled with suspense, drama and even laughter.  The ending is once again filled with sorrow yet hope remains.  For most, Aliens is their favorite movie of all 4.  The child and the new and complex characters sparked many other viewers interests.  Alien 3 was of course the movie I saw next.  I believe the 3rd sequel and last journey for Ellen is misunderstood. Many great fans of the saga do not like Alien 3.  Many say it must have been Ripley's dream and could have never really happened in her life story. I loved it.  I appreciate the introduction we all get into reality.  Because in real life, (just as Number 8 (the cloned Ripley) says in this new film Alien Resurrection), we die. I<br/><br/>When Alien Ressurection first came to the theaters I was amoung the very first to get in line to see it.  Suddenly the lights go out.  A very  recognisable type of music begins. Skin is pushed around the screen, something is being made.  Space surrounds you.  Things are strangely quiet once again.  Another ship is in the distance.  We enter the ship, the ""Usm Auriga"" space craft and walk through the door to see the same men we remember from Alien 3. Men in white lab coats.  Inside a embryonic tube we see a child.  Quietly she says to herself,  ""My mommy always said there were no monsters.. no real ones.. but there are.""  Any fan knows this child is quoting another child named Newt.  Yet this time the words take on new meaning.  This journey of Ripley no.8 is a new one.  I think it is a very important addition to the saga.<br/><br/>In conclution, after seeing all of these 4 segments of Ellen Ripleys' story in a row,  I think that the meaning behind it all is more than feminism or heroism.  I really believe it is all about being human.  I have really found a treasure in these 4 films and I hope that the future generations to come find her story just as interesting. After all, the year this movie came out we cloned an animal successfully for the first time.  What do we clone next?........"

","Well, I did not want to watch this title even being an Alien/Predator franchise lover and also Jean-Pierre Jeunet devoted fan since third Alien movie by David Fincher was awful and this one has low ratings.<br/><br/>So I pulled myself together, pressed 'Play' button and what do you think happened? It was pretty interesting from its very beginning to the end! I've just been watching it and didn't even go to take one more cup of tea or something.. <br/><br/>Great acting made me love these actors more than I did, Ron Perlman did his best, Dominique Pinon was not so good though.. These scary scenery were just like from other Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movies, especially in that lab scene.. <br/><br/>But the real question is WHY did they killed that baby?! It was really cute! It was looking at its 'mom' and saying 'please, why are you leaving, don't, why are you trying to kill me, mom?' I almost cried. She could make it not to kill people, the child was supposed to listen to its 'mom'.. And I don't know really why the hell it killed the queen, she was just like a woman and I didn't expect that baby's gonna kill her.. <br/><br/>Finally, from now on it's in my favorites. One more great Alien movie. One more great Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie."
"Joejoesan","8","5","8","3 January 2010"," Could have been great
","The problem with Alien Resurrection is that it could have been great instead of just fine. When I watched this movie back in 1997 in the theater I thought after the first hour: wow, this can't go wrong! The new born Ripley is an exciting character, because you don't know which side she is on. And Sigourney Weaver - 50 at that time - looked great in leather. Back was the hardware, the non-CGI aliens, the fresh ideas and the great action. The basketball scene and Ripley's confrontation with the previous clones were impressive. The look and feel were right on the spot and the story was exciting. <br/><br/>The first part of the movie wasn't flawless I guess. But I could live with the things that annoyed me. The miscasting and overacting of Wynona Ryder for instance. The unnecessary swearing and harsh language by both Ryder and Weaver. The scene in which Ripley suddenly talked in full sentences after her awakening. I could live with that. But it all fell definitely apart when the new alien was shown to us at the end of the movie. Man, were they serious? Was this supposed to be the alien of all aliens? The motha of all mothas? Come on, don't make me laugh!<br/><br/>The scene that spoiled it all for me had a great start, though. It began like the climax of Andrzej Zulawski's Possession (1981), a surrealistic European movie in which we saw the beautiful Isabelle Adjani making love to a monster. To me that was a shocking scene because it was very explicit. But here in Alien 4 it worked out very well... at first It looked like Ripley came to turns with her destiny. It started well until, of course, you see the final monster.<br/><br/>Twelve years later I'm watching the Alien movies again with my 12 year old son. I was 12 myself when I saw the first Alien in the theater so I thought the time was right. We both pretty much enjoyed ourselves. On DVD the first Alien was a little bit slow but still great. Aliens remained an overwhelming sequel. The long cut of Alien 3 wasn't good but better than the first time around. <br/><br/>And Alien Resurrection? Well, when you know what flaws to expect it's a good farewell to the Alien franchise. Good but not great. But if Ridley Scott or James Cameron wants to give it one more they both have my absolute blessing!<br/><br/>8/10"
"alainenglish","Null","5","8","28 May 2003"," Fascinating, if slightly unmemorable, coda to the franchise (spoilers)
","""Alien: Resurrection"" continues the story of Ellen Ripley after her sacrifice at the end of the third movie.  While this fourth film functions in some respect as something of an addendum, it does do what the otherwise excellent third Alien flick did not: expands upon the aliens biology and psychology and gives us some interesting new insights into the creature.<br/><br/>It has been nearly 200 years since Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) sacrificed herself on the prison planet Fiorina 161.  In this space-set adventure she's resurrected by a group of scientists (among them Brad Dourif) and the military, headed up by General Perez (Dan Hedaya).  The idea behind her resurrection is to use alien D.N.A in her blood to create an Alien Queen and a new Army of alien soldiers.  Naturally, this plan backfires and the aliens are loosed just as a team of pirates (among them Ron Perlman and Winona Ryder) attacks and boards the ship...<br/><br/>On completion of this movie, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet rightly paid homage to ""Alien"" director Ridley Scott and the alien designer H.R Giger, saying that they were the original artists and those that follow are just artisans. That is a very true sentiment, as alot of the story and character elements in this one are borrowed or are least familiar from previous instalments. There the tough grunts (the pirates in this picture equivalent to the Marines from ""Aliens""), ambiguous characters with hidden agendas or motives, and the onrunning theme of the humans out to exploit the deadly aliens for their own purposes.  Unlike the previous three movies, this film is set near Earth, providing the basis for the film's finale.<br/><br/>Performances are good enough for this kind of fare but Ripley, predictably, has the most interesting and best-developed role.  The combination of both human and alien D.N.A in her blood has gifted her with some unusual abilities, bleeding acid blood and being able to scale walls with ease. This in turn renders makes Ripley's relationship to the aliens far more intimate than previously envisaged and comes up with a few unexpected surprises.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Brad Dourif makes a creepy impression as one of the scientists, communicating very well his characters obsessed fascination and awe of the aliens.  However, Dan Hedaya should have perhaps been used more as General Perez, Perlman and Michael Wincott are unmemorable, and Winona Ryder fails to exploit fully the dramatic opportunities in her role.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is impressive.  Like David Fincher and Ridley Scott before him, Jeunet has an eye for the gloomy and portentous and it shows here.  The set designs, with their colours of rust, red and brown are beautifully reminiscent of the prison from the third film whilst creating a feel unique to the picture.  The special effects here are a welcome mix of traditional and CGi, although neither is overused to detrimental effect.<br/><br/>There are some interesting and memorable moments to behold here.  The first is the scene where a scientist eyes up an alien in the laboratory and the camera pans back to reveal the Alien Queen in all her glory.  It is a frightening moment and suggestive of the horror of the experiments.  There is also an inventive action scene where the aliens are fought underwater. The finale is strangely moving, as is the last scene (a slow-moving coda) on Earth.<br/><br/>""Alien: Resurrection"" is not too bad an effort and does expand on the themes of the first two films in ways that the third film did not.  It is that third film, however, which really should have ended the series."
"imseeg","7","3","4","28 March 2018"," The Monster's Mother
","Accidentally stumbled into Alien 4 (Resurection). Remembered it as a watered down version. But I enjoyed it beyond expectations, although the ending seems a little cheap. Maybe they ran out of money because the special effects at the end are somewhat cheesy, but as a whole Alien 4 has almost the same energy and feel as Alien 2 (Aliens). <br/><br/>The acting is particularly good in Alien 4. Better than in 2 and 3. I loved the stereotyped characters. The music is glorious as it should be. The effects are deliberately scaled down to gritty and dark, which is the way I like it. The first half of this movie is just as in the other versions the best part, because of the building up of the suspense. However once the monsters are beginning to attack it sort of demystifies the suspense and the action is not as well visually portrayed as has been done before, probably caused by the studios refusal to invest more money. This was a shock for the director who expected a bigger budget. But if you can look past some very cheap backsets and cheap explosions than the action, story and acting are enjoyable.<br/><br/>Alien 4 was co produced by Sigourney Weaver so it is safe to assume she has had some influence on the story. She always had said before that she wanted to ""mate"" with the monster in another sequel. And that ""mating"" with the monster is what makes Alien 4 so special. Sigourney Weaver has become the mother of the monsters in Alien 4. <br/><br/>Alien 4 has got some great humoristic oneliners that wouldnt look bad in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The jokes are good so they add to the general funny feel of this Alien version.<br/><br/>All in all a very enjoyable light Alien version but certainly not the best. But I like it more than Alien 3. Too bad for the cheap ending otherwise this 4th sequel could have been as enjoyable as some of the other editions."
"skybrick736","4","3","4","25 August 2016"," Alien Resurrection (4/10)
","The fourth installment to the Alien saga is a film that should absolutely never have been made. The movie was solely made just to cash in on the title without having any creativity or narrative to the stories franchise whatsoever. The thought of bringing Ripley back as a clone is just an outrageous plot line to begin with. Ripley's character completely 180'd in attitude and spirit and other characters in the film are weak, stale and have little character development. The vast majority of this movie is just a big stretch including the ending. One redeeming aspect of Resurrection is that it is ruthless and seemed to have good gore effects that were disturbing and were of quality to the first two alien movies. Otherwise it should be seen as part of the entire franchise but will likely leave you disappointed."
"classicsoncall","8","3","4","21 March 2015"," ""The best thing you can do is pray for a quick death.""
","If you ever had any doubt that comic book or movie characters don't have to stay dead, ""Alien Resurrection"" is your proof. Sigourney Weaver is back as Lieutenant Ellen Ripley, two hundred years following her demise in Alien3, and cloned from her remains found on Fiori Sixteen. One would probably consider this film another installment of the original Alien saga, but it has a decidedly different twist with the cloning angle and the experiments aboard the USM Auriga designed to produce a new breed of alien to serve a military master.<br/><br/>For the most part, I'd say the film makers did a successful job in bringing their vision to the big screen with a credible balance between sci-fi and horror. The movie touches on the familiar aspects of the earlier trilogy of films with chest bursters and synthetic robots while adding a new element in the concept of a host queen Alien that bypasses the egg cycle to produce a new generation of monsters.<br/><br/>Weaver's character has a difficult task in requiring her new cloned form to summon up remembrances of a long ago past, and I found it intriguing the way she displayed her motherly instincts just before dispatching the Newborn to the depths of space in a creative way. I also liked the way the writers linked the story line to another franchise when Brad Dourif's Dr. Gediman described Ripley as ""something of a predator, isn't she?""<br/><br/>So overall I didn't seem to have the same problem with the picture some other reviewers and fans seemed to have here. I think it works either way, as a follow up to the original trilogy or as a stand alone film combining elements of horror and science fiction in a compelling manner."
"OllieSuave-007","7","3","4","24 April 2014"," Resurrection is a good final chapter, so far.
","Sigourney Weaveer returns one last time, so far, as Ellen Ripley, albeit as a resurrected cloned version that was created by the company. It also removed the alien queen from the original Ripley, but not before its DNA gets mixed with Ripley's, making her develop certain alien characteristics. The Queen then goes on in giving birth to a deadly new breed of its kind that would spell trouble for the human race, leaving Ripley, along with a group of space smugglers, to stop the creature and the ship from reaching Earth. <br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a pretty good job directing, creating an intense atmosphere full of non-stop thrills and action, and directed a cast who is pretty forgettable yet decent in their acting for the most part, but I think Weaver carried the movie. Joss Whedon wrote a pretty exciting story for the plot that I thought wasn't as intriguing as Aliens, but definitely better than Alien 3 - not as dark, gloomy and depressing. ***spoiler ahead*** In order of time-line if you include the Predator and Promethesus movies, Alien: Resurrection is the final chapter, and I thought it closes out the saga on a positive note. <br/><br/>To top it off, the special effects were quite good and realistic, especially the execution of the aliens. The film is not the best in the Alien series, but definitely far from being the worst. <br/><br/>Grade B-"
"geminiredblue","7","3","4","18 December 2013"," She's BACK!!!
","If any of you haven't seen ALIEN 3, I'm sorry. In order to review this movie, I have to give away the ending. At the end of that fiasco, Ripley killed herself having discovered she's carrying an alien inside her. Flash forward 200 years and now scientists have resurrected her through cloning, in order to extract the alien embryo she's carrying. The new Ripley is even tougher than before, since some of the alien's DNA mixed with hers. She now has superhuman abilities and can sense when aliens are nearby. A group of mercenaries (headed by Wynona Rider) invade the scientific research ship, which results in the aliens being released. Where ALIEN 3 was dark, dank and depressing, this one is brightly lit and played, at times, for laughs. There's a sense of wonder and excitement at some of the new alien breeds on display here. Performances are, on the whole, good. And the movie's ending brings the series to a satisfying conclusion. While not anywhere near as good as ALIEN or ALIENS, this film is loads better than the appalling ALIEN 3. Now, let's hope the studio allows the series to rest on its laurels."
"dangkoen","7","3","4","29 May 2012"," ""My mommy always said there were no monsters, no real ones. But there are...""
","The above sentence sums up a recurring theme that is featured throughout the Alien quadrology; the aliens/xenomorphs aren't the only monsters. And they aren't, the antagonist human characters in each Alien-film are just as big of a monster as the aliens.<br/><br/>In this 4th entry, we see how far such human antagonists go to get their hands on the xenomorph species yet again. 200 years after Ripley's death, she is revived through a cloning process. In a pivotal scene, it is also revealed Ripley wasn't the first clone. Sigourney Weaver's acting in this scene is nothing short of amazing, as she witnesses the horrors that came out of the many attempts to bring her back. It is definitely the movie's highlight...<br/><br/>The film is also more gory then the previous installments which, along with the fact there are a little too much and underdeveloped characters, makes it come off like a typical horror/adventure movie and as a result fails to fully satisfy. Though you might get a kick out of the more primal Ripley, since her genes are mixed with xenomorph DNA because of the cloning procedure.<br/><br/>It's good entertainment, but don't feel guilty for skipping it."
"brando647","6","3","4","19 February 2010"," Maybe the Franchise Should Have Died with Ripley Back in 1992
","Here is the third direct sequel in the ALIEN franchise and, by this point, the series has all but completely lost the essence of the original. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, contributes nothing new to the series aside from better quality visual effects and a reason (albeit, a weak one) to resurrect Ellen Ripley. The film occurs 200 years after the events on Fiorina 161 and the military has used DNA samples from the impregnated Ripley to cultivate a Queen. Things get out of control and Ripley bands together with the crew of the unregistered freighter BETTY to escape alive. Whereas David Fincher's ALIEN 3 almost seemed to hearken back to the horror/suspense vibe of Ridley Scott's original, this film seems to aim more towards the man versus alien action of James Cameron's ALIENS. Unfortunately for Jeunet's film, it doesn't come close to matching the awesomeness that was Cameron's film.<br/><br/>This installment feels hollow and meaningless compared to the previous. Instead of focusing on interesting characters or claustrophobic paranoia, the movie feels more focused on the deaths as the aliens one-by-one pick off the survivors. The only scene with any real impact behind it is Ripley's discovery of the seven failed clone attempts that came before her, and the horror of confronting mutilated versions of herself (while showing her only instance of humanity in the entire film). Otherwise, it's just a paint-by-numbers survival horror film...a two hour period where you watch the survivors get dropped into situation after situation where someone is bound to die. As for the ending, I'm not all that keen on it. The conclusion involves an unforeseen result of the cloning process: Ripley has developed minor traits similar to the aliens (acidic blood, heightened senses and reflexes) and the Queen has developed human traits, namely a uterus that presents the film with it's final threat. The concept didn't sit right with me and it felt to me as if screenwriter Joss Whedon was stretching for ideas.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film would've been stronger if they had placed more of emphasis on the characters so their deaths would have an impact. Most of the characters are two-dimensional, with few exceptions. Sigourney Weaver returns for the fourth time as Ellen Ripley or, more accurately, Ripley clone #8. Weaver's spent three films building up a strong but empathetic protagonist and sacrifices it for an extra sequel where her clone is a cold, callous, hissing shell of her former self. Apparently, while Ripley's clone has managed to maintain all of her original memories, it's walked away with none of the best traits that made her who she was. I'll give her credit though, she still looks damn good in this movie.<br/><br/>Most of the supporting cast don't fare well. Michael Wincott shows promise as Elgyn, captain of the BETTY, but isn't around long (similar to the filmmakers' treatment of Charles Dance in ALIEN 3); I also enjoyed Gary Dourdan as Christie, though he is also underused (I'm seeing a pattern here...). I'm a fan of Ron Perlman and his tough guy routine, which is all he does here as Johner. Winona Ryder is beautiful but feels incredibly out of place in this film as Call, the newest crew member of the BETTY with her own secrets and intentions. I still don't understand what was up with Dominique Pinon as Vriess; the rest of the ""good"" guys (Kim Flowers, Raymond Cruz, and Leland Orser) never really evolve past fresh meat that scream/yell a lot. The film's ""villain"", Doctor Wren, is dastardly cartoonish in his portrayal by J. E. Freeman, though it doesn't get much goofier than Dan Hedaya as General Martin Perez. The cornball factor doesn't lend well to a series renowned for it's suspense and horror, and I really felt it weakened the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Probably the only aspect of the film that didn't underwhelm me was the visual effects. The shots of the AURIGA and the BETTY were fantastic and the xenomorphs are looking their best since ALIENS. Visual effects technology had improved greatly since 1992's ALIEN 3 so the CG aliens were much more impressive. There is plenty of gore this time around, giving the film a hard R rating, and should satisfy even the pickiest of gore-hounds. In that regard, the film entertains. I hate to sound as if I'm completely slamming the film because it's not terrible, it just doesn't live up to its predecessors. It's a bit more entertaining than ALIEN 3 but it's shallower in depth. The third film at least tried to have more substance whereas this movie accepts it's cookie-cutter format and runs with it, surviving on visual effects and gore."
"johnnyboyz","5","3","4","22 October 2008"," Seems ironic now that a film with the word 'resurrection' in the title would ultimately kill off a series, but this Alien film does not deserve the reputation it carries.
","I don't think it's that Alien: Resurrection is a bad film, just a film that pales in comparison when it comes to the mainstream's opinion of films that preceded it. But what films to have precede it; Ridley Scott's brilliant Alien, a film that helped pioneer that formula of the human, non-human and the anti-human archetype within a certain space together as events played out, more often than not the anti-human element 'jumping' out at you and picking off the hapless character. What happened in Aliens made everybody gush, some even more than Scott's effort and what happened in Alien³ largely has everybody point fingers at the studio simply because it's a David Fincher film and he directed Fight Club and that's 'brilliant' thus; he cannot make a bad film which means it was the studio's fault.<br/><br/>But biased opinions on directors, films and studios aside; Alien: Resurrection is a sort of hybrid of all three of the films, more so the first two than the third alone. As a film of the genre, it's relatively well paced with a host of characters that threaten to break into the anti-hero vein but all of whom are given their fair share of screen time and all of whom have their traits and quirks. This is a far cry from Cameron's Aliens, which is the worst of the quadrilogy in my opinion, which had a series of soldiers or space Marines or whatever all wear the same uniform, speak and act in the same manner and generally shoot and scream and panic their way out of obligatory action set pieces that would come along every so often.<br/><br/>If Alien was a science fiction that fell into the horror subgenre, Aliens was a science fiction that fell into the war subgenre. Alien: Resurrection is a science fiction film that just teeters over into horror meaning its core is taken from Scott's film although it has the elements of war from the second instalment although we never feel the group of protagonists are fit or equipped enough to take on the group of Aliens because of lack of firepower. The film isn't as good as the first one but then again, given the set up Alien had let loose to filmmakers after its release, no film that had been made in the genre by this time was as good.<br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection sees a band of space travellers land at the ship hosting events in this edition. Their timing of arrival co-insides with Alien series veteran Ripley (Weaver) getting cloned for the purpose of extracting the Alien queen inside of her by the nasty, greed driven guys in surgical suits. Little does everyone know, the ship is an experimentation lab of horror and soon their own fates will be rendered ambiguous when some of the Aliens break out. The set up sounds similar to the following year's Deep Rising, itself a film about a group of 'bad' people who hijack a large mode of transportation, that time it was a cruise liner on the open sea, just as the anti-human element of the piece decides to strike. Rest assured, it's a lot better than Deep Rising.<br/><br/>So the set up is one thing but the real meat of the film sees these rouge space travellers, of whom include Ron Perlman's Johner and Winona Ryder's Annalee Call as well as heroine of the hour Ripley fight and fend their way off the ship to safety. This is where it could be argued the film slips into ""Aliens"" territory in the sense it's a bunch of characters on a ship, with guns, trying to get the hell out of there. So the question is, what's wrong with that? It's not as if the films descends into out and out chaos complete with choppy editing and dodgy one-liners, more so a more calm and drawn out exercise in travelling to a certain location and weathering the storm. The group must deal with underwater travel, the problem in dealing with a character in a wheelchair and how all these elements might affect them.<br/><br/>But it's the character of Annalee Call that garners most of the attention, not least for the twist that arises to do with her. As a character, she is the voice of reason; she is the audience within the film, stating things and saying things aloud we might say or questions we might ask. At one point she stops Ripley from killing one of the ship's lab technicians after the grizzly hybrid findings in the laboratory; instead, she beat the official following Annalee's interruption and the audience perhaps feels relieved there is no blood shed between humans within the human prism of the human-nonhuman-antihuman triangle. Similarly, when it arises the ship automatically negates itself back to planet Earth following a revelation Annalee is there to once again announce, out loud that ""we should blow the ship up."" There's a beat between her (and us) hearing this information before her reacting during which time some audiences members might have already come to the conclusion she announces out loud.<br/><br/>So while the film isn't brilliant, it is far from the disaster its reputation embeds it with. The film is a little bit of the previous three moulded into one but with a European director at the helm stamping his own mark on proceedings and allowing new ideas such as the hybrid monster at the end to step up. With hindsight, it's a far cry better than the path the producers took the franchise down most recently; that being Alien vs. Predator and more-so its respective sequel."

","Having seen Alien³ I was surprised when I heard that a fourth film was to be made and that Sigourney Weaver would still be acting in it. In the opening minutes we learn that the Ripley we see in this film is a clone of the original, not only has she been cloned but so has the alien queen that was in her. The military remove the queen before it bursts from Ripley's chest.<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards a small cargo ship docks and its crew of smugglers unload an unusual cargo; twelve people in their cryogenic sleep tubes, it turns out these people are to be hosts to the next generation of aliens. One of the smugglers, an young engineer named Call, played by Winona Ryder, has an ulterior motive for being there; she has learnt of the military plans and had intended to kill Ripley before the queen could hatch. While the military are trying to apprehend the smugglers for Call's actions the Aliens escape from they holding cell and the alarm sounds ordering the evacuation of the ship... of course that doesn't go quite as well as it might as Ripley and the smugglers struggle past numerous aliens as well as encountering an entirely new type of alien that was live-born rather than needing a host.<br/><br/>This film is probably the lightest in tone of the four films, the smugglers are a varied group who are likable and quite funny, especially Ron Perlman's character. Another surprise is that more characters than usual survive... I won't spoil it by saying which ones though.<br/><br/>I found the story to be well written by Joss Whedon and the acting and direction was good too, I particularly liked Winina Ryder as Call. While it isn't the best film in the series I'd certainly advise those who liked the previous films to give it a go."
"tedsunsayng","7","3","4","8 January 2006"," Continuing Fox's gross mismanagement of the Aliens franchise
","If anyone has a doubt as to the influence and appeal of the first two movies in the Aliens franchise, just check out some of the merchandise selling like crazy 20 years after Aliens. The first movie, Alien, set up a working class future (as an acknowledged forerunner of cyberpunk)and a legitimately disturbing monster and set designs. The second film introduced the hugely popular Colonial Marines and their realistic technology and weaponry. The story line of Aliens also earned the the genuine affections of audiences for the characters Hicks, Bishop and Newt. Then comes Alien 3. During the opening credits Hicks and Newt are killed, showing Fox's tremendous disrespect for the fan base of this franchise. After the sting of disappointment wears off, Alien 3 otherwise proves to be a nicely Gothic film with attractive visuals, but lacking the thrill of either of its predecessors. As for Alien Resurrection: from the moment the credits roll over disgusting scenes of roiling flesh, bone, teeth and eyes, we know that all the dignity and intellect of the initial trilogy is gone. Joss Whedon's cloning storyline is absurd, and mature sensibilities will certainly be offended by scenes of both the non-viable clones and the death of the new creature. Ultimately, the mismanagement of this franchise comes down to Sigourney Weaver. Yes, we love her as an actress, and we love Ripley, but if you want to continue to play a role, don't approve a script that kills your character. The success of Alien vs Predator shows that Ripley is simply not necessary for the success of this franchise. And Winona Ryder's synthetic Call is trebly expendable. Unfortunately, the buzz on future films indicates that Fox is sold on both Weaver and Ryder. For die hard fans, lets pray that the buzz on Ridley Scott's and James Cameron's future involvement is true."
"saraarts","10","3","4","9 July 1999"," Surprising and brilliant
","I watched this film with three other people, all of whom, unlike me, had seen all the other films in this series.  Besides this one, I have only seen Alien, the first in the series.  While all of us agreed that Alien was a really good, definitely scary movie -- a real undie-stainer if you're not used to horror -- none of the people with whom I watched Alien Resurrection could remember much about the two other installments of the saga.  I think we will all remember this installment, though.<br/><br/>I expected Alien Resurrection to scare me almost but not quite as much as Alien, or to completely bore me like the fourth-generation sequel it is. I was completely surprised.  Yes, it scared me when it was supposed to, and yes, it grossed me out when it was supposed to.  But this is like saying the hollandaise sauce on a dish of eggs Benedict is creamy; true to its arena, this is just what it's supposed to be.  What I did not expect Alien Resurrection to do, and what it truly succeeded at, was to move me and to make me think.  I also did not expect this fourth-generation sequel to be able to stand alone as a work of art which can be understood and appreciated completely separately from the previous generations.<br/><br/>In terms of art, the costumes and sets are perfect.  The acting is incredible; there's a whole lot of subtext going on.  The writing is spare; unlike, say, Air Force One, a different breed of action thriller, there is no excess dialog giving rise to ridiculous overacting.  A substantial portion of this film's message -- which is mostly a series of questions -- is delivered by Sigourney Weaver's face.<br/><br/>One of the people with whom I watched this film asserts that it is the finest science/speculative fiction movie ever made, the quintessential expression of the genre.  This is because of those questions, the message of the film and the issues addressed.  Speculative fiction at its best explores constants in human experience by removing them from temporal quotidian settings and placing them, at least in concrete terms, ""where no one has gone before.""<br/><br/>All the great constants are here.  The very human issues addressed in this film include arrogance, bureaucracy, love, strength on all levels, the meaning of humanity, the meaning of tribe, motherhood, and finally, home and the implications of survivorhood.  Some classic questions include:  What exactly is humanity?  Human or not, what is the real definition of courage? Is there such a thing as ""natural"" selection, and how does free will enter into that equation?  What is a woman?  What are the duties of a mother, and how do we define that bond?  And, in a black-humor kind of way, when is it appropriate to apply tough love?<br/><br/>This film is certainly not for everyone.  It's absolutely not for children. It's also not a good choice for either the squeamish or the jaded viewer, or for a viewer looking for an easy thrill or a formula horror flick.  It is a brilliant, ambitious work and one that might keep you up thinking past your bedtime."

","If one thing can be said about Jeunet's direction of this film, it is that he has an uncanny visual sense of the alien (no pun intended) and surreal. From Ripley's weird little body movements into which she occasionally lapses to the makeup and costume design of the human/alien hybrid at the end of the film, this is one visually trippy experience.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty good -- with stand-outs being Sigourney Weaver (the ultimate femme bad-ass), Brad Dourif (the weird and crazy alien-obsessed doctor), and Michael Wincott (the surly yet likeable captain of the spaceship Betty). Unfortunately, though, Joss Whedon (whose Buffy TV series is about the only reason I miss having a boob-tube) really screws up the script. He never allows the characters to breath, constantly forcing them to spit out stupid one-liners in practically every scene.<br/><br/>
Additionally, the plot is nothing we haven't seen before in this series and offers little to keep us guessing. Overall, it's a decent effort, though one must wonder how much better it could have been in the hands of a more capable script-writer.<br/><br/>FINAL RATING: 5/10"
"generationofswine","1","4","6","23 December 2018"," An Honest Review
","I can't believe how the Alien franchise has been politicized in two directions by the same side of the political debate.<br/><br/>I pointed out Ripley as an example of a strong female lead that everyone loves, and that got me the ire of the intersectional crowd. It's not politically correct to like Ripley when you have worse and more modern strong female leads.<br/><br/>But, I really didn't like ""Alien: Resurrection"" and that earned me the wrath of the exact same people!!!!<br/><br/>So, I guess the basic rule of thumb is that you are only supposed to like the bad movies to be politically correct?<br/><br/>I don't know how it works.<br/><br/>For those of you that are rational, ""Alien: Resurrection"" stinks. For starters, Ripley is supposed to be dead. Bringing her back the way they did, well, that's not only an insult to us fans that love her, but to Ripley as well.<br/><br/>Seeing her like that left a sour taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>And though I always loved and will likely always love both Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman, and though they did as good of a job as they could...they couldnt act their way around a horrible script and a terrible premise.<br/><br/>You can't blame the actors for this nightmare. You can see that they are actually trying to salvage something from the mess. In the end, you have to blame it on the fact that this is an Alien movie that no one asked for, and it's a plot that should never have been.<br/><br/>In 1997 this movie was trash. In 2018, however, it's fresh air considering the Alien movies we have now. But still, I'm giving it the 97 rating.<br/><br/>it was over at 3, no need to insult a stellar franchise."

"Von S","1","9","18","1 June 2001"," What is perfect? Why is this movie NOT!?
","What is perfect? Answer: The Alien Creature, the pure quality of the being; its lifecycles, its seductive and poetic and immensely horrific image... in short; `The Alien'.<br/><br/>Why isn't `Alien: Resurrection' perfect? Answer: Allow me to sum the perspective: The four movies: 1: Alien - A mystic and highly horrifying and chilling introduction to the Alien universe = Perfect!! 2: Aliens - Builds upon the previous story without any attempt of copying the first movie (which is often the universal mistake of a flopping sequel). `Aliens' adds another type of storytelling to the Alien-universe. It is told with high pace and with wild action of the highest quality = Perfect (especially directors cut)!! 3: Alien 3 - Just as the second movie it builds the story. Its telling technique is a little like the first movie but it never becomes an obvious copy and the story expands the Alien-universe even further > Perfect!! The same Alien-topic told differently in all three movies and every story builds the universe further: these three movies complete the cycle perfectly. Yet it is a cycle that can easily be expanded if it is done with the same grace as mentioned above! This is where `Alien: Resurrection' fail.<br/><br/>`Alien: Resurrection' - The telling technique is not completely off yet very close to `Aliens', but it makes two fatal mistakes: I: The theme of the Alien-universe has so far been horror and action on the highest level. `Alien: Resurrection' is told in a way so the horror aspect is perhaps not lost but seriously down prioritised! One can justify this by saying that so was `Aliens'; that's true, though not as mush. However, it does NOT justify that humour and corny remarks are the new main ingredient along with action. But please Jean-Pierre Jeunet accept the fact that Alien IS HORROR and not something in between - which is the first fatal mistake the movie has! II: Referring to the definition of ""perfect"" as mentioned above, then there is no reason to change anything about the Alien creature: Why the new design of the eggs: Why make the opening of the eggs look like the anus of a fat jellyfish when the old design with a hard shell was perfect?! And most off all why change the whole mother design... making a big fat skeleton-baby instead? If one should change these two `mistakes' it would mean another design told in another horrifying way: That would have been a number four to be proud of!<br/><br/>But let's face it! The movie has many great action scenes and after all it is Alien and one can't stop from being impressed a little - Therefore I recommend seeing it and that is the only `therefore'!<br/><br/>Can't wait for number 5, perhaps it will bring order to the chaos `Alien: Resurrection' created in the cycles of the Alien! Anyway, any visualization of the Alien-universe is always welcomed - no matter the quality the first three will always be perfect!"

It doesn't mean it doesn't have to make sense... The sets make no sense at all. No matter how advanced a future society may be, it makes no sense to use a spaceship the size of Rhode Island to house a hundred people. There is the slight matter of using materials and energy to build something that big. Second, i understand that some directors want to create a creepy atmosphere, but please... Water dripping from the ceiling in a spaceship? come on... Not to mention the looks of the characters... They look like some escapees from an euro-trash trendy disco. Now acting... Ron Perlman is brilliant, as usual. Sigourney Weaver has reached a new level in self-absorption... Her pseudo-feral Ripley has the believability of casting Barney the Dinosaur as Freddy Krueger. And look at the costume! Gee, now Christian Gauthier designs clothes for prisoners? The special effects execution was good, but the designing was hilarious. The final creature is a mess - people, look at Giger's work if you want to make something Giger-like. The first time I saw the movie, i choked on my popcorn so much i laughed.

"aristide-1","1","11","24","13 June 2001"," The worst of the bunch.
","Before Alien Resurrection it was referred to as the Alien Trilogy.  After it's release it was still referred to as the Alien Trilogy, that fact pretty much sums up the value of this movie.  The ""Alien"" story is a mere backdrop for the latest in special effects, and spectacular though they may be they certainly can not make up for what is missing.  The most important aspect of ""Alien"" was that it was believable, totally plausible, and filmed in such a way that the seriousness of the story was always the most important aspect. That fact remained intact for 3 movies, until Jeunet came along and turned it into a parody of itself.  Jeunet steals lines and scenes from the earlier movies to bolster this movie's credibility, but with little success, and even less originality.  Given Sigourney Weaver was not initially paid for ""Aliens"", I prefer to think of Resurrection as ""Sigourney's Revenge"". She probably got paid more for this movie than the 3 prior movies combined. All this so she can do a poor imitation of Ah-nold from ""The Terminator"". Winona Ryder is pitiful as the emotional android.  She should stick to being a burned out teenage pot head, because that's the role she plays best and obviously comes most naturally. But that's not totally fair, because you can't act if you don't have a plot.  The scene with the flame thrower was ridiculous, it was such a poor copy of the incredible original. The scene where frozen limbs break off, what an original idea that was, can you spell T2? The mother alien, the largest, nastiest, creature that ever ripped an android in half with it's 2 hands, was killed off by a single blow from it's own offspring, a creature that looks like it's outfit was picked up at a Halloween costume store for $25.   Everyone I know laughed when they saw it. ""Unique visual genius""?  Please, picking up a medical journal and molding plaster to look like real deformities is not genius, it's exactly what the whole movie was, a total rip off.  File this one behind ""Space Balls""."
"obiwan-6","1","9","19","6 December 1998"," Good Lord, that was awful!
","Since there was nothing else very interesting on cable this evening, I watched ""Alien Resurrection"" for the first (and last) time on HBO. I am a tremendous fan of both Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder; therefore, by the end of this waste of celluloid, I was sad to have seen them in this... this... send-up? (I think Weaver and Ryder knew the truth, because, wow, were they just walking through their roles.) The best of all the Alien films was the first: ""Alien."" Why? I can think of three reasons right off the bat -- 1) Ridley Scott directed masterfully (especially for a first feature film), 2) this was a film based on characters (even the alien) and not gadgets, and 3) because in ""Alien"" the idea was new and fresh, it was (dare I say it?) original. And credit Scott that it was at least as suspenseful as Hitchcock's very best -- possibly more so. For ""Aliens"" John Cameron (writer, director) thought the original idea was good, so instead of being original himself he threw a bunch of money at it. He tossed in some unnecessary back story, filled the screen with gadgets and people in black rubber suits crawling through the air conditioning ducts atop sound stages at Fox, and had nearly all the characters play it either ""over the top"" (Bill Paxton comes to mind) or over-simplistically. Do you really want me to believe that, with the exception of Vasquez and Hicks, those intergalactic Marines were a group of ""tough hombres""? But then, maybe Cameron was just practising for ""Titanic,"" great eye-candy with little or no script support (he co-wrote) or depth of character. Give credit where it is due, though: Cameron sure has made a lot of money at the box office. Does this say something about him, or about us? Meanwhile, back at the Alien films... ""Aliens 3"" was just dreadful, and had story potholes that could swallow a Buick. (Actually, the book was much better than the film. Surprise, surprise.) I did find a bit of humor in it, upon reflection, when Ripley did herself in the very same way Arnold Schwarzenegger would later do in ""T2"" (another Cameron film, proving he can even steal ideas from himself... I wonder if he realizes it?). But did ""they"" stop there, stop milking this cash cow? Heavens no. They gave us ""Alien Resurrection."" To tell the truth, I wish they hadn't, and had donated the shooting budget to their favorite charity instead. Or maybe they could have spent some of it on a script that would have created some audience connection with -- and caring for -- the characters. But then, such stuff as ""story"" in a bad action movie would have just gotten in the way of making one more ""really cool"" special effects shot. Come to think of it, though, there really wasn't anything ""special"" about those, either: that sort of computer stuff has been done again and again, though I think the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" (for instance) had more heart and soul, more character -- more STORY -- to them than these goop-filled head-bangers did. I do wonder, though, what the day-rate was for the grip to do the run-around-in-the-queen-alien's-prenatal-abdomen-just-before-giving-birth shots... Just wondering... There was one -- count it: ONE -- good thing in ""Alien Resurrection"": there was no ""grip-help"" from just-out-of-frame -- Sigourney actually made the backwards half-court basketball shot, and got nothing but net. I'll bet it took Jeunet a few moments to call ""cut"" on that take just from the shock. Should have wrapped the whole movie there and gone home... Oh, well..."

","I enjoyed this, the fourth movie of the Alien saga. As good as the first two, no, but at least it was a lot better than part three which I did not really care much for at all. This is also the fastest paced and more humorous of the four movies and that only adds to the appeal. You never get as tense as you did watching the first two, but that can be a good thing if you just want to watch the aliens killing and being killed rather than watching something that makes your heart race. Weaver is back as a clone of her former self, and quite frankly she seems to be having a lot more fun in this one than in the others. Ryder and Pearlman make great additions and really add the overall effect of this film. The aliens are once again reborn and they take over a ship as of you expect to happen. No one ever listens when they are told that the aliens can not be controlled. A group of mercenaries join forces with Weaver to fight their way to freedom off the alien infested ship. Good movie, though there is a few bizarre scenes here and there including one with Weaver and an alien. This one is not the best of the series, but it is a fun movie to watch."

","While this movie is not entirely perfect, I felt the need to give it a 9 due to its overall rating of only 6.1.<br/><br/>Too many people compare this Alien to the Aliens of past films. This is ridiculous, because every sequel has been almost categorically different from its predecessor. While the original movie was a groundbreaking landmark of horror-science fiction, the second movie, Aliens, was much more of an action flick than a horror movie. And the third movie, while attempting to be something of a return to the claustrophobic, narrow corridor brand suspense and horror of the first, was nonetheless a far different movie with a far different alien.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece. It exudes style, much in the same vein of The Matrix, but with a definite monster movie twist. This exuberance of style does threaten, at times, to overwhelm its viewers, but it is peppered with enough gut-wrenching violence that one's attention stays just under the threshold.<br/><br/>This movie does demand, much more than its predecessors, that the viewer 'suspends disbelief.' The gore of this movie seems to be its only realism. Realism is sacrificed in the name of style, but to wonderful effect. Anyone who would expect any less must not be at all familiar with Jeunet, the movie's director (see ""City of Lost Children"").<br/><br/>What this movie lacks in realism, it more than makes up for in style. Furthermore, while fans may have been disappointed by a lack of realism, I do not know how they could expect a character who was burnt to a crisp in the previous sequel to return within a realist paradigm. Even if it is science-fiction, one need only note that truly dead characters more often return to life in the likes of Friday the 13th and Halloween than 2001.<br/><br/>And the ending sequence of the film is beyond harrowing. One of the greatest all-time monster movie endings I have ever seen. However it is definitely not for those with a weak stomach."

I couldn't even care for the Ellen Ripley character where even after her death, I was glad the film was over.<br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection is the fourth film in the series where the writers figured out a way to bring back the Ellen Ripley character just so it can make more money and show more blood. In this saga, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is a clone lab rat where the doctors want to see what they can do to her after being resurrected. Not only is she a lab rat, but the doctors and scientist have managed to capture the aliens and the queen and test them like lab rats along with bringing the queen's eggs and experiment human guinea pigs.<br/><br/>Other cast members include Winona Ryder as Annalee Call, a member of a mercenary team led by Michael Wincott where other supporting characters include Ron Pearlman as a hotshot gun-shooter who remains a likable for the fans to enjoy. Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) is a doctor who gets victim to one of the experiments; Dan Hedaya has a short role as a general while Leland Orser has the same psychotic energy he brought in Seven (1995).<br/><br/>What saves this movie is the action and usage of guns compared to the survival and no weaponry of Alien 3. There is hardly any plot to care for, but then again it's not a perfect film. It tries at least to bring the spirit of the first two movies."

","There are few films that can endure until version IV.<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection works on many levels. Given that after the three previous films we all know what the monster looks like, and what it can do, the new world we are asked to confront concerns relationships - involving humans, aliens, clones, robots, clone/alien hybrids. Maybe most importantly it examines the relationship between mother and offspring in a world of warped genetic engineering.<br/><br/>The complexity of the plot might at first seem a weakness, but our previous knowledge of the concepts from the other three films allows the film to encompass many ideas that might otherwise be too confusing.<br/><br/>How does it compare with the previous films?<br/><br/>Alien was outstanding for the concept. Aliens was exciting, introducing the Space Marines. Alien 3, with perhaps the lowest budget and plot lines, still worked because of the ending. Alien Resurrection is by far the most disturbing.

"ExpendableMan","4","6","12","23 April 2007"," Runaway egos and unnecessary sequels
","Back when I was about thirteen, I remember cheering with delight upon hearing that this movie would be made. I was born too late to catch any of the preceding films in the cinema but thanks to play ground gossip and not-entirely-wholesome class mates I'd managed to catch all three on video in those heady few hours between getting home from school and the scramble to hide the boxes when my parents got in from work. Needless to say then, my hormone addled teenage self practically foamed at the mouth at the prospect of more alien carnage, especially when somebody mentioned they were bringing the guns back into the franchise. However, I was of course still too young to see it on the big screen and it wasn't until a plane flight back from Florida a year later that I finally caught Alien: Resurrection in all it's glory. I whooped and hollered with delight and thought it was the most bad ass thing I'd ever seen. However, upon watching it again recently, all it really achieved was reminding me of the old me (which ironically was the young me) and how easily pleased I was. So I guess the whole point of this whimsical and nostalgic tale which has most likely caused the majority of you to skip to the next review down after clicking the ""not useful"" button is simply this; for gun crazy, early teenagers wanting gore, violence and acid bleeding monsters, this is a an absolute must once you've seen Aliens. For the slightly more seasoned film goer however, the ones who would have chosen The Third Man, The Seventh Seal, Cool Runnings or Citizen Kane on the flight instead, Alien: Resurrection is ultimately unrewarding.<br/><br/>Now, for all the plus points (Ron Pearlman!), the minus points (alien sex???) and the sitting on the fence points (is Distephano awesome or not? I can't tell), the principle reason for dismissing Alien: Resurrection is this: it's completely and utterly unnecessary. The original trilogy as I'm sure you're well aware runs in sequence quite beautifully. It moves from a haunting, slow paced opener, to a fast paced and action packed middle bit before climaxing in a grim, nihilistic opus of despair. Alien: Resurrection doesn't fit the storyline at all, it feels tacked on, the last slow gasp of the horse as it gets beaten to death. And given that two hundred years after Alien 3, scientists are able to clone Ripley and the alien inside her makes the character's noble sacrifice at the close of the third act less heroic and more of a delaying action.<br/><br/>Credit where credit's due though, it does have a very striking visual style. The influence of French director Jean Pierre Jeunet has carried over into the Gilliam-alike cinematography where everything is filmed with muddied, hazy colours and bizarre machinery waits round every corner. The appearance of the scientists in particular is pure nightmare fantasy; all shiny white suits that lead up to heads wearing quirky optic goggles and topped off with slick, greased back hair. The corridors of the ship meanwhile are dimly lit, endless octagonal constructs that fittingly enough, look like the inside of an alien's intestinal tract. Alien: Resurrection may not be the high point of the franchise, but it sure as hell is the weirdest looking one. In fact, the best way to describe the whole thing would be as some kind of dark, science fiction carnival of the grotesque, with the 'grotesque' part ably supplied by a smattering of gore in which the human body is ruined in some incredibly inventive ways (at one point a man quite literally picks apart his own brain).<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, imagery, gore and violence alone do not a good movie make. Unless it's 300. 300 was great. But I digress...<br/><br/>At the forefront of the problem here is this new version of Ripley. I hate to pass judgement on an actress the calibre of Sigourney Weaver but it does seem as though her ego was left to run rampant on the film every step of the way. This carries over into her performance as well, with this version of Ripley remaining nothing more than an aloof, nonchalant presence to such an extent that even the emotional outpouring when she torches a clone lab feels altogether forced and unnatural. The Ripley of the previous movies was an impassioned and determined survivalist, this one is just sterile. This wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the cast could fill in the blanks but sadly, they're the most uninteresting bunch of xenomorph ready meals yet. There's none of the natural charisma or camaraderie of the marines or the inmates and with the exception of Dominique Pinon as an ass kicking, handicapped mechanic and Ron Pearlman as Ron Pearlman, they're very difficult to root for.<br/><br/>By and large then, not a great film. It has its plus points but an uninteresting cast, silly concept and uninspiring heroine bring it down terribly and it's only real worth when compared to the rest of the series is as a catalogue of inventive deaths, best of which is undoubtedly the ""chestburster out the torso and through a man's head"" bit. It all reaches its zenith of course with the unveiling of the new monster, a human/alien hybrid that resembles a New York sanitation commissioner who just had the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man detonate above his head.<br/><br/>And Winona Ryder was rubbish."

","First off J P Jeunet is a great director you need only see Amelie to recognise that, but he is most to blame for this franchise killer of a movie. His style just doesn't suit this kind of action filled popcorn cinema and coupled with some bad casting choices and a mediocre storyline this really is poor.<br/><br/>Watch Alien, Aliens or even Alien 3 and they are all far superior to this effort. It's all fairly poor stuff on show here with the exception of one great set piece the underwater alien chase scene is heart stopping. But unfortunately the memory of this is soon erased by the milk baby alien at the end (possibly the worst alien creation i any big budget sci fi movie).<br/><br/>Disappointing 5/10"

","Most could say that the Alien series was better off with the end of Alien 3. But this is Hollywood we're talking about, so they'll be wanting to toss out another Alien movie just for the heck of it. While Resurrection shouldn't have been made to start with, it actually does a good job at being a decent movie entertainment-wise.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, who's somehow resurrected after over two-hundred years. How this was possible after Ripley pretty much burnt to death in Alien 3 I don't know, but the movie doesn't explain this much or at all. This actually works to Resurrection's strength since it doesn't try to be a smart movie anyway.<br/><br/>Since critics and other audiences didn't like the direction David Fincher did of making Alien 3 a suspenseful more than action flick Resurrection has been give the ""Aliens treatment"". So don't expect much more than a movie that has military action scenes with aliens involved. While this doesn't make Resurrection much more than an action movie with the name Alien slapped on the aliens look as cool as ever and the action is satisfying.<br/><br/>The acting in Resurrection is below-average, but that's expected as this is the fourth installment in the Alien series. There isn't much logic in Resurrection but it doesn't try to create much logic. Instead, the movie just focuses on two things, action and humor. Not a smart move in part of the Alien movies but I like how the direction was executed.<br/><br/>Alien fans shouldn't be too disappointed by Resurrection, it's got some fun action scenes. And since the over delivery of the movie is better than your typical fourth installment in a movie franchise it should give them even more reason to say that Resurrection wasn't half bad."
"objxs","2","6","12","22 March 2003"," The Last One, I Hope.
","I picked up this film after learning that it was made by one of my favorite directors, Jean-Pierre Jeunet (City of Lost Children, Amélie). It was my hope that this installment would be better than Alien3 which, at least on that count, it succeeds, even though that's a low mountain to climb.<br/><br/>The plot for this film is a predictable rehash of the last three films. You have your evil massive organization who keeps forgetting that the aliens are really bad. You have an android subplot (this time played by Winona Ryder) which adds nothing but continuity to the rest of the movies. You even have your ubiquitous ""Kill me"" scene where Ripley must kill someone with a flamethrower to save them from too much pain.<br/><br/>However, without sounding too critical there are some good points to this film. The cast is perfect for an Alien film pairing up big names (Weaver and Ryder) with an excellent set of character actors like Dominique Pinion (The Return of Martin Guerre and Amélie), Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Two Towers) and the ever odd Ron Perlman (Enemy at the Gates). This cast gives a valiant effort to bring something out of a script that seems to have been written by some 13 year old boys. Even so, the dialog is so silly it's hard not to wince.<br/><br/>However, the one thing that really saves this movie from the truly awful category is the cinematography and feel of the film. Jeunet, known for his dark films, has really kept the feel of the first two films. The underwater Alien sequence is nothing short of genius. Even the alien/Ripley love child (no, I'm not kidding) follows with the dark and brooding spirit of the original films.<br/><br/>The best I can say about this film is it redeems the series from the catastrophe of Alien3. However, this movie is repetitive, silly and without depth. Let us hope that this is the final film in the series so that no more slander can be thrown at what was once an terrifying experience."

What were the writers thinking when they decided to change the appearance of the alien into a more human creature?  That's all we need is another monster-in-human-clothes story.  Suddenly, this series has lost its energy and has become part of the movie muck we see too much of.  Let's see the aliens on earth in a global invasion (as UNLIKE ID4 as we can get).

","To view back at the previous films: Alien in my opinion was a mega-hit success and one of the only films I rated 10 out of 10. It's sequel, Aliens was also good, but maybe a little too much action, but the sequel still kicked butt and one of the few films I give 9 out of 10. But then came Alien 3 which in my opinion sucked, it had too many F-bombs and the Dog Alien was just a load of stress, Alien 3 was one of a number of films I gave 4 out of 10.<br/><br/>But now here is the fourth film known as Alien Resurrection.<br/><br/>This film was the runner-up to Aliens because I actually thought it was good. The film takes place in 2850 (200 years after Alien 3)but does not really seem like it actually.<br/><br/>The story is about Ripley resurrecting from the dead after 200 years had passed after many failed tries. And 14 aliens come along and bring back the classic spirit of the saga. It also seems that Ripley was carrying and Alien Queen inside her and made the 14 Facehuggers.<br/><br/>One of the strangest parts of this movie is the Alien Newborn, who the queen gave birth too but was killed by her own child. the newborn apparently has a crush on Ripley which I thought was kinda strange.<br/><br/>But still, there was plans for an Alien 5 which is now never going to be made. Alien Ressurrection was still a good enough of a close to the saga."

","I believe Alien Resurrection is a masterpiece with tremendous visual effects, action sequences, emotionally-gripping acting, and suspense. I do believe that its predecessor, Alien 3, had great closure to it, but Alien Resurrection was able to give yet one more great thrill for Alien fans around the world. There is great cinematography in this film. For instance, I think the underwater scene in the film is tremendously done with a combination of slow-motion and fast-paced action suspense sequences. Sigourney Weaver does another terrific job as a true female bad ass. I cannot get over the awesome basketball shot she delivers in the film. There is a very powerful relationship between Ripley's clone and the Alien. It is sad to see the reaction the Alien has towards Ripley betraying it in the end. Great job to Jean-Pierre Jenuet as well for a science fiction classic."

It's refreshing to have a female character in the main role in an action movie and I wish that they would do this more often.<br/><br/>A great mixture of horror (not as much as the first movie), action (probably not as much as the second movie), and overall dark themes (well, outside of horror) that are in the other movies, but really pushed in this one.<br/><br/>The acting, especially considering that this is a sci-fi action flick, is amazing.

If you look at in the light of being a spoof, and take it as lightheartedly poking fun at the series it is part of and the genre in which it belongs, it is really quite funny. I laugh every time I see it. Some of the action sequences were really good, the underwater one comes to mind. There are multiple endings available - the box set with all the Alien movies has both, I think it is the director's cut. The characters are fairly well developed, diverse, and interesting. They interact well and are a big part of what makes the movie so good. There are a couple parts that are a little weak, but they are short and don't detract too much from the movie. And it very funny that it is directed by the director of Amelie."

I got the special feeling that only the alien films give me - Especially when one could hear the ""alien music"" which has been used in number 1 and 2.<br/><br/>Sigourny Weaver manages her role as a clone 100%, and the selection of actors that follow her are perfect.<br/><br/>What prevented me from giving the film 10 (I gave it a 9) was some lack of action, and the unrealism in some of the shooting (when the alien avoids the bullets, and when its head explodes)<br/><br/>The film now holds a special place in my movie-collection."

The actors curiously talked like they thought they were making a prison film or perhaps a low-budget Mexican western. Clint Eastwood extras would be embarrassed to say some of the lines.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder is horribly miscast and looks and sounds stupid, although her voice is kind of amusing, especially if you like to hear her say ""f---."" Sig Weaver is semi-interesting in a bloodless and buff sort of way; but the rest of this dreary, low-brow space shoot 'em up with monsters, is a yawn. If you get off on gross biological freaks in formaldehyde, however, or like to pucker up to T Rex teeth dripping acid, or go for that special feel of flesh being ripped, etc., this might be for you.<br/><br/>Absolutely worst line (but funny as twice-removed accidental humor) is Ron Perlman's comment (after Weaver burns and blows away the grotesque embryos and her own twisted, misshapen clone) ""Must be a chick thing.""<br/><br/>Banal observation: you'd think after all the years in space, evolving away from mother earth, there would be some advance in degenerate habits; but no, these space terrorists still smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey-and I'M SURE basketball with metal nets will still be played on the playgrounds orbiting around Jupiter. Banal observation number 2: with all that fire power, you'd think they'd blow holes in the ship and lose all the air. Alas, no.<br/><br/>There's a special place in hell for people who produce movies like this. In it they are fastened into seats with their eye lids propped open, forced to watch their creations for eternity. I think they should also be forced to talk about how good the movie is and how they've done something just wonderful.

I feel this movie is too ""cool"", artificial and fast-paced - you cannot convey to the audience that what you see on the screen is really happening if things go much faster than in real life - which is really bad since suspense cannot really be created because you do not feel it could really happen. The cast and the script is a joke.<br/><br/>Always look on the bright side of life - at least Weaver earned $11,000,000 for this one, according to IMDB. But still it is like accepting a bribe for making a really bad movie. It is against principle, it is dirty, and in the end, you have a bad conscience and wish it would never have happened.<br/><br/>Weaver is an extra-ordinary actress who truely deserves several Academy Awards - but her public image suffers from bad movies like this one, which is very, very very sad :("
"maryolalov","5","5","10","8 January 2019"," The worst Alien movie ever made
","First of all I want to state that I don't think that this movie is as bad as everyone is saying. It is a decent 90's sci-fi action movie. Of course, if you compare it to the previous Alien movies it really seems like a bad movie. Alien was a masterpiece that defined a whole genre, Aliens was a great action, Alien 3 was also a quite good horror (not a popular opinion) and then there's Alien: Resurrection. It is neither a horror, nor an action movie, it's some sort of a mix between this two genres and that just doesn't seem to work right for an Alien movie.<br/><br/>Even though Alien: Resurrection is a bad Alien movie it is, as I already stated, a decent action movie. A simple plot and script, filled with puns and medicore jokes, which is typical for most action flicks from the 90's. So, if you ignore the previous movies and watch it as an independent film it won't seem that bad. But there are still a few things that completely destroyed the Alien franchise and made me not enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>First, the Alien-human hybrid. I don't know who came up with this idea but it was awful. They tried to make something original and they failed miserably.<br/><br/>The second thing that destroyed this movie for me is the whole idea for Ripley being cloned. It just shows that the only purpose of Alien:Resurrection is to continue milking the franchise, even though it died with Alien 3.<br/><br/>I can go on and point more reasons why this movie ruined the Alien anthology. But I'll stop here and just say that Alien: Resurrection is another example of how too much sequels can destroy even the best franchise."

","I had high hopes for ""Alien Resurrection"" when I saw it last summer, since I think nearly everyone feels the third movie was a weak entry.  I was both revulsed and turned off by AR, and when I saw it again on cable recently my feelings were only confirmed.<br/><br/>The original Alien was one of the first movies that used the ""doom and gloom"" view of the future to good effect.  Everything's dark and murky, spaceships look more like industrial waste yards, and the view of people and society is cynical.  The first few times you see it that approach is different or interesting, but now it seems every aspiring sci-fi movie uses it.  Will somebody please turn on the lights?<br/><br/>The makes of AR forgot one key element of making this approach work is giving someone for the audience to care about.  Ripley's dead, now we have a cloned half human hybrid who spouts wonderful lines like ""Who do I have to f$%! to get off this ship?"", a gang of smugglers who kidnapped colonists to use as hosts for the aliens, and a bunch of soldiers and scientists on ""the other"" side.  The only person in the entire movie who I cared lived or died was the poor infested colonist who ended up getting blown away as the alien was about to burst out of his chest.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver overdoes her creepy hybrid human but, let's just say you can tell she was the executive producer. Dan Hedaya I honestly thought was playing his part for laughs, which jarred in an otherwise gloomy movie.<br/><br/>Lots of running around and shooting, with the heroes using weapons that looked like they were cobbled together from spare plumber's pipe. It got to the point I wondered what color blood/entrails would be splashed across the screen next as people and aliens died in various creative ways.<br/><br/>The ""final showdown"" with the newborn alien, who is supposed to be a hybrid that's more alien, was ridiculous and incredibly revolting.  Did we really have to see every detail of it being sucked out a hole into space?<br/><br/>I've heard they're committed to making a fifth movie, after this entry I certainly hope not.  They can keep cranking out Star Trek movies until the end of time, but I think this series is dead"

The fourth instalment again has a variation on the originals ending but this is not the greatest of its crimes. It is set for some unknown reason 200 years after Alien 3. I say unknown as neither the sets or the hardware reflect any significant advancement from the other films in the franchise. Yet again we have blokes with guns running through industrial pipe n smoke filled corridors but these individuals we neither care for or understand. They are sketchy characters at best, cliched bad guys with ricocheting bullets & other comic book tricks. This whole film is like a cartoon version of Alien aimed at the MTV generation. This is not surprising considering it was scripted by Joss Whedon. If you wade through the dross there is the hint of a good film in here. Bringing Ripley back was really the only thing they could do as an Alien film without her would be even worse (is that possible). The Ripley clone with Alien characteristic is an enticing idea but one that is wasted here. Maybe she should have been the bad guy, the Alien species absent? The scene in which she destroys here clone 'sister' was what I thought would be a turning point for the movie but alas this was not to be. Now we come to this films crowning glory the woeful, laughable alien/human hybrid. What on earth was that THING? Were the designers actually proud of creating this?

(In fact, a lot of people thought at the time that they were indeed French.) That could have put me off, but Joss Whedon's great story (the best since the first Alien film), the visual orgy of colours and blood and mucus and slime, Winona Ryder's charmingly insecure and vulnerable robot character, the imaginative action sequences (especially the underwater alien attack) and the surprising twist on Ripley's character ensured a solid entertainment, unlike the very disappointing Alien3.<br/><br/>The new hybrid alien, the Newborn, is genuinely scary and repulsive - and yet, that look in her eyes, when she realises her mother wants her dead... it's truly heartbreaking. How can you pity such a horrid creature? Pure Jeunet brilliance."

","I actually read the novel before I had ever seen the feature, and I really enjoyed it. As I remembered being on holidays with my family soon after it just opened at cinemas and grabbing a copy to fill in the time. The aspect I liked about it was that the fact you could read that of the thoughts of the aliens. Sure it wouldn't work on film (well it might --- however it would feel quite odd to tell the truth), but it was an interesting touch in the book. I seen it a couple times now and it remains just as adrenaline pumped and enjoyably over-the-top entertainment.<br/><br/>Anyhow French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and writer Josh Whedon (best known for penning ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" TV series and than later on the TV show and movie ""Firefly"") would definitely change the tone of the franchise with this well-budgeted sequel ""Alien Resurrection"" as its broodingly surreal visual edge and venomous tongue-in-cheek approach were the signature styles of its creators. Was it better for itÂ… well, yes and no. While for me it doesn't come close to the first two films, I believe it to be an improvement over David Fincher's ""Alien 3"". Which I don't believe to be as bad as many make it out to be, but still a disappointing experience (although the producer's cut fixes up some problems evident in the theatrical release).<br/><br/>Whedon's story is a perfect blend of sci-fi/ horror / action that starts off with an interesting vision, before transcending into the same old formula. Nonetheless director Jeunet's clinical, but streamlined handling constructs some twisted images (like that of the newborn alien) and exciting passages outside the graphic jolts, liked the sequences staged underwater and involving some ladder climbing. The atmosphere is dark and shadowy with vast, open long wide photography and an expansively simmering score.<br/><br/>Special effects remain impressive as ever. Mixing with effective puppet work (how can you forget the second tongue and constant drooling!) and decent CGI work. The competent make-up FX stands up with moments of graphic carnage and new creation or two. The ensemble cast do decent job. Ron Pealman pretty much steals the show and Sigourney Weaver seems to be relishing her return. Winona Ryder is okay. Then there's solid support by Michael Wincott, J.E. Freeman, Dan Hedaya, Gary Dourdan and Brad Dourif."

","Alien and Aliens were sci-fi classics that can still be enjoyed till this day. Alien 3 was very flawed but it still had its moments. Alien Resurrection is a joke and shouldn't even be mentioned as a part of the Alien trilogy.<br/><br/>Plot: Mad scientists clone Ripley to get the alien that was inside of her from the previous episode on the maximum security prison. Later on Ripley stumbles upon a sick experiment to breed aliens with humans.<br/><br/>Opinion: At least Alien 3 had a chance to be great. This movie was dead once the plot unfolded within the first ten minutes. Sigourney Weaver telegraphs her performance in, and the rest of the cast does the same. Wynonna Ryder unconvincingly plays an android that was sent on the ship to protect the gung-ho crew aboard and supposedly destroy Ripley. The special efforts are the only thing this movie has going for it. Whereas Alien and Aliens had more of a story plus great special effects and chills going for it. Alien Resurrection plays like one of those campy B-movies of the 80s. Mindless action sequences, asinine plots and plot holes, corny one-liners and leaps in logic. Why would anyone clone someone to get an alien? The last 20 minutes with the alien/human spawn with an attachment to Ripley comes off a pathetic attempt to tug at the heartstrings with all the subtleties of a sledgehammer. Its safe to say that Alien 3 was the last of the series."
"fliper78617","8","3","5","9 June 2003"," Not as good as the first two but better than Alien 3
","To sum this up Alien: Resurrection is great example of combining action and some suspense and make it entertaining as best as possible. While it doesn't have the scariness of the first two or the best acting, It's not as melodramatic as Alien 3. The story revolves around 200 years later after Ellen Ripley's death on Fury 161 where scientists have genetically cloned her since she had an Alien queen founded by the Company. While after the Queen Alien has been removed from the cloned Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), she is been kept alive for stasis etc. Then a cargo shop which has a load of humans that are to be used for hosts. A curious female later to be known as the android Call (Winona Ryder) finds the cloned Ripley and sooner or later all of the people are in trouble because, now the Alien Experiments have minds of there own and now are attempting to create a colony of there own. This movie was a pretty good one to watch I enjoyed the movie even if there were flaws. The one major one was Call, Winona Ryder is a good actress but I felt her lines were dry and she could have done better, and some characters that I felt that should have stayed in the movie more like the character Elgyn, and Brad Dourif. Another flaw was the Alien human hybrid creature it was just too sick and depressing for that kind of thing. Now off to the good stuff Sigourney Weaver potrays the Ripley clone in a different way but It's not bad I especially liked the scene where she founds out about the other Clone experiments failed. Ron Perlman gives a great performance as the muscle bound Johner who likes to make a joke at just about anything. Dominque Pinon was an Interesting character as Vriess, Kim Flowers was ok but had no character development but I did like Brad Dourif's humor relief (Especially making those faces at the Aliens) and J.E. Freeman was ok. The writing by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer series) is a decent job but could have used some elements that could have given a more familiar Alien look to it but wasn't bad for his first try. The directing was stylish by French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet who's proberly directed a few classy french films before this one.

","Aliens2 this ain't - and that seems to be the reason for the overwhelming amount of bile that has been heaped upon this film, mostly by American reviewers. You see, this does'nt try to play by the numbers - don't get me wrong, this is not war and peace, but it's not studio kowtowing either. Resurrection manages to take the unintentionally amusing and laughably patchy Alien3 and come up with a plausible way to bring back Ripley from the dead.<br/><br/>Now all those expecting Ripley to bond with a cutesy little girl, strap together two guns or get down with her bad self inside a power suit will no doubt feel let down by the new ""alienated"" Ripley that manages to be far more menacing and infinitely more interesting than the old one.<br/><br/>All those expecting the Marines to kick Alien butt will also be disappointed - in this film they actually manage to do the more believable thing and vacate as soon as possible rather than provide the Aliens with HostsRus. This Ellen Ripley is unsure who she likes less, the humans or the Aliens - she's unsure of what she is or whether living is worth doing. Ironically enough, it's left to a ""Artificial person"" to sway her.<br/><br/>The scene where she discovers the earlier failed experiments is possibly the best in the entire film, let down only by Pearlman's subsequent one-liner. How many of us doubt that if the science was available, that some government or organisation would do this? I don't.<br/><br/>The supporting cast works well, whether it's Wincott's sudden death, Hillard sobbing before being the last to go underwater or Wren's complete immorality.<br/><br/>The whole idea of the Queen inheriting from Ripley as much as Ripley inherits from her is very intriguing and original. The newborn, whilst not geiger-esqe enough for me, somehow portrays a sense of innocence whether looking for guidance from Ripley or biting Christian's face in half. I found its end disturbing and unconciously put my hand over my mouth. I don't know whether this was well done, needlessly graphic or just plain revolting. Perhaps a mixture of the three.<br/><br/>The ending left me a little cold, but as a whole there was the sort of attempt to get inside the Alien (as opposed to the reverse) that the series really needs.<br/><br/>Alien remains - by far - the best installment of the series with characterisations that seem very real, claustrophobia and hidden deaths that work better than any amount of snot-splattering explosive effects and a COMPLETE lack of corny one-liners or machoistic attitudes. What it will never be, is the favourite for those that prefer large firearms, big explosions, flashy CGI and largely two-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>
Resurrection had some good things going for it - not least Jeunet as director - but it's a pity that Dan O'Bannon (Who wrote Alien) did not have more of a direct input."

","Years into the future, a clone of Ellen Ripley and other survivors find themselves trapped in an abandoned research ship overrun by the aliens they bred from her remains and try to escape before they're killed one-by-one.<br/><br/>This here is an unjustly maligned sequel and actually has a lot of good stuff going for it. One of the better areas in the film is the high-intensity action that permeates the surroundings, really from the start and manages to get in a lot of great stuff from it. There's a multitude of chases here that are a ton of fun and really high-energy, from the walk-through of the flooded corridor and the swim through the underwater section all the way through to the trap with the eggs and the resulting shoot-out there, as well as other scenes from the rampage through the ship and taking out the evacuees in the escape process as well as the rather impressive attack in the escape pod at the end which contains a lot of great parts to it and really works well. This is helped by a rather well-designed ship location that allows for these tension-packed scenes to take place and generate a lot of fun. Another good plus is the high gore on display, from scarred faces, jaws ripped open and other extremely graphic kills that give off a great feel, and as usual the aliens are incredible. The only real flaw to this one is the rather inane segment that keeps a dead crew-member around for no reason than to keep a big-name member more involved in the film at that point. Also problematic is the early scenes of the clone interacting with the crew which goes nowhere, but overall this one is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language"

","Unlike some Alien fans, I was gripped by Alien3. I found it to be a very worthy and successful return to the claustrophobic low-tech horror feel of the first, classic Ridley Scott film. It was also an appropriate and dignified end to the series, I thought and to Ripley's character in particular.<br/><br/>And so we thought the beast had been destroyed.<br/><br/>I guess the money-men and suits in Hollywood did not agree.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver must have been paid a hell of a lot to appear in this rubbish.<br/><br/>When I heard there was to be a sequel with Ridley ""resurrected"", I thought that surely this was an empty cash-in on a great idea, dragged out beyond its natural course.<br/><br/>As a great fan of the first three films of this series, the fourth in the franchise seemed redundant, unnecessary and quite frankly stupid and unappealing with stock characters and really inappropriate and distracting 'humour'. This was a long long way from the dark, intense Gothic masterpiece of the first in the saga. This was a cartoon of a crude kind, barren of ideas. A facsimile of a facsimile of a great idea.<br/><br/>It added nothing to the already distinguished heritage of the series, and to my mind devolved an intriguing frightening sci-fi legend into the sort of B-movie cheesy nonsense that Alien could have been had not Ridley Scott and his team got their hands on Dan O'Bannon's original script.<br/><br/>A backward step in all areas of film making.<br/><br/>A sorry and shoddy end end to a great film franchise.<br/><br/>One to miss of you love great films and the Alien legend."

","No questions asked this is the best movie I have ever seen. If you are sitting reading this right now, I recommend that you get out of your seat and go see it right now! Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder have great talent and chemistry in this movie. This is my personal favorite in the Alien Quadrilogy because you have feeling towards all of the characters. I am not familiar with Jean-Pierre Jeunet (the director) but he is clearly very skilled as a director. The scenes and landscapes are amazing in this film. And what would this movie be without...

"bullions27","1","4","8","13 November 2000"," A sorry ending
","I never liked Joss Whedon and this movie is another example as to why. First off I can not treat this movie as it's own. The series brought us a powerful and memorable heroine and a frightening and memorable villain. You can't separate the films apart. They are forever linked with those characters and thus they are to be scrutinized in comparison between them. Saying that I am sorry Alien Ressurection was made. <br/><br/>What made Ripley who she is in the Alien series? Obviously Whedon had no clue whatsoever and went ahead to change her character into this blasphemous Terminator-like hero. I for one didn't like this change. It's because she is human, succumbed to emotions, and most of all AFRAID of the unexpected and the horrific nightmares these creatures wrought upon her that made Ripley... Ripley. Turning her into an Alien is a novelty, and I suppose what they were trying to accomplish was an ironic and cruel twist of fate tossed to her. The thing that has haunted her for so long she becomes. Unfortunately, the performance wasn't convincing and we end up hating this new persona. Blame it on the script.<br/><br/>Visually this fourth installment is pretty much what we have been experiencing over and over again with the series. Again, they try to reproduce that claustrophobic experience Aliens gave us with the tight corridors, the running out of time factor, etc. Some of the humor in the movie was unnecessary and bland. The General saluting after destroying an alien, then gets killed by one but not before going through a few gestures which screams comedy, was insulting to the series. I will never understand european humor.<br/><br/>Anytime you're given a franchise, you'll love to excercise all possible storylines. Since it's already had it's success, you have a greater margin for error. What Whedon gave us is a plot thin as a wet tissue, and full of holes to see through. There was little explaining of anything, which could be a good thing. A script this messy how much more can it get if you let them explain it. What plot was there, was for the aliens to be shot at, destroyed, a character dies in between, and more aliens die. It's getting old, and so is this series. Thumbs down."

","I would have liked to see a much simpler plot about General Perez overseeing a clandestine scientific research operation that was buying cryo-tubes from pirates to use as hosts in an attempt to create alien/human hybrids. Something new could have even been done with the hybrids, since there were already three movies featuring xenomorphs. That would have required some imagination, however, and none was to be found in this disaster. What we got was a plot hopelessly gummed up with dumb and unnecessary scenes and characters.<br/><br/>The acting was almost categorically bad. Sigourney Weaver walks around like a zombie the entire movie, and really isn't even playing the character Ripley. Her character was an unnecessary distraction, and should have been left out. Winona Ryder was awful, and her character was clearly ""written in"" for the sole purpose of featuring her in the movie. Gary Dourdand, also terrible. Granted, the dialog they had to work with is among the worst I've seen in any movie, and I've seen some bad ones. There were a few decent scenes early on with Dan Hedaya, Ron Perlman, and Michael Wincott, but the is was clearly a Kobayashi Maru.<br/><br/>I'd recommend that people avoid this stinker, and I'm not sure how on earth it even has a 6 star rating. This is MST3K material."

","Alien 3 is a mess, but it's nothing compared to the abomination that is Alien: Resurrection. One wouldn't be wrong by saying that there isn't one good thing to say about this film. Sure, everything isn't horrible, but just about 95 percent of it is. Last time I checked, that's not a good percentage.<br/><br/>Resurrection is a shell of the films that made this series great in the first place. To start, the film's tone is all over the place. It feels like the script wants the film to take a lighter direction but the direction does exactly the opposite. You have characters that don't feel like real human beings and always seem to overact to the conflict, why the conflict itself is overtly gory and grotesque, just for the sake of being gory and grotesque. I'm still not sure what audience this film was trying to appeal to. It's neither a scary thriller like the first film nor an exciting action film like Aliens. But that's not for lack of trying.<br/><br/>Who thought it would be a good idea to have Ripley come back as an uncomfortably sexualized version of herself without any explanation as to why she was cloned in the first place? After the semi-heroic act at the end of Alien 3, there's absolutely no need to go back and recycle the same characters. And really, what was the point of bringing back Ripley if she wasn't even going to have the qualities we love about Weaver's portrayal. This does way more to hurt Ripley's legacy than it does to amplify it.<br/><br/>Written by Joss Whedon and directed by the guy who made Amelie makes this film more puzzling than its predecessor. We know there were severe behind the scenes issues with Fincher's Alien 3, but who could have possibly greenlit Resurrection? There's nothing redeemable about this film. And I mean nothing. Great actors and actresses like Ron Perlman and Winona Ryder give less than stellar performances (and that's generous). Even Weaver, who has always been the light of this franchise was just passable as Ripley. Heck, the Xenomorphs themselves were pathetic. The special effects looked off, they were kept up in cages for most of the film, and the hybrid alien at the end? My god it was all-time awful.<br/><br/>-Tone is all over the place<br/><br/>-Script and direction take the film to separate places<br/><br/>-Performances<br/><br/>2.9/10"
"Quinoa1984","7","2","3","11 August 2009"," Ripley's Believe it or Not
","One wouldn't think of pairing Jean-Pierre Jeunet, a half of the directing team responsible (in the 90's) for the very good Delicatessen and visual masterwork City of Lost Children, and Joss Whedon, a comedy writer fresh off an Oscar nomination for Toy Story (yes, there was a time) and just about to start Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But here they are, taking the franchise that started with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) into another direction. It's one that's very promising, and in a very ""sci-fi""-like approach: 200 years in the future, the little remains left of Ripley after the end of Alien3 (you know, the one where she, uh, throws herself into the fire), is taken by evil corporation guys who clone her after several tries and extract from her the alien being still inside her to make, what do you think, MORE aliens to, you know, get them to do tricks and cure diseases and things like that. I smile just writing it.<br/><br/>Of course, almost immediately, the aliens break out of their hermetically sealed cages (oddly enough through slaughtering one of their own for the benefit of its acid blood), and wreak havoc, once again, on a vessel carrying Ripley and a motley crew of bandits on a ship called ""Betty"", who were originally hired to get some extra clones to the military dumb-asses. After this, along with some of those juicy scenes of tough-but-funny dialog, Whedon kicks off a series of action set pieces that leads up to a revelation that is... not entirely satisfying. But it's got characters that, as unsavory (Ron Perlman) and strange (the clone-dude from City of Lost Children) as they are, we care about for the same reason we did in Alien and Aliens; they can take care of themselves pretty well, but only so far as in the midst of a dozen aliens - that have already hatched, of course.<br/><br/>Sure, the tropes of the series are well worn by now, and perhaps Whedon and the producers knew this too. That is some of the fun of it, though its familiarity keeps it from being completely fresh (i.e. another ""a-hole"" robot on board, you might guess who based on star ranking, traitor on the ship) and there's a couple of things the characters do that seem a little stupid, or rather stupider than one would think to be done by either the director or writer (i.e. bringing along the guy infected by the alien egg), its the re-fresh part that makes it worthwhile. It's visually got the same kind of knock-em-off-your-feet flair that Jeunet made his name on at the time, particularly with an underwater sequence and just the way his camera can VROOM (not zoom) in on a character's face or a moment of action. And the storytelling, however old-hat in parts, tries for some clever things and even tries to lighten it up, ironically, with sarcastic touches and even campiness. Not to mention the actors all having a fun time, even if they don't show it a whole lot (Weaver especially rises up her flat Ripley into something cunning and sarcastic) <br/><br/>At the same time, there's a few glaring things keeping it from real greatness. Aside from the conventions that in previous times Ridley Scott subverted as opposed to just taking along and charging up with adrenaline and ultra-violence, there's the factor of the ""human-alien"" hybrid. Its design isn't that bad, but what it does is never really made too clear. How much does its human side end up affecting the alien part? Is it cause its a baby, or has it grown super-fast? And before we can have some time with this creation that has some interest even in its silly dimensions (ever seen an alien 'lick' someone with its tongue, don't think so), it's given one of the most needlessly gory death scenes I've seen in recent memory. I find it hard to believe it was originally planned for the first Alien movie, but even as such its presentation here from Jeunet is just mind-bogglingly over the top, and not in a funny way. Up until this point I had been with the movie, more or less (mostly more), as a work of commercial Hollywood art. And then it had to go into pricey-goofy Troma-vision. 7.5/10"

","Believe it or not, it works and he did a wonderful job. You can even see some of his trademark french humor and quirky style and he does so without sacrificing the surprises and horrific moments. However, it's not as scary and tense as the first film, not as thrilling and action-packed as the second but way better in every way than the boring and confusing third. Alien Resurrection was lots of fun to watch. I thought the creatures looked pretty darn good and we see more of them than in any other Alien movie (don't know about Aliens VS Predators though). The ""Ripley"" in this one was fascinating to me and Sigourney Weaver is to be commended for her performance. I also enjoyed most of the secondary characters who were quite well characterized. Although you'll get the good old infamous scenes (like the chestbursters), I liked the few new concepts introduced here, which I cannot reveal for fear of spoilers.

And they've got a good supporting cast of Ron Perlman, Winona Ryder (in a somewhat unusual role), Dan Hedaya and others.<br/><br/>Although the film follows a storyline that somehow resembles 'Alien', which is good since Alien 3's complex story was a reason of its failure, 'Resurrection' remained a mediocre film mostly due to lack of twists in the plot and cheesy dialogues. The story is too much linear and the only plot twist involving the character Call was not directly related to the story. Yet the whole alien/human hybrid concept was entertaining enough and the bits of action were made well enough to watch.

This one never succeeds in doing that. Character development and slowly building scenes are traded and sacrificed for action and gore. Besides, whole thing feels very sinister and occult. It's no secret that Alien movies have something to do with eugenics (in a particular sense of creating a perfect race) which is clearly visible in this movie and Alien Covenant. While I have no problem with that topic in Alien context, I think they went a little too far with it and with sexuality in Resurrection.<br/><br/>Concerning character development, it's done poorly compared to previous Alien movies. First three films were somehow able to develop characters without using too much words instead concentrating on movements, face expressions and similar.

","Like every continuation of a series, ""Alien:Resurrection"" has the instincts of a child who has a fit after their parents took their favourite toy away. The sketchy, slimy alien creatures and the dark, claustrophobic scenarios are curiously provocative. However, the story fails to deliver even through its hardest effort in adding a new twist in the franchise. The film itself had the right material for newly inventive ways to make the series fresh, but it never tugs at your emotions and the impact falls flatter then diluted soda. In fact I was surprised more at just how fuzzy Dan Hedaya is and he's not the main attraction here. Sure fans of the series had came into the theatres in drones and it did do quite well at the box office, but it was highly doubtful if its welcome was long termed.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is back for the fourth time returning from the dead after 200 years as a hybrid human/alien Ellen Ripley and she's still just as tough as ever battling those slimy aliens as she's been doing since 1979. It's no surprise that Weaver is in her comfort zone and still looks buff and sexy and boss for a person who's by now in her late 40's. And when she did that back basketball shot, I think she's the only person who could get away with doing that.<br/><br/>As the franchise continues, the alien creatures continue to get more awkward each time. But the looks still have some originality each time and in this movie the aliens depicted here stand out above the rest. The inspiration for the alien creation comes from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet who got the horrific physicality of the creatures from his previous outings ""Delicatessen"" and the always inviting ""The City of Lost Children"".<br/><br/>The horrific characteristics of the film blends nicely to the dark settings, the heavy metal and the disgusting manifestations coming out of the creature's vials along with an exciting underwater scene along with the fear and the loss of humanity are just some of the spectacular traits from Jeunet's warped mind. Plus he brought his favourite actors Ron Perlman as a heavy-hitting antagonist and Dominique Pinon for some much needed comedy relief.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder was a nice new added attraction to the series as an engineer aboard the spaceship Auriga the centrepiece to where all the fun takes place. Unfortunately 12 sniveling aliens are heading to Earth, planning to conduct evil biological experiments to the civilians.<br/><br/>Ryder arrives on the scene with a ragtag group of smugglers seems out of place with the kind of cynical, barbaric individuals that make up the population in this franchise. Her chocolate brown eyes and her deadpan dramatic expressions has that token bright light for what has been a dark and dreary journey so far. Finally we can say this movie has a character with a small dosage of humanity.<br/><br/>Mean is the focal characteristic in this film and the violence renders no apologies about it. We are treated to a delightful opening scene where we get an up close look at some performing open-chest surgery with barf-inducing detail with Brad Dourif as the mad doctor. The final result is that Ripley has given birth to a bouncy baby alien. You don't see that everyday that's for sure.<br/><br/>Like every splatter fest in movies the aliens dine on delicious cuisines like guts, severed heads, and yummy brains. We also get insightful information about predatory subjects very few people talk about like predatory alien sex. Yeah ""viewer discretion advised"" makes its mark here.<br/><br/>Granted the film does have creative vibes going for it, so there's no need to go through plot details no matter how narrow it is. The thick of it all is that this film depends too much on the visuals and not much emphasis is based on the story.<br/><br/>We get fragments of a story that Ripley returned from the dead after two hundred years and her alien child has come back as well and she's on the hunt to slay these hideous evil creatures. The aliens are still the same gross, slimy creatures we all seen before, only now they're populating.<br/><br/>In the span of five years since the last ""Alien"" film back in 1992, the special effects have truly come a long way. The transformation from archaic puppetry to the more advanced use of CGI has created a new, but not entirely for the better way of upgrading the franchise. Plus these new batch of aliens possess a more humanoid look to them and can display emotions. It's something to think about here."
"PredragReviews","6","1","1","4 July 2016"," The Good, the bad and the ugly.
","Every Alien installment has had a new director at the helm, also bringing about a new style for the series. While Ridley Scott made a more claustrophobic sci-fi horror, James Cameron went all out and made a big combat movie and David Fincher made a more bleaker film which looked better and more ""arty"". After that film's failure, people thought the series was doomed and wrote it off until a 4th Alien film was announced with Jean-Pierre Jeunet at the helm, director of Delicatessen, City of Lost Children and the later film Amelie. So is it good? Heh... nope. Is there any redeeming quality to it at all? Well let's just say this: you know the film's in trouble when you actually have to think what was good about it.<br/><br/>The story... Ripley's blood/DNA, taken from the hospital ward of the prison colony, is used to create a clone of her former self. Aboard a military science vessel, where now the Alien species are being bred by some deranged scientists, a group of smugglers are hired to provide ""bodies"" for these disturbing actions. Sigourney Weaver is haunting and rather creepy as this new Ripley who has Alien DNA and a ""relationship"" with the creatures. Winona Ryder is Call, a renegade and obsolete android who's a recent addition of the space pirates, that get more than they bargained for on this delivery. Fittingly Ripley and Call show the most human character despite their strange background. Most of the other characters are nothing more than bait for the Aliens. Dominique Pinon as the crippled pirate is an exception. Being there are few surprises, this film works better as a Sci-fi/horror adventure film. The story itself is worthy and interesting but underdeveloped. Too much time is spent on the gory attacks. There are too many unnecessary characters as well.<br/><br/>The action in this movie wasn't even slightly believable, starting with the shootout between the criminals and the soldiers aboard the ship. At very short range, every soldier is killed and not a single criminal even wounded. Ripley escaped from certain doom on several occasions - I never felt as if she was in any peril at all. Then the action kept coming to a dead stop just when things were getting interesting. For instance, when everyone is in a huge hurry to get off the ship, Ripley decides to stop and wipe out a room full of failed clones. Truly one of those ""Aw, you gotta be kidding me"" moments. The set design and the look of the film though was starting to get better, relying on dim corridors and small lighting, much like the first film. And an action scene involving an underwater set is quite thrilling and the aliens certainly never looked better. But ultimately these are kind of superficial since a great scary experience like Alien or a blast like Aliens is sorely missing here. Overall, this movie is not a worthy sequel to the other films. Even Alien 3 was much better than this - it had loads of atmosphere, characters that one cared about, and you actually felt as if they were in extreme danger.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 6 out of 10."

","I think this film just had the bad luck of being made a few years too early. I think the biggest draw back to this film was the use of CG which was still very much in its infancy. When you look at the story, and the writing this film is right up there with the rest of the films and seeing how the Alien DNA changes to creating something totally different actually gives a bit nod to the eventual Prometheus movie. On a different subject... Giger... I think this director captured Giger's true vision for how these creatures act... its a slightly erotic form of extraterrestrial violence that Giger illustrated in a large number of his works. And come on... Ron Perlman was f-ing amazing in this film. In the end I must urge you all to look at this film in context of all the films trying to use CG at the time. It wasn't quite ready for the big screen on the level that Jean-Pierre Jeunet was really hoping for. When you are able to cut this movie a little slack for not living up to 2010's special effects standards you'll be able to concentrate on the great story, the great directing, and the great characters."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Alien: Resurrection"" (1997) is kind of cool movie if you feel nostalgia to previous ""Alien"" / ""Aliens"" movies. It's far from being at least partly good as those two, but it's a descent ""Alien"" movie on it's own, on the same level as ""Alien3"", which was OK. It has some style, some interesting shoots from visual point, it has OK acting, so this movie is just OK for spending one evening with, but don't expect to be so engaged in story and movie itself to come back to it for repeat viewings. Unfortunately ""Alien: Resurrection"" doesn't have the suspense the first two had because of characters – they are not so sharply written so you could really care for them the way you did for characters in ""Aliens"". The situations they encounter are menacing, well shoot, but again, the characters that you could care is what missing in those scenes – and what a great action sequence underwater – simply the best in whole movie.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Alien: Resurrection"" is not bad movie at all, it has cool visuals, OK acting, some great action sequences and Aliens themselves! What is missing is better characters, and more human Ripley – and didn't care for her in this movie at all which is strange when I consider her one off my favorite movie characters in the history."

","In an interview Ridley Scott cited the old Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant comics as one of many inspirations for Alien. Of all the films, the one that most resembles Heavy Metal is Jean-Pierre Jeunet's demented, over-the-top, but not unentertaining fourth entry.<br/><br/>This is another entry that uh...alienated fans, and it certainly doesn't have any of the atmosphere or suspense of even Alien 3. Visually, it's quite uneven. Production design is impressive, effects not always so - even in 1997. Gore is ramped up to 11. Indeed we see far more blood and guts in this one than all the others put together. A number of critics had issues with the humour on display, but I personally found this refreshing. It was interesting to see a more lighthearted display in an Alien segment after the deadly seriousness of the first three.<br/><br/>Where it most delivers is in Sigourney, excellent again, this time as a superhuman part-alien clone of Ripley, and in the frantic moments when the characters are facing off against the aliens. The monsters are menacing as always, and this time they're not above sacrificing one of their own for their own benefit. A brand new member to the Alien family, while perhaps not as scary as intended, provides some good moments at the climax.<br/><br/>While suffering in comparison to it's predecessors, on it's own terms it makes for good, gruesome, comic-book-style mayhem."

","After Alien 3 took the scares, fun and grotesque visuals out of the franchise Alien: Resurrection brings it all back with a big goopy splat. I really enjoyed what they did with the visuals and the story, turning it into a comic book sci-fi freak show. Unfortunately, Ripley's character takes a peculiar turn. Sigourney Weaver gave great performances in the previous installments, but I never fully understood what they were going for with her character this time around. The film also stumbles in it's final act, revealing a new breed of alien that is more laughable than scary.

"peter-bruck","7","1","1","5 July 2012"," Resurrected by Whedon
","While the first three installments were dark space creature tales stripped of all hope and mercy ""Alien: Resurrection"" changes the tone significantly. The fourth time around what we get is a sci fi actioner, a fun ride through space with aliens as a mere gimmick. Die hard alien heads might be unforgiving - and with good reason. If you don't care for the franchise but love yourself a gory laugh, you're in for a face hugging, chest bursting treat.<br/><br/>The atmosphere has changed and here is why: The Ripley of A4 is not the Ripley we once knew - for the simple fact that she's dead. Weaver is actually playing Ripley's clone number 8, a clone with a xenomorphic vengeance. Her blood is acid, her powers are strong. Aliens won't touch her as they consider Ripley as one of them. So... where's the suspense when we needn't worry about the heroine? Clone number 8 doesn't worry about itself very much either. Instead of a deadly serious, protective female what we get is a cynical, indifferent thing with super powers. That's fun to watch, but is it frighting? Is it breath taking? Is it menacing? Nah...<br/><br/>And then there's Dan Hedaya playing the boss of the space ship and the comic relief. But what it is he comically relieves us from is beyond me. His overacting is totally out of line and makes no sense, not even in Whedon's Alien universe. Good thing he's killed of quite soon.<br/><br/>Then we're manipulated in falling for Winona's character. Don't. Not worth it.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman and Leland Orser are mixing it up a little.<br/><br/>But there was no moment I wasn't somehow entertained.

","I gave this movie a 9 because it is honestly my favorite Alien movie to watch and I don't think 6.2 is nearly high enough rating. I think most of the other reviewers are being movie snobs and perhaps were hoping this movie was more like the original. Now don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the original Alien, but I think some people are giving that movie too much credit. Sure it was an amazing and quite original movie, but that was in 1979. People were more dazzled by anticipation and suspense. Watching it now, there are some parts that I think are a little, dry, long, and boring. People complain about Resurrection's lack of character development compared to the original but I don't really see the characters in the original having noticeably wondrous depth as people seem to imply. I think both movies show people having as much complexity as reasonable and necessary in their circumstances. I really enjoyed Ripley in this film as she was bizarre, quirky and kick ass. Other than that I'll say that this movie is the most fun of the series. It's full of action, humor, a bit of horror,many interesting elements some suspense, and a lot bad-assedness. Also i recommend watching the special edition as it has some extra scenes that add more explanation and ""depth"" to the film."
"The-Sarkologist","9","1","1","23 September 2011"," The fourth movie - does she get home now?
","After a very disappointing Alien III, the forth offering to the Alien saga, by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, promised to bring redemption. Could an alien movie supersede Cameron's Aliens? Well, in my opinion, no. Resurrection began having a lot of promise, and held on to this all the way through the movie with excellent characters, but it was at the end that it all fell apart. This was to do with a problem with the storyline, but I will explain a little before going into how the plot falls apart. The movie is set two hundred years after Ripley (Sigorney Weaver) died aboard a military medical research ship. The movie does follow along the alien tradition with having a small group of people aboard an enclosed space so the aliens cannot escape a wreck havok across the universe. The aliens are supposedly all destroyed, but they have managed to get hold of some of Ripley's blood and from this they managed to clone her. Later in the movie it is revealed that this is not the only clone of her made but this is the first functional one. They remove the queen from Ripley and then help it grow. We slowly come to find that the cloning process has not worked entirely, Ripley has inherited the alien's aggressive nature, and also seems to be able to sense them. The scientists then get the alien eggs (which we assume the queen laid) and cause them to open in front of some human captives, originally prisoners but captured by space pirates employed by the military. This is not the only place where the eggs have been laid, for we discover later that the eggs were laid as an ambush on the route back to the ship, the Betty. Now, as Ripley had inherited things from the alien, the alien inherited something from Ripley; the movie says that it was the womb and we watch the queen give birth to a half-human/half-alien hybrid. This causes problems with the plot because I do not know where the eggs came from. This research facility was conducting highly illegal experiments, that is trying to create the aliens to use for humanity. What we see is that what used to be a natural monster has now blurred with what humanity created. The monster is no longer from outside, it has now become us. The original alien movie put the monster inside of us so that we would feel defenceless against it, now Resurrection has made us the monster because what we are watching is what we have created. The final alien reacts in a very interesting way. It hates humans and kills all in sight, but it does not harm the synthetic nor does it harm Ripley. Ripley feels compassion when she watches it die, and the creature calls out to Ripley to save it. We can almost feel the regret in Ripley's heart when it speaks her name. No longer is this alien horrible, but what it has shown us is that beyond all the horror there is a human heart inside (or liver or stomach, depending on the culture you are from). This makes us realise that even the most horrid person we know is capable of love. The plot discrepancy destroyed the movie for me, but compared to Alien III, this was far better."

I can see why people despise this movie. The beginning of the movie is very slow. But from the halfway point, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Ripley returns two hundred years later as a clone...and an alien inside her. Along with a group of mercenaries, Ripley has to save the day again.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. I enjoyed another great performance by Signourey Weaver.

"dgefuller","6","1","1","8 November 2010"," It's not Alien 4, it's a new beginning
","I've always been surprised as to how much negativity Alien Resurrection has generated. Like its direct predecessor, it is a much maligned piece of cinema. Unlike Alien3, however, Resurrection doesn't descend further into the harrowing nightmare that ended with Ripley's death; it completely shifts the paradigms of the series.<br/><br/>You could easily view this film as something apart from the previous three. It doesn't even have Ripley in it, not really- it's a clone (one of eight), and Sigourney Weaver doesn't play her like she's Ripley, either. Undeniably, they look similar these two protagonists, but that is pretty much the only link. Other than the blood-thirsty aliens stalking the corridors of a military space station- which itself finally delivers on the idea of what might happen should 'The Company' (or at least 'a company' since Weyland-Yutani are no more 250 years into the future) get hold of alien DNA and mess about with it. It raises some really interesting ideas about the nature of the creature itself (how, exactly, do you clone a parasite from the host's blood sample? That's a sci-fi concept waiting to be explored), not to mention their more 'human' aspects (problem solving intelligence, for one, an implied sexual interest in their genetic grandmother- Ripley 8) making for some pretty nasty monsters.<br/><br/>That's the bad point really though, because ever since James Cameron took a load of machine guns to a colony of xenomorphs in 1986, they've lost the menace the creature had in the 1979 original. They are just teeth and claws to be dispatched, and perhaps it's intentional with regard to these aliens being a little bit human, but they look far too organic (they even seemed to have developed goat legs, which doesn't make such sense, but perhaps it's for artistic flare, and the creatures do look very good, just not as good as they used to).<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection really isn't business as usual, but then every film in the series has been different, so why not have a European black comedy thrown in, too? Personally, I love Jeunet's touch; despite his language barriers at the time, he injects great humour into the proceedings, without ridiculing the hallowed science fiction saga, and that is thanks to Joss Wedon's script. He's been incredibly vocal about his disappointment with the project, but Jeunet's visual style lends itself incredibly well to science fiction, creating a grubby, dystopian future an age away from the clean white space station of Aliens and a darn sight more believable. If man as a species takes to the stars, the universe will be filthy, and that is on display here in abundance.<br/><br/>There are some fantastic set pieces(although the underwater sequence's CGI has dated in the last 13 years), and a brave attempt at taking the series in a new and frightening direction with the love it/hate it (mostly people seem to hate it) Newborn creature, born directly from the (sadly under-used) Queen's womb inherited from the genetic crossover (so when do we get to see Ripley laying eggs?).<br/><br/>Like Alien3 before it, it takes up the reigns from an ending nobody really knows how to develop the series from. Sure, it would have been nice that Hicks and Newt made it. And sure, it might have been nice if Ripley hadn't died- but this series has been taking risks since the beginning. Captain Dallas should have been the hero way back in 1979, but he buys it halfway in. Ridley Scott pulls a Psycho on us, and we love it. Every time anyone else tries anything against the grain in this franchise, it's been met with disdain. The most popular entry into the series (Aliens) is the least subversive, all guns and war and even a happy ending. It's a masterclass in scifi action, sure, but I think Alien Resurrection is probably the bravest film of the four. It sort of writes itself into a hole at the end, but we've been there before with this series. I'd like to know what could happen next.<br/><br/>Bizarre, grotesque, frightening and equal parts hilarious, beautiful and bold, Alien Resurrection is a film that has been brutalised by fans and critics alike; even by those who made it. It takes risks, and the result is a subversive and entertaining b-move schlock-fest with European sensibilities and an incredible visual flare (like Fincher, it doesn't matter how much a studio suppresses the choices of Jeunet, his style is too powerful to be completely oppressed).<br/><br/>Alien was horror. Aliens was action. Alien3 was foreboding drama. Alien Resurrection is outlandish, kinetic and occasionally insane science fiction. You should give it another chance. But I still don't know why the aliens are brown in this one."
"DrLex","7","1","1","6 November 2010"," Entertaining but mostly forgettable
","I just finished watching the entire Alien saga from the first to the last film, and this is the run-down: Alien: 10; Aliens: 10; Alien³: 7; Alien Resurrection: 7.<br/><br/>Alien is a horror movie that introduces the ingenious concept of the alien species and then ramps up the terror right until the final scene. I almost forgot how scared I could get from watching a film, but re-watching Alien reminded me how un-scary most recent 'horror' films are.<br/><br/>Aliens also has horror, but focuses on action. It also ramps up this action steadily in such a brilliant way that every second of the film is thrilling. Watching Aliens again was just as thrilling as the first time. Films that can do that are rare, and certainly worth a score of 10.<br/><br/>Alien³ is a mess. It's way too obvious that there have been problems with the script and the directors, and the fact that they obviously got rid of most of the characters that survived from Aliens is jarring, but in the end Alien³ is not awful. It has a unique atmosphere and some memorable scenes. One of the biggest problems is that it has almost no characters to care about except Ripley. The only other interesting character is abruptly killed half-way the film.<br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection is also a mess but in a different way. Of course, the whole 'resurrection' concept is ridiculous but I could forgive the writers because there was no other way to continue the saga with Ripley included. What struck me the most is how little I remembered from A:R, even though my previous viewing was more recent than the other films. In fact, it has about three or maybe four memorable scenes and about two memorable characters. The rest is forgettable, albeit still entertaining.<br/><br/>While Alien³ still had some thrilling scenes, A:R relies mostly on gore in an attempt to be scary. Because all 'horror' films from the last decade followed this trend, I got used to seeing CGI monsters, horribly deformed mutants and people being ripped to shreds in all details. The original Alien is still scary because so little is shown and so much is implied. Seeing a dark corridor and knowing there's something horrible in there without actually seeing it, never gets old. Seeing a monster again and again, no matter how meticulously crafted it is to look hideous, does get old.<br/><br/>Overall, the last two films are OK and good enough to keep the Alien fan in me entertained, but you won't hear me protest at all if a director steps up and makes a *real* sequel to Aliens without even acknowledging the existence of A³ or A:R."

","Ripley is cloned and brought back. She wasn't alone though, they also brought back the alien that was inside her. With a crew bringing some cargo on board the same ship these alien experiments go awry and the aliens escape. All that is left is Ripley and the crew of the Betty. <br/><br/>The reason why I think this film gets so much hate is because it seems to cheapen the ending to Alien 3, which was the best thing about that film. It ended her legacy and the story in the franchise and now comes a fourth film that many thought was a cash cow waiting to be milked. Alien: Resurrection has some interesting ideas, but the execution of the film as a whole just seems like a misfire. <br/><br/>The first had terror, the second had action the third had the ending, the only way to end the series. What does this one have? Again, the cash cow thing comes to mind. The producers thought if they got geek writer Joss Whedon and French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, they could fool the audience. It would seem that two rights can't make a wrong. Joss Whedon's original script was obviously changed, but in interviews he said that his final draft is what is seen on the screen. So what's the problem? The execution apparently. While Whedon went for a tongue in cheek aspect, Jeunet went down the straight and narrow and made the film serious. So I guess two rights can make a wrong. <br/><br/>The characters are interesting and the actors portraying them I thought was the best thing about the film. Ron Perlman and Gary Dourdan are the two stand outs in my opinion. Weaver isn't the same Ripley we once knew and loved. She is different. Part alien, she acts like one in the film. Again, it was an interesting idea, but I found myself liking her less and less. Not as much as I hated Ryder though, she was irritating and boring. <br/><br/>The film is looked upon as the worst one. Or the one that could be tossed up between Alien 3 as the worst. It's no bag of dirt. It's watchable, a lot better than the last two alien films we got. The problem was there was no emotion, specifically for a character who was different than what we knew. The script was written one way and the direction went in another. Neither was right or wrong, but together it doesn't work that well. The underwater sequence is great though, definitely the stand out scene among a bunch of boring running down corridors bits. <br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection has no sense of danger or terror. All three previous films had this in abundance. The story tried it's best to bring back the character of Ripley, but we got a shallow clone. The human/alien hybrid wasn't scary, it looked like less of a threat than the normal aliens. The climax was non-existent and should have taken place on Earth, it would have added a bit more urgency. The film looks great though. Cheers."

","Alien Resurrection brings back the action of Aliens and combines it with the grimy goriness of Alien 3 to provide a film that is creepy and entertaining at the same time. The film's strength involve a number of interesting ways to reinvent the Aliens and a memorable cast of actors.<br/><br/>The film really seems to bring the Alien-franchise's more sensual aspects to life with the resurrected Ripley. The film also has many great confrontations with the Aliens and the final act of the film provides one of the strangest and most rewarding finishes of any of the Alien films.<br/><br/>The film's only real weakness is that it doesn't quite match the emotional conviction of Aliens and the story is more of a wrap up then a stand-alone chapter.

Once I saw the first and second I of course realized that they were much better and in fact are probably two of the best sci-fi movies i've ever seen, however I think this movie takes a lot of undue heat because these people are constantly comparing it to the first two movies. Pretty much any sci-fi movie that you compare to the first two movies will look bad and understandably if you are hoping it will be as good as the first two you will be let down. As a stand alone move it obviously doesn't warrant a 10 but people give it such a bad rep that i think it scares a lot of people from even giving it a chance, its really not that bad. I think it deserves a 7/10 but i'll vote it a 8/10 only to bring up the rating a bit."

","200 years after Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) killed herself in order to save mankind from the queen alien that was growing inside her, scientists have brought her back - as a clone, and also cloned the alien inside her. They extract the alien and keep it safe, and Ripley wakes up with superior knowledge as to what has happened to her, and an uncanny ability - her blood is acidic, as is the alien's blood.<br/><br/>A gang of roughs including Call (Winona Ryder) arrive on the ship to assist in an illegal transaction for the alien, when the alien (and some of her offspring) escape. Now Ripley must once again battle the aliens that already took her life once.<br/><br/>Sure, it's not even close to being as good as ""Alien"" or ""Aliens,"" but when you stack it up against the recent ""AvP"" series, it looks like cinematic genius. Weaver rocked it once again as Ripley, and it's really not a true ""Alien"" movie without her."
"FlorisV","7","1","1","5 July 2008"," Disappointing despite creative effort
","The action scenes are well thought out and there's plenty of gore. But it lacks character and suspense, it gets kind of formulaic.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon has written plenty of good scripts for both movies, TV shows as well as comics and this is definitely not his worst. It's a bit more creative than it's predecessor Alien 3, but the characters have less depth. The film is also more uneven, switching from action flick to surreal and gross splatter film, the wisecracks getting in the way of real suspense.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder does her part but it's not as memorable as Lance Henriksen's. Her character as well as some others were more grotesque than engaging. Also I don't find this Sigourney Weaver's best performance, while it was refreshing for herself, playing an alien-human clone, she wasn't as likable because she seemed to care less about the fate of humankind. Like in Alien3, the problem was again that you can't really care much about any of the characters. And too many of them make it out alive this time.<br/><br/>It was missing the human element as well and that was one thing Alien3 did better as well as the classic ones, Alien and Aliens.<br/><br/>Still, plenty of entertainment and not boring for a moment. An OK 7 out of 10."
"timesplitterz","7","1","1","14 June 2008"," Easily one of the weakest films in the Alien serious but that doesn't mean its bad film
","With this film I think Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (like all the other directors of previous Alien films) wasn't trying to create a film to match Alien or Aliens just a fun splatter film. <br/><br/>it does introduce another new Alien to the universe with the Unborn Alien that many will question weather it is stupid or cleaver, either way Jean-Pierre Jeunet does give the universe something new instead of creating just another Alien action sci-fi horror film. <br/><br/>One thing I was against was the use of CGI in the film. I strongly feel that when creating an Alien film that you should never present the aliens in CGI it just takes the whole horror of the creature away and leaves us with something embarrassing. even in the new Alien verses Predator films the aliens don't frighten people anymore because the CGI takes away that realism. <br/><br/>Another new thing added to the ALIEN universe is that now the creatures can now swim underwater, being a STRONG lover of the Alien universe I still to this day find it hard to accept but then it was never discussed in any other film weather they could swim or not. <br/><br/>The plot also was JUST acceptable although it does ruin the strength of the plot in alien 3, the dramatic ending now doesn't feel so dramatic because we now know she'll be cloned. <br/><br/>However if your looking for a little sci-fi horror to wet your appetite or you if your a big fan of the Alien serious and wish to dive into the fourth installment then Alien Resurrection will be your next film to watch."
"MaxBorg89","6","1","1","16 May 2007"," In space, no one can hear you scream...
","... in rage! Alien 3 was supposed to end the saga, but since they wanted to make more money, Fox decided to make another sequel. Only problem: how were they going to do it? As you may remember, David Fincher's underrated third installment ended with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) sacrificing herself to put an end to the alien threat for ever. As there can't be an Alien film without Weaver (and those who have seen Alien vs. Predator know it), something had to be done to bring her back convincingly. Hence Alien: Resurrection.<br/><br/>Taking place 200 years after the events of the third film, Resurrection solves the death issue in the most original way: cloning. That's right, the movie opens with a group of scientists finally succeeding, after seven disastrous attempts, in creating a perfect copy of Ripley. While the people involved in the experiment are thrilled, the crew of the Betty (a spaceship that stopped by for supplies) are not as excited. It does not take long to figure out why: the scientists' real purpose was to revive the Alien Queen that was inside Ripley at the time of her death, and use the offspring as biological weapons. And when the creatures start spreading terror and death, everyone realizes that maybe it wasn't such a good idea.<br/><br/>To be fair, the premise was not that bad: the idea of a cloned Ripley and the conspiracy regarding the aliens could have been awesome, if used correctly. Which is something neither writer Joss Whedon (who usually is a terrific storyteller, as Buffy and Angel prove) nor director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (yes, the same guy who did a masterwork like Amélie) know how to do. While the production design is superb and the special effects are generally good (with the exception of the hideous ""Newborn"" alien), the suspense and claustrophobia that made the first three movies unique are gone. What was meant to be a blend of sci-fi and horror is turned into a straight-out action flick, complete with loud guns, lame dialogue (maybe Whedon was suffering from writer's block in that period) and lousy characterizations: apart from Weaver, who does her usual job with finesse, and Ron Perlman, who plays a rude-yet-charismatic scumbag, no one is able to add something extra to a bunch of disposable, two-dimensional stereotypes, not even a clearly miscast Winona Ryder, who seems to have lost all the charm and intensity she had in the likes of Heathers and Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>Once again, the law of diminishing returns has been confirmed: aside from a few inspired moments early into the film, Alien: Resurrection is the most disappointing movie in the series. While Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher's contributions knew what they were aiming at and hit the target, Jeunet's franchise-closer doesn't even know where to aim.<br/><br/>5,5/10"
"vip_ebriega","7","1","1","20 February 2007"," The brainless, violent monster movie that it is.
","My Take: While not the best in the ALIEN saga, this fourth chapter brings along action-packed thrills fans found lacking in ALIEN 3. <br/><br/>(This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)<br/><br/>Fans consider ALIEN: RESURRECTION as a remedy after the doom-filled and much-maligned ALIEN 3. After all, after much of the pulp has already been juiced, it's only appropriate that this fourth ALIEN film declines to a mindless monster movie of the summer. Under those warrants, ALIEN: RESURRECTION gives you your end of the bargain. <br/><br/>""Alien: Resurrection"" is a good film. Lets not say excellent, but still a very good entry in the series. Sure, it does some things that should have ended in the previous chapter, but still makes up for it. The Ripley here is a clone, bred by scientists who plot to exploit and study the alien creatures. Okay, the film doesn't explain how they got Ripley, or the alien queen inside her (she supposedly burned in boiling lava in the previous chapter). But hey, those are somethings only sci-fi can answer. Anyway, the main attractions are those mean green mothers from outer space, slimier than ever. And then there's Weaver, returning to her competent, female Rambo, able to widen her characteristics when given the chance to make Ripley (or clone Ripley) a meaner and more complicated critter. <br/><br/>Overall, not the series' best, but it's definitely the best movie gross-out carnage and slimy monsters has got to offer. <br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."
"MrMuffinMan","5","1","1","5 July 2006"," Weakest storyline and script of the series, but good production values and cast
","I'll start by admitting that I wasn't really expecting a great deal from this movie, and so wasn't disappointed. <br/><br/>If you enjoy powerful, tight, quality scripting and cohesive story lines, and come at this without having seen the other three in the series, you'll probably wonder what the fuss is about, and agree with me that this feels just like a standard studio money making exercise, and that it would have been better going straight to video. I'm pretty sure it would have done so if it hadn't cost the studios so much to make and if the they were not certain that public was still desperate to see anything new from the Alien franchise store. That we will still spend hard earned dollars on this insipid stuff, is a tribute to the expectations raised by the first two films in the franchise.<br/><br/>**SPOILER** IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM YET, THIS CAN'T SPOIL THE FILM ANY MORE THAN THE SCRIPT WILL<br/><br/>Effects/Look and Feel <br/><br/>The look and feel of the film is generally very good, apart from the **""Son of Mummy Alien""** which is just very sad looking all round. CGI effects, stages and scenery are all pretty well carried off. I imagine a lot of the budget was spent in this department. This area has served all the Alien films pretty well, and no-one has dared screw this up badly (yet) in any of the films.<br/><br/>Cast <br/><br/>Great leading actors with a very high quality supporting cast, you definitely get the strong feeling they were all trying very hard to keep it all hanging together and make it work. I've no idea what they cost, but I've seen most of these actors turn in very decent performances in other films.<br/><br/>Script/direction <br/><br/>This is what I think lets the film down. The actors, costumes, staging and effects are all just so much better than the incredibly poor, vapid and soggy script. It feels like there had been a great idea and script, but then someone went and lost the real script and scriptwriter the night before filming, and then just pulled a 4th grader in to recreate the entire story again from a two line summary, scene by scene, as they were filming. Having thought about this some more, and reading through several other comments I realise that is a bit harsh. The director is great when able to work from scratch - his body of work proves that, with several really inventive and interesting films. The writer is not cut out for this kind of film at all, he's really best suited to the fairly lightweight TV style teen dramas, and does these well. I think the writer needed an entirely different take on this script, given audience (for that read ""Alien Fans"") expectations, with it played straight down the line. Doesn't mean there can't be some humour - but that should be from interplay between characters, and not from knowing wise-crack devices for the audience. Often through the film, you had the feeling the writer didn't expect his audience to really believe any of the story, and got bored at points, slotting in quite a few pretty hopeless throwaway lines. Fair enough, many writers just don't get or like the whole (too?)""serious"" sc-fi genre. But it does look like Mr Whedon was never very comfortable with this one. Still, that's not to say there isn't room for a full-on Alien send up in the ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" style.<br/><br/>Marks out of 10<br/><br/>I've given it a 4, as I think that is what I would have given if I'd not seen the first two films. If you make any comparison to the first two films and their decent scripts and direction, the mark must be 3. Almost embarrassingly cheesy in parts, but saved from the pit by the nice presentation and interesting cast.<br/><br/>The ""What Else Is On"" Test<br/><br/>If this is on, and there's nothing decent on any other channel, you'd probably stick with it until the very silly last 20 mins, when it gets annoyingly bad. <br/><br/>Buy It?<br/><br/>You'd have to be a hard core Alien fan to buy a film you'll never put on more than once."

","Two hundred years after her death Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is cloned for the Alien inside her by a rogue military faction. After the Alien is surgically removed the Ripley left is one of mixed species' strengths and seemingly divided species loyalty. When the Alien breeds and decimates the military space station, it is left to Ripley and a group of ""where the 'bleep' are the army guys?!"" mercenary smugglers stuck on the outpost to stop the Aliens from reaching Earth.<br/><br/>The standard Alien and space special effects are in play here (with one special ""birth"" near the end). The music has a tendency to get in the way of scenes instead of enhancing them. There's a nice mixed group of engaging characters in the smugglers (the lovers: Michael Wincott, Kim Flowers, the horny foul mouthed tough guy: Ron Perlman, the brainy soft hearted wheelchair bound guy: Dominique Pinon, the calm leader: Gary Dourdan, the one with a secret: Winona Ryder) and the obsessed to the point of arrogant blindness doctors (Brad Dourif, J.E.

""Waste of 'bleep' ammo...must be a chick thing,"" ""I'm not the mechanic here Ironsides, I just mostly hurt people!"") and Ron Perlman makes the most of it, turning in the performance most likely to be the first thing remembered about the film.<br/><br/>Favorite line: ""Earth?

Now if it was my choice I'd prefer it to end at number 3, as I'm sure you would all agree on.

She's cloned by the DNA that was left on Fiorina 161 at the time of her death. This time she more powerful as she has human and Alien DNA. Reason? Scientists used Ripley to get to the Alien Queen. For the scientists to continue their experiments they've brought in bait, not the bait you use on a fishing rod, they've brought in men for their templates, they probably had nothing else which could attract the facehugger.<br/><br/>6/10"

Ellen Ripley Clone #8 refers to Newt a few times, an alternate title sequence, a landing on earth and a few extra seconds here and there add to the mood making all the difference. <br/><br/>The down side though - some of the acting is too hammy, the Alien effects are computerised in parts which is just as distracting as they were back in 1997. They should have stuck to practical effects until CGI effects were perfected as the physical special effects are outstanding.<br/><br/>The New born is great and still gets my sympathy vote. The whole film isn't a gritty as the previous but the sets are fantastic. Some characters do get developed,there are some memorable moments which usually include Perlman or Weavers characters.<br/><br/>The film including the extra bits bridge the earlier films making Resurrection a more enjoyable ride for Alien fans but to date, despite some good scenes it is debatably the weakest of the series. <br/><br/>Watch and witness the resurrection."

","I just finished viewing Resurrection Special Edition from the quadrilogy boxed set.  I have to say that I quite enjoyed this installment, maybe more so than ""Aliens"".  The plot is great; it tends to be a bit cheesy at points, but those just lighten up the movie.  There are a few unpredictable twists, and you discover more and more disturbing things as you watch.  Ripley's character is as good as ever.  A solid sequel in my opinion, way better than Alien3, which I found kind of boring and generic in plot."

","My Rating: *** out of ****.<br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection may not hold a candle to Alien or Aliens, but hey its better than Alien 3. Its obvious that ideas in the Alien series are not too original anymore. It slightly borrows from Alien and really borrows from Aliens. However, Alien: Resurrection is entertaining.<br/><br/>The acting is particulary mixed. Sigourney Weaver is quite good here, but I have no idea why she has nail polish on. Winona Ryder is very stiff here, but I think she is miscast. There are only a couple of supporting characters that are likable at all and some arent used at all, they just fade into the background and get eaten by the monsters. Ron Pearlman is actually good, he makes his character likable for being such an asshole.<br/><br/>
Alien: Resurrection has some other problems, at times I thought it was kind of stupid and at other times I found it kind of thrilling. The special effects, particulary the ones with the Aliens, are kind of fake looking. The ones with the ship and the planet look quite real. The film also tended to be overvioelnt, but not as gratuitous as Alien 3. The script was also weak, but again not as weak as Alien 3.<br/><br/>The one thing I did like about this movie was the idea of a humanlike Alien. I loved the design of the creature. Many people found it disgusting but I thought it was the most original idea of the film. It was kind of weird how he got on the ship at the end but I thought that creature was a brilliant idea.<br/><br/>It may not be the best, especially compared to Alien and Aliens, but it is entertaining."
"CitizenCaine","6","1","1","14 September 2003"," Inferior to the first two in the series
","The fourth installment of the alien movies is like the third one: Clearly inferior to the first two in the series. It starts promisingly enough with Sigourney Weaver appearing as a clone of her original Ripley character. However, the movie unravels after the aliens escape as usual. As a result, the focus becomes merely another ""us vs. them"" plot in the second half of the movie. Interesting story elements are presented, but never expounded upon or completely discarded altogether. These include Ripley's superhuman/alien strength. What's the point of giving her that strength, if she rarely uses it? The ambiguity of Ripley's genetic make-up is never addressed satisfactorily either. Why do the space pirates really need her anyway? What's the real motivation for the conduction of the experiments to begin with? Giving Ripley more humanity than the fully human characters is literally a gross attempt to add melodrama to balance the action. If one were to read more into the movie, the ending could be interpreted as a metaphorical abortion of sorts. Winona Rider seems out of place in this movie also, and the full frontal nudity, or simulated nudity, of Sigourney Weaver might be cause to shield the eyes of younger audience members. There is some strong tension in here in certain scenes, most notably in a scene where two space pirates are ascending a ladder trying to escape. This movie is really an action movie masquerading as science fiction. As in most creature features, the more we see the aliens, the less we fear or are surprised by them. In this movie, the aliens can jump, swim, and give birth, no less! Perhaps, one of them could have written a better script. **1/2 of 4 stars."

","""Alien Resurrection"" is the fourth and final (to date) installment of the alien series starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This episode was directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.<br/><br/> The story takes place 200 years after ""Alien 3"". A military ship commanded by renegade General Perez (Dan Hedaya) has replaced ""The Company"" in trying to capture and ""tame"" the alien creatures. two doctors (J.E.

One of the crew is an advanced android, but who?<br/><br/> By now the alien creature has matured and multiplied and wouldn't you know it, escapes captivity and begins to wreak havoc.

"Cephyran","7","1","1","6 September 2003"," No more character...
","Of the four, this may be the poorest simply because of character. The body of the cast has very little development, but the big problem is Ripley. She's just not herself anymore - she doesn't have the same drive as she did in the first three. For Resurrection we return to the typical run for your life format. In This case, its the humans trying to get off the ship before they're all made into lunch or hosts. Aliens pop up all over the place, and we're granted some brief, bloody moments. My real appreciation lies in the CG aliens - this advantage, however briefly seen, allowed the aliens to be more insectoid, and saves a costume budget. Granted, there are bonuses to having a physical alien suit, but for sheer realism, an uncostumable physique works better for the aliens."

","Alien: Resurrection is the finest component of the series since the original.  The well-paced script by Joss Whedon (of Buffy fame) provides both humor and pathos.  Director Jeunet reproduces the visual genius of Delicatessin and City of Lost Children, aided by his veteran colleague, D.P. Darius Khondji, who washes the entire set with a metallic grey hue. Outstanding performances all around highlight the struggle between man and beast (as exemplified by the new, hybrid Ripley).  Watch for great animalistic portrayals by Sigourney Weaver and Ron Perlman and the Winona Ryder's ""mechanical"" characterisation.  Fans of Buffy will recognize Whedon's playful wit (keep an eye out for Perlman snagging the gun from a soldier guarding him, then returning the weapon with a warning not to touch him).  Fans of Jeunet's prior and later work (e.g. Amelie) will recognize the atmosphere and sudden shifts between extremes.  Finally, any sci-fi fan will get caught up in the fast-paced action and original gore."

Other then that, i think Winona Ryder's character, the new cyborg was cool, also the bad ass ripley and the crew of pirates.

","The problem with Alien Resurrection wasn't the fact that it was a bad movie. The problem was that it never seemed to know what it wanted to be.  The thing that I loved about the previous movies was the fact that each movie, while a continuing story line, was a different vision.  Alien was a pure horror film.  Aliens was an action/war movie.  Alien3 was a gothic thriller. Alien Resurrection seems to be a cross between a modern slasher flick, a art house movie, and a slam bang blow-your-brains-out John Woo style action movie.<br/><br/>Like all of the other Alien movies Resurrection's characters are both well defined and acted.  The scientists bored me, but I was both intrigued and entertained by the crew of the Betty.  Each member had their own distinct personality that didn't just seem like a clone from one of the previous movies.  I really liked the character of Analee Call, played adorably as always by Winona Ryder.  I think that if this series is to continue she is without a doubt the heir to the throne.  Call had an intriguing ""little girl in a world of big bad scary pirates"" thing going on, which was interesting. I also like Johner who was like a mix of all of the meanest characters of all the Alien movies thrown together.  He provided a good level of comic relief and managed the near impossible feat of being more frightening than the Aliens themselves are.<br/><br/>All in all, Resurrection was neither a bad Alien movie nor a bad movie period.  It's worth a look if for nothing more than to look at Winona Ryder for a couple of hours<br/><br/>7/10"
"baumer","6","1","1","27 July 1999"," What was a great series is now old like the Fridays.......
","I'll try to make this brief.  Alien was good because it set the tension up and then unleashed the terror.  Aliens was one of the best films ever made because James Cameron is brilliant, the supporting cast was spectacular and it was a terrifying experience.  Alien3 was okay because Ripley looked and sounded exhausted from facing the alien one too many times, and she dies with the monster.  Alien Resurection is just okay because there is nothing new to do here.  We have seen it all before and there is very little chance that the directors of 3 and 4 know how to create tension the way that Scott and Cameron did.  The film is tiresome.  Ripley isn't the frightened but tough heroine that she was before.  Now she is a terminator.  And that takes away from one of the elements that made the first and especially the second one so good.  In Aliens, Weaver had lines like,  ""I hope you're right. Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew. "" Now I expect her to say "" I'll be back. ""  It's just not the same.  And her bravado does not bode well for the picture here.  Having her this tough and emotionless would be like having Rambo as a wimp that begs the bad guys to stop before they torture him.  It just doesn't fit.<br/><br/>Alien 4 is not a terrible film.  It is okay, but it does not have the feeling that a good Aliens film does.  And maybe that is asking too much of it because the first two were really incredible films.  But the series is tired and I really hope it is over.  The only way I would like to see another one is if Cameron directs.  And seeing as that is not going to happen, let this series come to end.  It's dead.  Ripley is dead.  The Alien is dead.  All the cool characters are dead.  May the series rest in peace. It's time to leave it alone.<br/><br/>Alien series 1979-1997 R.I.P."

OK, so Ripley's characterisation was a bit off and the first half an hour was boring, but once it got going the action was fast and intense and the script was pretty good. It also has the most original plot of the series (apart from 1, of course.)

","Alien: Ressurrection was definitely a good movie, but lacked much of the strength and purity of the other three.  As in Aliens, the plot was perfect, there were no holes, no corny lines, no cheesy plot.  Alien: Ressurrection had its share of these.  Put it this way, three times in the movie, twice in almost a ten minute span did someone come out from behind a door, just happening to come upon the main group, and just so happening to be (every time) a crew member they thought had died earlier.  Only like 3 or 4 main people died so the aliens weren't that much of a threat.  And you didn't get to see the aliens much, they were just kinda there, as if they were almost minor. It touched all areas of a good movie but lacked in every one of them.  It may be possible to reclone Ripley, but ones genetic code wouldn't include the alien.  This makes for a weak (but pretty cool) main idea.  The baby alien was evil, but dumb.  It was gross and irritating.  Everything that makes the Aliens series so good was altered and tampered with in Ressurection and just made for a poor addition to the Alien series."
"jonathandoe_se7en","7","1","1","16 September 2001"," A visual freak-show of a movie, in every sense of the word
","Alien Resurrection is probably the most detested of the series by fans, I don't really know why. True, it's not great, the beauty of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and DP Darius Khondji's vision doesn't make up for the weak acting (what the hell is Winona Ryder doing here) or the laughable script, but Jeunet cannot make an uninteresting film. From Delicatessen (1991) right up to Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain (2001) he's proven that his beautifully surrealistic visual can create a perverse sense of wonder and terror, and with Alien Resurrection he's in full swing.<br/><br/>
The film is a visual freak show in every sense of the word, full of bizarre mutations and characters, but the script just lets the film down. This seems to disregard the character of Ellen Ripley, I know she's a clone but they should of given her a little more emotion, think about what the poor woman went through. The scriptwriter Joss Whedon gives us no true hero; Ripley is a shell of her former self so we just don't care about her. To rap up, Alien Resurrection is a decent enough standalone film, but as part of the franchise, it's definitely the weakest.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Jeremy-93","7","1","1","8 August 2001"," Frankenstein Created Aliens - and almost got away with it
","Joss Whedon, who has sole writer's credit for Alien: Resurrection, is famously unhappy with the end result (""a crappy-ass movie"") and it's certainly a bit of a mess in narrative terms: after a thoroughly effective first half hour, the film doesn't manage to graft on to its very basic escape-from-alien-infested-ship storyline the more meditative and fantastical elements that are its real raison d'être. Pacing goes haywire, and some sequences so strain credibility as to turn the film towards campy self-parody.  When you look both at Whedon's best writing (for Buffy on TV) and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's earlier French fantasy films, control of plotting isn't really either's strong suit, and there's a nagging feeling of imperfect coherence here, a film that never quite came together. All the same, the actual ingredients are astonishingly inventive (perhaps unprecedentedly so for a third sequel to what was a very straightforward, if brilliantly executed, original).<br/><br/>The story follows on from Alien 3, but its themes dovetail mainly with Cameron's first sequel, Aliens, especially the obsession with motherhood and family. Cameron's script for Aliens centered on the bizarre pairing of Ripley and the Alien queen as maternal figures, and that idea becomes the theme for a set of grand guignol variations here, as Whedon, Jeunet and the effects designers probe at the definition of what makes one human, what makes one a monster, and the strange fluidity between those categories. In many ways the end product less resembles the earlier Alien films than it does a classic Universal horror film, which (like all good monster movies) gives most of its sympathy to the monsters.<br/><br/>I hardly need to add that Sigourney Weaver's dazzling and unsettling reinvention of Ripley as something that both is and is not human is what holds everything together - if only barely (some of the supporting players are less well cast, notably Dominique Pinon who's so great in Jeunet's earlier films, though I confess I do like Winona Ryder in a role that's awkwardly written at times). This is one of those films that gets more interesting and more annoying on repeated viewing - its weaknesses become ever more glaring, its complexities and innovations ever more intriguing."
"oldbollweevil","7","1","1","28 July 2001"," Was it everything you'd hoped for?
","**includes spoilers**<br/><br/>I disagree with those of my fellow reviewers who say that this film<br/><br/>was just a gratuitous cash-in with no logical basis in the earlier<br/><br/>films.  It may indeed have been just a gratuitous cash-in, just like 2<br/><br/>& 3 were cash-ins on the first one, and the first one was a cash-in<br/><br/>on the post-Star Wars sci-fi boom.  But I found the premise not<br/><br/>only believable, but inevitable in the same way as the first three.<br/><br/>That is, if the scientific developments of the last few years (secret<br/><br/>cloning projects, creating embryos for the express purpose of<br/><br/>harvesting stem  cells, etc.) have taught us anything, it's that if<br/><br/>science can do something, it will.  Given the Company's scientists'<br/><br/>determination to get a specimen of the alien in the first three<br/><br/>movies, you have to know that if there was any way to reconstitute<br/><br/>Ripley and get the queen from inside her, they would.  You know<br/><br/>this would happen.  You know that somewhere, some scientist<br/><br/>(some government) would do this, no matter the consequences.<br/><br/>
That's what the whole series had been about, so in a sense it was<br/><br/>inevitable that at some point the series would have to show the<br/><br/>scientists actually trying to breed the alien.  In a sense, the whole<br/><br/>series has been building to this.<br/><br/>You can see it in Ripley's eyes.  Sigourney Weaver gives a<br/><br/>stunning performance in this film, showing us not only the effects<br/><br/>of the alien genes she now carries, but an utter disgust and<br/><br/>despair at what humanity has done.  Early on, you can tell that<br/><br/>Ripley has just given up on humanity--the coldness she displays<br/><br/>toward the victims of the alien could stem from her alien half, or<br/><br/>simply from this disgust.  Certainly the soldiers and scientists<br/><br/>deserved what they got.<br/><br/>It's this odd mixture of feelings, I think, that makes the scene with<br/><br/>Ripleys 1-7 so powerful.  Ripley 8, and the viewer, is filled with<br/><br/>horror at the degradations human inquisitiveness is capable of<br/><br/>producing, and pity for the victims of that inquisitiveness.  Ripley<br/><br/>herself is perhaps the greatest victim.<br/><br/>That doesn't make it a perfect movie.  I agree with the reviewer who<br/><br/>said that it hews closest to the formula of the second movie, which<br/><br/>in this case means lots of action and virtually no character<br/><br/>development.  Like Aliens, everybody in this movie except Ripley<br/><br/>basically exists either to kill or get killed;  and whereas Aliens at<br/><br/>least had the little girl to inject some real pathos into the<br/><br/>proceedings, in this movie there's nobody to care about except for<br/><br/>Ripley herself.  We're supposed to care about Winona Ryder's<br/><br/>character, the robot girl, but somehow the character doesn't quite<br/><br/>work.  Ryder just doesn't have the screen presence, the intensity,<br/><br/>to make herself felt over the explosions.  (I tend to think she's<br/><br/>overrated as an actress anyway.)<br/><br/>I also agree that in showing so much gore, the movie diminishes<br/><br/>the impact of the creatures.  The key to the first one was that you<br/><br/>only saw the aliens for seconds at a time, and you never got a<br/><br/>really good view--they were always hiding behind something, or in<br/><br/>a dim corner.  That's why they were so scary.  In this movie, you<br/><br/>see absolutely everything, and the result isn't so much scary as<br/><br/>just gross.  The newborn is a cool design--a misshapen human/ alien cross--but we just see too much of it.  The first one was a<br/><br/>horror movie;  this is a splatter movie.<br/><br/>So I give this one high marks for concept and for Weaver (and<br/><br/>maybe for the look), and low marks for just about everything else."

"Senefra","7","1","1","18 May 2001"," So close yet so far away....
","**SPOILERS**Allright, admittedly this film does not come close to the previous films. But I think that was the whole point, seeing as how each film in the series was directed by a different director each with their own vision of how the common threads of the series (Ripley and the Alien) were portrayed.<br/><br/>""Alien"" had Ridley Scott working closely with H.R. Giger(whose design inspired the character) to bring something that audiences had never encountered before, which was a scifi horror with human elements (mainly brought by the character of Eleanor Ripley, brilliantly played by Sigourney Weaver). Scott wanted to give us an anticipated chill by portraying the alien as a killer who is barely seen, but when revealed is more terrifying than anything we've come to expect from horror genre, while elevating scifi to a new level. With the introduction of Ripley, we find ourselves empathizing with the character because she's so human and therefore fallible.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" director James Cameron brought the action and SFX needed to give this series a jolt. In this one Ripley's just beginning to realize what has happened to her, but by setting it 57 years after the first one, becomes even more of a shock to the system. With her daughter dead, a mining colony on the same planet where the alien was found, we find her growing physically capable while slowly becoming emotionally detached. The addition of the marines (a group straight out of a Vietnam War pic), a sleazy lawyer (played neurotically but with an underlying menace by Paul Reiser), Bishop (the android at the opposite end of the spectrum for Ash in the first film) and Newt (who basically represents the daughter Ripley never had a chance to raise), Cameron adds the action portion while still containing the human elements we loved from the first film. Here Ripley has grown from a damsel-in-distress to a woman capable of handling an entire nest of these aliens, as well as introducing the Queen (an incredibly beautiful touch by Cameron on his part on the similarities between insect colonies/alien colony)), a complete turnaround from dealing with just one of them from the first film.<br/><br/>David Fincher, the director of ""Alien3"", wanted to have that one lone menace from the first film, but redefining the series by setting it in an abandoned maximum security prison/lead works, run by the former prisoners (all men) of the facility. By putting Ripley in that testosterone-filled setting, he changed the rules. He even upped the ante by allowing the alien to carry on through other creatures, besides human, be hosts for it. By doing this, he gave the alien abilities and a new look by taking characteristics from it's host (the dog) and fusing them with the alien's capabilities. Fincher also brought to us the alien's POV, which had never been seen before in the series, and used it with great effect. And having Ripley as the host for the new queen was an unbelievable way to end the character because at that point, she had finally reached her full potential. The analogy of Ripley (the strong capable leader) and a queen alien being inside her was just perfect, and having them both die together while Ripley flings herself into the lead works becoming essentially a saviour/martyr of the remainder of humanity was a great way to end the story.<br/><br/>Finally I come to ""Alien: Resurrection"", which must be treated as a separate film with the common threads of the series, Ripley and the alien. Director Jean-Pierre Jeune brought to us the fantastic visual style that made his last effort, ""La CitÃ© Des Enfants Perdus (The City of the Lost Children)"" such a cult classic. But by doing this, it weakened the expectations of the audience, who hoped to see the same old Ripley vs. Alien scenario, which in this case would not have worked, seeing as how the character of Eleanor Ripley had died in the last film. Sigourney Weaver decided to play the new Ripley as a being with inherited memories of Ripley's, but also sharing alien characteristics (acidic blood, fast reflexes, healing and heightened strength). In this way the character becomes almost like a double agent of humanity and the aliens, leaving you wondering whose side she's on, and depending on certain parts of the film, leaves you guessing. The new elements of the military experimentation, pirates (with Winona Ryder as Call, an emotional android capable of being humane) and the sense of humor brought to the table by Ron Pearlman and Dominique Pinon's characters are surprisingly enjoyable, but a far cry from what we know of the series. And yes I thought the ""Newborn"" indeed repelling, but I also felt sympathetic towards it because of it's emotional state (not sure who to trust and how to handle being what it is, almost as if it were a newborn puppy). And with aliens actually heading for Earth, which the first three films were aiming toward by preventing such a thing to happen, that brought an adrenaline kick to the film. The ambiguity of the ending left me wondering where the series might be headed.<br/><br/>Final analysis? ""Alien: Resurrection"" may not be on par with the earlier films, but as a scifi/horror/action film, it holds it's own. I give it a rating of 7 out of 10, minus three for plot elements and acting."
"LokiFirefox","Null","1","1","30 October 1998"," I like the movie despite everything
","I'm a huge fan of the series. I think, personally, that it's the best sci-fi series that I have seen. Part of the reason why I love the Alien movies is that each one was created differently. The first focused on suspense, the second on action etc. So I appreciated each movie differently and I don't think one better than the other. I think Aliens is more fun to watch than Alien 3 but I don't think it's better. When I saw the fourth movie for the first time on the big screen I was blown away. I love the look of the movie and Ripley is just too cool for words. However, when I saw it for the second time, the flaws began to show. Reading previous comments, I agree that part of the appeal of the series was fearing for Ripley and the terror whether or not she's gonna get it and how she'll survive. I don't mind Ripley being powered-up but she didn't have anyone to fight that was on her level. The Aliens disappeared and they just didn't seem as dangerous as in the previous movies. The Newborn didn't look dangerous, just grotesque. The deaths seemed to occur because the movie apparently needed to kill off the characters. Characterization of the Betty's crew seemed inconsistent and I definitely wanted to know more about them. Consequently when they started dying-off I couldn't care less, unlike how I felt when Vasquez and Hudson bit the bullet. Lastly, the Auriga was supposed to be in unregulated space but it took them only three hours to get to Earth? And why was Earth so defenseless? A ship was heading straight for it but no intercept was sent. Other flaws are mentioned in previous comments. Despite all of this I really do like the movie. What can I say, I'm a fan. I love the Betty in particular and the whole ""look"" of the movie in general. I would love to see the series continue and see in what direction they'll take it next."

","There are some grave injustices in this world. We are in front of one of them. This movie is EXCELLENT! It completely brought back to life a saga that was buried by another brilliant and not understood movie: alien 3. But the critics didn't let it. The issues of humanity, new way of facing the alien, new Ripley, dark environments, interesting characters and excellent direction make this film a near masterpiece of sci-fi, horror and action. The fresh direction from a french director that also brought us ""The City of Lost Children"" gives us a completely different movie that deviates from the normal pace of the alien movies. The only problem I can see in this movie is that the change is so big that the movie spends its entire time acomodating people to the changes, and doesn't face completely its issues, but that for me isn't a problem: on the contrary of what critics are saying, this opens the door for a grandeous Alien 5 in the future that could truly end the saga as it deserves. Two thumbs up for its excepcional musical score that brings back elements from the other three movies, and an applause for its great special and visual effects, bringing for the first time realistic CG aliens to life."

Alien: Resurrection is not liked very much by critics, but I thoroughly enjoyed this flick, I own the film and watch it when I seriously need some horrifying stuff.<br/><br/>Two centuries on from Alien3, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Lieutenant First Class, number 36706 is still very dead but Clone 8 - grown aboard the Auriga by the evil greedies at United Systems Military - looks damn near perfect (even if the only hair she has is her eyebrows when first we see her). From inside her, USM cut an Alien queen, then against the advice of General Perez (hairy-shouldered Dan Hedaya), let Ripley #8 live. She meets the six-strong vagabond crew of the Betty then USM's captive Aliens get smart and get free, chasing the crews through corridors (and flooded kitchens) until they die - or escape.<br/><br/>Although the plot sounds fairly thin and silly, it is a strong story with a scary twist. The actors are all really good, Weaver puts in yet another excellent performance as Ripley, while newcomers to the series, Winona Ryder and Dan Hedaya, are both just as watchable. The screenplay is played out to ridiculous ends, which, in Alien: Resurrection's case, isn't actually a bad thing.<br/><br/>If you like the Alien series and you're a big fan of sci-fi horror films, I highly recommend Alien: Resurrection.<br/><br/>I rate Alien: Resurrection 7 out of 10."

","Although there are some pretty poignant scenes in here, and this is overall quite enjoyable to watch, it suffers from quite a few flaws of a typical Hollywood (i.e stupid) big-budget late 90's action thriller flick; rather corny dialogue that fails to be properly witty and over-uses a rude word that rhymes with ""duck"" every two minutes, an overall plot that often seems too far-fetched and flimsy to take seriously (although everyone on-screen pretends they do), a general balance of brawn over brains in the form of tacky computer-made special effects, and over-milkage of one annoying little movie star (Winona Ryder in this case, who manages to be genuinely irritating. Her character Call is a screen-hogging nuisance as well).<br/><br/>
Nevertheless, this is entertaining enough to watch, with lots of shooting, some pretty strong horror moments directed with decent flair and of course, the Alien monicker to back it up. The big problem is that many will feel that the Alien franchise deserves much better than this, which feels way too teenager-oriented. And there's no denying that the first three Alien films are streets ahead of this both for style and substance.<br/><br/>So not an absolute travesty, but not quite worthy of the big name of the Alien films either."

Ripley's not a character you fear for anymore, like in the first film, cheer for as in the second film, or even grieve for like in the third film, she's just some character who has seem to have been put in so that people will go to see it because Weaver's in it. Too much gore?? Huh??? I think not! Too little gore. The first film is still sickening when Kane gave birth that it just beats all competition, Alien Resurrection's so over-the-top in its attepts to be slightly gorey that it makes no difference. If you want gore, see something like Hellraiser or the later Halloween films, or even Event Horizon, because this film even falls short in the gore factor. It's story is ludicrous, the newborn is pathetic, and its birth scene is even worse. Call (Winona Ryder) is just the mouldy icing on the rotting cake!

","If the third ""Alien"" film didn't convince you that the series has passed its expiration date, ""Alien: Resurrection"" surely will. While I must admit that this film is not altogether bad, and a big improvement over the third, it is in no way as good as its original two predecessors, and it is quite obvious from the establishing shots to the last.<br/><br/>The first two films were excellent, but the third film was one major flop, due to horrible characters, unintelligably fast camera movement, and, for me, the idea of all hope in the second film fading. (Ripley risks her life many times to save Newt in ""Aliens,"" but then in a quick moment in the third, she (Newt) is dead? That's not right.)<br/><br/>The thing that made the first two films superb was not only the tension and white-knuckle terror, but the cinematography (which won an Oscar for the original film), and the creatures, who were never quite shown to the extent anyone would like, including in the first film. And then the third film came along and showed the aliens' full bodies, and due to average CGI, the fear diminished. In this new installment, aliens hop along, walk upright, leap on people; heck, they even swim. But the visual effects on the creatures is so poor for a 1997 film that it makes one want to wipe the film from their memory. It ruins the original two ""Alien"" films. The aliens in this film look more like tiny lizards with heads shaped as melons than anything. ""Alien"" (1979) and ""Aliens"" (1986) showed the aliens from the waist up much of the time, and the creatures looked like men in alien suits. Which, in this case--believe it or not, is better. I like the hokey costumes; the creatures seem more terrifying when they hover above humans and move like humans. But alas, in ""Resurrection"" they move about like quick little...well...typical aliens, and the creatures are no longer original, but misused.<br/><br/>The plot in ""Resurrection""--what little of it there is--opened my eyes to the meaning of ""contrived,"" ""simple"" and ""stereoytpical."" The plot is so incredibly weak that one cannot take their eyes off the screen. Here it is in simple terms, cutting out the BS in between: A ship with crewmembers lands at a bigger ship, where they are transporting cargo. Bigger Ship will be referred to as Medical Ship, where they are conducting evil, B-science-fiction experiments on--whaddaya know--the old xenamorphs, commonly referred to as ""aliens."" These aliens trace back to Ellen Ripley. 200 years ago Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) died (see ""Alien3""), and now they have cloned her to get the alien that was inside her. For some reason, they still have Clone Ripley on board, studying her. And surprise, surprise: She is part-alien because when they cloned her, the alien inside her mixed with her DNA (???).<br/><br/>Somehow, Ripley still retains all her old memories. And when aliens escape from their containment chambers, Call (horribly mis-casted Winona Ryder) and the team of transporters take it upon themselves to ""get the f---k out of here.""<br/><br/>Ripley is no longer an interesting character. In this film, she has been cloned and is quarter alien and what not. But she acts odd--the old Ripley is no more. In this film, she refers to the aliens as ""her children"" and in a truly disgusting--and confusing--scene, she finds a bunch of half-human/alien figures and cries. This scene doesn't compare to the ending, which is even more confusing and disgusting.<br/><br/>The character-driven story is no more. The human quotient is diluted in an otherwise typical plot. ""Alien"" went from originality to predictability. Remember how good the first film was? Remember how excellent James Cameron's sequel was? Yeah, well, ""Alien: Resurrection"" had me wishing I could just see those movies again, and forget about how average this one was.<br/><br/>2.5/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"

Her portrayal of Ripley once more makes us feel everything that she is going through, even if this time it is a totally different struggle that she is fighting inside herself. Winona Ryder also gives an outstanding performance, so I may say that the whole team has hit it off perfectly and made one great movie. If you haven't seen it yet - what are you waiting for ?"
"Dierk","8","5","12","28 May 2000"," Underappreciated
","This movie may not be what hard core SF fans or critics wanted to see in the Alien series. But nevertheless it is a very good film.<br/><br/>Jeunet -- and the producers in choosing him as a director -- found the funny elements in the Alien saga and made a mostly bizarre sci-fi comedy. Well, it is not the kind of comedy Chevy Chase may stand for. It is a distinctly European kind of humour in the mold of Monty Python.<br/><br/>It would be a mistake to give anything away concerning scenes but be aware of some really, really good laughs that will stuck in your throat. Jeunets satire reminds one of the pictures of Hieronymus Bosch, either you like it or not. Oh, and be aware that Jeunet does not need as much ""shock"" scenes like previous directors but uses much more graphic violence and splatter effects.<br/><br/>Another thing: With all its gross humour the film delivers some of the most endearing and emotional scenes ever in a sci-fi flic."

It's one of the greatest dissapointments of all time and the worst movie of 1997. The plot is awful (2000 years of science and no-one cares with the acid-blood?!), everyone becomes tired when Winona Ryder starts to cry (while she just wanted to speak), the effects are just satisfactory and the new mutant-alien... argh!

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Terrible.  It is basically a facsimile of the original, with only a few, mostly irritating tweaks.<br/><br/>What's been added:<br/><br/><ul><li>A lot more cheesy, gratuitous ""neato"" action-movie shots, like a backwards sliding shot of a grenade rolling on the ground and a standard underwater chase scene.  By the time you see this movie, these techniques and technology will be old news, and are out of place in an Alien movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Plenty of cheesy lines, none with any actual humor built in, like the ""Vasquez, ever been mistaken for a man?"" ""No, have you?"" exchange from the original.  And plenty of horror movie overacting, including repeated comical bug-eyes courtesy of Dan Hedaya as Perez.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A pitifully out of place Winona Ryder, playing her usual Gen-X self (a la How to Make an American Quilt, Little Women, etc..).  Are you trying to tell me that this little waif got a job on a freakin pirate ship?  As a PIRATE? Her character, ""Mousy McSoftheart"" is a ridiculous star-power addition to the script, and Ryder fails miserably at breathing any life into it - it's as if she knows how out of place she is and doesn't even try.</li></ul><br/><br/>What's missing:<br/><br/><ul><li>Terror.  The settings of the original two films were absolutely terrifying.  The second film adds magnitude to the first film's visionary environment while maintaining that awful claustrophobic feel, and even Alien 3 is set in an unique and interesting place.  Resurrection has neither the feel of ""Oh my God, what's breathing down my neck - I can't get away from it!"" nor ""Oh my God, look at all of those... THINGS!"" nor even the unique perks gained from being set in a space-prison.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Terror.  Where is that indestructible Alien (capitalized) that you JUST CAN'T STOP from the first 3 movies?  In this flick, as far as I can remember, every time someone fires a gun at one of the aliens (not capitalized), it goes down.  And the full shot of the queen they give you is not nearly as horrifying as the partial glimpses of the Alien you get in the earlier films.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Terror.  I was not afraid for the lives of any of these character-less ""characters"" lives.  Even, dare I say it, Ripley.  *** POTENTIAL SPOILER *** While Sigourney Weaver's performance (especially her physicalizations) as an alien half-breed is interesting, (although unstable and off-balance - what's with all the smiles?  did becoming a half-alien make Ripley nicer?), her creepy motherly attitude leads you to distrust her.  And if she is capable of reproducing aliens, shouldn't she be destroyed anyway?  The only other character that I enjoyed watching was the pirate captain, and he's the first or second one to be killed off! *** END OF SPOILER *** And there is the addition of a mad scientist character who I assume is supposed to be creepy. Give me the icy menace of Bishop (from the first Alien) any time!</li></ul><br/><br/>Basically, if you haven't seen the first two movies, SEE THEM - they are excellent.  Don't waste your time on this one, or at least don't ruin the menace of the first two by starting here.  If you have seen the first two and loved them, don't watch this one because it will just make you sad.

","Whereas the whole Alien series is a unique enterprise, Resurrection is the gem. It is snobbishly underrated and ostracized, it has plot holes and other goofs, it may seem childish in an attempt to frighten, but it is much more than just a sci-fi horror. The Resurrection visual and sound design is nonetheless flawless. Acting is genuinely brilliant and cut timing is superb. Besides, this is about a wondering soul who knows there's no trade with the evil, and the struggle between this view and the desire to get a profit over anything.

","While Alien Resurrection would seem like a POS compared to Alien-1 and Aliens, by itself, its not such a bad movie. The special effects are top notch for the most part but the producers blundered badly by including CGI aliens in some scenes, which look totally fake and stupid. There's really little or no element of horror and not too much action but most parts were fairly realistic and the film did have its moments. The use of gore makes the aliens fairly effective. The characters were most entertaining and likable.

I know that Call could have been played by many others, but I think Winona's performance in the film is truly magical, cause she created a person who is both whimsical and innocent at the same time. Thanks to her acting we have another main character. It helps Weaver, who does't have to act like she was the only really interesting character in the film (I think the same thing was made by Ian Holm and John Hurt in Alien).

'Aliens' is a rare thing, a sequel that is as good as the first, very imaginative, well filmed and also enjoyable to watch again and again. 'Alien 3' didn't quite cut it, for a start off most of it was filmed in total darkness and when you can see what's happening there are to many camera angles to make sense of what you are seeing. Whoever decided that a fourth film was called for was out of his or her mind, 'Alien Resurrection' is just nonsense. So it's hundreds of years after Ripley was incinerated and a group of scientists have cloned her along with the DNA of the alien embryo she was carrying and spliced it with her DNA to cross breed her with the aliens. What???? And we now have hybrid aliens that can swim, a queen alien that has a womb and one is part human, insane but part human. The script is so weak it couldn't fight it's way out of a paper bag, a lot of the acting is very wooden, even the incredibly talented Sigourney Weaver fails to give a half decent performance, as for the continuuity, there doesn't appear to be any.

"KWiNK","2","3","6","1 April 2003"," If you want something new in your franchise, this is NOT the way to do it!
","Well, yes! After all these bad reviews for this movie, we can do little more than place the blame and I think, the blame is with the producers, who wanted to bring something new to the franchise in terms of genre.<br/><br/>This worked extremely well with the first two movies. After ""Alien"" was tense thriller, ""Aliens"" added a big-boom-action element, for which there couldn't have been anyone better than James Cameron. ""Alien 3"" tried to mix the elements of thriller and action a bit more than the second movie had done and, while being too cartoonish as a whole, succeeded in that and - to this reviewer - it was a step down but still OK.<br/><br/>Then there's this! I don't even mind the guy who said ""Hey! Let's make the fourth movie a sick comedy with camp-scale 10 acting and sick jokes and let's have a man pulling a bit of his own brain out!"" No, I'll forgive this person, whoever he was. But who were the geniuses that said: ""Wow! What a great idea! Let's do that!""???<br/><br/>They put a lot of money into this and got a few great set-pieces and a brilliantly made underwater scene. So, why did they go and waste it on this? There were some obviously super ideas, like Ripley returning as a part-alien and the lost crew of survivors trying to make their way out more or less adopting a man, who they know will soon die giving birth to one of the carnivorous extra terrestrials. But too many characters spend too much time, just trying to over-cool everybody else with brain-dead one-liners and their very special abilities (""Look at me! I've actually got two fire-arms integrated into my, er, other arms!"") or dying in an unusual way, which is obviously supposed to make us laugh.<br/><br/>Let's all just hope, the executives at Fox learned something from this and if a part 5 comes along they a) do it with some dignity and darkness and b) let Ripley die for good. Not because I don't like her, but they have wasted a great chance to turn the character into something completely new and now it's going nowhere. If you need a part 6, let Ron Perlman take the lead, because he's the one slightly appealing character in this. (Sorry, Noni! I've seen you do better.) Or he's just used to working with Jeunet and therefore gives a more accustomed performance. Anyway, don't let him be too cool and give him a few problems to chew on and we'll be fine with him as our new Ripley."

If you clone a pregnant woman, than her baby would definitely not be copied too. But the worst thing in the script are the completely nauseating characters. Winona Ryder (a very good actress in other films) is completely miscast as an action-heroine. Ron Perlmans character is completely unbearable and destroys even the last moment of atmosphere. Also weak is John Frizzells score, which is the absolutely boring standard-shocker music with high string tremolos and stomping percussions, the other 3 movies had great scores. And the worst part of it all: this movie doesn't even scare you. Instead of well build tension you get gore, gore, gore- my fantasies are much more frightening then liters of film blood. I give it a 1 out of 10, because Jeunet really failed in keeping up the high quality of the series (yes, i also liked Fincher's take on the beast, although you can feel, that it was heavily cut by the studio.) And now, there are rumours about a fifth ALIEN-movie directed by Ridley Scott. Chances are high, that this will get better than Jeunets ""achievement.""

Alien had suspense, I was actually scared out of my seat.  Why? because there was only one alien and I had no idea of its location.  However, Alien Resurrection has more aliens than would fill a galaxy. Horror films should follow one guideline.  Make sure the creature can't be seen, only then can the viewer use his/her imagination.<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection fails to do this, and hence it fails as a movie."
"KayCee-8","10","3","7","5 April 2000"," A lovely joke on Hollywood - viva Jeunet!
","Every time I perceive this marvelously disgusting, erotic, hilarious, and pretty film I enjoy it more than before.  Yet its undeniably different character from the first three films in the series begs addressing.  After my ninth screening, I propose that _Alien Resurrection_ is actually Situationist-influenced cinema.<br/><br/>The essence of the 1950s-60s French-based Situationist movement is ""constructing situations"" , a constructed situation defined as:<br/><br/>""A moment of life, concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of unitary environment and the free play of events."" --From the journal /Internationale Situationniste/ #1, June 1958<br/><br/>
Of course that might describe every film ever made; the distinguishing factor methinks lies in both the character of the individual scenes, and their attitude toward the narrative.  The idea of ""constructing situations"" includes the notion of free play of events in a carefully arranged environment.  As far as I can tell, the purpose is to break out of the Spectacular trance by appreciating life in an immediate, sensual way confounding to the intent of cultural or ideological scripts.  An example of Situationist-influenced daily life would be anarchists rearranging billboard messages to expose the advertiser's evil intent,  going out for a walk and intentionally getting lost, etc. <br/><br/>In _Alien Resurrection_ , the scenes were the thing.  The scenes often seemed directionless, haphazard, the acting even a bit fake, as if a troupe of really good improvisation actors had been given a particular situation, setting, music, costumes, and roles, and were told to work out what would happen, stretching it out to fill a particular time.  The cinematography lends a glow to the surroundings, like an aura of meaningfulness, that prettifies everything.  The score undulates unpredictably, imbuing piecemeal *deja vu.   In other words, it's as if they have, in a Situationist sense, constructed various situations out of which beauty unfolds, and the actors themselves experience this necessarily.  Indeed, from the various actors' commentaries, describing, for instance, the vaunted underwater scene, or the thrill of working with famous actors in a celebrated film series, it seems as though it was as much if not more fun and interesting to actually act in it as it is to perceive it on the screen.  The final product proceeded without flowing, scenes appeared interchangeable, the plot primarily an excuse for generating a series of well-done Situations.  In doing so, it's natural the work dismantles the ""ideology"" as it were of the first three films, and rearranges the elements to its own liking, for its own ends, in the service of situations.<br/><br/>In this light, the disjointedness of the film becomes a focussing device, a hint of where not to look.  The joys of the film, as both apologists and reluctantly won over fans in varying degrees realise, flow from appreciating the various impressive situations, not from an elaborately engaging plot. Contrast with the intense, simple plot of A1, the well-rounded helping of plot and character in A2, and the muddling of both qualities for the sake of a well-stirred mood in A3.  Perhaps this degrades A4, or perhaps not.  If my proposition is correct, this not only paints the Alien Saga in a more subversive colour than hitherto appreciated, but also plays one of the largest jokes in cinematic history on the film studio that made it.  If _Alien3_ was a fifty-five million dollar art film, _Alien Resurrection_ must be nothing less than an eighty million dollar Situationist film. (!)  As such, of course, the title gains another significance...that of ""resurrecting"" Situationist ideas into the popular imagination, nested within the heart of the spectacle itself.  If it's true that, in keeping with rumour, Jean-Pierre Jeunet will never make another Hollywood film, it's certainly no wonder why not!"

She is the highlight of the film, that has almost nothing else going for itself. Besides Ripley, the rest of the characters are either miscast, (Winona Ryder) or just plain silly.

","I will say that alien resurrection is better than its predecessor, Alien 3. But it is not nearly as great as aliens, no other Alien movie will be, because it is incredible in ever way. This movie once again, stars Sigourney weaver, and co stars Winona Ryder. I really loved Winona Ryder here, I loved her character and how she played that character. Sigourney is good here as usual, well, her character is very different in this final movie, Ripley is a clone, the real human Ripley is of course dead. So, at the beginning, I wasn't really enjoying her character because she is just so empty and hollow. But as the movie goes on, her character gets better and becomes more real, which is good. The action here is pretty good, again, it'll never compare to aliens, but it's still pretty nice. If you cannot stand gore, then you may wanna think twice about seeing this movie, or see it edited, the bloodshed in this film is a good bit stronger than in the previous ones. I do think they took the goriness too far in a few scenes towards the end. But I did love the ending, the newborn was very cool looking and I think the effects were very good looking during the birth scene, the effects throughout were nicely done. But dealing with the birth scene in particular, the effects NEEDED to be top notch, and they definitely were, that scene was just very cool looking and interesting. So overall, the acting is pretty good, the writing suffices, and the action/effects work. Not the best in the franchise, but certainly not the worst. 7/10 for alien resurrection."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","2","4","24 March 2016"," Very underrated. Unique, expressionistic Sci Fi at its best.
","To this day it still amazes me how under appreciated and misunderstood Alien Resurrection is. The four films in the series are a quartet of vastly different stories, due to the fact that the torch was passed to four very diverse directors over the course of the legacy. Ridley Scott crafted a tense, claustrophobic catalyst. James Cameron made a rootin, tootin Wild Bunch set in a galaxy far far away where no one can hear you scream. David Fincher gave us an odd, inaccessibly disturbing thriller where the real monsters lurked inside the humans, literally. French Maestro Jean-Pierre Jeunet, best known for his own charmingly surreal quartet of distinctly European wonders Amelie, A Very Long Engagement, City Of Lost Children and Delicatessen, made the final film in the franchise. I once saw a post on IMDb which prompted users to describe each of the Alien films in one word. The one response that stuck with me was: Alien-suspense, Aliens-action, Alien3- unpleasant and Alien Resurrection-weird. Is this accurate? Depends on your opinion of the series. Resurrection is my second favourite, after Aliens. To some it was weird, to many a failure, but to me it's a bona fide, rip roaring odyssey of gorgeous, gory design and offbeat ideas fleshed out by an absolutely legendary cast, headed up by Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. Two hundred years after she died, she is cloned using parts of the Xenomorph's DNA, and kept sequestered on a titanic pseudo military ship run by whackos who have never heard of a certain expression involving curiosity and a cat. She awakens, the alien genes giving her a decidedly heightened awareness which Weaver plays with giddy, sinister glee. This ain't the stalwart Ripley we are used to. Her eyes dance with an unearthly fire that pronounces 'here be dragons', in the spaces beyond science that humans foolishly venture into. The station is run by creepy, power hungry Dr. Mason Wren (underrated J.E. Freeman is almost ickier than the monsters themselves), and his sidekick Gediman, played by Brad Dourif in his final form, resembling a demented Pokemon who also raises more goosebumps than the aliens. The good doctor has commissioned a ragtag troupe of space pirates to bring him kidnapped humans in cryogenic sleep to be forcefully impregnated with alien fetuses. Lovely, right? This is where it gets interesting. Joss Whedon penned the script, and the crew of intergalactic badasses in this film are in fact the prototype for his endlessly successful TV series Firefly. Now, he claims that everything about the tone, delivery and execution of this film is wrong, and that the end result butchered his work. Here's my take: I've seen Firefly. It's good. But the team of space pirates in this movie are eternally more fascinating and worth spending time with. I feel that he really abandoned part of a great premise here, opting for a chipper, watered down version of a vision which presented itself to him and begged for further exploration. Firefly is fun, and it's characters are a veritable Partridge Family of interplanetary characters to chill with, but it lacks the steel edged nastiness and grit that he began with here. Michael Wincott is a blast as the captain, Frank Elgyn, in a role that's cut entirely too short but is aces while it lasts. Ron Perlman is a primate on earth and proves the same in space as Johner, the lovable lug of the crew. Gary Dourdan, the only black dude I know with blue eyes is Christie, with more than a few high powered tricks up his sleeves. Jeunet disciple Dominique Pinon plays wheelchair bound Riess, a tougher cookie than one might imagine. Lastly, Winona Ryder is Call, a doll with a pixie cut who takes an immediate shine to Ripley, leading them both to dark and dangerous places. Dan Hedaya makes lively work of Perez, the military honcho in charge, with Raymond Cruz, Kim Flowers and a shrieking Leland Orser rounding out the dream cast. As one might expect, all hell breaks loose in outer space as the creatures breed and hunt anything in their proximity. This provides loose cannon Jeunet with reason to fire off many a special effect that will give your gag reflex a workout and your pulse a solid pounding. There's seriously gnarly stuff here, especially near the end with a certain terrifying monster of an alien hybrid that acts as pure nightmare fuel while also being a bucket of fun at the same time. One of Whedon's complaints was that his lighthearted script was given the heavy treatment, which obviously clashed with the vision he had. Fair enough. It was his baby after all. But for me though, it works bettering he ever planned. The characters maintain a sense of gallows humour laced with very real danger, garnished with cheeky levity in the face of unimaginable horror. That's a good recipe to follow in any book I can think of. This one is ripe for redemption, certainly in the eyes of many who panned it upon release, and always ready for a revisit from myself."

","Alien: Resurrection (1997): Dir: Jean-Pierre Jeunet / Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perelman, Dan Hedaya, Michael Wincott: About as exciting as blowing your nose on your hand. Doesn't look like a resurrection as it does something that should be buried in a septic tank. Ripley is now over 200 years old thanks to cloning technology. There is an alien inside her and the crew fish it out and sew her up then study twelve of them behind unbreakable glass. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the unbreakable glass is about as effective as a one-legged man at an ass kicking contest. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet should have save his money and join the circus and do really cool acts with used snot rags. These films have directors of high profile but only the first two seem to be rewarding. Predictable circumstances include one's announcement that an alien inhabits him and that it will burst out his chest. They might as well have a welcoming committee ready. Sigourney Weaver was a great trooper in Alien and Aliens but now she is basically showing up for the job. Winona Ryder reduces the android to a moron the moment she opens her mouth. They should have added a laugh track just for her scenes. Ron Pearlman, Dan Hedaya and Michael Wincott play fast food and finger licking good to monster aliens. This film is about the ominous dangers of bad screen writing. Score: 1 / 10"

","As much as I'd love to do two in-depth reviews of Alien 3 and Resurrection, I'm afraid I just don't have the time and patience for that. However, since I detest both films with the fury of an F5 Tornado, I decided it would be therapeutic to vent my anger in a scathing, uninhibited, unfriendly, rage filled review of both films. Not to mention, rant on how each sequel, crossover, or prequel released after James Cameron's Aliens, has severely tarnished the legacy of the first two magnificent films. Let's begin with Alien 3. After the box office smash that was ""Aliens"" 20th century fox immediately rushed a second sequel into production. Screenplays were written and thrown out, directors were hired and fired, simply put: The production was troubled from the very beginning. No one knew what to do, or where they wanted to take this film. So after languishing in development hell for a while, The Head Mother f*cker(s) in charge at Fox decided to take two plot lines from two discarded screenplays and mush them together. Director David Fincher was hired and was basically told to make something out of those two plot lines. So here we have of Alien 3, and everything is just plain poor. However, it's not just simply the fact that the film is poor, it's also that the film is such a depressing experience! We learn that somehow, two alien eggs got aboard the Sulaco, the characters that we loved and cheered for: Hicks and Newt have died, and that Ripley is not only the sole survivor of the crash, but also is the only woman on a prison planet consisting of murderers and rapists! Who in their right mind thought that this was a good idea? Who thought that a bunch of murderers and rapists would make for good protagonists?! So to make a long story short, Ripley has discovered an alien inside of her, the prisoners kill the other alien that's been killing them, the company wants the alien that's inside of her, Ripley won't have it, and so she kills herself. So fast forward a few years later, and another alien film is announced. All of us alien fans collectively breathe a sigh of relief, and we think to ourselves: ""Okay great, they know that the last film was awful, and now they're going to make up for it."" Unfortunately, with the next film, we're all let down even more. But what baffles me, is that people all over defend the fourth film by saying: ""Well yeah, the fourth film was bad, but everyone knew that it was just a cheap cash grab anyway, so they just walked through it and didn't even try."" But isn't the whole point of film making to try to make a great film for people and fans to enjoy? I'm insulted by the philosophy that ""Resurrection was better than 3, because they weren't even trying anyway."" Yes, Alien 3 was, and still is a horrible film, but at least the people involved actually tried to make something good out of what they had to work with. With Resurrection, the people involved had a golden opportunity to make a great film, and to please the fans, and rectify their mistake. Instead, this film is nothing more than an excuse to make money. Everyone involved was just looking for a quick paycheck! No care or thought was given to the fans of the franchise, and that's heartbreaking. Sadly, it only got worse after that. Clearly no one cared with AVP, AVP:R, or Prometheus either. Still, we have these excellent, ground-breaking films in ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" and no matter what they do with the franchise from now on, Nothing can, or will ever take anything away from their individual greatness!"

When the aliens escape, the crew of the Betty must fight with the help of the clone Ripley.<br/><br/>This is the 4th installment of the franchise, and it has return to more flashier digs. The moody ugly sets are gone. Winona Ryder is really a godsend to this movie. She brings back a similar energy as Newt. She has an innate ability to project vulnerability. It was sorely missed in Alien3. And Sigourney Weaver is giddy playing this creepy feral version of Ripley.<br/><br/>The premise is a bit out there. It doesn't really make complete sense.

","After the snooze fest and disappointment of Alien3, there was no where to go but up for the Alien franchise.<br/><br/>Alien:Resurrection is a vastly underrated sci-fi thriller that seems to hit all the right marks. It's scary, it's action packed, it's humorous, and it's respectful to the series cannon. Weaver is top notch and Ron Pearlman is great as the one liner tough guy. The film is pretty gory too...maybe the goriest of the series.<br/><br/>The series went back to the James Cameron style of Alien...lots of action, lots of guns, and lots of special effects. I found myself having a great experience watching the film and was constantly entertained.<br/><br/>It's not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be. Yeah, Rider is a little dead pan but she's still pretty enough to look at. Resurrection is the easiest Alien film to enjoy, and in my opinion, the most entertaining."

"antonjsw1","8","2","4","2 January 2010"," Enjoyable and some morsels to chew on
","I have just seen the Quadrilogy special edition, which has a different opening and ending, and some extra scenes that flesh out some of he characters. I enjoyed it much more coming back to it some 3 or 4 years from having last seen that theatrical cut on DVD. The film doesn't have the visceral impact of either Alien or Aliens. However, it acknowledges Alien 3 and the previous films, and is a film with a very original, weird and surreal style typical of director Jean Pierre Jeunet. Unfortunately the KEY characters are not fleshed out quiet as well as the previous instalments, and only Sigourney Weaver, and Leland Orser, who plays the small role of Purvis, shine. Signourney Weaver, as in the previous two movies, is a standout and brings a new dimension to the character as a resurrected clone. In this special edition an interesting subplot about Ripley's past relationships is touched upon, but unfortunately its never developed to its full and interesting potential. The best part of the film is an outstanding sequence where Ripley confronts the reality of her existence as clone number 8, by seeing first hand the prior research, and it is a sequence right up their with the best of anything else in any of the other films. Leland Orser makes the most of a small part, and actually injects his character with pathos, even if the character's climax is way over the top! The story is interesting, but the film's main weakness is that some of the themes set up are not full explored, hence you do not get the emotional payoff that you get in Alien and Aliens, when subplots are carried through e.g Ash's character in Alien, Bishop's character arc in Aliens. Most characters, Wren, Elgyn ,Perez and Gediman(who is an unnecessarily weird character)come across more as plot devices,so you don't really care for them. However, Winona Ryder's Call is quite sympathetic, and by towards end of the film the characters of Vriess (played by Dominque Pinon) and Johner(played by Ron Perlman) are characters you begin to root for, even if the Johner character starts off as being deliberately dislikable.<br/><br/>The action sequences are well done, including a standout sequence underwater. The photography and design, like in all the alien films, are excellent. Visual effects are also excellent, bearing in mind this was the first Alien film to fully embrace CG, and is generally well integrated with the excellent live action animatronics. John Frizzell's music is entirely appropriate to the mood, and continues the tradition of excellent and fresh original scores across all four films.<br/><br/>The gore is certainly more obvious than in the previous instalments, and those with sensitive stomachs need to be aware that this is the most gratuitous of the four films. This was another small disappointment, as the horror of the aliens is much more psychological rather than the physical and the film is strongest when the horror is geared towards the implied rather than in your face (which for one character is more than just a metaphor!).<br/><br/>My final comment is about evolution. The research of the scientific characters in the story that leads to Ripley's Clone 8 raises some interesting thoughts on the ethics of genetic engineering, and links well into the Ripley Clone's issues about her identity. The idea could have been further explored but nevertheless its good to see these issues being layered into a Hollywood Sci- Fi movie. However, the impact of this research in the story of the evolution of the Alien species is controversial and while I really liked the idea, and of its linkage to Ripley, you'll need to make your mind up about the evolution's physical manifestation, which I was unsure about. This character was also on screen for too short a period, and it was a shame that more time wasn't devoted to this.<br/><br/>Overall I was impressed - not a classic, but a very well made and thoughtful, if occasionally weird movie."

Although it lacks the suspense and good action from the first 2 movies, this one has it's own style of entertainment, even if the movie did have some flaws. I found myself really enjoying it and wasn't dull or boring like ""Alien 3"", it doesn't do any damage. Characters were interesting or at least stood out, it's simply a fun film on it's own but just can't come close to being good as the first 2, which is why I think a lot of people seem to bash the film for.

I do not like the face of the last monster, it is really unsympathetic discharacter. I am sure it is some kind of enemy that is hard to destroy and get rid of...

You'd think that after the ending of Alien 3, they would have stopped making movies. Then upon first hearing of a 4th, people were probably thinking negative thoughts already. However, as a surprise to everyone, this is not a bad movie. However, I did NOT say it was without its share of flaws and holes. Sigourney Weaver amazingly returns AGAIN as Ripley and manages to play her very well again, however she is very different in this movie than in the other 3 and I personally have to say sometimes her performance here is rather irritating. Ron Perlman plays the loud-mouthed Johner very well actually, considering the ""cool/laid back"" personality he appears to have. Wynona Rider is actually sort of annoying in this movie but I can't say she should be replaced. Gary Dourdan is also very good as Christie. Brad Dourif was excellent as Dr. Jonathan Gediman also.

","... since I first heard about this movie being made, and when the trailers hit the small screen, I was really excited, even though I didn't find Alien 3 a good sequel to the brilliant first two films of the saga. Alien 3 had underdeveloped storyline. It had a few great elements (especially towards the end), but that's it. I never really got into that movie.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie seemed intriguing: scientists capture a bunch of aliens, doing various kinds of experiments on them. Wow! This will be a great movie - I thought.<br/><br/>But I was wrong. A:R failed to deliver on almost all levels of entertainment.<br/><br/>Story-wise it was okay at best. Scientists, yes, but they don't show you too much experiments. Just one scene made it into the final cut, when the main bad guy, the evil scientist tortures an alien then it learns which switch does that and becomes afraid of it. Big deal! We already knew aliens are smarter than a dog, so even if it's memorable, it has no impact whatsoever.<br/><br/>Effects-wise it has nice details and an unique feel for it, but again, nothing special. Aliens look slimier than ever and I didn't like that. Look at the original alien in the 1979 movie: it was smooth and clean, huge and sinister. These new ones are smaller, slimier and don't look that frightening. Sure they're faster, but that's not the aliens' main strength. It is the fear they generate that matters, and it's minimal in this movie. ""Aliens"" on the other hand also featured smaller, faster and slimier aliens than the original one, but it had great story, great cast and brilliantly directed scenes. Although their charisma was downgraded a bit, the movie was equally good. Cameron created memorable scenes using the aliens, while Jeunet failed to come up anything that catches you off-guard. Even the swimming aliens were somewhat dull. You could see that from a mile and a half away...<br/><br/>And we've now come to the most important aspect of this movie, which could've saved it completely. Characters. Having great characters in a movie is essential to the storytelling. It was Hudson, Hicks, Vasquez, Ripley, Burke, Ash, Lambert, Parker and the others who made the first two movie. In the third movie it was hard to find anyone who matched Ripley, but Clemens came close. Anyhow, that movie at least had decent ones. A:R only has Ron Perlman as Johner, and that's it. And he isn't even playing a character, it's just that he has a certain screen presence which I happen to like. But I couldn't give the slightest damn about anyone in this movie. Not even Ripley.<br/><br/>Well, that's a bit confusing. Ripley is dead, isn't she? Yep. She is. This ""Ripley"" we see in this movie is completely changed. She's an alien. Thus the Alien series lost their most important character, and it's a disaster when you cannot even like the main protagonist in a movie. Her mood, her tone of voice, her remarks, her view... all has changed to... well, alien. She even has acid blood for crying out loud! And no, the problem is not that she was cloned. The problem is that you can't root for a person like this. And in the end, there's no one else left. You don't care about the characters, the story or about the newborn alien, whose design is beyond ridiculous. Come on! Giger is spinning in his grave! Overall, it turns out to be a movie that you don't care about. It's not good, it's not bad, it's completely neutral. So it's right in the centre of your rating system. One viewing is enough, because you can think about what went wrong, and how it could've been better, but that's it. End of story.<br/><br/>5/10"

There are cartoon/comic elements everywhere: These ricochet bullets guns attached to the arms, a guy in wheelchair singing ""Popeye"" song, the crazy scientist playing stupidly with the alien thru a glass, a guy taking off a part of his head and watching it after the alien attacked him, etc. I thought I was watching a ""Roadrunner"" episode.<br/><br/>What director and writers were thinking when they made this garbage? ALIEN IS NOT A COMEDY FOR HEAVEN SAKE! What the other 3 directors built in years fell down in a second with this Alien Resurrection.<br/><br/>More! Ripley is not the Ripley you used to love, she is a clone and also part alien, OK, but she is rude, violent and cold, and smiles stupidly. Who can feel empathy for a character like this? In fact, you cannot feel anything for ANY character in this film. The only good character is the pirate captain but he disappeared too soon.<br/><br/>These aliens are not menacing like in the previous films. You can see too much of them, that makes the horror disappear. And there are also many plot holes. To make matters worse there is a new queen, with a womb... They say Ripley gave her a human reproductive system. Didn't you know a human reproductive system is more than a womb? And the queen is giving birth, but if it is a human reproductive system where is the father? Also the newborn is laughable and disgusting, far far far away from the Giger concept. And this newborn kills the queen just with a blow? What kind of queen is that?<br/><br/>Winona Ryder deserves a special paragraph. How did they cast her in this movie? This midget cannot appear in a sci-fi movie! Probably it was to add more comedy like giant & midget from a circus, just see how stupid she looks when she appears close to the tall Ripley.<br/><br/>This movie gives Alien saga a bad name."
"hydesmith","7","2","4","14 May 2006"," Not great but still has its place in the series
","The first 2 Alien films have gone down in history as two of the best horror/thrillers ever so the final 2 sequels had a lot to live up to. Alien Resurrection was seen in a negative context from the start as it was seen as near ridiculous the main character should come back to life. This often turns out to be the film's main weakness. Ripley in Alien 4 is far from the hero we know and love. I should say now that to do the last 2 films justice you should buy the DVD set and watch the special edition cuts. The special cut features some scenes which really strengthen the plot and Ripley character (e.g. Ripley talks about her memories of Newt from the second film). Alien Resurrection is probably the weakest of the series although it has its moments where it beautifully displays the spirit and atmosphere that Alien is all about (e.gg the cloning lab) unfortunately the characterisation and dialogue are too weak to do these moments justice."

Why resurrect her only to make another movie? Money, anyone? Great possibility. At least, they could have cloned her, but stay with her personality of the past, the great, powerful, kick-ass Lt. Ellen Ripley. But they changed the character completely! Now Ripley's more humorous, smiling all the time, giving us an idea that she's enjoying what's happening around her. And to kill an alien is as funny as it is to kill a monster in a video game for her. Bad consequences? The movie lost all the true alien elements from the previous movies: horror, suspense, fear emanating from the characters, all the essence of the alien movies has gone. And even Alien³ was too, an awful chapter in the quadrilogy, at least, Ripley still has Sigourney Weaver's great performance on her side. Weaver really did a horrible job, playing Ripley in Alien : Ressurrection, and that's a shame and at the same time, funny, since she was nominated for best actress in a leading role for Aliens (1986). And there's still people who think that this movie is ""not great as the others, but still good"". I don't believe it. This movie sucks in every way.<br/><br/>I haven't watched other Jean-Pierre Jeunet movies yet. But if you consider this one, the others must be a disaster. (Or maybe not, because in every artist, there are high and low points). But to insert humor elements in a horror/science fiction saga must have been the idea of a god! Ron Pearlman plays Johner, one of the few great characters in the movie. His presence on screen would be much better, had the movie sustained horror and dark elements from the previous movies. His performance is great, but why kill a spider with a gun and kiss Vriess in the mouth? Must be that god-idea thing. The rest of the cast includes Winona Ryder, Michael Wincott, Gary Dourdan, Brad Dourif and some others. They make a very good list of great actors, but some roles in this movie are pathetic! The action of the movie is quite good, but with no horror elements, like the ones we see in Aliens. When the creatures sneak in the complex right at the end of the movie, when all lights go out and all we see is a red light, we notice how the characters are frightened. They shoot, while at the same time shouting like they'd really die right there. But in A:R, it seems fun to kill aliens. I wonder why they didn't do that Luke Skywalker thing in Episode IV, when Luke and Han are escaping from the death star and fighting some ships in outer space: ""Ha ha! I got them!""<br/><br/>The story might be good, but is completely unnecessary and added nothing to the saga. Breed more aliens using human victims. Then they escape, and... let's hunt some buggies! And, also, the special edition DVD added nothing interesting and I even dare say that it's become even worse than the original version. That beginning credits where the title appears? What the hell was that bug, being squashed by that guy? And the ending was much worse than the original. The dialog's is almost the same, but this time, Ripley and Call actually land on earth. I preferred much more the original where we only see the skies from a high height.<br/><br/>I really do hope they don't make another alien movie. Because the truly good ones were only the first two."

","I loved this movies, the characters and just about every thing about ti including Ripley rediscovering her ""human"" side after being cloned and being part alien. Ryders portrayal of the ""human"" android who is willing to risk her ""life"" to stop the aliens from reaching earth and killing off her fellow ""humans"". and show Ripley what it means to be human, and Ripley shows her that being different is not a bad thing but is what makes us all ""HUMAN"". The only thing that did not sit well was the human/alien born at the end of the movie, it looked like a albino snail and looked so fake because of how waxy it looked that you wanted to laugh at it, it was not in any was scary, and if that had been done better then I could have given this a 10/10 but alas a 9/10 is all I can give, the wax work just was to bad to ignore"

","Good individual performances save an otherwise very ill advised addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>Ropey connections to the main history and the occasional 'Whoa ... look what wee can do with SFX' moments add little to what is otherwise a damn fine set of movies.<br/><br/>The first 'Alien'offerd a trip into the unknown. Aliens said ' we now have an idea what we are dealing with, but the scale of the problem is increased exponentially. #3 tried to return some of the first films aspects of horror an suspense and removed #2's firepower. But now we know exactly what we face and this time we don't really care.<br/><br/>As a stand alone movie, It would probably score a little higher, not least because of the the performances by Weaver, Ryder and Perlman among others making the best possible of the writing provided., but the weight of such formidable predecessors as he first two drag like a millstone around the neck of this film"
"juliebooth","10","2","4","9 August 2004"," THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING!!!
","OK when I first saw this movie I had never seen Alien, I'd seen maybe half of Aliens and I had turned off Alien 3 after half an hour because I thought it was SOO bad (the CGI alien is a DISGRACE)! But I was at a movie marathon and Alien Res was on so I sat through it - AND LOVED IT!<br/><br/>I'm now a massive fan of both Alien and Aliens (Alien 3 still sucks in my opinion and is responsible for killing the 'real' series) but I like each for totally different reasons. Alien has awesome suspense and for its time was completely unique. Aliens has a great story line, brilliant acting and is one of the greatest action films ever!<br/><br/>But Alien Resurrection has everything you saw in the first 3 films but wanted MORE of in close up GORY detail!!! There's evil Ripley who is now truly indestructible, evil doctors, surgically removed chest bursters, lotsa army guys with big guns, a pirate ship crew who get slaughtered one by one, aliens swimming, an alien nest, a hybrid alien, clones-gone-wrong, REALLY corny jokes and CHEST BURSTING AND MORE CHEST BURSTING! It is worth seeing this movie just to see one chestburst through a guys head.<br/><br/>OK but even more than the violence and corny jokes I love the characters. Basically Joss Whedon has just written another 'scooby gang' but they're great. And the movie makes so much fun of itself its hilarious! The doctors explaining to Gen. Perez why she has memories is absolute gold.<br/><br/>If you're not out LOOKING for the greatest movie ever then you'll enjoy this but I can understand why people who were fans of the trilogy saw this and were severely disappointed. I can't say a thing against it though, it has EVERYTHING you could want in an entertaining film.<br/><br/>Who'd you think it was gonna be? SANTA CLAUSE??? - Vriess"
"CSe7en","10","2","4","23 June 2003"," Ressurection from Alien3, this is not.
","Alien Ressurection, we're they taking a pop at Alien3?<br/><br/>This film really really struggles and with more time and less problems on the set it could have been very good instead of very mediocre.<br/><br/>The story is set 200 years after the events of Alien3 and scientists have obtained dna from Ellen Ripley from the prison planet in Alien3. They then set a about creating a perfect clone of Ripley which for some reason, (didn't the alien pop out before she died?)contains an Alien. All a crew of modern day pirates deliever unsuspecting victims to be infected with Alien face huggers. Off course a long the way hell breaks loose the aliens free.<br/><br/>But it's struggles with the one dimensional characters provided by scribe Josh Whedon that may be good enough Buffy but not for an Alien movie. The film may also have done better without the presence of Ripey or do I mean 8, who the whole film seems to be about. A lack of originality, basically this is Alien meets Aliens in a new location and some really strange and arty direction by Jeunet, there are a lot better established in this genre directors e.g. Renny Harlin. <br/><br/>But the good, the new born Alien though his conception and birth may seem strange, did offer something original and new. The sets are impecable giving a gothic outlook to the film and then there is the cinematography which looks impressive.<br/><br/>I really do hate Johner, who comes out with lines off, ""I don't get it, it must be a chick thing."" and ""I'm not a mechanic, I mostly just hurt people."" and for some reason calls Virese 'Ironside' who people now don't understand so I doubt they will in the far far off future.<br/><br/>Will we witness the true Alien Ressurection, it all depends on Alien5."
"harrs","10","2","4","11 July 1999"," The best sequel ever!
","I have always loved the Alien series and Alien Resurrection couldn't have been better! AR would've s*cked without Ripley and I am grateful that the producers brought her back. Nonetheless, there's a major difference between this installment compared to its predecessor (Alien 1, 2 & 3); the characters have more powerful weapons to kick those aliens' ass! I loved Ron Perlman's character, at first he acted like a total jerk (on the Betty) but later he turned out to be a good guy! However, I felt sorry for both the queen and her newborn, as they were both killed. (The newborn killed the queen and then Ripley killed the newborn). I even find it laughable in the scene where the aliens have escaped and one of them sneaked into the escape pod and killed all the soldiers. As for the ending, I didn't like it a bit!! WHY did the alien have to be sucked out of the spaceship?? And HOW did it get aboard? Like in Alien and Aliens, no explanation is offered as how did they managed to sneak in and then in all of a sudden, they showed up from nowhere and jumped on their preys! I certainly hope this sequel is the conclusion to the Alien series and please, NO Alien 5, let Ripley retire for God's sake!!"
"qus","10","2","4","17 June 1999"," I love French sense of humor!
","If ""Alien"" by Ridley Scott wasn't the first and original, I would say that ""Resurrection"" was the best one from the series. The first movie was full of suspense. ""Aliens"" were complete failure - no ideas just a lot of shooting. Third part was very picturesque and poetic. Fourth is just funny and dynamic! If you like the kind of black humor used in ""Delicatessen"" or ""City of lost children"" you will find yourself laughing hard at some moments (unless you're American and can hardly catch the kind of intelligent European humor bursting from this movie) I am not a die-hard fan of Aliens, but it *IS* one of my favorite movies, and having all four of them at home ""Resurrection"" is my most frequent choice, right after ""Alien 3""."

","I am not a horror film fan, but I liked Alien and Aliens, and after seeing the third episode, I thought, it can only get worse. (That was really bad.) But this episode has become my favourite: a lot of action as in Aliens, good characters, (I can't remember any significant character from the first three episode except for Ripley and the droid from Aliens.) Great effects and music. Some deeper thoughts and original ideas unmatched in the first three parts. It had more and finer humour than I-III together. The plot was more original than that of the previous ones. But I think best of all was the choice of the director. Dejeunets french charmeand humour was a real plus. By far the best and most original science fiction movie of this decade."
"johanleupen","7","2","4","4 August 2000"," Effective. Not nearly as terrible as Alien3.
","When David Fincher came along with Alien3 he nearly killed off the entire legacy when he failed to live up to the expectations and plunged Ripley into her death. Fortunately the wonders of Hollywood found a way around this to make yet another installment simply by cloning Ripley, hence Resurrection. It's all a bit too easy for me, but Resurrection does improve upon the last movie. The sets are fantastic, Weaver is still good, and the action is high-paced and exhillarating. Winona Ryder however doesn't belong in an Alien-film or any sci-fi movie for that matter. The story starts off in the right direction but it takes are wrong turn in the end (the newborn-sequence is terribly awkward). As you can see it kind of a mixed bag, although it's ultimately satisfying and it does make you forget about Fincher's screw up with Alien3."

","I hadn't laid eyeballs on this since that matinee back in 1997, so it seemed fresh and new almost. It's less dreary than the previous episode. It actually is more like Aliens, with it's humor and steady stream of action.<br/><br/>Ripley is dead but Sigourney Weaver is back playing a clone instead. It's probably what lured her back a fourth time, playing such a wild variation of the character. That, plus being paid eleven million dollars.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon's script is fun and full of many unique choices and homages to this series and other movies. It's pretty obvious that this was the springboard for Whedon's later TV series, Firefly.<br/><br/>The newborn baby/alien/hybrid creature had the saddest eyes, you almost feel sorry for it when it gets sucked into space in a most nasty manner.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman, classic bad ass, as always!"
"Wuchakk","6","0","0","17 June 2020"," A combo of the first three with a couple fresh ideas
","Two hundred years after Ripley's death in the previous film (Sigourney Weaver), she wakes up as a clone in a space station, which also serves as a colossal vessel. Scientists there are experimenting with xenomorph/human eugenics to create, I guess, the ultimate living weapon. Meanwhile a ship of smugglers visits the station when (big surprise) the aliens escape captivity. Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman play space pirates while Dominique Pinon and Michael Wincott are leaders at the station. Brad Dourif is on hand as a scientist.<br/><br/>""Alien Resurrection"" (1997) is the fourth film in the series and combines elements of the previous three while throwing in a couple of new things. The diverse cast is great but I started to get bored by the end of the first act. Thankfully, the movie perks up with an outstanding underwater sequence that recalls ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972), albeit more amped up.<br/><br/>The peripheral cast is highlighted by the voluptuous Kim Flowers as Hillard and the formidable Gary Dourdan as Christie. But you just know they're the equivalent of red shirts in Star Trek.<br/><br/>If you've seen the first three entries, there's no pressing reason to see this one. It has a been-there-done-that vibe. However, if you appreciate those films and want more of the same with a new cast, ""Alien Resurrection"" is well done for what it is, proficient sci-fi/horror. Armchair critics have been too hard on it. While it lacks the mystery of the first movie and the suspense & utter horror of the second, it has more pizazz than the relatively subdued third installment.<br/><br/>The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-/B"

","Despite Alien3 being a fitting end to the Alien series and Ripley's story Fox had to force through a sequel. After three dark films that all looked like they were set in the same universe, Alien Resurrection went in a different direction because of Joss Whedon's distinct style of dialogue and Jean-Pierre Jeunet unusual visions. The characters did not feel anything like they were in the previous films and it wasn't as funny and fun as it thought it was. There were some good moments like how the Aliens escape captivity and Ripley killing the failed clones. It was the embarrassing sequel in the Alien series that should be locked in a cupboard."

"Dutch90","7","0","0","2 April 2018"," Attack of the Clones
","Alien 3 seemed like and should have been the natural closure of Ripley's arc, and the series as a whole. Ripley sacrificed herself to defeat her extraterrestrial nemesis, and finally found peace after being torn from her home, loved ones and even her own timeline. Alien: Resurrection resets all that by turning to the age-old sci-fi trope of cloning, allowing the deceased character to simply come back. To its credit, the film does try to add something new by returning Ripley as an alien/human hybrid. It is perverse irony that Ripley would end up, albeit partially, becoming the very thing that she fought for so long. Sigourney Weaver, while realizing the material isn't up to par with previous entries in the series (supposedly, she only signed up to stop Fox from making the long-teased Alien/Predator crossover, which they did anyway seven years later), does her best to make this new Ripley interesting by upping the ambiguity of the character - being part Alien, do we even know what side she is on? Still, it's easy to see why this self-aware, sarcastic and superhuman Ripley doesn't appear to core Alien fans - Ripley's appeal wasn't being badass, it was her everyman nature and her brave moral stance against corporate greed, to the point where she gave her own life in order to save humanity from the Company's ill-advised exploitation of a dangerous alien organism. This new Ripley doesn't really seem to care, and condescendingly recounts how she tried to save 'people' once. The film does seem aware of this to some degree, and deliberately casts Winona Ryder's Call in Ripley's old role as the determined anti-Alien crusader who tries to remind Ripley of what she once stood for (and initially distrusting her for being not human, which is somewhat ironic since she herself is revealed to be an android in a potentially interesting moral sub-plot that should have gotten more attention). The rest of the supporting cast do their best, but the script relegates them to stock characters - the evil scientist (Wren), the cool black dude who sacrifices himself (Christy), the amoral seen-it-all smuggler (Elgyn) and the unhinged brawler who just wants to shoot everything (Johner). Leland Orser's Purvis deserves mention for spending the entire film knowing he's going to die a horrible death, and ultimately redeeming his apparent expendability in a final sacrifice (that is, unfortunately, unintentionally funny in execution). <br/><br/>The Aliens themselves have become your average slimy, roaring sci-fi monster, clumsily rendered through 90s era CGI for the first time, although the animatronics look better than ever save for an unneccessary color shift from blue to brown (thankfully corrected in Alien vs Predator) as well as excessive slime. Despite some changes, H.R. Giger's briljant design manages to keep them interesting. It's a shame, then, that the film decides to throw another human-Alien crossbreed into the mix in the form of the Newborn. Arguably one of the most hated elements of the film, the Newborn's main purpose seems to be present a new chief antagonist in the vein of Aliens' introduction of the Queen, and to serve as the punchline to the film's obsession with mingling human and Alien together, as if to say we're not so different from these terrifying monsters as we like to think we are. Given its quasi-innocent nature (it bonds with Ripley as its mother), its death scene seems unnecessarily cruel. But ultimately, the Newborn doesn't belong in the franchise - the Aliens are supposed to be a lethal force of nature, not something we can relate to. That is the human characters' job. <br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection is by no means a terrible film - it's a fun, gory monster ride. It's just that it doesn't entirely seem to understand what it means to be an Alien movie, and would have worked better as a non-Alien film taking cues from the series than an installment of it. It's also sad that the series has opted for Predator crossovers and prequels/reboots rather than continuing the story, as Alien: Resurrection leaves us in a very interesting place: Earth. The series has never set foot on Earth before, and this leaves the story wide open for any direction. Will the Aliens finally reach Earth? Will Ripley 8 come to terms with her Alien DNA? What about Call's struggle with her non-humanity, analogous to Ripley 8? Sadly, we will never know. There were and still are plenty of opportunities for jumpstarting the series from this point, even fixing many of the mistakes that Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Joss Whedon made with Alien: Resurrection."

","A one-off goofy, campy, B-movie comic book throw-away Alien universe film. One last ride but knowing full well the Ripley saga was truly wrapped up in the last one. Again though, as is the case with this franchise, this film has its own personality, look, feel and genre to call its own.<br/><br/>Ripley is a superhero now, and she's explained as emotionally autistic so as to not question why she's so benign the whole film (it's clear Whedon knew not to have her slinging quips the whole film, but he didn't know what else to do with her so he turned her into a superhero, surprise). Whedon apparently complained about the delivery of his lines in this film but I don't know. I think most of the actors are game and his dialogue is just OK.<br/><br/>The bigger problems are the lazy plotting (really, 200 years in the future the company still wants an Alien and they still weren't prepared for acid blood? or had a contingency plan in place...) and the lack of characterization of Ripley. There's nowhere else to take her. The only interesting thread involves Ripley kind of becoming an Alien queen at the end (there's mention of cross hybrid DNA) but this an end game play and it's interesting, it's just too bad it doesn't take up more room in the overall film.<br/><br/>Jeunet is not suspense generator, nightmare-maker, or an action stager. He has some pretty sets, and does well with the beautiful Alien special effects (not the CGI though, shudder). The only indelible image in the whole thing is the final shot of the new white Alien thing getting sucked out of a tiny hole. That looks painful, and it's harrowing to watch - notice that Ripley is almost crying seeing it. It's almost like the film made Ripley a mom again only to have her rip it away from herself, but I'm not entirely sure the film understood that, or knew what to do with it."

It's weird because it actually starts with this really stupid CGI shot of a fly, but it gets much better.

Well, it does lead to a pretty cool scene. The first half hour of this movie is pretty boring too. Around the third part, it does get its best parts because the action is nice. The problem is, this film doesn't bring anything new to the Alien mythology. I guess there is this new alien creature that appears at the end, but even that was poorly designed. Sigourney Weaver is still nice and yes, she actually literally made that backwards basketball shot in the film. **"

Ripley as a morally ambiguous clone is interesting, but the dialogue is laughably outrageous, & the characters are basically a bad parody of the series (what movie is Dan Hedaya even in?!)."

","Well, at least there were no more favored characters to be killed off.<br/><br/>""Alien Resurrection"" is a movie I paid to see in the theater, and I was even disappointed when it fell to ""Flubber"" at the box office. This is just to give you some perspective. Twenty years hence, it plays as something very French, very weird, and way too sluggish (and I'm not all that sure what I saw as a 17 year-old). It's certainly lost any of the spark of its predecessors, and the motley group of smugglers assembled here feels more like systematic xenomorph fodder. Even Ron Perlman(!) is wasted.<br/><br/>What I will say is that Sigourney Weaver embraces the off-kilter vibe of her lab-reproduced Ripley. The character's lost somewhere between human and alien, and she plays it with a mix of cynicism and wicked curiosity. She also has the best scene in the movie when she discovers one of the lab failures that came before here and puts it out of its misery; it's a hard scene.<br/><br/>We can probably all agree that cloning Ripley was a desperate attempt at keeping the series going, and it really shows.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Now just what in space is this carry-on? It's a good bit of fun, if you can excuse the abysmal script and acting from the majority of the cast, particularly Razzie dodger Winona Ryder. Yet, in spite of her now ludicrous character, Sigourney Weaver still puts on a damn good show. Controversially, I actually think this film slightly surpasses Alien 3. Or it's at least as bad as it. Unlike the third film, at least you can have a bit of fun watching this one. Gore galore, sleek alien effects and a few moments of well-crafted tension make it okay to sit through. Nonetheless, the film stands as an unfortunate joke - a sad testament to the poor direction the series took."

","We are 200 years after the last Aliens movie. Ripley (long dead) lives on in clones grown by evil military scientists on a space station for the purpose of hosting alien babies. Yes, these stupid humans see aliens as a species to be exploited.<br/><br/>One Ripley-like clone (not quite human, well played once again by Sigourney Weaver) knows better. When all goes wrong (as she and you know it will), she's joined by a hard-core mercenary crew (including Winona Rider and Ron Perlman) in an effort to escape the doomed space station.<br/><br/>Despite the time leap, this movie captures the spirit of the first and second films. Weaver is great, as are the rest of the cast. Lots of gore, near misses, slimy alien craziness. The clones and crossbreeding were suitably horrifying.

"PeachHamBeach","4","0","0","22 December 2014"," As a standalone, fun & surprising, as a part of the ALIEN legacy, kind of silly!!!
","PLEASE, BE SMART. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS FILM AND DON'T WANT SPOILERS, DON'T READ THIS REVIEW!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>ALIEN: scifi, drama, horror, with a first-rate cast and very spare dry comic relief. ALIENS: scifi,action, horror, with a VERY likable cast, and some fitting comic hysteria from Bill Paxton. ALIEN 3: scifi, drama, horror, a very gifted first time director, and again, very spare comedy, almost no comedy at all, and acting wise, surprising for all of its other disappointments.<br/><br/>ALIEN: RESURRECTION...hmmmm...as a standalone movie, this is kind of a treat as a scifi, horror, camp-comedy. Some pluses: Like ALIENS, it has a lot of action and gunplay, and like ALIENS, it has human villains and hordes of vicious aliens. And I LOVE John Frizzell's score. Completely awesome, evoking horror and suspense. The only score I like better is Jerry Goldsmith's from ALIEN. The cast is pretty good, though I thought a few characters were pointless.<br/><br/>As a member of the ALIEN franchise...perhaps not so much. Minuses: I hated Michael Wincott's sleazy and uninteresting Elgyn and was happy to see him offed early. Kim Flowers' Hillard was pointless as well. Ron Perlman's Johner was insufferable in his character and dialogue: ""So Ripley, I heard you, like, ran into these things before...So, like, what did you do?"" Winona Ryder. As with Ash, there is a big ""reveal"" scene with Call. But she absolutely has no place in this kind of film. Why would an android complain about being ""disgusting""? Just no. <br/><br/>Pluses: I liked Dominique Pinon's Vriess most of the time. I liked Gary Dourdan's Christie, but he was one character whose death was not only too damn early in the film, but totally ridiculous. Was it a suicide to save Vriess' life? Or did an alien grab him once he hit the water and take him under and kill him? Hitting the water from a ladder is not instant death, but the way Vriess was wailing, ""Don't do it, Christie!"" you would swear it was! <br/><br/>More pluses: Brad Douriff played the 2nd most evil scientist I have ever seen in history. J. E. Freeman narrowly exceeds him. This movie is a great scifi illustration of pure instinct vs. pure evil, and Wren is one evil bird. I have always seen the alien xenomorphs as instinctual creatures, not evil ones. Like lions, tigers and bears, they will kill you, but it's not because they are evil, it's because that is what they are hardwired to do, by God, by nature, by evolution, or whatever. Douriff, Freeman and their cronies? Evil as hell. The unholy glee with which these people watch the facehuggers attacking a crew up KIDNAPPED men is very sickening. So, see below...<br/><br/>Big minus: It was bad enough to realize the scientists are evil, no doubt seeking to build an alien army that would strike fear in the hearts of anyone opposing some fascist government somewhere. For this same reason, it was hard to really empathize with any of the pirate crew. The humans are the more evil of the villains. <br/><br/>Big plus: The aliens are only animals...at least until now. Sigourney Weaver delivers again, though I'm not sure why anyone felt this film had to be made. Maybe because ALIEN 3 was so dark and ultimately depressing. <br/><br/>And most certainly, it's preposterous to think the evil scientists could clone an ALIEN queen, as well as a Ripley, but she is great fun nevertheless. Anyway, this ain't the Ripley who died. In their evil experiment, the scientists created a Ripley who has lots and lots of alien DNA in her. In short, she is an alien who is physically a lot more strong, and mentally, a lot less kind-hearted, than her deceased human ancestor. She has just enough of the real Ripley in her to almost remember Newt, but otherwise, she grins instead of frowning when the evil scientists horribly overestimate their ability to ""tame"" and to ""train"" the aliens, and horribly underestimate the aliens' endless capacity for ingenuity. Because these aliens are also descendants of a human being, Ripley, they are ""smarter,"" and not above killing one of their own and using it as a means of escaping their cells. Of course, the alien in ALIEN and the aliens in ALIENS were descended from humans as well.<br/><br/>Ripley 8 is like the aliens, half innocent predatory animal, half intelligent and kind of evil human. She only begins to realize how awful those scientists are when she meets her seven ""sisters"" in the medical lab, how they heartlessly keep one clone alive with tubes and machines. Ripley 8 only begins to become our hero yet again when she decides she must not let her ""children"" live to destroy everyone on pitiful earth, which looks like it's been thru a few nuclear holocausts lately.<br/><br/>I see I am really Over-analyzing this movie. It's great to see the evil Wren get his ultimate reward from one of his victims. It's also great to see the other evil scientists end up in cocoons, but wait! The Queen that they created along with Ripley 8, the OTHER mama to the fearsome xenomorphs evolves from having an insect reproductive system to a human one! No more egg-laying!!! What?! Yes, Queenie now has a uterus!!! She's having another baby!!! What a busy Mom!!! And the only thing freakier than the Newborn itself is Douriff's delirious and hilarious verbal cooing, ""Beautiful, beautiful little baby!!!"" That newborn is the stuff of night and daymares, be warned!!! Strangely enough, many, including myself, feel a little sad (as well as VERY repulsed) by the newborn's death sequence.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 ."
"Joxerlives","8","0","0","18 May 2013"," Third best in the Alien series (but a LONNNGGGG way behind Alien/Aliens)
","Alien is rightfully considered possibly the finest horror/sci-fi film of all time (The Thing and The Fly its' only real competitors, interestingly both remakes). Aliens is the best sci-fi/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. <br/><br/>And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered. Alien; Resurrection was a valiant attempt to put things right and my boy Joss Whedon does a commendable job. But he had a long way to climb after the debacle of Alien 3. <br/><br/>Really Resurrection isn't a great film overall but it has some terrific things about it. Sigourney is great as always, Wionna does OK in her role, the relationship between Cal and Ripley 8 is brilliant and spawned a thousand slash fanfics. You can see the beginnings of Firefly here, even down to a prototype Jane and River. The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. <br/><br/>OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens.<br/><br/>Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! <br/><br/>Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films). She and Cal gaze at the beauty of their world and Ripley observes that she's a stranger to Earth herself...<br/><br/>Ripley has become the alien. I was actually only going to give this film a 7 but thinking of that final scene I've decided to give it 8."
"TrentReznorandAtticusRoss","5","0","0","13 June 2012"," Sorry- was that the sound of Ridley Scott's legacy dying in the background?
","It's interesting when you think about how far movies take their heroine's through sequels. A prime example being, Ellen Ripley, the female protagonist of all the Alien movies, and masturbatory dreams of sit-at-home nerds. In this fourth installment, her journey continues. Sadly. Instead of finding a new face and a new series of what could be a fantastic (or at least interesting) franchise, we have to stick to the same old' same old' Ripley. Trust us, she's not all bad, she's still as kick ass as we've seen her in previous movies, but now it's not the same Ripley. There's no real reason to bring back / or revive - a lead character that so heroically died in the previous installment. <br/><br/>Although, there are some highlights. There's a bit more exploration of the human mind, a good example being Ripley and Call, who happens to be a droid, the first female one we've seen - but not enough to suffice for a decent addition - having dreams. It also explores the human nature of curiosity - there's a scene where Brad Dourif gets a little too... Comfortabe with being up close to an alien. Then there's the human side of the slime-stick monster. Brillianty (but unnecessarily) shown through the 'intimate' moment with the Alien. There's also another great human/Alien scene where the Alien's 'argue' over who's gonna die for their escape. Ripley is now also in touch with her Alien side. She's also been stripped down to wearing leather pants and a leather waistcoat. An elegant solution to restraining a very dangerous 'thing'. There needs more talking scenes, instead of more gore and profanity. The other female protagonist, Call, played by Winona Ryder, probably has the most attention here. <br/><br/>John Frizzel's score is also a down-point. James Horner's score for Aliens was about as epic as you could get. And who could forget Jerry Goldsmith's score for he film that started it all? Elliot Goldenthal's score for Alien 3 screamed pop culture (then again, don't all of David Fincher's movies do?) and was very junk-yard. It was quite hard to digest, but Goldenthal's later scores were pretty amazing. But Frizzel's score for the film is also by far the worst. He tries to d beautifully disturbing, with a hint of epicness- that's just a very bad combination. His score was too soft, and far too loud. <br/><br/>Jean's direction was pretty O.K. Although, this is more like starship troopers - a B-movie with a big budget. I wasn't a fan of in in-your-face camera close ups. The film suffered from pacing problems also. The speed of the film is sped up to a depressingly short telemovie."

","This is a sad sack compared to the other movies, even alien 3. It feels like a low budget b sci movie. The story is dumb and the writing is pretty bad, everything feels hackneyed, cheap, and unrealistic. Ripley is just laughable as a clone which picked up a bit of alien dna upon her resurrection, giving her a silly nasty attitude, which comes off as just plain stupid - and she's given lots of dumb one liners to match her cheesy sneer. It's really a bloody embarrassment, all in all, yet the action is interesting enough to keep you til the end, barely. I won't ever watch it twice for sure. I guess someone just wanted to make another buck off the series, I can't figure why, with all the talented people in the industry, they came up with this crap."

","I actually think this film is pretty decent. It's not as bad as the haters say, but don't get me wrong - it is certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not as good as the two first ones. As Howars Hawks said: ""a film consists of three good scenes and no bad ones"". I believe there are three good scenes in this movie; the underwater scene, the scene where Ripley discovers the other 7 clones and the scene where the unborn is sucked into space (I love Ripley's face when her ""son"" is tortured to death)- but sadly there is also some very bad scenes. I like the characters from the ""Betty"" even though they are a little stereotypical action types, and I also like some of Jeunet's directing, especially with the visuals. One thing he does very wrong though is that he starts the action right away and he goes with cheap jump-scares. He should have built the tension like Scott did in ""ALIEN"" and then showed us some good action like Cameron in ""ALIENS"". I'm not even gonna mention ALIEN3. But in my opinion the fourth installment is a decent film, and worth watching."
"Three-Jane","9","0","0","25 June 2009"," Pity for the Monster - The Convergence (Spoilers !)
","Alien is one of the rare cases, when follow-ups worked and brought up films as good as the first. Perhaps due to the fact, that every sequel was made by another great director and had another Ripley character growing more and more adapt to the superhuman forces involved here. And that there was some kind of development of the alien species. Perhaps also due to the co-production of S.Weaver, who might protect her Sgt. Ripley against decay.<br/><br/>Alien is hard SF and hard SF is about possibility alone, neither about reality as the crime genre nor about myth as fantasy and horror. It is not at all the task of SF-authors to make real predictions - do you think they'd not work as engineering inventors or in policy, should they be capable of that ? No SF classic describing a nearer future as ""1984"", ""Brave New World"", ""20.000 miles under the sea"" has come only near to reality.<br/><br/>That is why hard SF is about possibilities. And the reader/spectator has to accept superluminal transit, for example. Attempts to fill the gap must inevitably fail by the missing scientific qualifications of the authors. In ""Solaris"" the alien is sending tormenting hallucinations to men - so far no problem - and Stanislav Lem tries to elaborate them as ""neutrino bundles"". That is ridiculous - in my view the only flaw of this masterpiece, but a severe.<br/><br/>Fortunately there is nothing like ""neutrino bundles"" in Alien 4. But unfortunately there are essentials of the plot too far from possibility. To pick out only one: The DNS Ripley 4 is made from could not have withstood the heat of the fumace in Alien 3. At the good end the plot has a marvellous outline and the length of IMDb's quote list proves the quality of the dialogue. A good part of its laconic humour comes from Ripley 4's alien nature and is quite appropriate. Nevertheless these holes are the main reason for me not to give a 10.<br/><br/>Slightly off-topic: For me Alien 1 is fine, but the poorest of the series. The only feeling it gives us is an always identical mixture of disgust and fear. It has a very very well done rhythm of terror and it has Sgt. Ripley, but these are the only extraordinary features - too poor for a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Ressurrection is using constants of the former sequels: Powerful Ripley against claustrophobia, militarism, feasibility obsession of degenerate scientists and against haunting aliens. Birth, spaceships with the flavor of lube, little colours.<br/><br/>This Ripley 4 is no more human at the beginning and S.Weaver is playing the alien and her development of what we call humanity extremely well letting us never forget Ripley 4 is post-human. The salvation of her misbred precursor models is showing her first tears and very moving.<br/><br/>And as Ripley 4 is more alien, the aliens make a move towards us. We never learned, what might be in the alien's minds. Alien 1 even let the question open, whether this species is intelligent or not, at least since Alien 3 we have learned it is. Here we are told of extreme abilities of that intelligence. And the reprieving of Sgt. Ripley in 3 was a first step to the Newborn recognizing Ripley 4 as his mother here (who is in fact his physical grandmother).<br/><br/>Thus this sequel 4 is consistent further development of the former. It is consequent to enrich the story with elements of the initial contact genre adding something to the series i always missed (there is another initial contact - that of the scientists to Ripley 4). And it is completely in the anti-militaristic line to overcome the terror that these simultaneously insectoid and lizard-like beasts are spreading - in a sense we spectators are reliving the process Ripley's feelings at them are going through.<br/><br/>The Newborn is an Alien Queen's creation in direction to mankind. The Queen apparently has understood the small child pattern. But creation under pressure and possibly the Newborn is misbred. Any remarks on his guise should be made with this possible narrative intention of misbredness in mind.<br/><br/>That scenes with him led me to the hope, he might survive tamed by Ripley 4. And to pity with his death. That is an equally logical and amazing climax of the whole series. Pity for this ugly and deathly monster - an extraordinary experience impossible with anything else than a great movie."

Certainly this film (directed by French stylist Jean-Pierre Jeunet) is an improvement over Alien 3, with a script that breathes exciting new life into the franchise. This chapter is set even further in the future, where scientists on a space colony have cloned both the alien and Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who died in Alien 3; in doing so, however, they've mixed alien DNA with Ripley's human chromosomes, which gives Ripley surprising power (and a bad attitude). A band of smugglers comes aboard only to discover the new race of aliens--and when the multi-mouthed melon heads get loose, no place is safe. But, on the plus side, they have Ripley as a guide to help them get out.

When the Auriga is set to automatically pilot back to Earth, its up to Ripley and the smugglers to stop the Auriga and escape with their lives.<br/><br/>After the great conclusion of ""Alien 3"", I really thought there shouldn't be another sequel, but there is.

I'm with the people who called ""Alien: Resurrection"" the worst of the bunch.<br/><br/>When saying ""worst"", I don't mean it's a horrible or stupid film. I actually liked the first hour and ten minutes. This film is by far the best looking film from the series. Obviously, modern technology has grown. The special effects are much better and the Alien make-up looks much scarier.<br/><br/>And although some franchises get a little repetitive and boring, this film manages to use some new ideas. On the down side, the new ideas are a bit awkward and uncomfortable to get use to. This movie is unlike the previous three films. Instead of a movie driven by characters and its plot, it's driven by visuals and action, which is called a popcorn movie.<br/><br/>I'm all for a popcorn Alien movie, like ""Alien vs. Predator"", which I truly enjoyed. Yeah, this film has cheesy one liners and constant chase sequences. What I didn't like about this film as a popcorn film is that the film falls apart by the last 45 minutes into the film. It all gets ridiculous and stupid.<br/><br/>There's also a time in this franchise where you are all Aliened out. I felt that way when watching this film. Sigourney Weaver's performance is decent but she acts like a jerk, for some unknown reason. Another good performance was from Winona Ryder.<br/><br/>If you're up for another Alien movie, go ahead and watch this one. It certainly gives you something new and awkward at the same time.

If you aren't really a fan and just want some entertainment, then this movie can be recommended. Its strange that they went for a weirdass and improbable story like this when they had tons of ideas for Alien 3 which they never even implemented? The movie can possibly be much more entertaining than Alien 3 which tries to be a horror but fails a lot at it because they ended up implementing the worst ideas. Even so, Alien 3 has slightly higher production values and suspense. But Alien 4 is just plain old fun to view. Both Alien 3 and Alien 4 cannot be put in the league of the first two parts. My guess is that the next Alien movie if ever made, would be a remake of sorts, going to back to the derelict ship, being explored by a humanoid race other than humans."

That being said, Jean-Pierre Jeunet did with it what he could. There wasn't much to do to it, but at least he made it look pretty! And, of course, there's Dominique Pinon, who has been in every single film by Jeunet that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I thought the Alien series was great, but it had a good closer with Alien3. If you like French films by artistic directors, and you want to see what directors do when given an American-action-movie palette to paint with, then watch this flick. Otherwise, pass Alien: Resurrection by."

","I have seen a lot of comments that have completely bashed this movie.. i am not sure why. I enjoyed it a lot more then i enjoyed Alien 3 or Alien vs Predator. ""PLOT OUTLINE"" this movie is set about 200 years after Alien 3 where a group of scientists are breeding aliens. They stumble upon Ripley who of course is dead. They take DNA samples of her and clone her. When they opened her up they found that she was breeding an alien. A different species of Alien, half human half alien. Ripley is cloned and taught everything over again with some memories of her past life. Then another group of so called ""pirates"" joins the scientists ship when all HELL breaks loose. This movie is very good in my opinion with a strong cast with Sigourney Weaver, Winonna Ryder, Ron Pealman, Dan Hedya, and others. The pace is very good never boring, great creature effects and gore. This one probably has the most gore out of the whole ALien series. The aliens are no longer people in suits they are now CGI monsters which on some levels could turn fans away. After all is done i have to say that i really liked Alien Resurrection. 8/10"

","Let's get the obvious out of the way - this film had nothing on either Alien or Aliens. Having said that, it is still enjoyable, and much better than Alien 3.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the script contains many flaws, and I personally feel the ending was somewhat out of place. Yet Alien: Resurrection is a very captivating film to watch, for one main reason. Due to it being a Jean-Pierre Jeunet flick, the film is packed full of unique and unusual visual ideas (the 'Viper Pit' scene stands out somewhat), and the film as a whole has a brooding, creepy atmosphere.<br/><br/>In terms of content and pace, it falls somewhere between the dark, eerie atmospherics of Alien, and the action-heavy bravado of Aliens.<br/><br/>Actors Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott and Sigourney Weaver are outstanding. However, I feel that Brad Dourif should have had a much bigger role. But hey, we can't win 'em all, can we?<br/><br/>Overall, despite it's flaws, it's still a good all-round film. 6/10"

This is more like a hack'n'slash - parody of the whole thing, more fitting for us gore hounds and slasher fans than the ones who like the serious cyberpunk/sci-fi/horror - tone of the first two. The approach of director Jeunet to Aliens (TM) is truly very different from what we have seen in the first three: it's optimistic (almost up to a point of being 'lighthearted'); highly enlighten instead of things happening in the dark; and way too grislingly blood'n'guts-gory to be taken seriously. Instead of horror we've got one-liners like for crying out loud!

","WARNING - MINOR SPOILERS.<br/><br/>There's a lot right with this movie, but there's a lot wrong as well, which makes it a very hard nut to crack.  For every good point, there's something not quite right.  The plot itself is sound, if a bit 'seen it all before', but why wait 200 hundred years to bring back Ripley?  It could have been two weeks, or a month.  How long does it take to clone someone in the future? 200 hundred years is too much.  57 was about right for ALIENS.  And for two hundred years beyond the events of ALIEN 3, things are pretty much the same technology wise. In fact they may have taken a backward step!!!<br/><br/>My biggest bugbear with Resurrection, as it was with part 3, is that we see far too much of the damn aliens.  Did no one notice why the first two were so scary?  You never got a good look at the beasty.  You filled in the blanks with your imagination which made it more terrifying than any guy in a suit (excellent suit though it was).  Now you get long, lingering shots of the alien, dribbling on the floor, swimming gracefully, dodging bullets!!! Not in the least bit scary, which is probably why the newborn failed so miserably.  I personally thought the newborn wasn't too bad.  Looked like a cross between a human and an alien to me (love the human eyes). <br/><br/>
The Special Edition threw in a few mixed moments.  The references to Newt were a real bonus and add to Ripley's character no end, but the knowledge that 'the company' was bought out by Wal-Mart is simply laughable.  Wal-Mart for God's sake!!!  The new opening credits were okay, but needed a hell of a lot more work in the CGI department.  What was the badly drawn thing supposed to be?  Ditto for the new ending.  Nice to allow Ripley to set foot back on Earth, but at least make it look a bit better.  Still, nicely ambiguous.  Why is Paris (or Blackpool as someone said) in such a state? Did we do it, or have the aliens already landed?  It's a nice premise for part 5, but please God, ask Ridley Scott to direct, and bring back the species that crewed the derilect from the first film.  That way, it can all tie back into one cycle and the circle will be complete - no more mediocre Alien films, and perhaps Sigourney Weaver can turn her talents to something else.  Maybe it's not too late to avoid total typecasting.<br/><br/>All in all, an okay film, with some good moments and nice music, average acting and OTT gore.  Should have been better. *** out of *****"

"calculon00","8","0","0","13 March 2004"," Good Sci-fi movie, mediocre Alien movie
","Don't get me wrong, I love Alien Resurrection.  As sci-fi goes, its one of the best, but it makes a mediocre Alien movie.  And to those who think they should let this series `die', the only reason most people feel that way is because the series has been going down-hill.  If they make an excellent Alien 5, it would completely justify continuing the series.<br/><br/>First off, I want to express how frustrated I am at the scenes that were cut in the theatrical release of Alien Resurrection.  In the uncut version in the Alien quadrilogy, there is this scene where Ripley is getting her intelligence tested by naming the pictures that are shown to her that was cut.  In the uncut version, there is a shot where she is presented with a picture of a girl, which clearly reminds her of Newt from Aliens.  These few seconds were cut from the scene in the theatrical release which would have added greatly to the movie, as it shows that the movie does not forget its roots and gives the Ripley character more personality and emotion.<br/><br/>Another cut shot which should have been included is during the scene where Call and Ripley are in the ships chapel and Call is hacking into the ships computer.  Ripley tells Call that she remembers a girl who was very important to her, but now she can't even remember her name.  This should have been included for the same reasons and the first cut shot.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder and Sigourney Weaver do excellent performances in this movie (Pretty much all the acting is done well), but I think the key thing that this movie and Alien 3 were flawed in was that they showed the Alien too much, taking away all its terror.  Perhaps that is why the latest two movies are not as good as the first two.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is good sci-fi, but needs more focus on the actual characters.  While they all did have good development (Except for General Parez, who seems to be the stereotypical, stupid-military guy.) they needed the personality detailing that the first Alien movie had.  That way the audience actually cares when they die.<br/><br/>If they do make an Alien 5, I hope that more focus will be on Ripley and her emotional struggle at all the loss she's endured in her lifetime."

"Mr_Triboro","5","0","0","19 August 2003"," Crippled by Joss Whedon's inability to be talented
","There was no need for 'Alien Resurrection', I'll say that right now. 'Alien3' for all it's execution flaws, had it's heart in the right place. The alien is dead, with Ripley killing herself to prevent is falling into the wrong hands. I thought that was it. Most people thought that was it. Enter 1997. Enter 'Alien Resurrection'.<br/><br/>First of all, the problem is this doesn't FEEL like an 'Alien' film. The pace is too rushed, some of the scenes too comicky. I cite the scene where General Perez removes part of his own brain as an example. The visuals are beautiful and it's obvious Jeunet is a very talented director. Unfortunately his style doesn't really suit the film. It's too bright, the colours too flashy. The aliens are obviously CGI, and it is actually disconcerting to realize that they are already looking dated. They have lost all sense of reality with their environment. 'Alien' used a suit, and for the most part it looks more real than it's brothers in 'Resurrection'.<br/><br/>But the main problem of 'Alien Resurrection' is the script. Joss Whedon has disowned the film, yet the film bares a great resemblance to what he wrote. We have the cliche characters, the tacky dialogue, the need for a finale monster at the end (I actually didn't mind The Newborn, even if a lot of people did. It was a realistic and unhappy blend of the alien and the human. What Whedon originally wrote, before somebody with common sense told him to make something more realistic, is so utterly laughable it defies belief) and the completely out of place ""humour"" It's ironic a lot of people hated the characters in 'Resurrection' seeing as their ancestors are present in 'Aliens' In fact, it's painfully obvious Whedon is a fanboy. As it is, 'Alien Resurrection' is the perfect reason why fans of 'Aliens' should not be allowed to write an 'Alien' film. Joss Whedon is, without a doubt, a complete hack. If you've ever seen 'Angel' you'll know the digs at 'Resurrection' are about as subtle as a sledge hammer.<br/><br/>Another problem with 'Alien Resurrection' (and hey, it's rooted in the script. How about that?) is it's complete lack of pace. There is zero tension or suspense after the aliens have broken loose. Word to the wise, Whedon, you can't have characters strolling down an empty ship one minute and expect your audience to be scared at a loud noise when you've built nothing behind it. The aliens aren't scary. They're interesting to watch, but they've really become more of a technical excersise. There is nothing in the way of the ultimate threat present in 'Alien' The aliens are really more of a nuisance. They pop in, they die. All of the other films established the terror of the aliens. If you encountered one, you would die. Not here. Now you make half witty wise cracks. Like all films caked in ""the 90s"" factor.<br/><br/>I probably shouldn't blame the faults of this film ALL on Whedon, but the childish way he's attacked the film after it's release really annoy me. That, and the fact is most of the film IS his fault. I hope you email me, Whedon. Maybe then I'll get an apology. Five out of ten."

Of course, there was ""Se7en"", but he only had a bit part in that.  Anyway, like I said, ""Gore"" made a good decision signing on for this movie.  This is definitely ""Gore""'s best movie.<br/><br/>Do you find the above paragraph a little strange?  Well, believe it or not, it's true, because gore seems to be the main character of ""Alien: Resurrection.  It certainly isn't Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), playing a character who was already killed off in the last one (but hey, logic doesn't matter when it comes to producers making money).  After you see ""Alien: Resurrection"" you'll agree that gore has the most screen time in this pathetic excuse for a movie.<br/><br/>The 'story' focuses on Ripley being 'resurrected' (or cloned, but they decided to go with a biblical reference) because the company needs the alien to use as a weapon.  The alien, of course, gets free and starts to kill off everyone on the ship.  Only Ripley (who is now Super Ripley because of a weird bond she now shares with the alien) can save the human race from the alien!<br/><br/>The only thing I was ever confused about for the Alien movies was just, why is ""The Company"" so eager to get a new weapon?  Throughout the entire series I've never heard of any opposition there is towards The Company, and The Company seems to be the dominant ruler of the Universe.

","Having just watched Aliens: Resurrection, I was reasonable impressed. The makers had enough new ideas to justify making another sequel. You see, sequels aren't that bad if they create a new story, a movie that can stand on it's own.<br/><br/>They almost succeeded with Resurrection. Ripley is older (48), but still strangely attractive. Being a part Alien hybrid this time around, she is also a lot meaner, although not enough in my book. I would have liked to see more of her vicious side, because a bad good guy/gal would have really spiced things up. Turning the obligatory cold, calculating and logical android (in previous movies played by Ian Holm and Lance Henriksen) into cute, emotional, cuddly  but physically just as tough Wynona Ryder, is a new touch too. A touch that shows some evolution in thinking of what future computers and robots are going to be like - after all the first movie was made in 1979. There are some gross-out moments when Ripley discovers her mutant siblings, showing a side to cloning no one will easily forget (although for an experiment set in the future, it looks awfully crude - don't they have better control of genetics 200 years from now?).<br/><br/>The problem comes with the structure of the story. The story is really simple. Rogue captain Dan Hedaya is conducting experiments in ""restricted space"" to clone alien-human hybrid Ripley and bring a few of the critters back to planet earth. Michael Wincott and his crew of space pirates come across the ship, mess around and kill much of the crew. Then, and this is where the movie really lets you down, it becomes a ""let's get to the shuttle before the aliens get us"" routine that-we've-seen-in-every-single-rendition-of-this-franchise. And some more movies like Pitch Black with Vin Diesel. Why do script writers find it so difficult to write a new, interesting ending to their movies? That's the major problem. The race for the capsule is almost as big a cliché as the shootout.<br/><br/>See it if you love the previous movies, and if not see it for free on cable for some cheap thrills."

The 3""-wide trailer seemed to promise something on part with Aliens.<br/><br/>Of course it did.  It was a trailer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what turned out what a misguided effort.  Joss Whedon, the writer, obviously was not the last word on the script, despite the credits. He knows how to write a pretty complete story, and he never fails with characterization.  Ripley's the only one who has any sort of Whedon touch, and she spends much of the time near-catatonic.  The idea of making her a xenomorph hybrid was brilliant, and gave her a new dimension besides alternating between petrified and vengeful.  However, the logic behind her revival just sucks.  I have no doubt that the trench-coated, icy scientists of 400-odd years from now could clone you from blood samples.  However, that's not bringing what's in your chest back.  If I eat a ham sandwich and die afterwards, they can clone me a thousand times in the year 2453, and they'll never bring back that ham sandwich.  And I won't come back as some human/ham sandwich mix.  As cool as that would be.<br/><br/>I thought the film had great atmosphere until I saw ""City of Lost Children"" and realized the director basically copied himself.  Jeunet's happily redeemed himself with Amelie, but that doesn't help this film.  The action tends towards the close-up, blurry variety, except for a couple of set pieces involving improbable bounced gunshots.  I found it stupid that six or seven well-armed people couldn't face a few Aliens.  Especially considering the well-lit hallways they faced them in.  The Marines in ""Aliens"" had no idea what they were facing, and they were in the dark.  No such luck here. In the ladder sequence, three armed characters just stop and stare while a crippled man fights for his life for about twenty minutes.  And I just don't think it'd be that hard to shoot something two feet below you on a ladder.<br/><br/>I will give props to the clone and basketball scenes.  I just wish that they, and uber-Ripley, could have been in a different film.<br/><br/>So the point of my whole review is, just make Aliens vs. Predator already.

Weaver, who sported 4 hairstyles from the 4 pictures, here perpetually damp-haired, is exceptional, as usual. Wynona Ryder, pert and small-boned, is mis-cast as a heroic type; other characters are either obnoxious or undeveloped. The Alien costumes, almost black, are ferocious and look great, except for the underwater sequences. There, they are CGI-created, and look cartoony and lack weight and enough blackness. The film's best sequence is an emotional one, with Weaver finding the lab of previous failed dead clone experiments of herself, culminating in the discovery of a live one.

","""You don't dare kill it"" said Yaphet Kotto of the original alien's tendency to use acid for blood. Well, the IMDB User Reviews seem to be using their own acid to kill off Alien Resurrection.<br/><br/>It is, as of this writing, five years after the film's release, and the bile keeps flowing over Alien 4. I'm not going to spew acid. I don't like the movie either, it's true. But adding more bile to the brew would be redundant. Instead, I'd like to put Alien 4 in context by rekindling a little fire underneath Ridley Scott's original movie.<br/><br/>Scott is on record as saying that he took the job because the script was tight, direct, plain and simple. In other words, it was a nice blank canvas for his great visual skills to run free. His one and only aim was to make a frightening film, and because he was Ridley Scott he also made, by default, a very beautiful film. Beauty and fear is one hell of a mix.<br/><br/>Part of Alien 1's success lies in its simplicity. The dialogue is terse and functional - almost Kubrickian in its deliberate banality - and is delivered with documentary conviction by a superb cast of legitimate actors. Not stars. Actors.<br/><br/>The script is not weighed down by back-story. It finds no need to explain anything beyond what we see and, more importantly, feel. That was all it needed to work. There was no baggage with Alien, no anally retentive fans to complain that such and such a piece of trivia was inconsistent with Bishop's this, or Ripley's that from an earlier Alien movie. There was no tedious Lord Of The Rings/Star Wars type lore and mythology to be beholden to. None of that bilge had set in. Not yet. Rather, it is a simple story about seven people facing one big problem. But Scott's and Geiger's vision made it a richer experience than anything in the increasingly complex Alien stories to come. Alien 1 is simple in intention, but baroque in execution. There is imagery here which reaches deep into the subconscious. It lingers there.<br/><br/>
The critic Leslie Halliwell called Alien's imagery 'half-assed poetry' (at least Halliwell, a habitual movie reactionary, recognised that it had poetry). I'd take Scott's half-assed poetry over Cameron's simple minded Vietnam revenge allegory any day (aliens as surrogate 'gooks'? A disgusting, NRA wet dream). And I'd take Scott's half-assed poetry over Alien 3's laughable pretentiousness.<br/><br/>And then there was Alien Resurrection. Alien Resurrection - it's a painfully ostentatious title. This hopefully final installment of the series is a typical Hollywood product of the 1990's and remains a good example of what was to come in the following decade. It has speed but no grace. It has surface gloss but no texture. It substitutes escalating dread with repulsive gouts of blood. It replaces crisp dialogue with disconnected strings of would-be hip one-liners (a common practice that works for a trailer but kills the actual film stone dead). Worst of all is the film's smug portentousness - the ultimate fate of all film sagas.<br/><br/>So, what happened to bring this about? Money happened. The need to make it. Scott's poetic vision was long gone, or at least too expensive by then for the producers to re-hire. Yet those producers were haunted by that poetry. Half-assed or not, they needed it. They also needed some 'class' to counter balance the goofy, MTV-style script they had bought from the man who wrote Buffy The Vampire Slayer. And so they imported it, fresh from France. Enter Jeunet.<br/><br/>Jeunet had a reputation as an art-house director, yet by even considering this project, he immediately relinquished any claims to 'art'. He certainly didn't achieve it in the movie. Many reviewers claim that Alien 4 has a strong, distinct visual style. But I agree with the reviewer who pointed out the studio-bound look of the film. In fact it more resembles an expensive TV movie. Both Scott and indeed David Fincher used long lenses and peripheral lighting to give a sense of depth and life to their pictures. Jeunet used shorter lenses and hard, textureless lighting to render a crisper but flatter look - probably so that it would 'look' better on a TV screen. It would seem that Monsieur Jeunet sold his art house and bought a condo in Malibu.<br/><br/>Acidic bile is creeping into this review. Must be time to stop.<br/><br/>
I'll finish with what may seem an odd notion. I believe that if another Alien film is made, and I don't think it should by the way, then it should be helmed by a British director. This is not idiotic nationalism. It is an acceptance of the fact that there is something in the British psyche which is uniquely suited to the original concept of Alien: innate morbidity. It's the same quality which Hitchcock brought to the American scripted Psycho, and which pervades even the cheesiest Hammer film.<br/><br/>Horror is in the blood of British film makers. Directors after Scott would spout pseudo sociological waffle about how the alien is an allegory of AIDS, Vietnam, the role of the family, corporate greed, etc. This is an over-conceptualised, self-conscious and quintessentially American set of views. Scott's own publicly stated appraisal was much less Sunday supplement friendly. To him the alien is death incarnate. Full stop. Nothing half-assed about that."

","I think I like this movie more than the original Alien. It was smart. It was up-to-date. It was interesting, and lacking of dull, sluggish moments that other Alien films have had. The method behind re-incarnating Ellen Ripley is much more acceptable than other ""resurrections"" in the past. Namely, my Halloween reference, of which the latest installment is just horrible and stupid. Unlike the previous ""definitive"" Alien movies, there is ample room for this saga to continue. Though, let's hope it is not as choppy and random as some other un-mentioned movie series. All in all, a great movie. Don't bother watching all of the Aliens for clues, plots, and stories. This one stands all on its own."

","This was yet another series that was condemned to the pit of mediocrity thanks to the late 90's. How dare they come along and destroy this wonderful series of films. Its predecessor Alien 3, was an average film. But side-by-side, it is Shakespeare in comparison with a primary schools Nativity play. Joss Whedon is the man who gets the blame, a writer also responsible for such fallacies as Buffy The Vampire Slayer and (cough) Parenthood. No wonder Alien Resurrection fell flat on its face.<br/><br/>Instead of characters believable, and at least respectable, you will wish them away, hoping the beasts will devour them one by one. Most of them fall victim anyway, but it's far too long to endure their horrible lines. Does using the f-word make a character? Does Winona Ryder gain respect since you see her in every movie from Heathers to Beetlejuice? Her acting is terrible in this film. Listen at her use the f-word to make her sound scary. Aww, bless, she tried.<br/><br/>Not only is the story and script a complete failure, but also the exposure of aliens. Ripley is related to them since the predecessor  but turns against them to help a band of space hijackers? Nice one Joss. Even the new breed of alien, look like old childrens TV mascot Gilbert the green alien who seems to have got mixed up in the toxic waste from Robocop. They are disappointinly non-scary and instead rather comical.<br/><br/>It gets worse All fantasy aspects of the series being in another place entirely are shattered in the closing moments. The hijackers are driving towards earth! Thanks for fond memories of some of the greatest sci-fiction ever guys and then vomiting all over them. Good job."

","Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), last seen leaping into a flaming pit in Alien 3, has been brought back from the dead. Seems she was impregnated before her suicide plunge, and we need her alive and breeding for the popular sci-fi/horror series to continue. Ripley, who has been cloned from a blood sample, has just given birth (would you call this a C-section?) to the ugliest little sucker this side of Uranus. Welcome to Alien Resurrection. This fairly engaging sequel may not be as scary as Ridley Scott's Alien or as action-packed as James Cameron's Aliens, but at least Ripley has hair. Weaver gets some good lines and is an energetic force cloning around at the center of this very particular universe. The supporting cast is colorful too, including Brad Dourif, Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon.  The Frenchman at the helm certainly has a way with atmosphere. Cinematography, lighting and set design are tops. A terrific underwater chase scene also left me breathless. Too bad much of the plot seems jumbled, at times I just wasn't sure for whom I was supposed to be rooting, or why. The drooling, slimy aliens themselves are technical marvels, I guess, but too familiar to be very frightening. One drawback, Winona Ryder, who seemed to have booked a ride on the wrong flight. Here she's just a little girl lost in space. Interesting note, Aliens Resurrection's screenplay is by Joss Whedon, who also wrote TOY STORY. Now that's a change of pace."

","Eh.  I've seen A:R twice, and really wasn't able to get into it much either time.<br/><br/>One of the biggest weaknesses in my opinion is that I never had much sympathy for the group of 'protagonists'.  Unlike the crew of the Nostromo in A1 who were basically a bunch of innocents considered 'expendable' by the greedy Company; unlike the confident Marines in A2 who find themselves in over their heads and looking to Ripley for help; unlike the inmates in A3 who've found God and, for all their flaws and foul language, see a spiritual side to the battle...this new group is basically a bunch of scumbag mercenaries.  Charles Dutton's character in A3 frankly admitted his crimes, but at least he had scruples.  This group seemingly has none.  They're just unpleasant.<br/><br/>Another problem is a lack of suspense.  Maybe it's the effect of three movies, but the 'in-between' sequences - when the aliens are off-screen - seem too empty to build much suspense.  I watched ""Aliens"" on cable the other day, and even having seen it probably more than any other film in the series, I still got a feeling of dread when they showed the exoskeleton-looking stuff when the Marines were looking for the colonists. With A:R, I simply got *impatient* waiting for the alien to jump out from somewhere.  And what is with that funky-looking hybrid alien at the end? It looked like Odo (from Star Trek: Deep Space 9) after getting splashed with acid.  It didn't look menacing...just ugly.<br/><br/>Good points:  Sigourney Weaver is excellent as usual, and she saves A:R from being a complete waste.  The scene where she finds the failed clones is chilling.<br/><br/>But overall, the series ended for me at Alien 3.  Though I'll still probably see A5 if it is made."

","""Alien"" was an original: suspenseful, haunting, claustrophobic. ""Aliens"" was the most popular part, but the one I didn't like because I just experienced it as very boring all in all. ""Alien³"" was very dark, but in its darkness it really had power. ""Resurrection"" is indeed much more suspenseful than ""Aliens"", but it's just too obviously just stupid.<br/><br/>It doesn't really seem to be a bad movie, because it is very entertaining. It's gloomy, creepy, suspenseful and very much action. But it's only visual, if you look at it as a puzzle, no piece fits the other. When it comes to a quiet scene and some dialogue, you get like paralyzed and ""Huh?"", ""Explain?"", ""Come again?""... When you read a synopsis it sounds like it made sense, but... I don't know: We get too much and no time to make something of it.<br/><br/>The movie seems like very very much was just cut out and thrown away. There are many scenes that seem to indicate what kind of story should have been told. Like the one where the big alien creature seems to like Ripley because she's one of her kind. The whole Ripley with alien DNA idea was interesting, has always been announced and praised, but it's not worked out. Most of the time is running, facing the aliens, trying to figure out who is who and who is dead and who not, who is up to what. It seems like Jeunet wanted to tell a story, failed and did something different.<br/><br/>As in all Alien features, the cast consists of (up to date) rather unknown actors. But in ""Alien"", everyone was talented and everyone was to become a well-known actor. I hardly think anyone will speak of Gary Dourdan again, for example. The cast consists of Sigourney, Winona Ryder, Dan Hedaya, Brad Dourif, Michael Wincott (who looks a bit like Gary Oldman), many many un-known people and in one of the biggest parts one of the most unsympathetic and un-shining men in movie history, Ron Perlman. No good at all. Even Winona Ryder is just silly in this one.<br/><br/>It's visually stunning, atmospheric but: don't think, just watch! Maybe you shouldn't even listen.<br/><br/>Oh, and I read that there was some irony in the movie, and I have to agree, there is. But there's also a lot of dullness therefore. So if one would take it all *personally*, he or she would maybe both enjoy and suffer. Rating: 4 out of 10"

","As someone who jumps everytime an Alien appears on the screen, this film has all the right elements and passed the time pretty quickly. However for those who didn't appreciate the first Alien film, it certainly won't win them over. It looks like a pension fund raiser for Sigourny - with that nice open ending and all that. Let's forget plot credibility (the writers certainly did - when did Ripley find time to run up that leather gear on her sewing machine?), the science ( General -""she knows about it"", Doctor - ""it must be some sort of inherited race memory combined with highly refined instincts"" - duh?) and concentrate purely on the Alien myth. Here we see plenty for our ""alternative"" Alien fans - lots of smouldering looks from the new improved Ripley towards Wynona, I thought (could have been maternal - I just don't know). Plenty for our feminist Alien friends - the men were as usual completely useless when they weren't being downright devious. And plenty for our Alien etymology freaks - we can probably build one in our backyard we've seen so much of their insides and outsides. I predict an Alien 5, an Alien 6, and so on until the super lean Ms Weaver runs to fat. And more power to her, I say - 48 years old in this film and still looks good in leather!"

","It seems that many people have been ignoring the reason that I think this movie is so good.  It is FUNNY.  This is an all-out campy throw-back to the days when a horror movie had no substance, and KNEW IT.  There were gallons and gallons of icky, gooey, gross-out slime and sludge.  The sets were the only serious things about this movie.  I could not help but enjoy myself. For example, as revenge for getting frozen at with a button, the alien puts a guy into the room and pushes the button.  They are almost like the ""intelligent"" dinosaurs of Jurassic Park.  I laughed in that movie too. And, in the underwater scene, I timed it, they were moving extremely fast for almost three minutes of movie time.  However, this was cut and edited for time reasons, and if it was featured in real-time, it probably would have been 5-7 minutes, while blood pumping and racing, working hard.  Not done in real world.  The images of Ripley's predecessors of clones were funny (teeth on the side of the mouth), and the comment afterwards gave you the signal to be offended and laugh (What a waste of ammo.  Must be a chick thing.)<br/><br/>Now for the comparison: I love the Alien series.  However, I am probably the only one who feels that they could almost be independent of each other. They are all on the same level.  Alien was more of the true horror film that it was.  Aliens was more sci-fi and action, Terminator-like, also Cameron. I loved Alien 3, if you do not realize that it is an Alien movie.  It is a great moody suspense movie.  It is the darkest, moodiest movie ever.  It has more drama than all of the others combined.  Alien R. is the campiest movie off the series, because the other genres are worn out.  It is funny and good.  All are different, and should be regarded as completely independent.<br/><br/>Since I love this movie for being bad------------6"

The Aliens are no longer horrifying, as they are brought right into the limelight, just where they don't belong. We see far too much of them.

","In my mind, Alien Resurrection should not even be considered to be the fourth installment of the alien series. The first,""Alien"", was brilliant in introducing you to this new kind of creature, and what it would be like if you met up with one. A great drama thriller flick.""Aliens"", the second alien movie, excellent too, but it was more action and suspense,(fine by me). ""Alien 3"", I disliked very much mostly becuse of the transition that scary action movies took later on from being pure excitement and jump scenes, to dark comedic, bad A** movies. Now, ""Alien Resurrection"", I thought had a good idea for describing the aliens' lifestyles for you. but, it didn't show you enough, all it did was show that they are smart creatures which was something that we already knew. Then, their escape from their pens was smart, but if it was so easy for them to do it, they would have done it a long time ago. People start to die way too early in the film. The creepy crawly effect is gone, (starting with Alien 3). And like Alien 3, is more of a dark comedic, bad a** film, with actors who look like they could have been drunk stung out punk rockers, and a new breed of aliens that look so ferocious they could have come out of the bottom of a cereal box. Which brings up another point, there never should have been a new breed of aliens, it's a stupid idea. The earlier aliens looked much more dangerous and scary, plus it is the original good old bad guy. This alien looked like an anorexic jaba the hut with a beer belly and nail polish. Lastly, Ripley should have been killed off in the last alien film, which would have honorably laid to rest the Alien saga and our human hero friend who sacrificed her life to save mankind from the aliens. Then again, at the end of Alien 3, the baby alien was already out of Ripley's stomach, so it was killed in the burning lead. So, why in Alien Resurrection, did they say that they took the aliens body out of Ripley's where it was not harmed. It was just an excuse at an attempt to create yet another (sigh) chapter. I do not recomend this film to anyone who has seen the first two alien movies, I think the saga should have ended at the second one, when the queen alien was killed, but that's the way life goes. For anyone who has not seen any Alien movie or at least Alien 3, I reluctantly request you see this film, even though I hate knowing that you would be wasting your hard earned money on a film that makes a mockery of a brilliant storyline and plot.

","The first two are universally renowned classics (Aliens: Special Edition is my favourite) and I have to admit that, like most true fans of the series it seems, I liked Alien 3. Problem is the driving force of the series gets killed at the end of it. What do Fox do? Do they hope they can carry on without her? Do they pretend it was all a dream and hope no-one notices? Do they take the side route of pairing the Aliens off with the Predators? Nope, they do their damnedest to get Ripley back on her feet. In this the film succeeds. As for the rest my opinions are somewhat divided.<br/><br/>As a standalone film about a different alien species A:R would probably have succeeded. The nice, slow, tense build-up was used brilliantly. The Alien escape is very clever. And the underwater sequence borders on genius. It's a good little sci-fi horror which is incredibly stylish and has some clever twists to it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately A:R is not a standalone film. It's part of one of the most successful and influential franchises ever made. As such it has to be compared to the others. This is where it falls down. A:R never escapes the feeling that it's merely a bridge for the next one. Somewhere, I believe, is a truly awe-inspiring Alien script. It's the best of the series, will win awards by the shedload and become a legend in film history. But it's got Ripley in it. Fox scramble to get Ripley back into the series which results in this: a film which just doesn't match up to (or use) the Alien heritage.<br/><br/>The idea of introducing a human element to the Alien world is a nice one. It's also clever to parallel it by introducing an Alien element into the human world with the hybrid Ripley. But by doing this the Aliens lose something. The mystique is gone. They're no longer the most ruthless killers in known space. They no longer kill because it's in their nature to do so. They loose that level of terror which they always had. It gets replaced with the Newborn. This unholy union of chimpanzee and strawberry blamanche will either have you gasping at it's horrifying elegance or make you splutter into your popcorn. Guess which one I did.<br/><br/>The whole film is a rehash of the previous three. We get Scott's shadowy corridors and silent terror. We get Camerons gung-ho action and horror in numbers. We get Finchers dark visuals and gothic sets. We don't get anything new except ideas which don't work or aren't used properly. In the first film the computer was called Mother. Now it's called Father. Go figure. There's also a casting problem. Hedaya and Dourif ham it up because they know they're only minor. Perlman mugs away trying to look hard but only succeeds in looking stupid. Ryder looks out of place and never quite gets her swearing right. But worst is the criminal underuse of Wincott. Add a lousy, tacked on ending and the case for the prosecution is complete.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of the Alien series which I've always liked is the fact that each film has a different director. This means that each film has a different visual style. I expect they'll do it again for Alien 5. Now it's absolutely essential! Get Jeunet as far away from from the film set as possible! His surreal, Lynch-like style may work for Delicatessen. Here it's just plain weird and he never seems to be taking it seriously. Hopefully the next film will have a lot less brown and a lot less goo.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad film (it has a strangely watchable quality) but it's a half hearted attempt which only served one purpose: getting Ripley back. It works but here's hoping that script gets made."

"Rerun-2","Null","0","0","25 January 1999"," No dignity left for this series
","The makers of this film should have taken a cue from the last film in which Ripley, the main character, killed herself, and just called it quits.  There are few things as irritating as a series that has long since gone bad but just won't die.  The last Alien film, Alien3, was bad, but I would have sat through it again to avoid seeing this gory, slimy mess. The plot, for lack of a better term, revives Ripley 200 years after she killed herself to end the alien terror that had chased her through three previous movies.  She is cloned by military scientists intent on harnessing the alien within her as an unstoppable weapon.  One would think that they would have learned from the past, since I can not think of one character that has survived at this point against these creatures, but never mind, soon the alien and his other cloned siblings are being closely studied in thick glass chambers.  Ripley, played again by Sigourney Weaver, is the best thing about this movie, and the only one who projects any kind of personality.  She warns them, calmly, that the alien queen they have bred will escape.  Sure enough, soon there are aliens crawling all over, and a motley crew of a freighter stranded on the station is fighting against them to survive.  One of them is Cole, played by Wynona Ryder in a performance that could have been turned in by anyone, who harbors a secret about her identity.  Who cares?  Virtually all the interesting characters are killed off in the first 10 minutes.  I found myself at least perking up when Weaver is on the screen, because I know it will at least be entertaining.  She seems to have a strange connection with the aliens, and has acid blood like they do, somehow.  Her character is an example of a direction the movie willfully ignores to follow.  I would have liked to know more about her relationship with the aliens. The sad thing is that the first movie in the series, Alien, was such a classic example of this genre done right.  One alien, with an interesting cast of characters you cared about, was far more terrifying and effective than thousands crawling around a darkened ship slaughtering dozens of characters we care nothing for.  This film is a demonstration to what happens when you take a promising idea and drag it out over two decades until it grows listless and sophomoric."
"Hasta-2","Null","0","0","10 January 1999"," Not good, not horrible
","I have no clue about this director's history, but I can tell from this film he has some talent.  The movie is as gory as a Paul Verhoeven film (Robocop/Starship Troopers), but lacks the detail.  There is not much action, which is the worst part of the movie, considering the plot was dull. The movie led me in too many different directions, and made it hard for me to concentrate.  The start of the movie is interesting, and the scene where everybody attempts to evacuate is bloody as hell, but very fun to watch. The rest of the survivors consist of Ripley, the crew, and one scientist, which I got no emotional effect from, not even ripley.  I think this is where Alien, Aliens, and Alien 3 succeeded most in, the attachment to the characters.  Not having this feature made Alien Resurrection much worse then could have been.  There were some good scenes though, the evacuation at the start, and the water scene (although I find it hard to believe they could stay under the water that long).  Weaver does a good job playing her part, although it is a bad part, and Ryder just does a horrible job of whatever she was supposed to do.  The one thing that made this movie above ""bad"" to me was that it made me think.  The movie was a mess, but there were 2 scenes that made me break down emotionally, and I wasn't sure why.  Although the queen giving birth was indeed disgusting, I found it very sad when the baby killed the queen, do not ask me why, I just did.  Then, after the baby makes a few killings, comes the scene where Ripley interacts with the alien/human baby, almost like a mother and child.  This got me thinking, and then all of a sudden she burns the window and has the baby get sucked out of the window. It made sense, but I did not want it to happen.  If she would have blown up the baby, it would have been fine.  But she has to make it go through more pain then anybody can imagine.  As it moaned loud whimpering sounds while getting piece by piece ripped off of its body, I could almost feel its pain. Topping that off it then continuously shows Ripley looking at the poor thing, almost crying.  I couldn't take it, I don't know why but for me it was one of the saddest scenes I have seen.  This scene was horrible, but it made me think differently about the film, and made me put it in the average category.  Other then those few points the rest of the movie just consisted of smart ass one liners and poor special effects (compared to starship troopers/godzilla).  Overall, this movie does not compete with Alien, Aliens, or Alien 3, but it worthy to rent.  I recommend watching every other 3 before this, because this was indeed one of the best trilogies ever, despite the fact this was released."
"Alien-22","Null","0","0","9 January 1999"," A worthy successor of the series
","The first half of Alien 4 is a must see.  The characters are wonderfully written and played extremely well.  Most notably the characters of Christie and Wren.  The first is an incredibly cool character with hidden side-arms up his sleeves and the latter is a bad guy whom you will love to hate.  Of course the very best part of the movie is a chance to the character of Ripley act like Arnold Schwarzeneger. The reason that this movie is a good successor to the other three movies is that in each movie Ripley has transformed.  In the first movie she was the strong willed, but rather naive, warrant officer.  In Aliens she became a gun-toting mother figure who trusted almost no one.  In Alien Three she has lost everything; her life, her daughter, and her hair.  She trusted no one in this movie and it showed.  She was tough and battered and used people if she had to, but she was still a heroine who would try to save everyone even though her worst nightmare was coming true.  In Alien 4 Ripley has transformed herself once again.  This Ripley doesn't take anything from anyone, even if its extraterrestrial.  In Alien three she had an alien inside her, now she is part Alien!  I can't wait to see what happens in Alien 5, although I feel they will start to transform her back into Ellen Ripley. Alien 4 has two major drawbacks.  It kills the best characters first and is painfully predictable.  You know who will and won't die.  The movie's sets and cinematography were so good, the director foreign and fresh, that I expected a little more from Joss Whedon's script. This being the fourth movie in the series I guess I can't complain too much, it is much better than other movie sequels. In the end, if you are a big sci-fi fan this is a must see.  You may walk away feeling a little mad at how they did it, but the more you see it the more you will like it.  I promise."

The problem is that Whedon wrote this movie like another episode of ""Buffy.""  Yeah, for those of you who don't know, Joss Whedon is the writer of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer - which should be all the explanation you need as to why this film did not succeed.  My point is that the script functioned on the TV show principle, in which the audience needs to be constantly reminded that this is just fantasy, and therefore they should not take it too seriously.  Held back by what can be mercifully regarded as an awful script, Resurection is a blemish on Jeunet's career - through no fault of his own.

"Breydel","Null","0","0","9 November 2001"," My thoughts on all Alien movies (spoiler alert)
","I recently bought all 4 DVDs of the Alien films at a great bargain price (all 4 separately, even cheaper than buying the entire Alien DVD Collection at once).  I had already seen Aliens and Alien 3 very long time ago (vagely remembering some pieces) but now watched all 4 films in the right order. I'll write my conclusion in the comments of this film because it's the latest installment in the Alien franchise.  Here are my thoughts.<br/><br/>Alien.  I think this film is both great and mediocre.  Great because it's the first film and thus was able to start developing the great alien story line (which it did great, I only regret the cocoon scene explaining the alien life cycle was deleted).  Also because it has a nice dark atmosphere throughout the entire film and feels the most scary of all movies.  The film was also mediocre because it has a lot of flaws in it.  For example after this guy (forgot name) had a facehugger on him for a few days, the facehugger is mysteriously gone.  What happens next is that all crew are happily sitting together joining their meal, laughing, breading the same air as if the most normal thing happened the passed days.  I mean, WTF?, do they not have quarantine rules or something?  Also in the beginning of the movie quarantine restrictions seem to only be laughed away.  As the story enfolds, you can understand that from the android but not the other crew members. I was constantly thinking ""omg, this can't be happening"".  To me the entire crew felt more like an amature team of space explorers to me which is one of the main reasons the film never drew me into the story line.  Rating: 7/10.<br/><br/>Aliens.  This movie picks up on the story very well.  Also the contrast with the first one (faced paced action Sci-Fi thriller versus a very slow and dark horror movie) is superb.  I really liked the casting on the marine team as well.  Action and special effects are far superior here as in the other movies.  This one is definately a classic.  Rating: 9/10.<br/><br/>Alien3.  While a lot of fans seemed to find this film horrible I have to say I liked it.  Just like the second one but in lesser extend it picks up on the storyline (although I have a few questions about the egg and 2 facehuggers on board and didn't like the instant death of Higgs and Newt either).  For the rest this film was great IMO.  Most people describe this one as a drama / tragedy film which I agree upon.  What I enjoyed most was the part where they wanted to capture the Alien later in the film. Especially the chases through the alien bug-eye view were great.  Very well shot.  Also the decision to make Ripley die in the end of the film was great.  If they would have got some super doctors to put her into surgury and remove the alien from her chest it would have been a joke.  Rating: 8/10.<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection.  Well here I agree with most of you to say the film should never have been made.  The first three movies fitted together very well (the Alien trilogy where Ripley dies at the end of the 3rd film) so any director to even think making a 4th film should better come up with a great storyline.   This is where it all went wrong.  While the first three films picked up the story very good the fourth seems to not even belong in there. The idea of having Ripley resurrected on its own is something I don't like much but it's also built into the storyline the most aweful way.  Heck, for all I care they could just as well have invented time travel and go back to the beginning of Alien3.  Beam me up Scotty!  If they so badly wanted to make a fourth film after all it would have been better to have an all new cast in there with a new main character.  Also the aliens in Alien Resurrection looked way to slimey and at some points even reminded me about Jurassic Park (which the other three never did).  The casted crew here is in no way comparable to the Marine crew in Aliens, Winona Rider's character is the only one that at least has some depth.  Also the entire story around the newborn humanoid alien at the end of the film is discusting.  Weaver's acting is the worse of all films, special effects are not half as good as in the second film which is more than 10 years older.  The first had a great dark atmosphere, the second one was the action movie of the series, the third one the dramatic film but this here?  I'd say it's a shame it even belongs in the Alien series.  Rating: 4/10<br/><br/>Future.  For the future I hope they make a new movie because seeing with what miserable story Alien Resurrection left us is horrible.  With the games Aliens Vs. Predator and AvP2 being quite popular I even heard some rumors an Aliens Vs. Predator movie could be made.  Well, while I don't immediately like the idea to cross these movies I think with a decent story it could actually be worth it.  But I certainly hope we don't need to see anyone of the survivors from Alien Resurrection in there.  Weaver's character is completely ruined thanks to Alien Resurrection.  Develloping Rider's character could be interesting but heck, she could just as well be dumped for somebody else."

","This film was outright slandored by American critics, a fact which I find supremly ironic. Alfred Hitchcock, as we all (hopefully) know, was unilatterally panned by American critics until the publication of Francois Truffaut's interviews with Hitch. It seems, judging by the present opinion of Hitch's work, that all those thousands of American critics were incorrect. The irony of Jean-Peirre Jeunet's film being panned by American critics should be obvious.<br/><br/>One must realize that there is an entirerly different approach to film in France.

"karpar","Null","0","0","5 November 2001"," A Wrong Turn in the Alien Series
","The core problem of this movie is that it completely missteps with the newest incarnation of the Ripley character.  I understand that she was a clone.  I understand that alien genetic material and mixing caused her to be different from the original.  In my mind, however, these are excuses, not justification.<br/><br/>The problem is, Ripley enjoys herself.  It's that simple.  She seems to WANT to be doing what she's doing.  She cracks jokes, she is vicious, she is aware of the brutality she's capable of and revels in it.  That's not Ripley.  That's Buffy.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - I like Buffy, and I think Joss Whedon is an excellent writer.  I certainly don't want to pin all of the blame on him, because I know that many factors go into a character's personality.  I do believe, however, that Whedon's base script probably had a great deal of Ripley's newfound flippant attitude, and even a bit of that is a big mistake.<br/><br/>The strength of the Ripley character, and one of the things that made the other Alien movies so appealing, was the fact that she's not a hero.  She doesn't want to be one.  She wants to go home to a normal life with the people she cares about, but she can't.  No matter what happens, she's thrown into chaos, and instead of falling to pieces, she finds the will to fight back and survive.  Even as she's fighting, though, she hates what she's doing.  She fights only because she hopes to reach a point where she doesn't have to fight anymore.<br/><br/>Some have suggested that the ""new"" Ripley is just weary and cynical, that her new attitude is her giving up on the concept of a normal life and rejecting the morality and humanity she clung to for so long.  That's certainly an interesting possibility, but it wasn't conveyed very well in the film.  I certainly hope that if the series continues, a lot of consideration will go into the psychology of the Ripley character, and her motivations will be made clear again."

","**WARNING: INCLUDES SPOILER(S)**<br/><br/>I was looking forward to this one: after the dire Alien3, anything would be an improvement.<br/><br/>Oh dear. Alien: Delicatessen (duh, sorry) is a sinner for several reasons.<br/><br/>Most strikingly, it appears set-bound and unconvincing.  The haunted corridors of the NOSTROMO and the 80's industrial plant-scape of Aliens had some feeling of reality, but the setting for this fourth effort (though undeniably grand in scale) seems very like something in a movie studio.<br/><br/>The cast don't seem to involved either; when a character is not on screen, I can't imagine that they're doing anything other than waiting for their next entrance.  Of course, that is exactly what they ARE doing, but you're supposed to believe that they're running around doing military/scientific/mercenary stuff, and that's hard in this movie- it's too window-dressy and any tension is not sustainable.<br/><br/>By now, surely, it's time to move the idea on a bit.  Aliens managed this, with its glimpse of the social nature of the creatures, and we did get a little behavioural insight in Resurrection with two of them offing one of their own without a second thought in order to escape from their confinement aboard the AURIGA.<br/><br/>If the franchise continues, it could profit from developing the story of the aliens themselves, which Resurrection fought shy of doing.<br/><br/>However, it must be said that the worst was saved for the last reel. Ripley's 'grand-child' was a farcical device from the C-movie rubber-suit school.  As if that were not enough, Brad Dourif's potty scientist insisted on hanging from the wall of the birth chamber cooing inanely at the new-borne beast in tones reminiscent of Kenneth Williams' character Orlando in 'Carry On Screaming'.  On this evidence, husbands should not be allowed in the delivery room.<br/><br/>But if the wretched hybrid suffered an unfortunate start in life, its early demise was the stuff of crude airline gags: it ended up, as the saying goes, getting sucked through a hole in the fuselage.<br/><br/>Perhaps it would be too unkind to say that Monsieur Jeunet has made the SAME film yet again (with many of the same cast), but he did not bring enough to this one by a long way.<br/><br/>I heard that Ridley Scott is in the frame for a potential Alien 5; maybe he can put back some of that awful magic.<br/><br/>If you like contemporary sci-fi horror (a genre less over-supplied than it may seem) then Resurrection is worth seeing, but don't expect too much."

Anyway, he tried to invent something new in order to continue the tradition of renewal of the first 3 movies, Alien was a horror sci-fi, Aliens was an action sci-fi, Alien3 was a thriller sci-fi and now we have this comic-strip sci-fi that definitely cuts a bad figure compared to his predecessors... well, now i wonder what a 5th chapter could be and, unwillingly, i hope it won't be if these are the results..."

","Take a deep breath and say...This movie doesn't exist. Don't you feel better? No matter how many good points you can pile up about this movie, it just doesnt fit in the series, and I would rather ignore it, reffering to the Alien movies as a trilogy. The first was a masterpiece, the second will blow you away, even the third, if weakest (of the trilogy) still is fascinating and quite entertaining,and a fitting ending to the mighty trilogy (...this is Ripley, signing off.) Than there came Alien Ressurection. Jeez, for one thing, it's not even Ripley anymore, it's a dumb clone! Another, the Newborn!! Oh, God!! It is so stupid looking and more pathetic than terrifying. When it was born, people in the theater were actually laughing out loud (no joke, I even found me chuckling to myself.) How did H.R. Giger allow this to happen??? It is a hideous freak of nature that kills the mighty queen in one swipe!! I have to say, the scene that Ripley sees 1-7 reject clones is first-class filmmaking and a masterpiece scene, but cannot save the fact that this is no more than a cash in on the Alien Trilogy. Even when watching the other Alien movies now, I can't help but have a bad taste in my mouth knowing how it all ends up, which is why I don't consider this part of the Alien series. The trilogy is great storytelling that fits in seamlessly, and admit it, you didn't wanna see Ripley die, but come on, let's be realistic. After three encounters with the beast, it is unbelievable that she would survive (as it is amazing that she simply survived the first time!) while if Ressurection is ignored you will be happier. TRUST ME."

","Let's agree to disagree. Most people disliked this movie. Does it mean ""it sucks""?

This movie is trashy scifi. Take it as such, and it's fine.<br/><br/>If instead, you slather upon it all the breathless expectation of a hardcore Aliens-geek (if you know the name of the planet in Alien3, you qualify) then you will be disappointed in proportion to your fanaticism.<br/><br/>I think we all need to step back and consider that nothing short of cinematic masterpiece will satisfy die-hard fans at this point, which is the same curse that George Lucas labors under.<br/><br/>This is a passable, if dumb, ""rainy sunday"" scifi flick.

","You gotta give the studio and producers credit for their choice of director. A French art cinema visualist who doesn´t speak any English, instead of a no-nonsense action craftsman (like James Cameron). Perhaps they wanted the series to go in another direction, following the much debated, but criminally underrated #3. The end result is, while not an entire washout, also the most disappointing and uneven of the series. The cast is interesting enough, Jeunet reunites Pinon and Perlman from his previous film ""La citté des enfants perdus"". Weaver rises way above the material, and Ryder is OK. Michael Wincott is strangely subdued and Dan Hedaya´s hairy back is scarier than any alien you´ll ever see! There are a couple of genuinely startling and beautiful scenes that proves Jeunet to be an excellent visual talent. The shootout with Perlman dangling from a ladder is astonishing, and the crew being chased by two aliens underwater is intense and scary, especially with John Frizzell´s forceful score. Watch as a woman desperately tries to escape one of them... The film´s most memorable and poignant scene, however, is where the cloned Weaver meets her previously failed clones. A genuinely touching and sad scene, which is rather abruptly punctured by Perlman´s chauvinist joke.<br/><br/>But they blew it with that ending...the alien is about as scary as any of the Teletubbies. **½ (of ****)"

","**SPOILERS AHEAD**<br/><br/>God, what a waste.  Where to begin, with a film like this?  It strikes me more as a Saturday Night Live skit based on the Alien films, rather than part 4 of the series.  The very premise behind Ripley's ""resurrection"" would make anyone with even high-school level knowledge of biology alternatively cringe or laugh.<br/><br/>Jeunet should not have been placed as director.  His style, while visually lovely, is too dramatically lighthearted for this type of film.  The comic-relief is badly-timed, jarring, and ill-suited to the ""Alien tradition"", subverting any emotional depth or suspense.  Worse, though, is the pornographic level of violence.  Do we really need to see this much gore?  Remember how little of it was actually shown in the first two films, and yet how unsettling and effective those sequences were?<br/><br/>I loved seeing Pinon in an English-language film, but he just seems miscast for this type of thing.  Hedaya should not have been in this either, only more so.  Perlman, while talented in general, is wasted as an unlikable caricature.  Weaver is just awful.  While somewhat interesting in the beginning, she quickly devolves into playing the role for ironic laughs.  I thought Ryder wasn't that bad, actually, but she seems to be here just to bring in more ticket sales.<br/><br/>The ""birthing"" scene is the most unintentionally hilarious thing I've seen in a Hollywood film in ages.  Dourif's delivery is so over-the-top it provokes snickers.  The Queen herself looks like she's kicked back in stirrups (""Puuuush!"").  And the big reveal, the Newborn, is so absurdly stupid-looking I don't understand how it got past the conceptual stage. The way the thing's killed at the end is equally stupid, not to mention the fact that it's physically impossible and not even barely believable (should have stuck with the farm equipment, Joss).<br/><br/>Alien3 was an object lesson in promising, but failed filmmaking.  Alien: Resurrection is simply trash, designed by a corporation to make money off of consumers who sadly don't know any better."

","This third `Alien' sequel really is a mixed bag of the good and the bad. The setting, the atmosphere and the characters hark back to Parts 1 and 2 (that's good). The new Ripley is also fascinating with her ""darker side"" and the aliens themselves were more ""in your face"" than they've ever been before, which is also a positive thing. I like to SEE my monsters in a monster movie, and I don't buy into the pretentious and arty-farty view that ""the less you see of them the scarier they are"". If the monsters are well executed and don't just look like men in rubber suits, bring 'em on!!! Another good thing was how the Aliens are seen in this movie to be intelligent and thinking creatures - as when they turn on and kill one of their own in order to use its acid blood to burn their way out of their confinement. Murderously ingenious!!! What I didn't like however were the lame attempts to inject elements of humour into the movie, like when Dan Hedaya's rather cartoonish General character offers a stiff salute to his just deceased comrades immediately before becoming Alien fodder himself (you can just picture Lesley Nielson doing the scene in an Alien spoof movie), and Winona Ryder's android character plugging herself into the space vessel's loudspeaker system and saying ""Would all Aliens please report to...."". The Alien franchise is NOT about comedy, and such silliness has no place in an Alien movie. I also thought that the ""Alien baby"" was - and came across as - a desperate attempt to come up with a new angle on the creatures which just didn't work. Let's stick to the chestbursters!! I'd give this one 5 (maybe 6 if I'm feeling generous) out of 10. Not a BAD movie. But let's hope that the rumoured Number 5 is better."

","The main problem I have with this film is that it loses the original style of the other films (including Alien3, which I liked) through trying to be too deep and clever. The underlying threat of the Alien is its mystery, like many things we fear even when we see the Alien its way of thinking is something vastly different to ours, simple and more primal, hence more perfect killing machine. In trying to 'delve into the Alien Psyche' the creature loses some of its scariness. It also lacks a lot of credibility storywise.  The Aliens lack numbers which is fine in a prison or a mining ship where there is no military hardware. Also where did they get bits of Ripley to regenerate when she burnt herself to nothing in molten metal, note the bits needed her DNA after impregnation!!????? Not a wholly unpleasant film but poor acting and a distinctly European feel (whose artistic emphasis lessen a necessary grittiness in this sort of Sci-Fi demonstrated in The 5th Element) mean you don't get quite as involved.

","Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" was a masterpiece in both areas of science fiction and horror.  The acting was impeccable (sp?) and you were on the edge of your seat the entire time because you didn't know where the alien was next. James Cameron's ""Aliens"" was an even better masterpiece in which he took H.R. Giger's Alien design and multiplied it into an army of aliens.  It was absolute war.  Intense, fierce, ruthless, heart-stopping action.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie with this kind of intensity.  David Fincher's ""Alien 3"" was what I thought was going to be the last of the Alien movies. This one, while is doesn't measure up to the other two, was a fitting ending to a 13 year saga.  The franchise should have ended.  Alien Resurrection is a pile of crap.  Sure it looks good in some spots, but this movie is absolutely horrid.  From the banal dialogue to the ridiculous plot, this sequel has ruined one of my favorite movie franchises.  The movie takes place 200 years after Ripley has died.  Somehow, someway, the bad guys were able to clone her so that they could rip the Alien out of her body and reproduce it.  The only thing about this Ripley, played once again by Sigourney Weaver, is that she seems to have a little bit Alien in her, which was another ridiculous plot twist.  Another one of the bad spots in this movie is the miscasting of Winona Ryder.  Now, I love Winona Ryder more than anything, but Science Fiction is just one genre she is not good for.  The third thing I'd like to address which was the worst part of this movie was the ending.  What in God's name was thay thing at the end of the movie.  A human alien?!  I think the producers tried way too hard on this movie. What a shame."

","Alien Resurrection was not the best movie out of all the alien films; it was never going to be. But what the movie did hit home to me was the way the character 'Ellen Ripley' had changed from the first film. People feel that this change was bad; they did not like the way in which she was now a b**ch from hell, compared to the emotional, kind person she was in the first movie. But yet i found that after watching all four movies in a row, this change in personality was perfect. It really made you feel for the character, and you began to realise all the torment she had gone through. It created pathos to an extreme; i felt sorrow for the character that had now been changed so dramatically by the alien race. Although all the physical violence the aliens did to 'Ripley' and others was easily seen, it was only when i saw the last movie that i began to appreciate that this woman had been tormented for about 400 years by this race, and i felt pity for her. Therefore, while the fact that this movie was not as successful as the others still stands, i do feel that they way 'Ellen Ripley' was portrayed was fantastic. The difference in character (compared to the first movie) shows that the movies were not like the typical 'hero kills aliens via lots of gore and action' horror movies, but that these horror movies also contained a very strong central character, where the actress delivered a fine performance mentally, not just physically."

","I can't believe how negative reviews have generally been for this movie. I think this is a case of people badmouthing a movie because it doesn't live up to its predecessors.<br/><br/>Is it as scary as the original Alien?  No.  Not even close.<br/><br/>Is it as awe-inspiring as the first sequel, Aliens?  Nope.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Alien: Resurrection, it's been almost 20 years since the groundbreaking original film Alien.  Everything in this movie suffers from the ""been there, done that"" sydrome.<br/><br/>The most obvious example is the Xenomorph alien itself.  When Ridley Scott created the first film, he purposely shot it to show as little of the Xenomorph as possible.  It leaves more to the imagination... and hence made it scarier.  Thus, even though we saw a lot of the xenomorphs in the sequel Aliens, it still *felt* new.  Not so with Alien4.  Everybody who hasn't been living under a rock is waaay too (over)familiar with the xenomorph by now. It's become a pop culture icon most movie fans recognize --- like Rambo, Indiana Jones, or Darth Vader.  This has taken much of the air out of the ""Scary"" bit of the movie.<br/><br/>Without the ""Alien"" prefix to the title ""Resurrection"" this movie would not have been trashed by fans & critics.  It's a fairly enjoyable film, ranking somewhere between ""Above Average"" and ""Good"".  One thing that separates this film from the other 3 Alien flicks is the occasional tongue-in-cheek humor, mostly via quirps from Ripley.  The new Ripley of this movie is a sardonic, witty incarnation of the serious, emotional Ellen Ripley.<br/><br/>In terms of the Alien movie series, ""Alien4"" is the true sequel to ""Aliens"" just as ""Alien3"" was the true sequel to ""Alien"".  The first and third films focused on a dark, brooding storyline.  Slow paced, very scary, but little action.  The second and fourth films were more about Hollywood action bonanzas, death-defying stunt sequences, with lots of special FX.  If you enjoyed all the Marine Gadgets, weapons, and vehicles in ""Aliens"" you'll love Alien Resurrection.<br/><br/>I'd rate this movie 7.5/10.  Good flick, but not great."

I think an Alien movie without Ripley is not logical. It would be a completely different movie since Ripley is one of the best movie heroes of all time and Weaver gives one of her best performances as Ripley in this sequel. I also think Ryder is not a miscast. With her a little bit androgen looks she is a good choice as the robot-human. Who do you think will be a better actress for that role? Gwyneth Paltrow???<br/><br/>Now the unsuccessful parts: The relation between Ryder and Weaver is not explored, we don't even understand why they're together.

WHYYY!? This is aliens, not jurassic they-can-open-doors f***in park) and you have a perfect recipe for a franchise tombstone.

Even 2 of the same actors (Johner and DeVriess). The set designs and costumes look like something out of the dark horse aliens comic books, which may not be a bad thing. After seeing Alien Resurrection one of the few things that came to my mind other than ""oh.. my.. god that was dumb"" was ""hrm, if they're going to mess up the aliens franchise, why not make a TV show. Hey, it worked allright for Stargate"". The plot in A-R is so flat anyway, it could have been told in 45 minutes no problems whatsoever. The characters are cartoony as well. A lot of them are obviously chosen to accomodate the public. mad professor, funny paraphlegic (bwahahah), ""cool"" mercs, asshole militaries.. this is all straight out of the comic books.

"jiangliqings","Null","0","0","10 February 2001"," Decent, it will either please series fans or disgust them.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ** 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>If anything, Alien: Resurrection has the distinction of being the most consistently paced film of the series.  Ridley Scott's Alien was fairly slow all the way, James Cameron's Aliens built up slowly and the last 1/3 of that film was a rollercoaster ride of action and terror, and David Fincher's Alien 3 mixed some highly suspenseful parts along with some slow, morose scenes.  Resurrection basically tries to get the action started as quickly as possible (which, as is typical of the genre, means halfway through the film) but before that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet tries to hold attention with some icky gore, new developments, and a wicked sense of humor.  The result is decent, certainly not bad by a long shot.<br/><br/>The film takes place 200 years after the events of Alien 3, when Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) committed suicide inside a prison to exterminate the last of the xenomorph, a dangerous race of alien monsters.  Some of her blood was recovered by from the prison by a scientific and military team and is used to clone her.  They extract the queen and plan to create a small nest aboard their ship.  As for Ripley, her personality is different now. She's seems less human, but still has all the memories of her former life.<br/><br/>Then a band of space pirates arrive on board the same ship, including a mechanic named Annallee Call (Winona Ryder), bringing along cargo that the military team is in need of (if you haven't figured it out by now, that cargo is humans).  But then all hell breaks loose when the aliens cleverly, if not also gruesomely, figure out a way to escape, and now the space pirates, along with Ripley and Dr. Wren, the man in charge of the whole cloning operation, must find a way to get off the ship and prevent the aliens from getting to Earth.<br/><br/>Going over the plot, it seems writer Joss Whedon and director Jeunut were aiming for a mixture of Alien and its sequel.  The obvious fact is that you have a bunch of people trapped on a ship as they're being hunted down.  It also tries for the high-octane action of Aliens, and is fairly successful at that.  Perhaps the film's most intense sequence is an edge-of-the-seat ten-minute setpiece that first involves the survivors swimming through water until they end up in the room where all the eggs are laid and must find a way to get through as the aliens surround them.  Though the remainder of the film afterward is still tense, no other scenes maintain as much suspense as that setpiece.  But still, Jeunet proves himself a director capable of creating excitement and the film never tested my patience once.<br/><br/>Other good aspects of the film include the special effects, which are actually slightly less than Cameron's film because of the use of CGI, which isn't nearly as convincing when the creatures are animatronic.  Jeunet's cinematography is vivid and distinct, and the use of humor is effective at times.  The cast (with one signifcant exception) is good, with Sigourney Weaver delivering another fine performance as Weaver, though you can't help but feel at times it might have been better if they'd thought of something else other than cloning to buttress the plot.  The other standout is Ron Pearlman, whose wise-cracking character gets the best lines.<br/><br/>Not everything in this movie is good, however.  The fact that the storyline is a mixture of the first and second installments makes predictibility a factor, and there's never really a doubt as to who lives and who dies. Then there's also the whole cloning issue, and the fact that it is used in this movie goes to show that the filmmakers trying to take the easy way out. To be fair, they did pull it off in a more convincing (and disturbing) manner than I expected so credit should be given for that.<br/><br/>If nobody noticed, except for those ten-minutes I mentioned, there's not exactly a whole lot of non-stop slam-bang action, it's mostly sporadic throughout.  Though, I must say what is present is gory enough to jolt even the most hardened series fan.  This is easily the goriest film in the series, surpassing the original by quite a bit.<br/><br/>Then there's that one casting mistake I mentioned previously and that goes to Winona Ryder.  It pains me to say this, considering the fact that I admire her very much and is among my favorite actresses.  But she's pretty much a miscast as the character Annallee Call.  Whether it's that haircut, which is a short one (keep the hair long, Winona, you look extremely beautiful that way!), or the long bouts of shouting she's forced to do, she comes off unconvincing and had me wishing they'd replaced her with someone like up-and-comer Radha Mitchell, whose performance in her own respective sci-fi thriller Pitch Black shows her quite adroit at playing a strong heroine.<br/><br/>The biggest problem series fans have with this film is introduction of the new alien.  First of all, give Jeunet and the special effects crew credit once again for trying something different and original.  The alien design is not as good as H.R. Giger's but I didn't find it annoying or bothersome, either.  Just as a sidenote, the way this creature dies may very well be the most gruesome death I've ever seen so don't be surprised if you actually feel a little sorry for it.<br/><br/>At this point, another addition to the series seems unlikely since Weaver is unwilling for another run at it, which is both a good and bad thing.  You can take the fact that the series won't go into overkill, but the final reels of Resurrection hint at the prospect of another installment that could take place on Earth, which is exactly what series fans have been clamoring for.  It may never happen, but either way at least Alien: Resurrection wasn't a shameful way to end the series."

","I thought that the end of the great alien movies was near when I saw the terrible movie ""Alien 3"". But they realized that they had to save aliens reputation and therefore made the fourth movie which is rather good. Well I have to admit that this ain't the best alien film but it's at least a representable sequel."

","It's funny that our american friends are the ones who disliked this movie the most. Well - not funny, but interesting and logical.<br/><br/>Jeunet is my god, I adore his movies. Nevertheless: I was kinda disappointed after having seen Alien Resurrection for the first time - even though there were many ""holy"" moments or extremely typical parts of dialogs (""Back to earth? S**t, I'd rather stay here then... earth... that  s**t sphere!""). - Or like fighting with extreme firepower against one of the aliens: After the frigging beast's gone the panic still takes hold, especially for the one that's been shooting like a lost idiot - but, the alien's finally dead and the guy keeps shouting while his eyes catch up a innocent little sweet spider hanging on it's sweet little net - KAWUMM - also being shot in fury...!<br/><br/>The characters in the first two parts of the alien series had been much more realistic than in Part three and four. In fact, this impression got lost after the first movie which was handling the story with the appropriate seriousness of a crew that's acting totally realistic in this purely fictious environment. Same for part two - But I hated to see too many aliens getting killed too easily. It had been that damned hard work to get rid of the beast that'd scared the hell out of me in part one. Good thing to see in ALIENS  that - at least - the courage and heroesness was kinda totally lost after the first real contact between the overcool space marines and our biting babes. I don't like part three. The problem is probably the problem I'm having generally with Mister Fincher's movies. None of'em really sucked me in but I can't tell exactly why. (Se7en, The game...) The characters in Alien Resurrection are much more cartoonish and there are brilliantly shot, but maybe too hero-like gunfiring secquences. (watch christie handling his special double-gun...). That was very confusing when I saw the movie for the first time. I love gore but found it just too hard sometimes. But that kind of violence can also be understood kinda humouristic 'cause it's mostly that nasty that I felt so sorry for certain people and had - as a weird consequence of it - to laugh about it. I think this movie is a WONDERFUL addition to the others even if it makes it hard to follow Ripley's space odissey. FOX Int. seems to be very proud for their alien works. I believe to have felt the importance to do a special part four, not just some expected sequel. Well, here it is. Now it's european humour and things are more weird, it's another movie language and a non-typically-american-style that's telling us the story on the USS Auriga... that's why (especially) our american friends problably do have their worries 'bout it."
"cb808","Null","0","0","17 October 1998"," A worthy sequel--flawed but satisfying
","First things first: I *like* this movie. I love the Alien saga as a whole, and I was definitely not disappointed by Resurrection. In fact, I strongly defended it when it came out, against every criticism thrown at it. Now that I've seen it on video a few times, my enthusiasm has partially faded. Its major flaw is its script. The dialgoue often comes off as sound-bytes, as the actors seem to speak to the camera instead of each other. And, because this movie if so short, we have very little time to get to know the characters, although their personas are very cool--especially Elgyn (Michael Wincott) and Vriess (Dominique Pinon). There are a few plot-holes and inconsistencies, although Jeunet is famous for creating intended situational absurdity. The production design is FANTASTIC as well as Jeunet's directorial work. The action fast-paced and original, though short-lived. The dreaded Newborn does indeed look awful, but the idea behind it is respectable. Overall, I will probably enjoy watching this film over and over again, just like the other films in the Alien Saga."

"alianalloy","Null","0","0","23 January 2001"," well i like it
","I liked this film, why, because its sifi, and well made sifi, i also like the other aliens films as each one is as individual as the other, and so if you had never seen any of the others and were in fact an alien your self to the films they're all well made, ripping yarns with great affects, but obviously nothing can top the first simply cuz it was the original, scary dark and tense, the second was all Americanised big boys with toys gun-ho come get some, action stuff that everyone loves, but that could have stood alone as a film of sifi action. the third and most criticised was a return to darker more broody atmosphere, whilst most younger people i feel wanted a starship trooper type film where we go do the aliens at home, going one further in action over the second, this took it in the complete opposite direction, i could go in to deep sub plot Sigmund Freud- isation of a woman in a max security prison with rapist and killers, equally as scary as being on a world of killer alians, or human ingenuity with no weapons but evil against evil, yet this if it was a stand alone film would have worked, but unfortunately it was compared to the original, which had the big advantage of being ORIGINAL, the forth again completely different style of filming with a totally new director in his un miss-able style, some say the sequels should have stopped long time back but the same people who bay for more sequels are the same to knock the films as not being as good as the first, and to my knowledge the only way to make any of these films as good as the first is to wipe their memories of the original. i think these films are great and would love them to go the way of James bond always the latest new effects and new directors wanting to have the honour of directing it, Not the way of Robo cop, Superman, Rocky or the halloween films, slowly sinking more and more in to the mud of knackers, nothing more than a fast buck making film than a work of love, genius and respect of the name 'Alien' so if your the type of person who will utter the quote:wasnt as good as the first"" or ""wasnt as good as the book"" dont see this, obviously you take all this way too seriously, so i suggest you go do better and stop wingeing..:o)<br/><br/>TOM."

","alien: resurrection is the last of the alien series (so far...), and it is not the greatest movie of the saga, but isn't also the worst. for me the best is the second movie and the worst is the third movie. the movie has all the elements of the alien saga, it has fear, suspense and gore. the alien looks more alive, we can now see his breath. sigourney weaver as the eternal ripley does a fantastic job (puts linda hamilton in a pocket). and as weaver side-kick we have winona ryder, that is kind a new in this type of movie (except for her performance in dracula) does a nice job. the screen write was in charge of joss whedon, the creator of buffy the vampire slayer, giving a nice rhythm to the action of the movie. in short this is movie that all the fans of the alien saga should see. also all the fans of sci-fi and gore can't miss this. all the others, watch other movie."

If you don't want to think about the movie, mindless entertainment.  I typically like movies like that, but when it's a movie that's a part of a really good series (not including Alien3, of course) it just tends to ruin the series.  I've heard that a fifth installment may be coming out, I hope it lives up to the story line that was set up in 1 and 2, otherwise this series has lost a fan."

It has a lot of moral themes, it has some good action and it gives the old films a new vision (the ""kill me"" is given a whole new twist). Perhaps a few quirky lines could be taken out.<br/><br/>

"sampath","6","0","0","16 October 2000"," Unnecessary fourth installment of an all-time great saga
","After Alien3, it seemed the Alien Saga had drawn to a (fairly acceptable)close.  But thanks to a rather ingenious premise, Ripley is back, but for all the anticipation, the film fails to live up to its predecessors.<br/><br/>Director Jeunet's surrealistic style worked quite well in Delicatessen, but on this occasion it only serves to betray the spirit of the series.  There are some genuinely eerie moments, but most of the jokes fall flat, and the plot is predictable enough to extinguish any notion of suspense.  And the fact that Ripley is not really 'Ripley' means the audience has no one to root for apart from a cliched bunch of mercenaries about whom one could not care less.<br/><br/>It would all be forgivable, however, had it not been for the diabolical casting of Winona Ryder as the Bishop-esque cyborg Call: she may be a good actress, but looks completely at a loss here.<br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection is still a must-see, but only because it is part of something far grander than itself.<br/><br/>6/10"

","While there were some good elements to this movie, there were some unsettling inconsistencies, and I didnt like the way the story has turned. I'm having difficulty understanding a how a clone (supposedly from a few cells) can be raised to a state almost identical to just before she died (ie with alien embryo in situ). Also, how the queen initially spawns eggs (giving rise to the aliens who are caged), but then gives a ""live"" birth? (or is this another ""queen""?).

"Truman-10","Null","0","0","30 July 2000"," Rehash or rerun, but not resurrection
","Alien 4, on first viewing, is a lot of fun. Exciting and scary, with plenty of action and certainly the funniest of the series. But what ever you do, don't watch it again. On second viewing, it's a rehash of the first two movies in the series, struggling unsuccesfully through the coporate demands to establish a style of it's own. I'm sure Jean Pierre Jeunet could make a great Alien film of his own, with his own weird ideas, but he doesn't get a chance to here. He has to throw it the neccesary Hollywood cliches, guns and action scenes at regular intervals in an obvious bid by the producers to be like Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), but don't be like Alien 3 (1992)'.  It's a shame that a series previously made up of such individual, creative films in which each took their own direction, has been diluted by such a movie.<br/><br/>
At least Alien 3, which wasn't popular with the masses, tried something different and new. Ressurection suceeds as a collection of highlights from the series, and in giving us great new versions of Ripley and the alien - an alien-a-fied ripley and a Ripley-a-fied alien respectively. But that's all. And it's absolutely disgusting as well. Don't expect Alien 5 after the poor box-office performance of this one. A script, Alien: Revelation, was written, but it looks like the future of the series is with the upcoming Aliens versus Predator.  Let's hope that lives up to it's billing."
"Jonathan Horner","Null","0","0","21 July 2000"," Pointless.
","In my opinion there was no need to make Alien Resurrection. It's just another pointless sequel to add to the series. The directors and producers should of stopped at Alien 3. <br/><br/>Once again like the other 3 Alien movies. We see Ripley lead a team of marines around an Alien infested ship in space. But this time it's more confusing Ripley is not all human. Since Ripley died in Alien 3, she has been resurrected and brought back as some kind of half Alien, half human life form. Plus the Aliens won't harm her, because they think she's one of them.<br/><br/>There's the usual hard-core team of marines plus an android, but this time it's not Bishop from Aliens and Aliens 3, it's a female android.<br/><br/>
Really, it's just the same old ""destroy the Aliens then get off the ship and blow it up to kingdom come"" story line. <br/><br/>But Alien Resurrection isn't all that bad. Since it's the most newest sequel out of the 4 the special effects are slightly better and I think it's got more action in it than Alien 3.<br/><br/>A sequel which wasn't worth making. It just makes the whole series more confusing.<br/><br/>5/10."

","This film is the forth in the Alien series, and it comes very close to being the worst. While Alien and Aliens were both excellent (everyone has their preference, personally, I prefer Aliens), Alien 3 was a complete mess and that is barely improved upon in this sequel.<br/><br/>The director tries to turn this into an arty film, and while that is no bad thing, it does not gel with the gruesome subject matter. The cast is mediocre except for Weaver, Winona Ryder standing out in particular as she seems to have no purpose but to expand the male fan-base. A number of scenes do not work, and many are just plain laughable. One scene reminds us once again that man meddling with nature is BAD, as Ripley destroys a lab of aborted clones. The characters hardly generate sympathy with their one-liners and constant complaining.<br/><br/>And just wait until you see the Newborn, a new species of alien. What should have been a horrific blend of man and creature has been realised as a monster more likely to have you laughing into your popcorn than cowering in terror. In the original film, a terrifying monster design (by H.R.Giger) was occasionally let down by dodgy special effects. Here, there is no excuse for bad SFX (although they are often ropey), it is just that the design is terrible.<br/><br/>There is, however, one good scene. An underwater sequence which leaves you breathless quickly gets your hopes up again about the film. ""Will it be like this all the way from now?"" you hope, but no.

It totally ruined itself at the end with an alien that couldn't look any dumber.  I left the theaters thinking it was so so and had some good scenes and was a little bit better than the third.

You may be amazed by the computer generated effects in the new one but if you look back at the second one you REALLY will think the special effects look better and are more appealing.  If they make another one, which if they do they better get it right this time, give us the feel, the action, and the suspense the first 2 gave us and make us really enjoy it.

","First off, I would like to state that I am quite a fan of the Alien films. The original was a classic film on its own, the sequel was (in my opinion, of course) a classic of the action/horror/sci-fi/whatever genre, but I found the 3rd one a bit forgettable.  Alien:Resurrection, the 4th in the series, is perhaps the most grotesque of all of them.  Among the yuckiest moments are the scenes where the Alien ""Newborn"" is sucked out through the hole in the window, and perhaps where the general is struck in the head from behind by the alien queen with her lovely retractable mouth.  These scenes add appeal for those fans of gore in movies, but they don't benefit anyone else and therefore aren't much to watch for the general public. <br/><br/>
Something that irritated me in this movie are the one liners that a lot of the characters spit out, mainly Rippley, who states ""It was in my way"", after Winona Ryder's character shows incredulity when Rippley exterminates an alien.  These aren't exactly a good substitute for dialogue and the movie would've done better to have left them out altogether - in fact most speech in this movie could be erased to make the film better, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Anyway, to sum it up Alien:Resurrection should be seen if you're either a fan of the Alien films (all fans of these films would've already seen it anyway), or a sci-fi/horror freak."
"krenshaw","Null","0","0","31 March 2000"," Not bad, but it can't hold a candle to the trilogy
","Now, don't get me wrong.  This is a decent movie.  I enjoyed watching it. But at the same I writhed and twitched in pain as I saw everything that gave the Alien saga its unique, wonderfully appealing luster sucked away in two hours of gore and weird ""art"" directing.<br/><br/>***Warning...I reveal some plot elements here so if you haven't seen it, don't read on unless you want to know about the movie***<br/><br/>First off, there are some definite flaws in the underlying principal of the movie.  Cloning is obviously OK, but somehow cloning Ripley and having the Alien be cloned along with her seems just a tad fetched.  Perhaps this is why it took 200 years; such incredible cloning techniques had to be developed!  But we can let this slide.<br/><br/>Next up is the bizarre entourage of characters. The officer in charge of the station, General Perez, is overacted to an extreme.  He seems to try to capture some of the style of the drill sergeant from ""Full Metal Jacket"" but just comes off as being a poor actor and character.  (And this makes no mention of his final scene, with the piece of his brain...oohh...gore for 14 year olds, never seen that before). We have the terrible one-liners that Ron Perlman, an actor that I actually like quite well, delivers with little enthusiasm.  But who would really want to say ""Earth, man...what a ****hole?""  What kind of a line is that?  It just astounds me to hear that as a line that's actually meant to be taken seriously. And then there's Winona Ryder.  I cannot think of a movie that has had an actor or actress so poorly cast.  Not only does Ryder not seem to fit the image of an android space pirate, her lines are both not written well and she does little to correct it.   ""You're a construct...they grew you in a ****ing lab.""  I hate to continue making the same complaint, but that is an awful, awful line that is out-of-place.<br/><br/>Throughout the whole movie, Sigourney Weaver usually is able to salvage most of the scenes, but then she goes and ruins this by over-acting her part as well, with one-liners almost as bad as Perlman's.  Cole:""I can't believe you did that, its like killing one of your own kind."" (Another example of Ryder's brilliant lines and reading)  Ripley:""It was in my way.""  Ha ha, that's funny Ripley.<br/><br/>OK, again, we can put up with this.  We're movie fans.  We're tough.<br/><br/>Then, to shatter this, there's the Newborn Alien.  From a storyline standpoint, its not well done.  From a visual effects standpoint, well, lets just say it wasn't done as well as it *should* have been.  It exists for a short, very gory time on screen and seems to have been added as just another thing for Ripley to fight as an ending to the movie, just to make the running time fit the box office minimum.<br/><br/>
But wait!  Perhaps it's a nod to the previous two installments.<br/><br/>*cough*<br/><br/>OK, well in the Director's Cut of Aliens we learn that Ripley did indeed have a daughter, that died in part because of the Alien (Ripley was lost for 57 years...you know the story).  Then, in Alien3, Ripley loses her surrogate daughter, Newt, to the Alien (the facehugger burns a hole in the cryotube...).  Then, in the third one, her second surrogate daughter is killed because it's a menace to society.  Unfortunately though, most people don't see the correlation (not that I blame them) because they can't get past that ugly Alien Newborn.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Alien:Resurrection falls short of the other movies; even the Alien from this movie has little relation to the original from the other three.  The Alien changes in all four movies, but the only thing that this Alien seems to have in common with the other three is summed up by Superintendent Chalmers' words from Alien3: ""So its an 8 foot creature, some kind with acid for blood, and is generally unpleasant.""  Its mannerisms and behaviors are completely different from those in the other three; it lays an ""ambush,"" attacks in the open, and can be held off by seemingly simple weapons. Only one civilian could escape the one from Alien.  Only one space marine could escape it the one from Aliens.  Only one prisoner could escape it in Alien3.  But somehow three (count them, Vriess, Cole, and Johner plus Ripley) space pirates can survive not just the Queen but also the Newborn?<br/><br/>
Oh well.  Its actually a good movie if you aren't obsessed with the other three and can see the failings in the movie.  But its not comparable to the previous three, all prime examples of their age and genre.  The trilogy seems to be gauged more at adults, while the latest installment seems somewhat teenage-ish, with lots of unnecessary gore and cursing."

"Kit-48","8","0","0","22 March 2000"," Tied for second-best
","This is the fourth film in the Alien series and, for my money, tied with ""Alien 3"" as second-best of the lot, coming behind only the original ""Alien"" in quality. I'm aware that it's an unpopular opinion, but I definitely think that, while ""Aliens"" is a damn good action movie, it is a fairly ordinary science fiction movie, and the Alien series is first and foremost about science fiction.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is simple. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) died at the end of ""Alien 3,"" and now, two hundred years later, the United Systems Military has cloned her and the alien queen inside her. Their genes have become mixed a bit in the cloning process, though, so while Ripley is now something a little more than human, the Queen has her own unique surprises in store.<br/><br/>This is an absolutely beautiful film, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's direction is wonderful. The look of this film - both the sets and the aliens themselves, except for one - is fantastic. The actors are definitely competent, though Weaver, Winona Ryder (Call), Michael Wincott (Elgyn) and Brad Dourif (Gediman) stand out from the crowd. I must admit that I'm yet to be wholly disappointed by either Ryder or Dourif, and they don't even come close in this film.<br/><br/>There *are,* however, problems here, or rather *a* problem. The last alien that Ripley must deal with, the nature of which I won't reveal, is a particularly uninspired piece of design. It's easy to see what Jeunet was trying to achieve with its look, but it comes off as tacky and, frankly, ridiculous. It's sad how such a potentially great film can have such a clear point at which it declines.<br/><br/>Still, the failures of the last ten minutes aside, this is still a film well worth seeing. A particular highlight is the scene underwater; watch for the differences between the way Ripley moves and the other characters do, and see if you can pick up on exactly what she moves like."
"sleeper-10","Null","0","0","14 March 2000"," Next time, dismember the franchise's corpse
","I dunno.  This one...sure, they spent a lot of money on it, okay.  Yes, Sigourney Weaver is amazing in that not only does she look phenomenal for a 48-year-old woman, but she actually bothers to act in what could easily have been a where's-my-paycheck performance.  Fine, we've got a great supporting cast, like J.E. Freeman, Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya, Ron Perlman.  So where did they go wrong?  Why is this a waste of a movie?<br/><br/>I'll give it a shot:<br/><br/>1) Let's start with the small stuff first.  H.R. Giger might be a whiz at designing xenomorphic monsters, but must we let him influence spaceship architecture too?  Come on!  Why on Earth do spaceships always have dark corridors, strange and severe angles and contours...it's a military vessel, sure, so it won't be pretty, but this ship looks like a lot of effort went into making it creepy and scary.  It's not as ludicrous as EVENT HORIZON's Notre-Dame cathedral in space, but it's pretty close.<br/><br/>2) They spend all of the film's creative energy justifying a means of bringing Ripley back into the story, and they do a decent job: cloning her centuries later, so that The Man get his grubby hands on the Alien DNA kicking around inside her when she died.  Fine, semi-plausible within a sci-fi context, although the odds of one blood sample lasting for 200 years until cloning is perfected is slim, but whatever.  However...once the pawns are in place, the film, like the spaceship it's set on, goes on autopilot: kill the lights, let the monsters loose, run for your lives.  We've seen this exact same thing three times already.  It was old in the third movie.<br/><br/>3) They squander one of the more intriguing premises of the film: having a little bit of Ripley's human DNA, the Aliens are a lot smarter now.  But beyond one or two scenes, and a silly ""ambush"" they set for the humans, this is kind of forgotten about.<br/><br/>4) Winona Ryder is horribly miscast as Call, the gal with a secret (and unlike the morons at Fox, I won't give it away for those who haven't yet seen the movie).  She's just too soft and porcelain to play a hardened pirate-type character.<br/><br/>5) Not to give anything away, but the final monster, a human/Alien hybrid, looks like crap.  Kind of like Pumpkinhead.  So the ending was a bit lacking.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie just didn't do anything for me.  It lacked the terror of the first one, the ferocity of the second, and the misguided-but-bold philosophical stance of the third.  Instead of trying a new thematic approach, it tries to cover all the bases at once, stretches way too thin, and snaps, leaving you with a movie that doesn't really say or do or instill anything.  Sigh.  Oh well."

","Alien Resurrection supplies us with the logical extension of the conceptual issues raised in the previous three films; unfortunately, the story doesn't take us through them in a satisfactory way.<br/><br/>Ripley's identity becomes more and more entwined with that of the alien throughout the series.  In Alien, it is little more than a lethal opponent; Aliens created a set of parallels between the two, primarily motherhood; In Alien3 the parallels become intersections, portraying Ripley ""pregnant"" with an alien.  Now, Ripley and alien are reborn through cloning, a process that intermingles their genes, and conflates their identities even more. Ripley's blood is acidic, her physical traits are enhanced, and she communicates intuitively with the aliens.  The queen alien, for its part, gives birth to a human/alien hybrid, which identifies Ripley as its mother. These are all pleasing developments.  Also, Juenet's visuals are at least as striking as those of the previous films, crisp and stylish.  Both Brad Dourif and Dan Hedaya provide solidly enjoyable performances, in addition to Sigourney Weaver's serene Ripley.<br/><br/>Instead of unfolding carefully and thoughtfully, however, the movie rockets into confusion in the first 20 minutes, and the rest of the film is a flacid series of chase scenes.  It chooses not to focus on the most interesting of the new characters (Dourif's alien-loving scientist, and Hedaya's General Perez), who are dispatched as soon as the aliens get loose.  Instead, we get to muck along with the foul-mouthed crew of smugglers as they work their way through the alien-infested ship, which, minus the shocks, is nothing less than boring.<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection also reverses much of the work of Alien3, which attempted to return the alien to its status as a sort of supernatural death-figure. The components of the alien (which were so utterly horrific in the first film) are now gimmicks; one alien presses a button with its extendable jaws; in another scene, a ""chestburster"" is used to kill one of the bad guys by placing his head right over the point of exit.  (This last scene is one of several that are sure to make this film remembered as the most gratuitously gory in the series.)<br/><br/>There are several other moments worth mentioning (such as when Ripley discovers a lab that displays the results of failed attempts to clone her), but they are usually deflated by the lack of dramatic tact (in this case, one of the smugglers says snidely, ""Must be a chick thing,"" after she destroys the lab in rage).  This was a film with enormous potential, only a fraction of which was lived up to."

To me, ""Alien: Ressurection"" is very similar to James Cameron's ""Aliens"" (aka ""Alien II""), but it lacks the nerve and intensity of that film. And while Camerons movie from '86 was packed with new special effects that amazed most viewers, Resurrection doesn't come up with anything new. (Although the scene while they're submerged and they fire grenades under water, is quite cool.)<br/><br/>All together, it's a good movie, and it delivers what you'd expect from the last movie in the Alien-series.

","Alien: Ressurrection was definitely a good attempt at a sequel but definitely fell short by a long, long way.  The other three Alien films were solid. Their plots were strong and held their own.  If the Alien species were to be real, these films would describe them perfectly, in mannerism and in habits, reproduction, and thinking patterns.  In Alien 4, much of this structure and solid foundation were thrown away.  It is easily proven impossible and contradictory in many ways.  Even the slime and gunk the aliens put off to build their homes was altered and very different. Alien: Ressurection was an addition that was best to do without.  The characters were somewhat weak except for Ripley's.  The only character that truly fit the alien movie specifications was the leader of the Betty crew and he was killed right away.  Too many times in the film did a door open and those who were still alive thought it to be an alien whereas it was someone they thought to have died earlier on.  It might have been ok if it was done once, but three times?  Two of them within 5 minutes of each other. Talk about lacking ideas for suspense. Speaking of suspense, the film wasn't even suspenseful, nor was it thrilling, and the action was weak and almost non-existent.  The film was so full of plot holes and unrealistic ideas and concepts that it was almost funny. And the ""Newborn""?  It was rather a stupid idea to begin with. Now I'm not saying that Alien: Ressurrection was a bad movie, there were some very strong points to it, such as how the newborn was torn between it's thinking of an alien and as a human was very realistic (even though the overall idea was dumb).  The film definetly would have done much better as an independent idea and film but completely lacked everything as an alien sequel.  It truly did not live up to it.  What a disappointment."

Furthermore, the creator of the original Alien design, H.R.

Resurrection was pleasing to the eye and had a very good plot, the references to the past movies were done with a style and class unlike many sequels today.  (Ripley's first line in the movie is ""My Mother told me there were no monsters, no real ones"" with scientists all around looking at her in some sort of chamber, and that is the exact same line Newt said from the second Alien movies to Ripley about the Aliens.) Except I think Ripley was refering to the Scientists bringing her tortured soul back to life to re-live the horror she had already been through 3 times.  The new age alien fighters aren't company men, nor are they marines, but more like space pirate guns for hire types that add a new element to the series, I hope if they do another movie, they use some of the characters because they interacted with Weaver's character extremely well.

","Okay, so this movie doesn't match up to Alien or Aliens. But it certainly makes up for Alien 3's lack to carry the series.  But after all, it would be difficult to carry the series from what Ridley Scott and James Cameron have done. Alien Res. does provide more insight into the lives of the denizens of a later era.  We meet Elgyn and his irrepressible crew, as well as the almost psychotic General Perez and his slimy scientists.  We get another great character, Call (played by the very talented Wynona<br/><br/>Ryder), and finally, we get Ripley, believe it or not (!) back from the dead (played by the fantastic Sigourney Weaver.  An Alien film just isn't an Alien film without the Erica Kane of the Alien Legacy.  What a great heroine!) This film brings Ripley to a new plane on the evolutionary scale.  This new Ellen Ripley, part Alien, part human, is unsure about her destiny at first, but the film ends up giving us the Ripley we've come to know and love. Alien Res. does take the series' show piece, the Alien, to a new level with the disgusting Newborn.  If the Queen in Aliens didn't even terrify you, this creature will! The pace is somewhat uneven, but the action is high, the film's sequences are interesting. The movie is a excellent blend of the dirty pirates shifting to virtue (well, somewhat) while the clean scientists turn evil, Ripley's dynamic return, and an interesting prophetic commentary on cloning, evil and good. My thinking, 20th Century Fox can take this series now in two different directions:: 1) Alien 5 could catalogue a new discovery of aliens after Alien Res. with or without Ripley (and Call) or 2) Alien 5 could write off the two most recent films as a<br/><br/>dream sequence (Fox's original idea for Alien 4).  After<br/><br/>all, it makes sense that Ripley would dream about dying with the aliens, and her resurrection with the aliens is testimony to her growing ever close to the alien race.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  We met one derelict ship in Alien.  Isn't<br/><br/>interesting, the prospect of more?  I would think the aliens had to originate from somewhere, right?<br/><br/>Let Ripley, Hicks, Newt, and Bishop embark on new adventures with our unfriendly aliens, or show all new characters.

In shortit is annoying.<br/><br/>With characters that wouldn't seem out of place in Whedon's terrible Serenity, some very bad CGI, awful acting (Wynona, how did you ever manage to become a film star? Sigourney, were you having a laugh or what?) and an ending so bad I was unsure as to whether I should laugh or cry, this film is a failure on almost every level.<br/><br/>Ripley, having died at the end of Alien 3, is cloned by the military, so that they can lay their hands on the alien queen that is inside her (is it just me, or does this make no sense whatsoever?). The new Ripley's DNA, however, is a fusion of alien and human, meaning that she now has superhuman strength, cool basketball skills and a liking for leather pants.<br/><br/>With a queen now in their possession, the military scientists quickly grow themselves a batch of aliens, using some poor saps, kidnapped by a bunch of unlikeable space rogues, as hosts for their creatures. However, once 'born', these aliens prove smarter than your average ET, and they soon escape to cause all manner of bloody mayhem .<br/><br/>Ripley, along with the rough and ready 'pirates' and an android terrorist, must try to escape death whilst also ensuring that the aliens do not successfully make their way to Earth.<br/><br/>I will confess to enjoying the gratuitous gore in this chapter of the franchise but, between them, Jeunet and Whedon have loaded this film with so many naff elements that fans of the series will surely curse their names for what they have done."

","Alien: Resurrection starts by informing us, the viewer that is, we are on a huge spaceship the 'USM Auriga Medical Research Vessel United Systems Military' where on-board there are 'Standing Crew: 42 Enlisted, 7 Science Officers'. The sinister & misguided Dr. Mason Wren (J.E. Freeman) & his team have recreated Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) by cloning her using blood samples, some 200 plus years after she originally died. They want the unborn queen alien inside of her & surgically remove it. Wren has military backing & General Perez (Dan Hedaya) pulls the strings & gets him what he wants. Enter 'The Betty Commercial Freighter Standing Crew: 6 Unregistered', it's crew of criminals & general scum have a delivery for Perez. A delivery of bodies in suspended animation which Wren uses to create more aliens. As you could probably guess it's not long before the aliens have escaped their rather inadequate cages & are rampaging all over the place killing everyone in sight. Ripley, aided by the alien DNA inside her, must once again do battle with the alien & prevent them from reaching planet Earth...<br/><br/>Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet I liked Alien: Resurrection, I would probably rate it as third in a very good series of horror Sci-Fi films behind Alien (1979) & Aliens (1986) but ahead of Alien 3 (1992). The script by Joss Whedon isn't a massive departure from the previous instalments, a group of people trapped in an isolated location in a race against time to survive &, of course, plenty of dark corridors. Alien: Resurrection tries to take the best elements from the first two, the spaceship setting from the original & the action from the second, & it does a pretty good job at entertaining for an hour and fifty odd minutes. The strong paternal themes are here again & run throughout the film, the character's are a bit clichéd like the obligatory tough guy, the token black character, the young female & the disposable character's who get no screen time at all except for when they are killed but Ripley is very different this time around which makes for an interesting new angle if nothing else. It moves along a nice pace & is never boring or uneventful. I must admit though I didn't like where Alien: Resurrection went with that stupid looking alien human hybrid at the end.<br/><br/>French director Pierre Jeunet (who apparently spoke very little English & had a translator on set at all times) lights the majority of the film in dark browns & oranges which gives it a slightly drab & dull look. He films the action scenes quite stylishly with some nice shots although that ricocheting bullet is the height of stupidity, I would like to see anybody actually try it! Overall the film has a nice style to it & is pleasing on the eyes. Thankfully he doesn't forget about the gore & Alien: Resurrection has to the goriest entry in the series, people have the tops of their heads bitten off, heads squashed, someone is frozen & breaks apart, aliens stick their tongues into & through people, a room full of dead bodies with their chests burst open & a cool bit where an alien burrows through someones head & pops out of their forehead plus there is a room full of gross genetic experiments gone (very) wrong.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 Alien: Resurrection is undoubtedly a fine looking film with that big budget Hollywood polish to it. Slick cinematography good production values & sets while the aliens themselves have never looked better, apart from one or two poor, by todays standards anyway, CGI shots. I love all that thick slime the aliens drool as well, of which there is plenty. Unfortunately I think the alien hybrid thing at the end looks absolutely awful & like someone wearing a rubber skull mask brought from a joke shop. The acting is OK but they aren't given much to work with.<br/><br/>Personally I think Alien: Resurrection is a pretty good action/Sci-Fi/horror film that delivers on all counts, although it's nothing we haven't seen before. Still, definitely worth a watch."

This film is contrived, flat, and relies heavily on special effects and enormously gruesome creature attacks to pull the movie through a lengthy running time of nearly an hour and fifty minutes. Sure, the visual atmosphere, special alien effects, and science fiction action are all impressive, and I liked much of the film thanks to those elements. I did not care for the movie, however, for many reasons. Mainly due to the absence of a story line beyond scene after scene of violent behavior. <br/><br/>
	The story takes place 200 years after the last ""Alien"" movie. Ripley has been cloned from a drop of her blood and is still the main character. All this takes place on a massive space ship, where the government wishes to breed alien for medical reasons.  Most of the movie takes place on a freighter ran by a homeless crew. Something goes wrong, aliens break out of their restraints, and wreak havoc on most of the members of the crew. However, they have Ripley with them to explain what is going on. One of the group members is named Annalee Call (Winona Ryder), whose identity may not be what it seems. She and the rest of the band are placed in situation after situation with a simple gimmick of how they must reach their way back to earth without aliens on board. Most of the production is spent detailing these situations, and at times, perhaps in a little too much detail. <br/><br/>
	Some of the film's violence gores a little over the edge at times. Lets say an individual excepts the fact that aliens tare off and or crush victims' heads frequently, as well as doing their gobble de gook scare scenes when they kill no one. There are even murder scenes under water, obviously taking some pointers from ""Jaws."" And the stomach churning suction sequence in space where the aliens and the last of the remaining humans are placed on a shuttle, will stick with you long after the ending credits roll by. This is not a movie for the faint of hear, young, or squeamish.<br/><br/>Most of the performances were modicum satisfactory, but none were anything noteworthy. Sigourney Weaver is surely running out of energy with the Alien series, and seems a bit lost here. Winona Ryder suffers from the exact same syndrome. Her character inhabits such a big twist near the end of the film, it is a shame that it isn't very effective. Since characters are such in lacking of humanity, and the aliens are so brilliantly crafted, it is hard not to root for the monsters here.<br/><br/>Brought to you by 20th Century Fox."

"Headrock","9","2","6","11 September 1998"," Greatest Ever?
","Well, I certainly disagree with many people when I say that resurrection is the best movie in the series. Jean Pierre Jeunet, with a record of some increadible movies, brings his talent to Hollywood, to create what is (In my opinion) the best movies in the series and (Although too many disagree) the best movie I've seen in the past 10 years. What David Fincher failed to do in Alien^3, Jeunet succeeded in Resurrection, and bigtime. This is probably the best ripley ever, and the cast is magnificent and has wonderful chemistry on the screen. This is one movie that makes you go ""WOW "" when it ends. I've heard more than enough bad reviews about it. Perhaps it 's just a bunch of ""Aliens"" fans who can't accept that it's just a better movie, and perhaps it's right. But so far, the only thing I can say is :<br/><br/>This is one record-breaking movie."

","I just finished watching the special edition Aliens on DVD and I love that movie now even more than before.  James Cameron worked a brilliant sequel off of Ridley Scott's masterpiece.  Both of these Alien films were just that, FILMS.  The parallels and symbolism that they draw to feminism, childbirth, man vs nature, and even the Vietnam war are poignant and powerful.  Alien 3 wasn't as good as the first two, but it was still a good sequel directed by the amazing David Fincher.  I was really looking foward to Alien Ressurection when it came out, and never have I wanted 2 hours back so much in my life.  This couln't have been any worse.  From the cliched dialogue, to the gratuitous action scenes, Ressurection was 109 minutes of the worst piece of sci-fi period.<br/><br/>There is nothing new or creative about this movie.  It covers the same allusions to the pain of birth, except this time we have to hear cheesy one liners to ""lighten the mood"".  If I want to leave a theater feeling light hearted I'll go see Babe Has Fun Somewhere.  I watch Aliens to see a dark film about man trying to harness nature and failing miserably."

","There are so many things wrong with this movie that it becomes next to impossible to find anything positive to say about it. Atrocious writing, epileptic pacing, characters made out of wet cardboard, special effects that look like a video game and cinematography to match.<br/><br/>Watch the first two of this series and then compare them to this abysmal write-off. If you can't tell the difference, you may have severe perceptual problems. Possibly even a crippling mental handicap. The first two films of this series are original, inventive, and genuinely frightening. They've been imitated by lesser movies ever since.

","After watching again Alien, Aliens, Alien3 and Alien Resurrection in a row my personal preference has changed. Now, I prefer Alien 3 over Resurrection. So, my personal ranking is Aliens, Alien, Alien3 and Resurrection.
I am not sure why today Alien Resurrection looks weird, FX looks cheap and the movie itself is a weird mixture of comic-tragic boring Alien story. Also, the ending is the weakest of all the movies. Give me a break.
On the other hand I still choose Alien and Aliens as my TOP 5 favorite movies of all time."

","Dear oh dear or dear - Sad face.<br/><br/>What the hell happened?<br/><br/>What was that?<br/><br/>What did they do to it?<br/><br/>Those were just some of the things that I thought after watching this film. There were more things I was wondering, but such expletives would get me banned from reviewing films on here so I can't write them. This was slightly annoying, slightly horrible and a bit weak too.<br/><br/>So, 200 years after Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself for the good of humanity to make sure Aliens didn't become a menace to the universe, she is reborn. A clone of her is created in order to extract the Alien that she was carrying. In recreating her, the alien she was carrying is also recreated. Unfortunately as they both share one body the DNA gets a little mixed up and they both become part of each other. The ship where she was created is attacked by hijackers/ protesters/ smugglers and becomes unstable subsequently freeing aliens. She forced into teaming up in order to survive, in teaming up she learns information that puts her in a conflicting position that tests her allegiances.<br/><br/>Amongst some of the other questions I had were; why contain aliens with acid for blood, in containers that aren't acid proof? Why have autopilot sequences that return the ship to earth the minute the aliens escape? What is plan B for emergencies - or is plan B just run for your life and hope to escape? Also, Winona Ryder - why? In the world of sequels this feels like ""Batman and Robin"" - it's almost cartoon and colourful in its appearance, it contains stupid segments that add nothing to the plot or universe, and it might as well have nipples on the alien suit (a-la Batman). Sure there are worse film in the world, but for a franchise that had so much potential in the first films and in novels and comics - this is served up as a lite version of aliens which looks like it's just there to gross some money from fans willing to pay for anything Alien related. It's formulaic; it's ill-conceived, woefully executed. Maybe as stand-alone film you find on the Sy-Fy or Horror channel this works, in the franchise of Alien films, not. 5 out of 10 is a bit kind but this review has found me on a good day."
"johnnyboyz","5","1","2","24 January 2020"," Some interesting ideas, but falls short in too many departments too often to work
","The annoying thing about ""Alien: Resurrection"" is that it is primarily an action film that comes with the odd scare, rather than an actual horror film which happens to include the odd second-unit set piece. It is additionally lacking in that atmosphere most science fiction films have when they place characters far off into the future or depict events on other planets or in the vast chasm of space. Things here feel more synthetic than the other films, and it makes you appreciate even more what Cameron did in the first sequel when he managed to keep ""Aliens"" genuinely frightening in spite of the heavy artillery its characters had access to.<br/><br/>""Resurrection"" unfolds on a heavily guarded space station, a few hours from Earth, in the distant realms of the 23rd century. After the moaning and wailing which greeted the aftermath of the killing off of three beloved characters at the beginning of ""Alien3"", ""Resurrection"" rather curiously opens with the bringing of another one back to life. Look away now if you haven't seen ""Alien3"", but following the death, nay evisceration, of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, scientists, in a film shot the year of the cloning of Dolly the sheep no less, have managed to recreate her as she was just prior to her decision to extradite herself from this mortal realm. The decision behind this is/was born out of the fact she possessed inside of her a young alien queen, likely the only one in left in existence, at the time of her plunge, which is a shifty organisation's only means of obtaining the spawn of this queen - the likes of which they require for their own ends.<br/><br/>The base soon welcomes a motley space-crew who are delivering people in hyper-sleep to the scientists and military personnel while Ripley undergoes the death-roes of her treatment. The gang offer somewhat fertile ground for characterisation - the captain and pilot are in a relationship; Ron Perlman plays the rugged equivalent of a twenty-third century seadog; there's a mechanic in a wheelchair (but wouldn't robotic technology enabling him to walk exist by now?) and a young angelic looking woman named Call (Winona Ryder) who holds her own in the rough, working-man dominated space. Frustratingly, few get beyond a perimeter of stock status.<br/><br/>What is additionally curious is that Ripley is not the protagonist per se in this edition; her mannerisms and behaviour, whilst executed flawlessly by Weaver herself who must play someone who is neither human nor animal and, on top of that, artificially created in the first place, are cold; detached and strangely invulnerable - she is not the Ripley of the franchise prior to now and this sits a little uncomfortably. The film, in fact, lacks any kind of presence of a hero around which we might revolve our interest. Much time is spent in the opening act on characters that are removed within minutes of the second, while Weaver plays someone whose arc has already been completed in the other three films when she played out some interesting dynamics with the alien creatures to do with motherhood and fostering children.<br/><br/>The Queen they get out of Ripley does what they want and the staff get their aliens on cue, only to see them escape, of course, and wreak havoc on the spaceship, all around the time the transporters come to blows with the marines on board when Call, the one we thought least likely of the crew to start trouble, breaks house rules. Confusingly, the vast army of soldiers already on board abandon the ship at the first sign of a problem, thus calling into question as to what their purpose was in the first place in case of an emergency, and the film beds down into a nice, comfortable groove of depicting an array of people, military personnel included, striving to get to the remaining route off the ship, which is the craft the mercenaries arrived in, which of course is miles away from where anyone begins.<br/><br/>I suppose there is an air of unpredictability in who will live and who will die, but this doesn't compensate for much when we realise how poor characterisation has been to this point. To everyone's horror, the mother ship's programming has automatically kicked in, meaning it is in the process of returning to Earth - an odd contingency if you know what you're dealing with on board is as dangerous as it was. There is much talk on concepts of universal brotherhood and sticking together from one character among the band of survivors, but as soon as they realise Earth is the ship's destination and that these animals will probably ravage the planet, making a dangerous detour to try and stop it seems unappealing. Where else did they expect to be able to go if not Earth?<br/><br/>""Resurrection"" falls rather a long way short in the pacing and atmosphere stakes - it unfolds on a ship too close to Earth in the first place for it to feel like we're lost in the barren wildernesses of outer space, unlike ""Alien"", and where in Ridley Scott's film the characters had to make up a course of action as they went along as they faced their situation, they plod their way to a fixed destination in this entry, knowing full well a sort of reprieve awaits them when they arrive. What was additionally lost on me was the film's commentary - does it disapprove of the science behind cloning? Is toying with genetics a bad thing? That cross-breeding is a dangerous game? Long after you realise the new addition to the franchise, a giant white mutant, can understand English, it will probably be lost on you too."
"davidmvining","5","1","2","26 November 2019"," Kinda works as a comedy, but only kinda
","This is the first movie in the Alien franchise that makes no attempt to be a horror film. Instead, it's a blackly comic action movie, and I think it sort of works. Sort of.<br/><br/>There's a lot of handwaving away of certain practical elements like the source of DNA used to clone Ripley, or how her DNA includes the DNA of the alien, or how, if they had both, they couldn't just clone the alien and not Ripley. But, hey! If they don't do this, then there's no movie! So, handwaving is somewhat appropriate.<br/><br/>What that creates is a character that looks like Ripley but is not actually her. There's talk about her inheriting the original Ripley's memories (through some handwaving), but there's never really an exploration of Ripley dealing with the fact that she's not really Ripley. She just kind of becomes a more badass version of Ripley because she's got some alien traits now. This could be an interesting place to start Ripley. She's new, not quite the same, not quite sure of who she is or what her new relationship with the aliens is. But, she's lost in the movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is standard Alien stuff. A shady organization (the military this time) wants to capture the alien and use it for its own purposes, but the alien cannot be controlled and runs amok. At the center are a group of working class people who have to find a way to fight back and escape the enclosed space they are trapped in with the antagonistic aliens. All of the Alien movies have this basic plot, so it's hard to hold that against the fourth entry.<br/><br/>The single largest problem with the movie is the fact that it tries to be an ensemble piece, but it's a grand 108 minutes long with extended action sequences. That's not a lot of time to spend with the array of characters that Joss Whedon wrote and Jean-Pierre Jeunet created as the writer and director. Ripley gets lost among the other characters like General Perez, Call, Dr. Gediman, and Vriess. You would expect the movie to cull the herd like the rest of the franchise does, but a shocking number of characters survive to the end, further muddying the waters. Cutting the cast down from the beginning, or killing off a lot more at the start of the mayhem, may have allowed a bit of narrative clarity that the movie as it stands currently lacks.<br/><br/>Where this movie shines is in how it embraces weirdness and black humor. Reactions to deaths, odd designs, and Dan Hedaya's entire performance provide regular, if intermittent, comedic value to a movie that would otherwise be rather dreary. Ripley's own complete nihilism is a good source for some laughs as well, though her sudden scene of attempted pathos when she comes across the seven previous attempts at clones falls flat in comparison.<br/><br/>Probably my favorite bit of weirdness, though, comes near the end. Long after the Queen taken from Ripley's chest has laid a series of eggs that have birthed facehuggers that have subsequently impregnated human subjects with xenomorphs (this life cycle is complex), we discover that the Queen isn't actually laying eggs anymore. There's no real explanation for the change, but we do get the magnificent image of an alien Queen laid back with her legs spread wide and a giant womb that births a weird alien human hybrid. I do not understand how that image could have ever been intended as something serious. It's just simply way too out there and bizarre for that. It has to be an attempt at absurdist humor, and I embrace it as such. The design of the hybrid seems like a reasonably logical extension of the idea, but it's still so thoroughly off-putting (especially that little upturned nose at the end of its snout) that it feels like poorly executed weirdness.<br/><br/>The action scenes are reasonably well executed, but the only one that really stands out is the underwater chase. I suppose it stands out most because it's unlike anything in the franchise up to that point and it's the first one that includes a fully CGI (and rather well done) xenomorph that moves swiftly through the water. There's no real terror to the image, though. The movie embraces the visceral nature of the beast but never really tries to make it scary.<br/><br/>Still, the movie's a mixed bag. I appreciate the humor and some of the design, but I find the story overall confused and the rest of the design uninspired or off-putting. It's not the complete disaster some people make it out to be. If it weren't funny, I'd agree, but those chuckles I get through the film carry it quite a bit."

","One of the most polarizing sequels in modern franchises, ""Alien Resurrection"" sometimes plays like several movies at once: It's a science-fiction sequel with grotesque special effects, an enthusiastic crowd pleaser filled with one-liners written by Joss Whedon, a European farce, and a compelling furthering of the Ripley saga (thanks to Sigourney Weaver's deeply peculiar but effective performance).

Oh well, I guess these mistakes happen, it's just that, when they happen in a movie so draining, it's hard to focus on anything else.<br/><br/>The Alien series is truly a disappointment. Its been over 250 years, and these aliens are still what they were back in 1979, because this entire series is filled with repetition and gimmicks, with zero story.<br/><br/>There was an Alien, that alien came from a queen alien, then an alien lay an embryo inside Ripley and Ripley killed herself. She got cloned and had her DNA mixed with another queen alien, that then gave birth to another alien, and now Ripley has moved from being prey, to being mommy. The 1st sentence is literally all 3 of the first Alien movies, and the second sentence, is a convoluted mess meant to resurrect a kicking horse.<br/><br/>I don't know how I would've felt watching these films back in the day, but watching them today, I can't help but see shoddy pieces of work, that get crippled more and more with every sequel, by their predecessors.

","A completely unnecessary sequel that proudly takes over the label of Alien franchise's weakest chapter & also features an odd bit of interspecies erotica, Alien: Resurrection was seen by many as an improvement over Alien³ when it released but that's only because this film didn't have to deal with the reputation of two genre- defining chapters of the franchise & unlike its preceding installment, it only gets worse on multiple viewings.<br/><br/>Set 200 years after the events of Alien³, Alien: Resurrection finds Ellen Ripley resurrected back to life through successful cloning & has the alien queen surgically removed from her body. In the hope of breeding this magnificent life form & study its biology, human hosts are used which are delivered by mercenaries but when the aliens escape their enclosures, Ripley & the rest of the survivors attempt to escape & destroy the spaceship before it reaches Earth.<br/><br/>Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the film tries to make a tonal shift from a sci-fi horror to a dark comedy but eventually fails at achieving any of its goals as it pretty much sucks as a horror film, doesn't carry enough meat for an action or sci-fi feature and the black comedy elements only come off as far too stupid. Joss Whedon's script is another culprit here even if it contains some interesting ideas & is completely inept when it comes to characterization or action or suspense.<br/><br/>Cinematography adds more tinge to the picture & also includes close-ups of characters when they're busy making stupid faces. Set design is passable & although the alien creatures aren't poorly rendered like it was in the last film, it still doesn't come close to their seamless depiction in the first two films. Visual effects ain't up to the mark either despite its high-budget, music doesn't even feel like a part of the film & the very final creature is so grotesquely designed that it's just too absurd & laughable.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Alien: Resurrection manages to even surpass the last chapter when it comes to overacting. Other than Sigourney Weaver & Winona Ryder to some extent, the entire cast looks horrible with their exaggerated expressions, sounds horrible with their overly cheesy dialogues & plays horrible by delivering terrible performances from start to finish. Weaver's performance ain't that great either, however, she does enough to avoid any major complaint on her part.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Alien: Resurrection is the most light-hearted & cheesiest chapter of the Alien franchise which fails at everything it was trying to do. Adding nothing new to the franchise that we haven't seen before, featuring a set of uninteresting characters most of whom served their purpose as just death fodders & providing no excitement or thrill in any of its action sequences, Alien: Resurrection succeeds in ruining the very franchise that redefined horror, sci-fi & action with its first two chapters and suffered a heavy dent with the third."

","Recovering from the mediocre blow that was ""Alien³"" put a lot of pressure on ""Alien: Resurrection"", and it was steep hill to scale for director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. With that being said, don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying that he failed, nor am I saying that ""Alien: Resurrection"" is a poor movie. No. The director managed to steer the franchise back towards the right track, which was established with the first two movies. But it just didn't fully reach the same level of entertaining or intensity.<br/><br/>Personally I didn't get the aspect of cloning would mix the DNA of Ripley and the alien that she had inside her at the time of her death in ""Alien³"". But hey, I guess it made for a theatrical twist to the storyline. And also the super-human direction that this was steering the Ripley character was also a bit too childish, in lack of a better word, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The story in ""Alien: Resurrection"" takes place 200 years after ""Alien³"". Ripley has been cloned and the alien queen inside her surgically removed, but the cloning process has mixed the DNA of Ripley and the queen, giving Ripley a mutated human/xenomorph DNA structure. And as the military is trying to breed the aliens for biological weapons, they soon find their space vessel overrun by perfect killing machines.<br/><br/>The effects in ""Alien: Resurrection"" were adequate and getting back on track after the abysmal gallery of effects shown in ""Alien³"". And it was, of course, nice to have multiple aliens and even a queen throughout the movie. Which leads me on to the creature birthed by the queen, as she no longer lays eggs, but gives birth much like humans do. The creature which was now closer in resemblance to a human that ever before, well of course it is a matter of personal preference whether you enjoyed that or not. Personally, I didn't like that creature particularly much. Sure it had some nice touches and details, but in overall it just deviated too much from the original alien strain. And furthermore, where did all the eggs in the kitchen area come from if the queen no longer laid eggs? That was a puzzle to me.<br/><br/>""Alien: Resurrection"" doesn't have as much of an impressive cast as the previous three movies did. Sure, Sigourney Weaver is the main attraction, but aside from here then there isn't that much of an impressive ensemble of cast for my liking. The only two other people that really pulled their weight was Brad Dourif and Michael Wincott.<br/><br/>Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet started to steer the franchise back on course, but just fully reached the endline with ""Alien: Resurrection""."

There isn't a likable character in the movie so it becomes hard to root for the characters and fear for them when they are in danger...

Alien 3 was not up to the quality of its predecessors, but it had its moments and, if you look at it as a 'stand-alone' piece, it's better still.<br/><br/>Therefore, Alien: Resurrection is the studio's attempt to make up for part 3. Do they? Well, sort of. For a start they realise that having only ONE alien and NO guns was a mistake in part 3. Now we have guns and about fourteen aliens. Unfortunately, this still means it's a step backwards from the planet full of aliens we saw in part 2.<br/><br/>Ripley is back and, seeing as she's now part alien herself, is enjoying playing her 'duel role.' Plus the supporting cast are good. But, again, if you've seen Aliens, they you'll probably realise that they're all just there to make up for the characters (needlessly?) killed off in Aliens.<br/><br/>At least the direction is good (as per all its predecessors) and the film looks brilliantly dark and foreboding.<br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection is a good film, but, as keeping with part 3 rather than parts 1 and 2, it's better more as another 'stand-alone' film. An Alien film shouldn't just be 'good,' it should be absolutely amazing, setting the standards for adult sci-fi/horror to come. This one is a nice effort at the mistakes made in part 3, but it's still inferior to Aliens, sadly."

","A completely unnecessary sequel that proudly takes over the label of Alien franchise's weakest chapter & also features an odd bit of interspecies erotica, Alien: Resurrection was seen by many as an improvement over Alien³ when it was released but that's only because it didn't have to deal with the reputation of two genre-defining chapters of the franchise & unlike its preceding installment, it only gets worse on repeated viewings.<br/><br/>Set 200 years after the events of Alien³, Alien: Resurrection finds Ellen Ripley resurrected by successful cloning & has the Alien queen surgically removed from her body. In the hope of breeding this magnificent life form & study its biology, human hosts are used which are delivered by mercenaries but when the Aliens escape their enclosures, Ripley & the rest of the survivors attempt to escape & destroy the spaceship before it reaches Earth.<br/><br/>Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the film tries to make a tonal shift from a sci-fi horror to a dark comedy but eventually fails at achieving any of its goals as it pretty much sucks as a horror film, doesn't carry enough meat for an action or sci-fi feature and the black comedy elements only come off as far too stupid. Joss Whedon's script is another culprit here even if it contains some interesting ideas & is completely inept when it comes to characterization or action or suspense.<br/><br/>Cinematography adds more tinge to the picture & also includes close-ups of characters when they're busy making stupid faces. Set design is passable & although the alien creatures aren't poorly rendered like it was in the last film, it still doesn't come close to their seamless depiction in the first two films. Visual effects ain't up to the mark either despite its high-budget, music doesn't even feel like a part of the film & the final creature which is a human/alien hybrid is so grotesquely designed that it's just too absurd & laughable.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Alien: Resurrection manages to even surpass the last chapter when it comes to what's known as overacting. Other than Sigourney Weaver & Winona Ryder to some extent, the entire cast looks horrible with their exaggerated expressions, sounds horrible with their overly cheesy dialogues & plays horrible by delivering terrible performances from start to finish. Weaver's performance ain't that great either, however, she does enough to avoid any major complaint on her part.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Alien: Resurrection is the most light-hearted & cheesiest chapter of the Alien franchise which fails at everything it was trying to do. Adding nothing new to the franchise that we haven't seen before, featuring a set of uninteresting characters most of whom served their purpose as just death fodders & providing no excitement or thrill in any of its action sequences, Alien: Resurrection succeeds in ruining the very franchise that redefined horror, sci-fi & action with its first two chapters and suffered a heavy dent with the third."

","I'm not certain of why this film came about. Whether it was because of a desire to end the franchise in a better way after the failure of Alien 3 or just cashing in on the name of a popular franchise. Either way Alien Requiem is a weak addition to the Alien franchise and one that does not live up to the legacy that preceded it. <br/><br/>This time it doesn't even feel like a sequel, but rather like a reboot. 200 years after she died, Ripley is resurrected by a mad scientist who wants to use her DNA to create a new form of Xenomorph. But the aliens escape their cage using their acid blood (why they didn't put them in a special jail that wouldn't melt with acid is one of many plot holes) and take over the ship. Thus it's up to Ripley and a group of space bandits to defeat the Xenomorphs before they make it to earth. It's a bizarre story that is alright, but out of place for the tone of the franchise.<br/><br/>The idea of space bandits is a good one (as evidenced by the fact Whedon used the same idea later to make the hit show Firefly). But unfortunately it is not executed particularly well here. Each character does have a memorable feature that will ensure you do remember the different characters, but it seems to lack the usual quick witted charm that makes most of Whedon's work so memorable. Whedon states the reason for this is a weak execution of the source material and some script changes after his draft. Possibly this comes from the fact that the director Jean Pierre Jeunet's style does not blend well with Whedon's with his melancholy, dramatic approach not being best suited for the script. <br/><br/>Unfortunately just like Alien 3, Resurrection screws up the most important thing in the franchise. The Xenomorphs. Once again we see too much of them. What made them so iconic in the first two is that we hardly saw them. It was the fear of the unknown that made them so memorable. Here they appear a no better than some run of the mill monsters. They never feel as if they're too much of a threat and even their designs are different. <br/><br/>On top of this they do some incredibly strange plot points with the Xenomorphs, the strangest coming within the final act. Out of nowhere a Xenomorph/human hybrid is born merging Ripleys DNA with the alien. That sentence alone felt strange to write They even attempt to add some drama in to it with the alien viewing Ripley as its mother, even trying to make us feel sorry for it. But when they constantly switch between sympathetic child and murdering monster the whole thing just loses its impact.<br/><br/>Ultimately there's nothing in this film that is particularly memorable. There's little reason to watch the film since it doesn't add anything interesting to the franchise. But if you do watch it then don't enter with any expectations."

","So what I do is to buy the entire Alien Quadrilogy, and sit down for a marathon. The first two were awesome, the third being alright, and then I look forward to seeing how they could continue after killing off Ripley. And with Alien Resurrection, they proved that the third movie should have been the last one. Not sure if anyone notices, but the crew following Ripley in each movie have a lot to say for the atmosphere. The original movie had a spaceship crew, then come the marines, and after that come a bunch of space convicts. Sorry, but I can't see the people in this movie as anything else than a bunch of retards. Some scenes I loathe: the scientist that uses steam to tame an Alien, scenes with that gun-guy ricocheting bullets via the walls and things (it's just not going to work), the way Ripley shows little fear of the Aliens anymore, and (good grief) the new Alien introduced at the end of the movie: Clone-Ripley's hybrid-humanoid-alien-beast-thing. Let's take a look at the last one. To me, he became an instant Jar Jar Binks of the Alien universe. My first thought was: ""NO"". When they kill it, it even looks at Ripley with sad eyes and desperately cries ""Mommy!"" Dear producers, think for a second: this thing had been alive for almost five minutes, and now it has learned English. Just the ending in itself kills everything with the Aliens: the danger, the sinister promise of certain death, and the pure genius characteristic design of HR Giger. Just sad. Please, no more Alien movies after this one. Some things can not be repaired."

","Say what you will, this installment definitely saved the saga from the premature demise that was almost engineered by Sigourney Weaver when she indulged in way too much PMS hostility toward the series while making Alien3. <br/><br/>The slaughter of all our darlings during the course of that film spelled desolation and oblivion for any hope of further sequels. But, lo and behold! Jeunet & company have done the impossible in a very houdinian escape from what looked like certain destruction with this film!<br/><br/>I say HOORAH! <br/><br/>Yes, it's very icky and slimy in its own way, but is that out of keeping with this tradition? Au contraire!<br/><br/>This film also has its own original brand of beauty and elegance, perhaps more than any other installment thus far. <br/><br/>Each installment makes its own special contribution: Alien=Atmosphere and suspense. Aliens=Action, adventure, and human interest. Resurrection=Visual effects and sheer creativity. Aliens3=Stupidity and forgettable-ness! <br/><br/>The character development is wonderful. Ripley as Alien/human hybrid is a revelation of sinister anti-heroism. The dialog is snappy and often very funny. Ron Perlman is also wonderful as the hulking merc who is devoid of etiquette.<br/><br/>I was so relieved when I saw this film! Once again, a great director adds his own genius to the anthology. <br/><br/>But I still regret that David Fincher didn't get his fair shot at contributing with Alien3. If only Ms. Weaver had been in a less bitchy frame of mind back then (sigh!)<br/><br/>Ah, well! As the French say, C'est la vie!"
"KnightsofNi11","6","1","2","10 September 2012"," When writer and director don't see eye to eye
","After the Alien saga was treated by a Brit and two Americans it was time for a Frenchie to step in and take the reins. Enter French auteur Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the man to helm the fourth Alien movie, Alien: Resurrection. This fourth installment takes place 200 years after Alien 3. Scientists have gathered blood samples from Fury 116, Lt. Ellen Ripley's final resting place, and used them to create a super strong alien/human hybrid clone of the Xenomorph slaying expert. These scientists pulled the Queen alien that was inside of Ripley out of her and used the Queen to start breeding the Xenomorphs. And, as one would expect, things quickly go wrong. It is, once again, up to Ripley to save a rag tag gang of space pirates from these horrific creatures running amok on a ship that is headed towards Earth at an alarming rate.<br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection is undoubtedly a Jeunet film, with its darkly comic atmosphere and animated and eccentric style. He adds all of his usual European flare to this exciting and explosive film. Alien: Resurrection reverts back to James Cameron's way of doing things in this saga, making the film an action film rather than a suspense horror. Honestly, this is something I was happy about. It was neat to see the series switch back and forth between these two genres with Alien being a true sci-fi horror, Aliens being a strictly action packed film, and Alien 3 returning to the horror roots. Alien: Resurrection is non stop action and with Jeunet's visual brilliance it is an absolute visual spectacle.<br/><br/>Where Alien: Resurrection fails, however, is in its script. Not so much because the script is bad, but writer Joss Whedon and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet had two different visions for the film. Whedon wrote a crazier and more tongue-in-cheek script, while Jeunet directed a more straight edge final product. This clashing is what makes this film falter the most. The style doesn't match the script, and when characters say or do things that seem a little silly in a more serious environment it feels awkward and cringe worthy at times.<br/><br/>Also, Joss Whedon made a very bold move in what he did with the space pirates. He tried to create a group of characters who we could believe have worked together for a very long time and he tried to create an atmosphere around them that made them feel like a true space crew, not just actors thrown together to play certain archetypes. This is one of the most revolutionary things that the original Alien succeeded phenomenally at. No science fiction film has ever created this sort of atmosphere, and Alien: Resurrection does't even come close. Whedon tried to pay a great homage to the first film in doing this, but really he just revealed to us the things that made the crew of Alien work by showing us what absolutely doesn't work.<br/><br/>Visuall, Alien: Resurrection is astounding and as pure entertainment it works pretty well. It's definitely fun and a great way to kill two hours. But with a script that is mismatched with the film's style and a story that is full of odd plot holes that continually take you out of the experience this film is kept from being much more than just a fun little action film. It has some great moments and if you've seen the other three films then definitely see this one, but don't expect the kind of quality you are used to with this franchise."

","200 years on from the events of Alien 3 – and the death of Ellen Ripley and she's back, cloned from DNA retrieved prior to her death aboard a massive spaceship.<br/><br/>Why it had to be Ripley and not some random? Who knows aside from the obvious cinematic reasoning, but after a few tries #8 comes good and supplies the diabolical scientists with what they are seeking – a Queen alien.<br/><br/>After it is surgically extracted and the former host Ripley #8 is patched up she calmly tells the giddy scientists ""It's a Queen she'll breed you'll die."" Now if a clone 200+ years into the future knows what lies ahead (maybe she has seen the first 3 films?) we shouldn't be too surprised that she is right.<br/><br/>The scientists eventually decide to keep Ripley #8 alive and she exhibits miraculous healing powers and almost superhuman tendencies – the fact that they use basketball to highlight some of these new abilities lead to a scene best described as uncomfortably corny.<br/><br/>Once the aliens put their heads together and come up with an embarrassingly easy escape the usual modus operandi begins, only this time more than a dozen aliens are criss-crossing the ship in search of tucker. In the early stages everyone able to escape does just that, for the rest it is every man, woman, android or cloned-alien/human hybrid for themselves.<br/><br/>There is a cool underwater sequence that looks particularly cool (and as usual in film everyone can hold their breath for around 4 minutes). The Queen seems a lot bigger this time out but gets minimal time on screen and even less to do when she finally arrives and a finale that leaves me on the fence, it is either plausible or lazy – I can't decide.<br/><br/>Aside from dredging out the same basic formula of Ripley + stragglers once again the main problem is that Alien: Resurrection is spectacularly miscast. The ship's commander is Dan Hedaya and he's just wrong – but believe it or not he isn't the least appropriate – that would be Winona Ryder as Call, a member of a group of less than honourable space cowboys. The team are allegedly tough, rough and dangerous to know, and with Ron Perlman and the excellently gruff Michael Wincott among their number some of them are – but Winona and a physically challenged and over-acting guy named Vriess it's more of an impractical eyebrow raising joke of a crew in reality. Some of Winona's dialogue sounds plain bizarre when she says it.<br/><br/>Team that with a cartoonishly over the top Brad Dourif as a cuckoo scientist and you have a higher ratio of perplexing decisions than you have realistic characters, never a good thing.<br/><br/>In reality this is a 6.5 – a film with a couple of marginally entertaining moments but overall a patchy disappointment, but I owe Aliens so much that I can't bring myself to do that to Ripley, so<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7 / 10. (But read the paragraph above) Alien 4: Resurrection is far and away the least of the series, but it has a couple of decent moments. Ripley – even a cloned hybrid Ripley – deserved better."

","It's been over the decade since I saw the last Alien so I don't quite remember what going on in Alien3 but I guess it doesn't really matter since this movie took place 200 years later and there ain't much connection between the rests of Alien trilogy.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Ripley was raise back to life after 200 years of her death by the process of cloning; where the scientist decides to take revive Alien that was in her for experiment. Things don't stay as plan when they escaped while the Queen is breeding a new kind of alien.<br/><br/>Written by Joss Whedon, the guy who wrote Buffy, Firefly, Toys story and so on; this guy got his own fans – whatever he does or he touches turn into gold for them. Sadly it ain't me, I see movie for what it is. And despite the great potential in this movie – it fail.<br/><br/>I do not blame Joss for this failure since there seem to be quite a change in the script and how it was executed. But overall there ain't anything much in the storyline to hold on to. It was kinda lame and predictable storyline (maybe in 1997 it was awesome, but in 21st century it wasn't – it was dated). The only memorable scene might be the underwater fight (still, it last only few minutes).<br/><br/>What I suspect was there has been a great influence from the studio to change the feel of the movie (almost half of budget has been cut) and the story and production design has been change. The movie feels like an ordinary - man versus extraterrestrial movie and not an ALIEN movie. It is not much of a thriller ride anymore.<br/><br/>Anyway I don't get why they always give to the project to the unknown director (first it was James Cameron, and then it was David Fincher, now this - Jean-Pierre Jeunet). (James only did Terminator and Piranha) (David only did commercial before that) (Jean can't even speak English – maybe that is the reason he can't communicate with the rest of the crews and casts).<br/><br/>Overall the movie lacks the very ALIEN feel of the first three that very unique in its own way. This was very commercial. The story was weak and the execution wasn't very plane movie – nothing really stand out. Not even the newly hybrid Alien that suppose to be one of the most fearsome creature in the universe. It was disappointment.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Sure why not, it wasn't all bad if you have low expectation and not compares it to its predecessor.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10 (Grade: C-)"

","This gets a whopping 4 from me only because Whedon's script has Whedon moments. Otherwise, it is a dismal end to what began as innovative, captivating sci/fi horror. Everything about this film screams exploitation, and I am deeply amused at the recurring statement that Weaver only agreed to do the film because of the emotional medical unit scene; I kind of thought the $11 million persuaded her. Clearly, budget problems interfered, and it shows. There is a Disney-esque look to the aliens, especially in the underwater sequences. Worst of all, though, is the dreadful, knowing, irritating clone played by Ripley. I remember thinking that A3, while flawed, was at least a legitimate end to sequels. Too bad. 1 was inspired and stunning. 2 delivered, albeit in schlockmeister Cameron's hands. 3 had a morbidity that gave it integrity. This...the whole damn team wanted to make a buck, and it annoys the hell out of me that they mask this greed as a new 'vision'."

"mnpollio","4","1","2","13 April 2011"," Beating the dead horse
","If Alien was a sophisticated sci-fi thriller set in outer space, Aliens was a virtual textbook on the correct way to make a sequel and Alien 3 was a wall-to-wall catastrophe that put the nail in the coffin of a stellar series, then Alien: Resurrection is little more than a cheap attempt to wring one more round of cash from a once durable tentpole. After the disastrous third entry, it was difficult to see where this film could go or why enduring leading lady Sigourney Weaver would want to go there with it.<br/><br/>A couple of hundred years after the last debacle, the Company has once again launched an effort to clone the aliens and also end up with a bizarre hybrid of Ellen Ripley (Weaver) who also shares alien DNA. During a visit by a group of mercenaries, all hell breaks loose with the aliens going on the rampage and the mercenaries forced into a prickly trust with the hybrid Weaver to escape with their lives intact.<br/><br/>On the plus side, while practically nothing works in this sequel, it still manages to surpass the wet fart of Alien 3. Although it would have been in her best interest to take a powder after the prior film, one still has to hand some credit to Weaver for still managing to find new facets to play in a role that should have been played out. The problem here is that Ripley has always been an audience favorite and too much time is spent with the viewer wondering how far this latest incarnation can be trusted. This is a bit sad since this film desperately needs some rooting interest.<br/><br/>The screenplay feels like it is at least four drafts from being completed. It is a veritable skeleton, which barely gets its sketchy characters into position before starting the pursuit. It never gives a compelling reason why the Company maintains its compulsion to exploit the aliens, much less why they want a clone of Ripley hanging around. The new characters are without exception badly written and underdeveloped, which means the only way of having any impact is by shamelessly overacting. Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, J.E. Freeman and Brad Dourif indulge in laughably hammy over-the-top performances that make them memorable, but not in a good way. Michael Wincott, as the leader of the mercenaries, is barely introduced before being discarded and Dan Hedaya is simply dreadful as the leader of the military contingent on site. Apparently remembering that James Cameron had much success introducing a mother/daughter relationship in Aliens, the filmmakers here try a clumsy stab at the same thing between Weaver and series newcomer Winona Ryder. Unfortunately, the film offers no time for such trivialities like character development, and the dialog is groan-worthy. Ryder spends her time on screen looking ill-at-ease, miscast and fails to find any sort of camaraderie with Weaver, rendering the mentor/student relationship that the film half-heartedly introduces utterly pointless.<br/><br/>Director Jeunot's direction reminds one uncomfortably of David Fincher's previous effort, but without some of the ponderousness. The visuals and special effects are merely adequate, trodding ground that the prior entries have done better. Worst of all, this film squanders the opportunity presented by the return of the alien queen by rendering her harmless in favor of an ill-conceived alien/human hybrid that makes an appearance in the final stage of the film. This proves to be one of the most misguided developments because this new creature seems to look upon Weaver at its mother and astonishingly manages the feat of being the only character in the film to elicit any sympathy. The final moments where it is betrayed by its ""mother"" and its all-too-realistic shrieks of agony and looks of uncomprehending betrayal during its uncomfortably protracted death scene serve to emphasize that none of the ""human"" characters that one has wasted an hour or so with previously were remotely as believable or worth their screen time.<br/><br/>If one could only scour one's mind of Alien 3 and now this entry (to say nothing of the Alien vs. Predator foolishness), the world would indeed be a better place."

","Honestly, I wasn't a big fan of Alien: Resurrection when it was first released. I saw it at Harkins Arizona Mills and walked with distaste because, at that time, I was a thorough lover of the Alien³ film. Years later, I would reverse my opinion by simply opening my eyes to the (literal) horror of Alien³ and realizing, despite the ""humor"" of Alien: Resurrection, it was 10x the movie part 3 was and a good conclusion of the series.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't taking itself too seriously. If it did, it would be very odd for the once-great Ripley character to be spewing lines that only (other Sci-Fi great) Spock would recite. It was fun, scary, adventurous and just enough suspense and originality to be added to any Alien franchise lover's collection.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, you kind of have to see the wretched Alien³ to get the background needed: (and believe me, this is a spoiler for those who haven't seen part 3) Ripley's partners from Aliens died, including the young girl, Newt and Ripley gets stranded on Fury 161, a prison planet, but not before being injected with the queen alien. Ripley attempts at destroying the *only* queen by killing it along with herself.<br/><br/>200 years and 8 attempts later, the new ""company"" of militants, clone her and remove the queen alien in order to spawn more alien warriors for the battle..of a war we've never seen. Anyways, they decide to keep #8, or Ripley, alive and she slowly, but surely, regains some of her memories of her uncloned past. Meanwhile, we have on this cloning ship a group of renegades who brought the hosts to those aliens. They're very rambunctious with this new model Ripley, but all hell breaks loose when the inevitable happens: the aliens, smartly, escape on board.<br/><br/>So, here it turns into the past, once again, making this a thankful last chapterthe movie turns to escaping off the ship to avoid being either eaten or harvested for the Queen. Luckily, Ripley (Weaver) keeps it interesting with dialogue and quips and they introduce the NEVER-SEEN-BEFORE alien swimmersnot that that's a big deal.<br/><br/>The movie's finale still puzzles meeven after watching this several times. I don't want to spoil it even further, but the two (vague) things that bother me was Ripley's willing to go there and why one character/creature kills another immediately. This could just be me, but I can see why they were trying to change it up at the endeven though it ended just like part one?<br/><br/>I have already stated to stay away from the ""Special Edition"" of Alien³ and I might have repeated that hereif only for the incredibly awful, ""Men in Black"" opening segment. Don't let that discourage you or set the scene for Alien: Resurrection. Simply, get the DVD that contains both, watch the original (theatrical) opening credit scene – though it looks like some Child's Play horror sequel beginning – and then continue on with the rest of the special edition. Seriously, the MIB terrible ""special"" edition should be avoided, while the rest is just fine.<br/><br/>It's a watchable movie, with some really funny lines and scenes – I loved the ""it was in my way"" bit. It's nowhere near the caliber as Alien or Aliens and it's 10x higher than Alien³but it's worth a viewing to complete the series.<br/><br/>Side Note: (spoiler) Once again, they kill off one of the best characters almost immediately. In Alien³ the doctor was axed prematurely and Newt, Bishop and Hicks earlier. Here, it was the captain, Frank (Wincott)he got the same quick fate. Yeah, I get this is not supposed to be a bed of roses, but come on, for oncelet someone other than Ripley prevail."

It was only after watching both several years later it dawned on me how great they actually were. The extended editions also help greatly. And while they aren't without their problems, they are truly worthy to be part of the series (I think we can all agree the same can't be said for the abominations that are AvP and AvP2).<br/><br/>People always point out what they perceive to be plot holes in the movie. Why is Ripley cloned 200 years later, why not straight away? Easy, while its never actually explained why, it doesn't matter, you can think for yourself. Maybe they didn't develop the tech until then. Hence the 7 failed experiments. In aliens no one ever questions why the narcissus didn't get found until 57 years later with Ripley in perfect condition. How do they clone her with the alien inside her? In Alien3 Clemens uses medical equipment on Ripley, when she first arrives her clothes are bloody, who's not to say that alien DNA can't be already mixed with her blood?<br/><br/>I will concede that the USM Auriga crashing into Earth is major. Wouldn't it kill millions of people? perhaps even had meteor like consequences? Stupid.<br/><br/>As for the characters, they are all perfectly believable for what they are. The cloned Ripley is a fascinating character, but more should have been done with her. Overall its just a great movie, with plenty of action and interesting scenes.<br/><br/>It's undeniable that Alien and Aliens are true classics.

This film is not a whim of Jeunet, is a commission from a European film to Hollywood, and I've seen other films of Jeunet ( ""Delicatessen,"" ""The City of Lost Children,"" ""Amelie"") will understand that we are with a pure Jeunet different genres, and it brings its own vision. A big disappointment for me was seeing a Jeunet ""made in Hollywood."" Although there is not faced with a change in the Alien saga, which came from the previous filmed by David Fincher, which explores various other fields in the world of fiction and horror.<br/><br/>A director must have its own seal, and Jeunet's it. And so I appreciate this film, much as Ridley Scott says that he believes a ""shit"" than yours.<br/><br/>.. and is said not to let it be so as Jeunet would have liked. A director who makes this great movie, and then performs Amelie, deserves all my respect."
"Dr_Kruger","5","1","2","3 November 2008"," What is it that makes it the worst of the series?
","What is it about this film that makes it the weakest of the four Alien films? Visually it's terrific in places. Where Brad Dourif faces off the Alien through the glass in the lab, the set design, lighting is excellent. The music is nice and dramatic and the cast and performances from Weaver, Perlman, Wincott, Dourif, and others are really good too. Some moments of dialogue also put a smile on the face. I quite enjoyed Ripley 8 telling Leland Orser he was going to die and she was the mother for one.<br/><br/>So what we have is the basis for a great sequel. Where does it all go wrong? Well the whole concept is just completely ridiculous isn't it. I mean almost every trick that made the first films work (and most other effective action/horror work) is hammered, the main thing being that limited exposure of the actual Alien to keep you on the edge of your seat is gone and here it's practically in every second scene. This nullifies any potential for it to be scary. The final 30 minutes is cringe making at best and since and they didn't even get the science right. I mean, since when does Sulfuric acid dissolve glass? It's a damn shame, because with all the ingredients in the first paragraph in place it had the potential to be better than Alien3 if not as good as the first two. If anything, Alien Resurrection shows how difficult a task Fincher had in making Alien3 original and reinventing the concept. For what it does well it gets half marks from me"
"t_ilcev","Null","1","2","6 April 2008"," I liked the film
","I liked this film. Although I prefer 1 & 3. Many people praise Aliens as the best one,but, for my taste, it's a little bit to much of a Rambo movie, with not to convincing gun-action. I liked the development of Ripley's character though, her growing up and becoming stronger, fearlessly overcoming the fact that she has been lost in space for so many years and that her daughter had died of old age by the time she returned to Earth.I liked immensely her very strong maternal instinct, leading her back to the alien's nest to rescue the little girl Newt and her battle with the mother-queen.Ripley has always been the central point of the Alien saga-and of course her antagonists,aliens, on the other side. I liked the idea of cloning the defunct Ripley very much. When I saw her die in that furnace, with the queen bursting from her chest, I felt that it was just a perfect ending for an outstanding trilogy. But, they have cloned Dolly, why not Ripley? When you think about it, it makes perfect sense-the Company has always been prepared to do anything, just to get this perfect biological weapon. The fact that they have obtained an improved version of Ripley, without planning it, after 7 other failed attempts, just mirrors all the justified fears of playing gods of creation with genetics. And, what is the detail I liked even more, is that they have even improved the Queen-she has also a certain amount of Ripley's DNA, as she has developed a womb and the ability to give birth...no need for cocoons, eggs, all the slimy stuff any more...the Queen gives birth to a Newborn, which seems even worse than the original alien, because of his similarity to humans. It is similar to us even in the fact that he ultimately kills his mother, denies his origins, just like we are denying our animal origin, and clings to Ripley, his other, human-partly alien mother. She has some attraction to her other nature, but, in the end, we all know whom she chooses-the human inside of her. She has been always wondering which species is the worse, the Xenomorphes or the Humans; this franchise has been a very nice exploration of this idea..."

","This movie shouldn't have been made. It lacks all the outright fear of the first three. Sigourney Weaver did a decent job, but the movie itself was just too corny to be a valid representation of the Alien Series. Honestly, if you are a true fan of the series, I would advise skipping this one.<br/><br/>To be honest, the book that either this movie is based on or is based on the movie (I am not sure which) had a much cooler storyline. I mean Ripley gets into a bare hands fight with an alien and wins. That would have been an awesome element to add to the movie.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder is moderately good at acting, but she doesn't really stand out in any good way.<br/><br/>And the storyline is very hard to believe, although they did take blood from Ripley in 3, so I guess the alien could be cloned, but I don't recall the Alien embryo altering the host's blood chemistry and DNA in any of the other movies, so all they should have is Ripley's blood.<br/><br/>Anyway, it works, and the film does give you a little bang for your buck. If possible avoid, but any alien fan needs to see this movie once, so they can appreciate the others even more."

","My eighth review for IMDb is for ""Alien: Resurrection"", a forth installment that was made despite the fact that the franchise WAS SUPPOSED TO END WITH THE THIRD ONE. Oh well, I'm just gonna get this over with.<br/><br/>The Positives: -Sigourney Weaver. Without her, this film wouldn't even deserve one star. -The CG looks good, with one glaring exception (I'll get to that later).<br/><br/>The Negatives: -The actors that aren't Sigourney Weaver. Winona Ryder seems lost, and she doesn't belong in this movie. Ron Perlman is a great character actor, but the character and dialogue that he's given robs him of any opportunities to stand out. And who were the other characters in this movie again? I can't remember any of their names. -There are a lot of glaring plot holes in this film. How did they clone Ripley in the first place? Couldn't the company have gotten an alien some other way? How does Ripley have the alien inside her still? How could it take 200 years to clone her? And I thought that the aliens didn't kill one another. What gives? Trust me, there's a lot more where this came from. -Characters keep falling victim to horror film clichés, even after ""Scream"" came out a year before this. How could a scientist smart enough to clone Ripley be stupid enough to look down the hole where the alien just went? -Random, stupid things happen in this movie. So that guy is a traitor? So Winona Ryder is dead now? So after a fight with the aliens, Winona Ryder is suddenly outside that door? So Winona Ryder is actually a robot? Huh?? -The alien/human hybrid child of Ripley is one of the worst visual effects creations I've ever seen.

","I'm not sure I agree with even having a fourth party in the ""trilogy"", or ex-trilogy. The third part had a glorious and finite ending. But when you combine the DNA from the dead Ripley and the DNA from the head of a Hollywood studio you get a monster that is for all practical purposes immortal. The film is visually up to the standard of the series, perhaps even better-looking than some of the others. Jeunet, as is evident in ""Amelie Poulain"", knows his way with visuals so there is no problem there. There is also no problem cast-wise... almost.<br/><br/>Who the hell had the ""brilliant"" idea to cast Ryder in a sci-fi film, and in an ""Alien"" film at that? First we are supposed to accept her as a SMUGGLER. I don't think so. (I mean, she proved that she can't even successfully smuggle stolen clothes in an L.A. clothes store!) Then we are supposed to accept her as some kind of a TERRORIST with a mission to destroy the aliens. I don't think so. And then we are supposed to buy that she is an ANDROID - on top of all that. Smuggler? A joke. Terrorist? A bigger joke. ANDROID??? UNBELIEVABLE! Her being an ANDROID is a piece of absurdity that was the hardest to swallow in recent movie memory. To make things worse, they made her WEEP in one scene over the fact that the others are making fun of her being a robot: this doesn't exactly help make her more believable as one, either. Ryder is cute, relatively likable and everything, but I simply don't see a place for her either in the future or in the past; I would only cast her in a late 20th century setting. Having Ryder in this picture is like putting Bruce Willis or Stallone in a generation X film (or a costume drama). Who's next in line to play in outer space? Madonna? Drew Barrymore? Richard Simmons? Roseanne? Hugh Grant? The rest of the casting is good; the inclusion of Perlman, Hedaya, and Wyncott, among others, was good. The film is full of action, the characters aren't annoying... almost.<br/><br/>The evil scientist shtick was used here to a high and absurd level. There are also occasional lines and one-liners here and there that almost threaten to turn this film into a self-parody and I, for one, consider this a bad idea; either it's a full-scale parody with Bill Murray and Goldie Hawn or it's a regular sci-fi horror - make up your mind. An example of this indecisiveness is the scene in which a half-human half-alien is born in the presence of a cocooned scientist. His comments about the ""infant"" being like a ""butterfly"" (and other such nonsense) were ridiculous. A sequel that parodies itself cannot work, one example being ""Escape from L.A."" (though, admittedly, THAT particular movie would have been bad anyway).<br/><br/>However, the film is fun to watch, and the underwater sequences were good. The humour didn't always work, but most of the dialog didn't get (too) moronic. The first half is better. If you'd like to read my ""biography"" of Sigourney Weaver, contact me by e-mail."
"dark_one71","6","1","2","8 October 2006"," Mostly Tolerable except...
","I'd say that this movie was alright. Not great, not terrible, just alright. I try to keep an unbiased opinion and will first do a little compare and contrast.<br/><br/>Alien: A suspenseful horror that has you enthralled through most of it.<br/><br/>Aliens: A bit more overt action oriented, but still enthralls you in the scenes where the marines are being sieged by the aliens and eventually manage to escape. (not to mention a few others).<br/><br/>Alien 3: A hashed together reason for a crash landing but otherwise well done character development and interaction. Dialogue was alright and was an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Alien 'R': Good setup, makes you scratch your head and brings you in. But once it has you it is fairly shallow. The dialogue is the bare minimum required to progress things along between actions scenes for the most part. (all in all this seemed like it was half-finished).<br/><br/>Now here go the big moments that just glared as ridiculous and that I couldn't ignore at all. I don't care what your excuse is... this just doesn't make sense. (these won't be chronological, just what comes to mind first).<br/><br/>Scene 1: Post underwater swimming they begin climbing the ladder shortly after losing Frank's main squeeze. Christie is carrying their crippled friend on his back when ""Oh no!"" the alien climbing the ladder grabs a hold of his foot. In an effort to take him down Johner lets out a barrage and finally kills the thing. Weakened from the swimming and the acid in his eyes, temporarily (or permanently?) blinding him Christie is weakly there being held on the ladder by his passenger. In an unfathomably stupid writing, Christie dies by valiantly sacrificing himself... The way that alien was dangling... all he had to do was shake his foot. Just a little jiggle and away it would go. But no, he drops himself down into the water into what should have been him shortly pulling himself back up... Last time I checked acid burns didn't kill you.<br/><br/>Scene 2: The simple fact that when cloned ripley somehow has a foreign creature inside of her... Last time I checked DNA doesn't contain a parasites details in it... It isn't like copy and pasting something, only the original organism gets copied over. Unless the fact that the face hugger's alter the hosts DNA when they impregnate them was omitted from the last three movies.<br/><br/>Scene 3: With seemingly no motivation besides, just because, the sociopathic Dr. Wren does his best to screw over the mercenaries. Even going so far as to betray them for no reason other than ""Hey look! I'm evil!"".<br/><br/>Scene 4: When the Origomo (sp?) crashes into the earth it seemingly was large enough and contained enough force when detonating to take out Africa as a whole. The majestic sunset scene of a peaceful sky greeting them when there'd already be atmospheric consequences occurring everywhere.<br/><br/>My final and biggest criticism. The whiny humanitarian android lives, the bad-ass ""Ripley"" lives (though that's expected), the crippled guy lives (though he's plucky and neat so expected), and the misogynistic asshole lives? Not the captain... or his girlfriend... or the almost meditative trick shot Christie? Hell I would've settle on The random security guy joining up with them over Winona Ryder's character."

No. Somehow, all this high grade material has been put together and the result is less than satisfactory. It is difficult to put my finger on exactly what went wrong, I suspect the script has to bear some of the blame. Also, the villain was not particularly villainous and the heroes were not terribly likable and the aliens failed to instill the brooding menace of the first film, the terrifying vigour of the second or even the vaguely artistic and bizarre nature of the third. I don't think I will take the trouble to watch this film a third time."

","OK, this one does have quite a few questionable plot aspects, but it's still A LOT better than the garbage that Alien 3 was. First of all, cloning Ripley back into the series may come off as real desperate, but what can you do when the damage of Alien 3 is already done? I don't buy the idea that Resurrection stands out negatively as a pointless follow-up to the trilogy. If anything, it actually saves the series from ending in horrible fashion, both considering the plot and production.<br/><br/>Resurrection starts off brilliantly - the cast is great (apart from the misplaced Winona Ryder) and the Aliens look better than they ever did; the 1st Alien was more magic for obvious reasons but there were technical limitations, whereas Cameron's Aliens were lost in the action-packed style of the film. Fincher's Alien was too obvious in its CGI-ness.<br/><br/>However, the whole thing pretty much starts lacking when the action starts. It just doesn't really live up to the initial build-up (which I agree, may not have been that original as such). I will also agree on comments above that Ripley is not the same Ripley that we got to know from the first Alien movies, but again, she was already damaged by Fincher. Also, yes, the villain in this movie is a questionable one, for reasons that the viewer will see as the movie rolls on.<br/><br/>I read some comments about how this one isn't scary enough compared to the other Alien films. This may be true more or less (I really think Cameron kinda started this by putting action before suspense), but on the plus side, Alien is once again a true sci-fi movie, whereas Fincher unfortunately steered it into the direction of horror."

This movie was directed by french filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet which gave this movie a different style. The sets are fine. There are some good action scenes. The characters are somewhat simple (exept for Ripley). The alien themselves are CGI and look okay but not great. There are the most gory scenes in this movie than in any of the other ALIEN movies.

Sigourney Weaver delivers a good performance but the rest of the cast fails somehow. Winona Rider... well, let's just say I don't really like her :).

That can't be legal.<br/><br/>The last Alien-Ripley movie is not: A suspenseful movie (despite some quite scenes), an action movie (despite so many weaponry), or a tragedy (despite the creepy and magnify clone room scene).<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection is: A comedy (very black but still the funniest Alien movie, you can have a really fun time watching it), a gore movie (blood, guts, exploded heads, freeze people, more brains and guts, etc...), a nightmare (is a nightmare, no more twists, is like a french nightmare, very Gothic, not very intelligent).<br/><br/>For the performances, let's forget about sexually behaved Ripley (that mixture of Alien and human really affected her). Ron Perlman, Gary Dourdan, Dominique Pinon and even Winona Rider give perfect performances that will never be forgotten into the Alien universe.<br/><br/>In general is another Alien movie, better than Alien 3 of course, but that is far away from Alien and zillions of Light years away from Aliens.

","In some ways, ""Resurrection"" is a logical fourth episode in the sequence: the trilogy has become a tetralogy. What SHOULD be considered (apart from the obvious need by the franchise to make more money) is that the Ripley character IS NOT THE SAME Ripley we saw in the first three.<br/><br/>Ripley has been a constantly changing/evolving character. Within the 'original' trilogy, she has developed from the competent officer on a company ship, via a protective mother-figure, into a militant protector of humanity and, perhaps, beyond. Resurrection puts this much-loved, fiercely-protective character, into a situation where SHE is the controller. But who are we talking about? It/she is the end result of generations of experimentation: of an attempt to create a hybrid alien/human.<br/><br/>Perhaps, the underlying message is that scientists cannot cage their creations, indeed, cannot control and/or understand them.<br/><br/>The introduction of the 'mercenary crew' underlines this notion. Ripley has become an 'alien' complete with the 'attitude' the entity 'Ripley' has apparently always had.<br/><br/>When, accompanied by the 'new' humans, she discovers her lab-bound predecessors, (complete with 'kill me' dialogue), the realisation that we are only shown a small percentage of the 'failures' is, perhaps, accompanied by the notion that she has every reason to kill ALL the research scientists.<br/><br/>As a mother-figure to the aliens, who have, possibly, become more HUMAN, the hybrid clone (Ripley) still can't overcome her loathing of this invasive, destructive life-form.<br/><br/>Whilst not the insect-based supermom, the Ripley hybrid surely offers us the luxury of feeling empathy for ALL mothers, regardless of species.<br/><br/>There are subtexts within subtexts. Still, I could be overreacting. Damnit - it deserves better than some of the featured critiques.<br/><br/>Watch Alien: Resurrection and make up your own mind. I did."
"valadas","5","1","2","5 August 2005"," Nothing original
","The problem with these stories that develop themselves in several successive episodes is that quality deteriorates from the first on. This saga of the alien monsters doesn't escape this rule. If the first movie was good mainly for the originality of the main theme and the creativity of its conception the following ones became repetitive and mere action movies for lack of ideas(I must say however that I have not yet seen the third one). If you still recall the first movie you may remember that the monsters' image was only suggested by some glimpses which left large field for the viewer's imagination to conceive them. From the moment they began to be shown entirely they lost much of their power to thrill or scare us. This 4th episode has indeed some good and some original ideas. But like someone already said about a certain novel, the good ones are not original and the original ones are not good. The rest is mere action to rivet your attention till the ending which is moreover predictable. There is therefore not much to credit this movie except that it's technically well made but you know the part that computers take nowadays in this kind of sci-fi movies. A final note to say that the acting was not very good with the exception of Sigourney Weaver of course.

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","12 July 2005"," Alien Crucifixion (spoilers throughout)
","I don't care what most people say, Alien 3 is a damn good film. It's dark, it's gritty and it's refreshingly downbeat. It was a damn good end to the Alien trilogy. Unfortunately though, because of the negative reaction to the film and the desire to make some more cash out of a potentially lucrative franchise, Alien Resurrection got made. And boy is it bad.<br/><br/>Right from the very first second it's obvious you're watching a turkey. The music is terrible, the special effects are sub-par and the visual style reminds me of The Fifth Element  a film I hate with all my heart. Then you have the awful Star Trek costumes and soldiers who look like they're holding toy guns. It's a comic book.<br/><br/>What I like most about the original trilogy is the way that despite being set in the future and despite being about aliens with acid for blood, the environments felt realistic. The Nostromo felt like a living breathing spaceship, the colony in Aliens felt authentically low-tech and the prison planet in Alien 3 was grim and dirty. Alien Resurrection, though, feels like exactly what it is, a film. Not once could I suspend my disbelief. The sets look like sets (something that should never happen) and you can just imagine them filming in some large hanger and then someone shouting 'Cut!' The environments are horribly artificial. They're TV quality.<br/><br/>Then there are all the pointless gimmicks. Not one of them works, whether it be the breath identification, the metal detector gloves (more cheap TV sci-fi), the ship's computer being called Father just because it's oh-so clever in light of the computer in Alien being called Mother (Father, by the way, sounds like Stephen Hawking), the spitting Aliens or the bastard creation that is the Newborn. And speaking of the Newborn, how in the hell did that get past the design stages? It looks like hunchback yellow turd with a potbelly and National Geographic tits. It's not in the least bit scary and the attempts to humanise it are hilarious. I'm supposed to have sympathy for its demise? Sorry, I could only sit there laughing my head off.<br/><br/>But the Aliens in Resurrection aren't much better either. They all look like someone has blown their nose on them. They're covered in too much slime and gunk. And then, like the Newborn, there are the depressingly stupid attempts to try and give them character and to try and make the audience feel sympathy for them. Do I care that two aliens decide to kill one of their own? No, of course not.<br/><br/>But what about the characters? Well, the film doesn't have much time for them and neither do I. Every single one is a cardboard cut out. You've got the evil corporate/military guy, the supposedly lovable rogues and the character who turns out to be a robot. Haven't we been over all of this before? And Ripley is a waste of space too. Sure Weaver tries her best to give her character layers, and she has a bit of fun being bad, but Whedon's script is so thin that it all comes off as a bunch of soundbites, or trailer moments as I call them. ""I heard you run into these things before. What did you do?"" ""I died."" Ooh, pithy! But I guess that's what happens when you give writing duties to a fanboy and the creator of the hideously adolescent Buffy the Vampire Slayer. However, to be fair to Weaver, although perhaps not to Whedon, Ripley does have one good scene, the one where she kills one of her clones. It's the only scene with genuine feeling. Too bad then that it ends with more dire-logue  ""It must be a chick thing."" <br/><br/>In light of these multiple atrocities, I hoped that at least the action would be a welcome distraction. It isn't. The worst offender has to be the basketball scene. As if the fight isn't bad enough with its brief burst of techno music (I can't adequately express how awful the musical score is), there's the shoot-out with its toy guns and the ridiculous ricocheted shot. It's yet more comic book crap. And the underwater scene, while a good idea on paper, fails to get the blood pumping. In fact, the only thing I kept thinking during the whole scene was, 'Boy, they can hold their breath for a long time.' <br/><br/>Oh, but the worst moment in the film, worse even than the Newborn, has to be when a man with an Alien inside him, who's convulsing, and who indeed gets shot three or four times as he's walking and giving 'birth', manages to punch the shooter in the face, disarm him and brutally beat him up. It's obviously meant to be crowd-pleasing moment, but the only people it's going to please are morons.<br/><br/>But there are many other moronic things in the film. There's the way Ripley has acid for blood yet apparently has a normal physiology. There's the way that Ripley uses her blood as a convenient way to get her out of tricky situations (she's a galactic James Bond). There's the way that the company, the real bad guys in the series, are disposed of. There's the way that grown adults refer to the aliens as 'nasties' and 'monsters'. There's the way that Call inexplicably has a sample of the General's breath (how did she get that?). There's the way that Call gets shot, falls into the water and miraculously reappears. There are the Taxi Driver-style electronic holsters that one of the characters wears. And there are the amusingly awful moments of ultra-violence  the General saluting and then picking his own brain, the baby alien shooting through the bloke's head, the Newborn biting someone's head off and the Newborn squeezing someone's face off. Way to crucify a once great series."

","Jean Pierre Jeunet swans in here all French with a yellow and brown colour palette with a chance to make a great movie in a massive franchise...and balls it all up! Why? The main star of the show was ignored (the aliens) and instead crappy humour and visuals destroyed a good storyline. Another thing this franchise does not require Ripley to survive! <br/><br/>The newborn was a good idea but looked really stupid. The idea that it thought Ripley was its mum was good and that when she killed you generally felt for the beast, but it looked crap, it had a pot belly for Christ's sake!. There were some good character development, and some characters to rival that of aliens, but other than that it wasn't that good. The story was the best thing. Another thing... Being a massive fan of the alien franchise mad me notice a few things about the creatures: 1. I suppose I don't mind them being brown in colour because if they were genetically bred from the alien on fury 161 and that alien was brown it figures really. 2. Why did the aliens roar? And why did it sound so lame? 3. Why did they spit acid? That was also very lame Now that I think about it this film isn't bad I suppose overall, 6 out of 10"

","The final entry in the series, so far, and perhaps one entry too far considering Ripley's nightmare was finally ended in Alien 3. However, as is the case with nightmares, they always find a way back. Being 1997, DNA and cloning was all the rage so the guys in charge decided to bring Ripley back using advanced cloning techniques 200 years after her death. With Jeunet directing, one of the most original upcoming directors, and Joss Whedon with the script this had potential, and all thoughts were of taking the series back to an action style. Get together a talented cast and this should have been much better. Though for some reason it simply does not live up to the hype.<br/><br/>Those evil scientists have been chasing the alien Ripley encountered for centuries now, and finally after many failed attempts they managed to clone Ripley with the Alien DNA inside her. Using this they created a number of Aliens for observation, but Ripley has also become a cross-breed with all the strengths of both species. Meanwhile a cargo ship has landed on the floating base where these experiments are being made, and soon the aliens have found a way to escape. Most employees try to flee, leaving the cargo crew and Ripley to fend off the aliens. Though it is uncertain which side Ripley is on. As they try to escape The Queen gives birth to a new breed of Alien, more deadly than all the rest. Their ship is drifting towards Earth, and if the creature makes it there, humanity could be over.<br/><br/>The inclusion of quality actors such as Ryder, Perlman and Wincott add to the film's strengths, but the whole thing seems hollow, lacking both the excitement of Aliens and the scares of Alien. There are twists, lots of gore, some good effects and ideas, but perhaps it tries to be too clever for one movie. Mostly the performances are good, though most of the characters are not given a chance to grow or get our sympathy. Weaver is again good as the new Ripley, but one of the main good points of the other entries was that she was human, mortal, weak but when in danger would fight. Now we cannot relate to her and none of the other characters really draw our attention as they are all cold and hardened smugglers. Only Ryder gets some emotional value, but then again she has a twist in store for the viewer. It seems to be a film which tries to blend all of the past films into one, and therefore does not excel in any one place. The visuals are very good, as are the sets etc, but with this series we have come to want excellence.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"Izzet_06","6","1","2","27 February 2005"," The series weak link.
","It was billed as Alien crossed with Aliens when it was released in '97, but unlike Alien 3, time hasn't been kind to Alien resurrection. I would have rated this a 7 a couple of years ago, but i'd struggle to give it a 5 out of 10 at this point in time.<br/><br/>It's visually stunning, much like the films that have gone before it, but unlike the films that have went before it, it's utterly uninteresting. The set-pieces are mildly boring, the Aliens look awful and despite it's difference (almost like a french black comedy), nothing goes right for Resurrection.<br/><br/>If i wasn't an Alien fan and cared what is said about these movies, i would tell everyone to avoid it, but, it does have it's moments (Ripley destroying her clones was touching).<br/><br/>5.5/10"
"mentalcritic","6","1","2","21 December 2004"," It tried, and that's more than can be said for the next sequel...
","The first time I heard of Alien: Resurrection was when a reader of those Hollywood magazines reported reading about a new Alien sequel rumoured to be in the works. According to his statement, Ripley would be ""brought back"" by cloning. Given that Sigourney Weaver insisted that she be killed off at the end of the previous film, those in the know were skeptical that she would even appear. In spite of all that, they found the right price for her, and the rest is history. Thankfully, she had the good sense to avoid the dreadful Alien VS. Predator project. Apparently, she read that script and said it sounded like a dreadful idea, which makes one wonder why Fox has never examined some of the ideas in such sources as Dark Horse comic books.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Fox learned their lesson from the Alien 3 experience. Instead of rushing an incomplete script into production, they hired a decent writer and gave him time to come up with something watchable. As with Aliens after Alien, the decision was also made to attempt to follow up a slow, languid science-fiction/horror piece with a fast-paced, breathless science-fiction/action piece. The results, while not even remotely able to compete with the best of the series, are such an improvement upon Alien 3 that it makes the elements of Gibson's Alien 3 script that can be seen in Alien: Resurrection a bitchslap to Brandywine Productions.<br/><br/>However, a number of problems keep Alien: Resurrection from really achieving its potential. One of them is the casting. While Brad Dourif can be believed in a film like this in spite of his relatively tiny size, Winona Ryder screams out ""miscast"" like Roseanne Barr would as the lead in a porn film. Not only is she tiny even in comparison to Dourif, her mannerisms and voice scream a softness that the world of the Alien series will not suffer. That she lives to see the end while more appropriate characters like those portrayed by Michael Wincott or Dominique Pinon bite it about forty minutes after they are introduced indicates that plausibility was a secondary concern to the director.<br/><br/>The design of the Alien-Human hybrid in particular makes one wonder exactly what was going on in the minds of the production team. Apparently, a more crab-like version was originally proposed, but changed in order to make it seem more ""plausible"". That... thing... is meant to be plausible? I must have been asleep when they redefined that word. The statement that the Alien Queen also now has a Human reproductive system is a bit of a joke, given that it is implied in the same monologue that she reproduces asexually. Then again, given that the prologue expects us to believe they can obtain an Alien by cloning someone who carried one once, I doubt that respect for the audience's sense of the plausible was a big concern.<br/><br/>To the credit of the film, Ron Perlman makes an excellent addition to the canon. Unlike Ryder, one has no trouble believing Perlman could survive well in a universe like this. Weaver has also grown in terms of acting to the point where the role of Ellen Ripley fits her like a glove. She could practically portray this role in her sleep, so there's not much chance of her not giving an awesome performance. With the new direction the character is taken in, she shows that there is nothing she cannot do if given a chance.<br/><br/>In the end, however, the flaws outweigh the strengths. I don't know whether the seven minutes added to the Special Edition for a 2003 release fix this, but I doubt it. As a result, I'd rate Alien: Resurrection a six out of ten. It is far better than its most immediate predecessor, but long-time fans of the series had a right to expect more."

","Why does Fox keep beating a dead horse? Seriously, if anyone can answer this, let me know. This movie was bad on so many levels it wasn't funny. For one thing, Ripley shouldn't have even been able to be cloned, much less with an alien queen inside, so there's a plot hole right there. The acting sucked for the most part (except for Ron Perlman, who's always good), there was hardly any plot, and there were continuity errors and plot holes abound. Then there's the ending...all I can say is ""wow"". Joss Whedon, what the blue f#$@ were you smoking when you wrote the last twenty minutes of that movie? That was the single lamest thing I have ever seen in all the Alien movies. Anyway, don't go see this. You'll be wasting your time.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Go watch the first two Alien movies.

","Alien Resurrection has problems, I will agree with that. I do not agree when people say that this is an action film though. The film spends over thirty minutes setting up the story and the acting throughout is very well done. To me the Alien movies (not even the first one) scared me. They were more about making the heart race a little bit, giving a tease of the creatures. I loved the ironies in this film as well. The computer is named ""Father"" the aliens using the machine to freeze a human! The aliens are in this film for certain and it most definitely has an action feel to it but again I harken back to Aleins. Aliens was a pure action movie. We saw the aliens in it more than we did in any other film I still believe. Aliens was not scary, it did not make you freak out like the first one did. Aliens and Alien Resurrection share this in common, they are both very high powered action movies with deep integrated plot lines. The movie is not perfect, but what film is. I think most people are too over critical. ..its a movie.. .about aliens with acid for blood."
"Robert R Jackson","Null","1","2","26 June 2004"," A Hollywood franchise gutted by an echo of the French New Wave.
","I've been waiting for years for someone more articulate than myself to tackle this, but I still haven't read the review of this film that I've been waiting to see. I guess I'll have to write it myself. <br/><br/>I believe there's ample evidence on the screen in Alien: Resurrection to suggest that Jeunet had ulterior motives when he put this film together. While Scott, Cameron and Fincher all had the intention of making seamless Hollywood films that pull the audience into their world of horror and sci-fi for a cathartic and engaging experience, I do not believe that was the intention of this film. I believe Jeunet was using a method well-known to fans of the French New Wave that is often referred to as ""laying bare the device."" The intention was to make the moviegoers aware that they were watching a movie by allowing continuity errors or allowing the cameraman to catch his own reflection in a mirror. It was supposed to pull you out of the moment and make you aware that you were watching actors performing. What Jeunet does in this film is actually more subtle. He sets up scenes that parody conventions of Hollywood blockbusters and he pushes them just far enough so we know as an audience that we're in on the joke before continuing on. For a moment we're taken out of the film and given time to reflect on how ridiculous the genre can be, but before casual moviegoers can throw up their hands the film begins to take itself seriously again and we proceed. It's like Jeunet was taking potshots at Hollywood on their dime. <br/><br/>There are dozens of examples of this technique in the film. An example is when Dan Hedaya's General Perez is attacked from behind and he reaches around and grabs a piece of his brain to examine. Another is when Michael Wincott's Elgyn is led down a corridor by a trail of guns which he picks up one by one as he walks into a trap. Or the whole gag about the door locks keying on the breath of the people with access. Or when Ron Perlman delivers his ""Waste of ammo...must be a chick thing"" line (which holds the convention of the action- hero one-liner up to the light). You can go on and on with these examples. Some have suggested it was just bad writing, but I feel like there are too many clear signs that this was Jeunet's attempt to murder a Hollywood franchise by milking its own conceits until it drowned in them. <br/><br/>The next Alien film will undoubtedly be ""back on track"" as far as the intent of the filmmaker goes. Paul Anderson isn't exactly known for the layers of subtext in his films. I think it's very interesting that Alien: Resurrection was made at all. I also wonder if Fox ever had any idea (or has any idea to this day) that Jeunet made this film to ridicule and destroy the Alien franchise."

","*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br/><br/>OK, so this film was your typical run of the mill Hollywood cash grab. However, being a fan of the Alien films I liked to some extent. Unlike other Alien movies, here you can see Aliens through the work of CGI magic, yes Alien 3 had computer graphics, but the ones here are much much better. So after so many years we finally get a good look at a regular Alien. Also the cloning story is kind of interesting especially since when this movie came out cloning was a hot news item, so you can't really say this film is a piece of trash that came from nowhere.<br/><br/>Despite all this this movie has its faults. First is the surprising lack of Aliens. The characters only kill two! I was expecting some balls out gun battles with some crazy stunts and CGI effects, but none of that, though the action scene with the two Aliens is pretty cool. Second, the movie's biggest fault: The last 30 minutes. Basically summed up in a couple of words - Ripley has sex with an Alien queen. From earlier in the film we find out this is the alien she had inside her! Incest? With an Alien? Please, spare me the BS. And then there is the grotesque child monster which is an alien-human hybrid. I was ready to go with the fact that Ripley copulated with the Queen if the resulting Alien was a cool foe that could provide for an exciting climatic action scene. But that didn't happen and the climax is rather dull and the child alien looks quite stupid.<br/><br/>Ergo - this film is only for fans of the series, others steer clear. As a fan of the Alien movies I rate this 6/10. It would have been higher if the last part of the movie wasn't so dumb and pointless.<br/><br/>Rated R: graphic violence/gore, and profanity"

","**SPOILERS** First of all, I didn't hate this movie. I didn't love it either, though. Which is a shame, because I pretty much feel a good ""Alien"" sequel writes itself. Admittedly, the creators were written into a corner when Ripley killed herself in part 3. But I felt the device used to bring her back here was clever...she's a clone, duplicated in an effort to pull the gestating queen out of her. At first Sigourney Weaver plays this with just the right amount of innocence and curiosity you would expect from a new born. But about half way through she becomes just another wisecracker, like the space crooks surrounding her. I also didn't understand how I was supposed to get all ga-ga with fear over the fact that there were 12 aliens in the movie...remember, there were HUNDREDS in ""Aliens"".

It had a very tongue-in-cheek vibe throughout, and Sigourney playing a Ripley who may be half-alien was interesting. The film poked fun at itself, and at the way those aliens pick off crews one-by-one. <br/><br/>I laughed at the CGI aliens, though. They weren't too good. The other Alien movies were scarier because you saw less of the alien, and in this one, you see it all the time. Ugh.<br/><br/>OK, but I still have one beef with this movie: Winona. Who cast Winona? She plays some whiny girl who won't shut up, and when she finally gets killed (I praised the lord for that one...), she came back two seconds later. That was annoying.

The aliens run around, killing people or dragging them off to be hosts for more aliens etc etc... yada yada.<br/><br/>But Ripley is new and improved. Pretty much right off I had a certainty that she was not only going to survive, but not even be really tested by the aliens this time. And I wasn't disappointed. She was far more deadly than they were. No the focus became would she side with the humans or aliens. And which of the humans would survive.<br/><br/>The rest of the story is pretty standard fare for the series. Foolish humans capture aliens, aliens escape, kill humans, remaining humans fight for survival and a way of escape. Nothing new really.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman has a good part, although it's his usual tough guy role, and he has some good scenes. Brad Dourif is just plain creepy as the mad scientist in love with the aliens. That guy scares me!

It might not have been the most exciting, but there was evidence that someone who cared had worked on it. Alien: Resurrection is an example of Hollywood making a little more money off of a franchise.  There's barely any story, just a bunch of people trying to get off of a space ship, most of which characters we WANT to die.  Just a dumb movie all around.

"boondocksaint20","6","1","2","2 December 2002"," Not bad, but disappointing
","I remember how excited I was to see this movie when it came out.  Aliens was at the time, my favorite movie ever, and I wanted to see a much better follow up to it and Alien than the mostly mediocre Alien 3.  The result? An okay film that could have been better (aren't most films like this nowadays?)<br/><br/>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I won't reveal the plot, except that Ripley has been cloned by the evil 'Corporation', and yes, once again, the Corporations' own greed backfires on them.  We get some cool characters, nice sets and plenty of action...so what went wrong?<br/><br/>First, before I go into that, I'll go into more detail with the good points. I loved the setup, like Alien, straight and to the point.  I thought the atmopshere at the beginning was very creepy and very claustrophobic, especially with the musical score.  The beginning (before everything gets FUBAR), is well done, well directed and most importantly, well lighted. The atmosphere is dark and creepy, just what we need to get into our fantasy/horror film mode.  The characters are cool, but not nearly as cool as the seasoned hombres we saw in Aliens.  Michael Wincott (The 'bad guy' actor with that incredibly cool voice from Robin Hood and The Counte of Monte Cristo), Ron Perlman and some others you know you've seen before on tv make up a pretty good supporting cast/alien fodder.  Sigourney Weaver, as usual, really shines as she resumes her role as Ellen Ripley, this time, as an Alien hybrid.  The movie sports some good action scenes, and a few scares, though mostly for shock value (loud sound effects mixed with buckets full of gore).  There are some creative scenes given the time period and the setting (a cube of whiskey being heated in a shot glass, the futuristic weapons, the alien labs...etc).  As for the special effects, not too shabby, especially the part where we see the camera go down inside a screaming man's throat to see an alien chest burster about to make it's appearance. Okay, now comes the part I'm sure will be ubiquitous for those who read other reviews on this one on this site...so far, I've given this one so pretty good reviews to be fair and give credit where credit is due, but like everyone else on this site, I just have to vent my frustrations now on the bad parts of Alien 4...<br/><br/>First, did I like this one better than Alien 3?  That's a tough one since all four Alien films have different directors and look and feel differently from one another.  But did I like it over the often visually stunning, yet ultimately disapointing sequel directed by Fight Club director David Fincher?  Yes, but not by much (what can I say?  I'm a sucker for 'survival horror' with plenty of guns and ammo).  Alien 3 suffered from too many underdeveloped characters that we couldn't give a damn about (a la Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"") and just one slaughter scene after another.  This one is a little different in that most of the characters are developed, at least minimally, yet, they are still picked off in pretty much the same way as Alien 3.  The thing that frustrated me the most was that Michael Wincott and Dan Hedaya's characters, both pretty well developed at the beginning, make you think that they will be really important to the storyline, but no, they are among the first to be killed off...though I was looking for another 'Hicks' in Wincott who is a great actor, I may have to give a few props to the writer in that noone truly expects both the leader of the mercenaries and the leader of the marines to die before the movie hits it's 3rd chapter.  Besides that, there are some stupid deaths (especially the last, and truly unnecessary death aboard the space ship...that one made me groan so much, it was so obvious that it was tacked on for no good reason), some stupid decision making and totally unrealistic scenes.  There are scenes that make you go, that makes no sense at all, just like when the mercs. kill off a squad of marines...were they asking for it? No, they were just doing their job, but what do we care?  The only reason I bring these frustrations up is not b\c I don't like violence (Evil Dead 2 and Dead Alive are amongst my favorite 'Over the top' films), I think it can be done well for camp or horror purposes, but b\c I can't stand when filmmakers put such stupidity on the screen (from characters, and the plot) and think that noone in the audience will think otherwise.  That really insults my intelligence, and I know others.  I have to agree, Alien 4 plays like a video game, which is mostly bad than good b\c we don't want to see this in an Alien movie.  The Alien movie (1-3) all based their horror elements on the human psyche...how given people would react to a given situation, and they all suceeded.  Alien 4 doesn't give a crap about the human psyche or that inner fear inside, instead, it relies on visuals (though, it does have some impressive ones at that) and a fast-paced (almost Jerry Bruckheimer-like) plot that goes from one scene of impending doom to the next.  I have to agree with many posters on this site...the aliens are just overexposed...the real fear in the others was the clandestine nature of the aliens; the sounds they made, the motion sensors used to track their movements, the looks of fear of the trapped victims' faces.  All of these made us jump out of our seats after the suspense had been built up for so long.  This one goes for a newer generation I guess, one that likes quick thrills and not much else.  I thought the alien hybrid at the end was so stupid, almost comical looking, though brutal (Brad Dorif's death was classic...if only he would have shut his stupid mouth...LOL...if you have seen it then you'll know what I mean).  Which goes to show you, just because a plot idea may be new, it is not necessarily a good idea.  In a weird way, I almost wish that the ending to Alien 3 was the grand finale (though from a rather weak film at that).<br/><br/>All in all, not too bad.  It is entertaining at times, but it just doesn't give the true fans what we crave, true survival horror.  I don't think any sequel will top Alien or the much better in terms of horror and excitement, Aliens.  Aliens was such a good film, filled with action, suspense and characters you rooted for towards the end (and for the person on this site who called Aliens a ""Vietnam Revenge allegory"" that is ""a disgusting NRA wet-dream"", I have to say that you are totally wrong...just because a film has violence, or even in this case, marines who crack under the pressure and go nuts given the situation, does not make it symbolic of the vietnam war, nor does it excite those of us who happen to support the NRA and the right to bear arms.  Aliens is simply entertainment at its finest, and truly embraces the human condition as most characters reach an epiphany of courage at the end as they've had to change over the course of the movie.  It is not a generation flick for blood thirsty 'cowboys' who grew up watching Rambo and Arnie blow people away).  Aliens truly was a film that was almost flawless, in my opinion, in terms of what it was aiming to accomplish. What was Alien Resurrection trying to accomplish?  $$$$.  Plain and simple. Anyways, I would only recommend this one for die-hard fans, but even most of them will range from somewhat to incredibly disapointed by this one, but yet, not as disappointed as they were with Alien 3 (though I know that opinion will vary).  Yet, it is still entertaining, and a good way to kill a couple of hours.  Not the worst movie I have ever seen, but definitely not the best.  Overall, I did like it, and think it has more pluses for the sake of entertainment than negatives.  I add one more star to my rating just b\c of Sigourney Weaver doing a kick @ss job this time around, and of course, seeing the silver screen's best 'creatures from another planet' return once again.  Though this one was almost a 6, I give it my slightly above average rating of 7/10 stars."

"LepInDaHood","2","1","2","1 August 1999"," A disgrace to the series.
","Okay the third one was bad-but this one is just horrible, simply horrible. The first two were sublime-they are two of the best sci-fi movies ever, and have been imitated dozens of times. The third one was just a bunch guys with British accents who you couldn't tell apart running around and getting killed. The third one ruined the series, but at least it was a trilogy. This one not only destroys the trilogy status, but disgraces the series.<br/><br/>So lets see where do I start? Well first of all the characters are evil space pirates that have probably killed many innocent people, and you don't really care what happens to them. From the beginning, you can pretty much tell which ones will live and which ones are just there to die. The movie might have been more interesting if it had more people in it, but everyone abandons ship, leaving only a few boring people to entertain us. And of course, in the tradition of Ash and Burke, there's the one bad guy who betrays them-I'm sure we can all guess what happens to him.<br/><br/>Then there's the aliens. In my opinion, the second one had the most real-looking aliens because they were animatronic. The aliens in this one were just bad. In this one they lost all their insect-like characteristics which made them creepy. CGI effects haven't quite been perfected yet, so it looks like a cartoon has been inserted into a movie. This one is no exception. The hybrid alien at the end is just plain awful. Words can't describe how incredibly bad it is, but by this point in the film you don't even care anymore. But wait, there's more! After the crew is seemingly safe, the alien comes back for what is possibly the worst moment in film history.<br/><br/>This film uses the formula created in Alien and Aliens- [---A group of _______s is trapped on a ______ and is being hunted by______(some kind of monster). During the escape, _______(usually multiple persons) is/are killed by the monster(s). The remaining crew gets to an escape craft, but the monster comes back and is killed by the hero. The end---] There are even scenes which seem to be directly lifted from ""Aliens"". Out of 10 stars it gets 2. Don't waste your money by renting it, wait for it to be on TV."

When I watched this movie, I thought it was good.. till I saw the scene where the military guys started running away... Hmm in Aliens (Alien 2) Those space marines were macho and wanted to kill every Alien they see... It's wonderful to see 200 years later in Alien 4, all the military guys are hired to run away from computer animation. Not being racist here, but since a French guy directed the movie, I would assume he would put alot of ""artistic stuff"" in the movie, man I was wrong... He and other french actors (he secretly hired) ruined the whole Alien movie for me. However, they did put in a handicapped person on wheelchair, and that was pretty nice for handicapped people. Why'd the heck they put Winona Ryder in the movie... I don't know, I guess she was bored."

Third movie:  Nobody believes in Ripley, who kills herself to make sure it doesn't happen again (should have ended there).  Fourth movie:  Everybody believes everything and everybody dies because... why?  Because they were stupid, just like the movie.  The whole point of the series is to keep advancing the aliens while the humans try and fight ever growing bigger and better bad aliens.  This movie, they weakened the alien by making it a hybrid, and giving it the instinct for self-sacrifice, things that should never be given to an alien that is described as utterly merciless and virtually indestructible.

The film is not suspensful, but it is entertaining. The characters are mixed. Minus some bad lines here and there weaver and rider do just fine. In the only ""good guys"" that live are the one you want to.  It rids off the horribly stupid ones.  Brad Dourif puts in a wonderfully good performance as one of the top scientists.

This is by far the weakest of the four, and in my opinion, it shouldn't have even been green-lit to go into production!<br/><br/>The structure of this movie (if you look at my Alien 3 review) is more or less trying to return to the winning formula of the 2nd film, but it fails. And it fails with flying colours!<br/><br/>Loads of guns. Loads of Aliens. Loads of cast.<br/><br/>Credit due to the writers to be able to fluke a fourth film!!

"uds3","Null","1","2","15 November 2001"," Alien to the preceding trilogy - yes!
","Has enough already been written about this catastrophic loser of a sequel? probably....I just get so angry thinking about it, I believe it deserves one more shellacking!<br/><br/>Having Jeunet direct this sequel is akin to having Walt Disney direct Rocky 6 (or FIRST BLOOD 4: RAMBO GOES AFGHAN, if Stallone has his way!) It has been made with absolutely no ""feel"" for the series. Similar comments might justifiably have been levelled at ALIEN 3 which initially turned me off too, but age and multiple viewings have improved it. The flick has much to commend it (refer separate review if you are so inclined!) ALIEN RESURRECTION on the other hand gets worse with each viewing and ends up being turned off earlier whenever I see it! But for the cloned Ripley (A mere excuse for a sequel...better to have had her wake up back on board the NOSTROMO having dreamed 2 and 3!) the thing is a childish and puerile copy of the original even down to the need for another ""Oh My God, it's a robot"" scene and Jeunet could be no Ridley Scott even with multiple clonings and genetic alteration!<br/><br/>Ripley looks 53 and desperate for a decent scriptwriter. Winona Ryder is the wimpiest 'heroine' (I use the term lightly) you ever laid eyes on and the FX just plain laughable. The 'underwater sequence' with the digitised swimming-aliens is at once a cack-fest and an insult to the marvellous contributions of Scott and Cameron! The ONE decent scene in the movie is that where the two aliens chomp up their compatriot, so that the acid eats through their cage and frees them - I liked that! A thinking man's alien! I didn't find the ""kill me"" sequence either moving or relevant...sorry guys, just plain idiotic, like the rest of the disaster that is ALIEN RESURRECTION.<br/><br/>What would a critique of this film be without its very own paragraph reserved for the ""baby alien?"" My only question is..""How did Ripley keep a straight face all that time, in the proximity of that nauseatingly comical piece of aberrated latex? For that matter, how did the crew not crack-up filming it?  Was it supposed to generate fear? pathos? serious contemplation of our scientific future?  What it achieved in my case (after the laughter subsided) was extreme anger, that some half-baked Director, who should never have been anywhere near the set of an Alien movie, would try to foist this insultingly bad and near juvenile excuse for a monster on to my patch! Enough said!<br/><br/>Great ending too huh? It just stops! You could virtually see Weaver whispering to Ryder out of the corner of her mouth  ""Hey Win, that damned camera off us yet?""<br/><br/>I would happily take up a petition to have every copy of this film destroyed world-wide.

"The_Movie_Cat","4","1","2","26 November 2000"," Weakest of the series
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>I couldn't believe Resurrection the first time I saw it. Isn't the biggest pile of pants you've ever seen? Well, maybe not. Second time around, I didn't find this low-brow edition so bad, though maybe that's because this time I'd won a free ticket. And can you really blame the producers for making it this way? After the failure of the introspective third, the logical progression would be to return to the previously successful format.<br/><br/>Where the first two sequels had used Alien as their template, Resurrection seems to think James Cameron's was the first film. Categorically set 200 years after the third, which was set possibly 200 years after the second, we get an action movie c.2299 with excessive gore and wisecracks. And that's really what dismayed me the first time. For while the movie never gets out of it's mainstream trough, the last twenty minutes scrape the barrel for tacky excess. Worst moment has to be the guy with an alien inside him who gets shot multiple times then bangs a man's face against a steel bar. With the man's head at waist level, he screams, and the camera pans down his throat to endoscopically reveal the alien. Then the alien rips through his ribcage, and in so doing tears through the face of the other man, all in blood-spattered detail. Or maybe you prefer the bit where the General picks his own brain out the back of his head, or the alien's guts getting sucked out of a g-force crack in slow motion. Just have a glance through this entry's ""quotes"" section. Nearly the entire list contains profanity or crude sexual references, clearly indicating the mentality of the piece.<br/><br/>But away from the juvenile gore, the underwritten characters and the non-literary narrative, there are some good points. The aliens themselves are utilised better here than in the third, probably because the ""Rottweiler"" alien could never be played by a man in a suit. CGI is used, but sparingly. Still a little primitive, (note to CGI workers on soon-to-be-made Alien 5: the aliens are black, so why design them as silver?), but rarely used, it is passable. The aliens are shown to be intelligent, a throwback to the lift-operators of Aliens. Again, there is no horror, but that is because the creatures are perhaps over-familiar to audiences now. In fact, so docile are these aliens that this is the only film in the series with more than four survivors. The use of clones to bring back Ripley seems more of a logical plot extension than the gimmick it seemed first time around, and this does add an interesting slant to her hybrid character. Though once more, this doesn't really add to the dramatic tension, as the new, sexual Ripley, amazed she's alive again, doesn't care whether or not she lives.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, it comes down to who's your favourite Spice Girl? Scary? Action? Moody? Or Dumb Spice? They are the products of four very different writers and directors and do not gel together particularly well as a whole. Taken alone, Aliens is great entertainment. Watched concurrently with Alien, it's mindless slop. Yet while they're all entertaining, none of them, not even the first, have got above a ""7"" rating from me. For whatever you say about these four movies, they are just ""bug-eyed monster from outer space"" vehicles, the original no-brainers. Maybe that's why the fourth really disappoints. The first three try to disguise this fact, the fourth makes a celebration of it. 4/10."

The insinuated physical relationship between Ripley and the Queen though was vulgar and completely unnecessary. The second main criticism was that the film was shorter than the others in the series, and no time was spent on trying to get to know the characters (esp. the smugglers).  Surely 10 minutes could have been spent on making them better defined and known. Thirdly, the new-born. It was a huge disappointment.

After 200 years with DNK they cloned Ripley and they took xenomorph queen out of her chests. They grew up in to 2 Aliens and since when an Alien kills his own species?

","My goodness I thought alien 3 was bad but boy alien resurrection is one of the worst films I have ever seen and it is ironic that a film called Resurrection truly killed this franchise for a while. The premise of the film sees 200 years after alien 3 Ripley is found and cloned including the alien inside of her. Her and a team of mercenaries attempt to escape a facility fro! These cloned xenomorphes. Sigourney weaver legitimately only returned as Ripley for this film because she was offered a ridiculous amount of money. It clearly shows, as she gives a pretty bad performance in this film and I hated the fact that they decided to use her character in this film after the events of the previous film. The supporting cast at least has some recognisable faces in it, Winona Ryder plays call and she is just ridiculously bland in this movie. She adds very little to her character and you really won't care about her or anybody else in this movie. Ron perlman is in this film and he does add a little bit of charisma and entertainment but even he is a joke in this film and just spouts stupid one liners. The rest of the cast are just cliché and dull which will make you check out. The story in this film has absolutely nothing to it, it feels like a really bad pale imitation of alien mixed with a bit of alien 3 and there is nothing unique here which makes you think why was this film even made. The script has nothing really special to it and absolutely nothing memorable to it whatsoever which is poor when you consider the great alien films. The style of the film is pretty awful, the action scenes are really poorly filmed and even though it is better then alien 3 I really didn't like the design of the aliens in this film especially towards the end of the film. Overall this film is a total travesty and shouldn't exist, try to avoid this film at all cost and look forward to alien covenant."

","This is the kind of movie that is hard to come by: a well written and directed story with elements of horror and sci-fi, a brilliant cast and a European director. It is not for everyone. If you simply want a rehash of any of the previous three films, this is not for you.<br/><br/>Resurrection is not a perfect film, there are some scenes - dialogue mainly - which can make one cringe, but overall I found it to be the almost perfect mix of horror, action and irony. With the storytelling talents of Dan O'Bannon and Joss Whedon, you get layer after layer of interesting plot, while Jeunet's directing shows what a movie can be if creativity is let loose.<br/><br/>I've seen this film several times now and I am pretty sure I am going to like it every time. It has not aged well, but it wasn't supposed to: its visual design was crafted for this movie only. It is not a Prometheus prequel and it is hardly an Alien sequel. It stands alone and you probably either get to love it or to hate it."

Horrible B version of an Alien story with some awful over acting and bad special effects in the way of goopy green slime for Alien blood instead of watery acid as was introduced to us in 1979. Not scary or creepy at all. More like a bad comic book story with bad Alien effects imagery to match. Yes, Alien 3 left something to be desired somewhat in the way of plot but at least it tried to stay true to the franchise in the general feel of the Alien universe."

","When Ripley sacrificed herself at the end of Aliens 3 it finished off Ripley's struggle against the Aliens with a noble and brave finale that shut the door on her story. Or so it should have been. I mean there's no way she could come back, right? Well as it turns out the dribblers responsible for this movie decided that she would come back and as Sigourney Weaver is co-producer you have to assume she went along with it happily enough.<br/><br/>Here then are my complaints about this atrocity of a movie; <br/><br/>The plot makes no sense: Boiled alive in lead? Well no problem, we erm got your DNA from the lead and remade you. And the thing inside you. A more plausible, though still admittedly hokey, explanation would be that they got a sample of her somehow from the EEV medical computer from the last film.<br/><br/>The plot makes even less sense: Maybe genes do have a sort of memory, that would explain a lot of things we don't understand yet. But what they probably can't do is remember conversations, one liners and events from people they were derived from. They do in this film though.<br/><br/>That crew: The 'pirates' look a heck of a lot like they wandered into the film from a rejected episode of Andromeda. They are completely out of place.<br/><br/>That general: He has orange skin, big bushy eyebrows and boggle eyes making him look like a muppet. He also has a muppet voice just to hammer home the connection.<br/><br/>The movie just isn't aliens in atmosphere or storyline.

"Polaris_DiB","8","1","3","1 September 2006"," Well, okay then...
","*Sigh*... and here is where I ruin all of the other reviews I've written, all of any objective respectability, and imagined audience I probably didn't have in the first place.<br/><br/>I liked it. A lot. In fact I think it's the best film in the series.<br/><br/>Outrage! Horror! How could he say that when he says Alien 3 is terrible! I can say it because this movie is fun, it's very visually amazing, and best of all, it's complete. Joss Whedon has done an excellent job with this, something most people didn't notice probably because they were too distracted by Winona Ryder's terrible acting and the huge change in Ripley's character, along with a good ol' fashioned distrust of modern sequels, to notice that he has tied together some open threads that have existed basically from the very beginning.<br/><br/>The thing I want to remark upon, that is, stress very importantly, is that Ripley's life throughout the Alien films is very horrible. It's an obvious assessment, but so obvious it's not often noted. She literally exists, by this film, to fight the aliens... there's almost no other purpose to her life. In fact her past is utterly removed at this point. She and the aliens have become a continuing conflict of good and evil, and it's gone so far that she's literally become a part of the alien world. So Whedon actually makes her an alien and the aliens a part of her. It's brilliant, really.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think this film is a lot of fun. Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon, Jeunet regulars, make wonderful supporting characters to Sigourney Weaver's new interpretation of the cynically stuck Ripley, the Ripley who went from androgynous to motherly to nihilist to an almost perfect conglomeration of all three in this last film. Other supporting actors are very well-placed too, such as the guy from The Crow and Dan Hedaya.<br/><br/>Jeunet's visual activity is in full force here as well. I have to laugh and admit that it's completely over the top... and yet with the excellent cast it makes it more fun than the action bonanza of the second and more interesting than the brooding nihilism of the third. There's no attempt to be the first one with psychological horror. There's no attempt to be the second one with masses of aliens everywhere. There's just a defining compromise: a dozen of them. And mystery as to what their motivations, at this point, really are.<br/><br/>There's a lot that needn't be in here, too much. It's too modern, the alien/human hybrid at the end is pretty ridiculous (though I still think a good continuation of what has been happening between Ripley and the aliens), too much modern fear of cloning, and too many characters trying to be ""bad-ass"". I can understand entirely why people hate this movie so. But I still think it's really good.<br/><br/>It also has the perfect ending to the series. Ripley returns to Earth, and it's at this point that it should be noted: we have never seen Earth throughout all of the movies, and yet the whole reason why Ripley seems to exist is to protect it. It's transcendent, it's remarkable, and it's a beautiful scene. Remember that this is four hundred years and four stases since Ripley left Earth merely as a cargo carrier. She's been through a lot, and now look what she's become... This is why I think this is a really good movie.<br/><br/>Bring on the neggies. I guess I deserve it.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

"MinorityReporter","4","1","3","15 September 2005"," Insulting!
","I really cannot begin to express how much I hate this film. Even though it is not the worst film with aliens in it (that title belongs to AVP: Alien Vs. Predator) it sure is close. The first thing I'm going to do is make a pros and cons list so people will get a general idea of how I perceive this film<br/><br/>Pros: The effects. Cons: Everything else.<br/><br/>First the pros. This film has the best effects of all the series but that really isn't very surprising. The first two films were beautiful in their own ways and I thought the the third film was very atmospheric as well but they were all before the era of computer graphics and as Alien Resurrection is from 1997 (ergo after Jurassic Park which was the first film to really use the potential of computer graphics) it must be fairly straightforward to assume that the effects will be better. They are. The effects are stunning and even today (2005) they are believable. The director, Jean Pierre Jeunet, has a very distinct visual style and it works beautifully. From the space shots to the design of the aliens themselves. It all works. We finally get to see the aliens walk around and seem a 100 percent believable. We also get to see them swim which is nice little addition to their range of abilities. The gore in the film is very graphic and this too works fine but aside from the effects the film is pretty awful.<br/><br/>The acting doesn't exactly suck but its not very good either. Sigourney Weaver does her best but her new abilities and the fact that she is not the same character as in the previous films does that we don't really feel with her in the same way any longer. Her performance is passable though and I have nothing against her. I don't know what Winona Ryder is doing in this film and her talent does seem to be completely wasted. Ryder's emotional range as an actress is very high but we don't really get to see it in this movie (for obvious reasons) and that is a darn shame. She is degraded to being eye-candy. Dominique Pinon, Jeunet's favorite actor doesn't really do that much in the film and quite frankly isn't all that good even though I am impressed with his English. Most French actors have a very thick accent but Pinon doesn't. Ron Perlman who has since become quite a big star has nothing to work with in this film and thus his performance is not really worth noting. The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Some do decent jobs (for example Brad Dourif) and some do not.<br/><br/>The story is what is really disappointing and (I feel) insultingly bad. The two first films had brilliant stories and even the third had a passable story (considering it never had an entirely finished script) but the story in the fourth one is just hauntingly bad. I won't go into the details as I might accidentally spoil the plot but needless to say it is really, really bad. Especially the ending is very anti-climactic. As for it being a horror film. Come on there isn't anything remotely scary about the film and the action is average at best.<br/><br/>All in all a film that should be avoided almost at all costs. The only saving factor is the effects but effects don't make a movie.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Why do we watch Alien movies?  Truth to be told, it's the production design.<br/><br/>The Alien movies don't have an original style, but rather are amalgamations of lesser elements.  With ALIEN it was Halloween and It! Terror from Beyond Space.  ALIENS was Rambo and Ghostbusters.  ALIEN3...well, I can't really see any large elements taken into it other than Rosemary's Baby.  With our beloved ""Resurrection"", Jeunet infuses too much French style reminiscent of The Fifth Element, Starship Troopers, and Species.  Of course, traces of Resurrection are evident in everything ranging from Dark City to the Matrix. <br/><br/>Perhaps another big problem with Resurrection is that it is less functional and utilitarian like the original Trilogy and more modern, too futuristic. There is technology, but no understanding of it.  Cameron had the opposite problem in ALIENS of making an overabundance of hardware and trying to spend too much time explaining its operation.  At least he paid that much attention to detail.  Resurrection is 1/8 as powerful.<br/><br/>Next, DO THEY CALL THAT CREATURE DESIGN?!  The first two movies were a miracle in the design phase--the second getting my favor for improving the appearance.  ALIEN3 started the overuse of CGI that plagues this movie...""Yeah, real scary.  Hit the 'delete' key and alien goes adios."" Here the creators tried inserting too much style (and slime) into the creatures that make it less animalistic and more cartoonish.  It is 1/8 as creative as the original.<br/><br/>I'm certain Jeunet is proudest about the Queen birth scene near the end.  So much of his French style and method are visible in contrast to Cameron and Scott's darkness method.  Bright moody colors are prevalent compared to the subdued hues of the first two...Luc Besson must have noticed.  In that sense, this is 8 times brighter than the first movie.<br/><br/>By comparison to ALIEN3, Resurrection still fails because it stays too far into familiar territory.  Perhaps Fincher knew that his style was going to be the future of the series...so he killed it then and there.  Too bad the studio didn't agree.<br/><br/>Overall, Resurrection has cinematography power (and more gore than the Original Trilogy combined) and little else.  The characters are typical--evil scientist, obvious android, tough black guy, and stupid white male reminiscent of Hudson from the second movie--the plot is worse, and the production design falters because computers aren't as good at replicating environments like miniatures and mattes.  1.5 out of 5 stars."
"baumer","6","1","3","13 August 1999"," The end of what was once a proud series
","I really hope this is the end of this series.  Alien was a good film with lots of atmosphere.  Aliens was one of the best films ever made and it was one of the few films that I can say actually made me frightened and nervous. Alien 3 was stylistic but annoying and Alien 4 displays nothing that made the first two great.  In the first and especially the second, Ripley was a scared but tough heroine that knew better than anyone what the Bitch was capable of.  In the second film she says things like "" I hope you're right because just one of things managed to wipe out my entire crew. ""  Now she is a cyborg and she has no fear and that takes away one of the most rudimentary things that made the first two scary.  We could live vicariously through Ripley and her fear.  But in this one, it is just a bunch of idiots running around that we don't care about.  In Aliens we had Hudson ( is this going to be another bug hunt SIR? ) Hicks ( okay, we waste him, no offense ) Vasquez ( I just need to know one thing, where they are ) and even Apomb ( look into my eye! ).  These characters added an element to the film that Alien 4 could never hope to copy.  So what are we left with?  I'm not sure, but it is not a good product, that is for sure.  Even Winona Ryder can't do anything with the role that she was given.  So the series has worn out it's welcome.  It's time to put it to rest.  I have heard that there is talk of a fifth, are these going to go the way of the Rocky's?  I hope not because the first two were really superb films.  I really hope they end it now.  Please.  This is not a good film and I can't see how the next could be any better, unless Cameron directed..... nah, that would be too good to be true."

","If Alien3 didn't convince you that the franchise was finished Alien Resurrection sure will.  Set 200 years in the future after Ripley destroys herself to save humanity (in Alien3) she is brought back to life, cloned from a surviving sample of her blood.  But it's not just her genes but a mixture that includes alien genetic material.  She still looks human but is not, now she can play a killer game of basketball.  Stripped of her humanity Ripley fails to pack the dramatic punch that was so much a critical element of the earlier Alien movies.  And the aliens, well, they are now just another part of the cast, ho-hum.  The plot, and other characters are cartoonish and stereotypical.  What a waste of acting talent!  And the grand finale is so bad as to be laughable. <br/><br/>My advice is to avoid this movie."
"jboothmillard","8","2","11","15 June 2005"," Alien: Resurrection
","If you thought Alien³ had ended the series, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amélie) had found a way to return, quite a clever one. It has 200 years since Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) killed herself on the prison planet, being impregnated. After many attempts, scientists from The Company have successfully managed to clone her into an alien/human hybrid clone using her blood samples (from the planet), and removed the alien queen from her. Ripley, known as Number 8, does have blurs in her original memory, and she does need to relearn things, but she seems to have developed much more power, e.g. acidic blood, strength, ability to hear and smell the aliens, and obviously with these they won't kill her. They are keeping the growing queen in a high security room, and breeding new aliens (with face huggers) insanely with crew members in hibernation, and eventually, they all break out on the ship. So with the help of Ripley, a group of smugglers, including: Annalee Call (Winona Ryder) (who turns out to be an android), cripple Vriess (Amélie's Dominique Pinon), Johner (Hellboy's Ron Perlman), Christie (Gary Dourdan), Sabra Hillard (Kim Flowers) and Vincent Distephano (Raymond Cruz) are trying to escape the ship before they enter the Homeland, Earth. Ripley does have contact with what she has become though, including meeting the new hybrid baby from the alien she had inside her, a hideous pale yellow alien with what looks like a skull for a head, who mistakes Ripley for her mother. In the end they do escape though, the aliens are destroyed, and the pale yellow thing is sucked (by the vaccuum) into bloody chunks going into outer space. Also starring Michael Wincott as Frank Elgyn, Dan Hedaya as Gen. Martin Perez, J.E. Freeman as Dr. Mason Wren, Brad Dourif as Dr. Jonathan Gediman and Leland Orser as Larry Purvis. The fantastic sequences include Dourif face to face (through glass) with the alien queen making it pull faces, the underwater chase, the alien birth through both a guy's stomach and a guy's head, and almost all of the gory effects. I have seen the re-edited version, which is ridiculous, e.g. the opening being an alien turning into an insect being squashed, although Ripley being reminded of Newt (she can't remember her name though) is interesting, but just see the original. Winona Ryder was number 87, and Sigourney Weaver number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","5","1","4","6 May 2008"," Jean-Pierre? Well, see, a number of us have been wondering... what the heck were you thinking?
","I understand that French directors make weird films. In fact, maybe this one's even one of the most extreme in that respect. But this is just... a minor complaint would be events and actions in general that are bizarre, but there also bigger issues. For one thing, so many situations are solved in an unexpected way. Now, kudos for not just taking the easy way out, but it almost comes off as overcompensating, going so far in the other direction that the viewer feels completely disconnected from it... the illusion cracks, and we find ourselves wondering why we're giving this piece of fiction, which at these bits, not so much makes no attempt at convincing us, but more goes out of its way to taunt and push us away. The humor is seldom all that funny, and more often than not common sense is its expense. It should not be thought that Jeunet is not skillful; tension is mustered up(if, as others have said, there is hardly any character development), the creatures, as well as various parts of the movie, are effective. The plot is more or less empty and by-the-numbers once the initial stuff is out of the way(save for one or two ideas and scenes, which admittedly are pretty darn good and interesting), and its overall progression is mostly devoid of surprises(which is not to say that everything herein is figured out ahead of time). Something that, at best, at least nags is how this seems to try to fit in what was in each entry to go before it(which, sooner or later, has got to get to be ridiculous). The effects are great. There are some rather grotesque sights and sounds in this, anyone considering watching should take that into account. The action isn't that involving or entertaining. This did have the worst start-off point, and they did actually manage to work around that, if in a way that is far-fetched. The behavior of the Aliens is somewhat messed up. Furthermore, I wasn't scared of them at... anytime, really. The acting isn't particularly impressive, same goes for some of the character writing(Ripley, what happened to you? Is it the black nail-polish(I know, I know, someone told you it would look wicked)?). Perlman is reasonably cool(but the man probably delivered a one-liner as his first words). The Special Edition, briefly introduced(in less than a minute) by he who helmed this, holds an alternate opening and ending, among other things, and is worth it for those who want more of what this is. The commentary track is also fine to listen to. I recommend this to... maybe more fans of Jean-Pierre Jeunet(as well as Joss Whedon? I... wouldn't know, this appears to be the only thing of his I've seen firsthand) than those who dig the franchise. 5/10"

Unlike alien and aliens or even alien 3, which have a cast of characters that have great personality, this film has a cast of gimmicky good for nothing characters. Not even Ripley could save this movie, because in this film she isn't playing herself. She is playing a clone of herself, so even time she is in the movie she seems confused and over sexualizes aspects of her personality. They also feature the aliens way to much in this film taking out any suspense that could possibly be there. The are also many scenes including the spider scene and the overly insane chestbursting scene (if you watch the movie you will know what I mean) where I can't help but laugh at how absurd the movie is. I do like the twist at the end to an extent, but it is very poorly executed and the new design of the newborn is terrible, the scene where Ripley finds failed clones of herself is very powerful, but not as well executed as it could be. I found the death of the newborn hilarious even though I don't think it was supposed to be. I don't recommend this film, because even though it has so bad it's good moments, most of the film is either boring or bewildering.

Each Alien installment has chosen a completely different genre angle and this could have been a great gore/satire take on it. Unfortunately it is just trying to be a little bit of everything and doesn't succeed at any of it. Also what they tried to go for would have benefited from more modern visual effects, another argument for wishing this had been made at least 10 years later.

","""Alien"" was a science fiction masterpiece. ""Aliens"" was an action movie that had its scary moments. ""Alien 3"" was not great, but I don't think it got fair treatment. There was a lot that went on behind the scenes. Now, Ellen Ripley is brought back in ""Alien Resurrection,"" the fourth installment. Forgotten is what made the original film scary and what made it work. This sequel is extremely violent to the point of shock and disgust held together by a flimsy plot. The inspiration has come and gone, and we got a film that we didn't ask for in the first place. I question how this film has an R rating being as violent as it.<br/><br/>It's about a government operation led by General Perez (Dan Heyda), who is overseeing the resurrection of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) whose brought back to life and scientists harvest an Alien queen from her that breeds. It's not long before the Aliens break out of confinement and wreck all kinds of hell all over the ship. It comes down to a small crew of armed mercenaries who try to make it to the Betty before it's too late.<br/><br/>There is a statement in the movie that echos perfectly. ""Ellen Ripley died trying to wipe this species out. For all intents and purposes, she succeeded. I'm not anxious to see her taking up her old hobbies."" This line comes from the General Perez character. He says he doesn't want Ripley to fight the aliens again, but what does he expect after bringing her back to life? Ripley's back as a clone because the scientists somehow retrieved blood samples on ice from the prison planet where she died in ""Alien 3,"" and she has become an alien hybrid of some sort. The scientists want to breed the aliens for biological weapons; I suspect because that is the plotline of the previous films, and that's the reason for Ripley's return.<br/><br/>It opens with Ripley standing in a tube, and her voiceover says, ""My mommy always said there were no monsters. No real ones. But there are"" before surgeons remove the baby Alien Queen from her womb. She is aboard the USM Auriga, a military government ship, which appears to operate outside of regulated space, which means illegal experiments, and it functions as a medical research facility. I was being coy about the scientists breeding the aliens for bioweapons, and yes, that is what they are trying to do. Ripley somehow retains all her memories after 200 years have passed, and she awakens on the ship knowing the aliens are going to escape, but nobody listens to her. ""She will breed. You will die."" She says.<br/><br/>
When you see the Aliens for the first time, held in glass cages, it takes the fear out of what this organism used to be, and it's one of the many bad decisions the film makes. The Aliens look restless until one of the scientists decides to play with one of them through the glass before he pisses it off, and it snarls at him. I will say, the look of the aliens is superior. They look, pitch black, is slimy and shown to be smart, and they escape in a very clever way involving their blood. A freighter called The Betty arrives at the facility with the vagabond crew led by Elgyn (Michael Wincott). Johner (Ron Perlman) is the unstable and dangerous one. There is also Christie (Gary Dourdan), Vriess (Dominique Pinon), who is in a wheelchair, Hillard (Kim Flowers) and Call (Winona Ryder), who holds a few surprises of her own. The Vriess character has his wheelchair full of shotgun pieces, and he seems to love raiding the ship's armoury when nobody is around. When they all arrive, shortly after is when the aliens break out.<br/><br/>Ripley doesn't know what she is doing, and it never really says whose side she is on. Weaver is over-sexualized in the role that made her famous for the fourth time, but we can only assume that the screenwriter, Joss Whedon, didn't know what to do with her. She knows when the Aliens are near, and they know where she is it seems, but it's never developed, After everyone on the ship is killed in very violent ways, the aliens only attack the crew once I think which is odd seeing as how they were relentless in ""Aliens."" Speaking of attack, okay, so as I have said, the movie is violent, let's see. When the Aliens escape, someone, walks into one of the cells and is frozen to death as his body snaps apart. One guy pulls a piece of his brain out of the back of his head and stares at it. A crew attempting to escape in a shuttle gets shredded to bits, and we see blood and guts flung on a window, and that's only some of the carnage.<br/><br/>Into the second act, they are moving through water pouring down from the cooling tanks, and it's a thought-provoking set up before the execution throws it all away. They end up swimming for a lot longer than one can hold there breathing, and it gets quite hooky. They must all be expert swimmers. I liked this sequence because two aliens chase them underwater. Well, one does, the other gets blown up at first sight. It was entertaining until someone I was starting to like is killed, and I just gave up-none one these characters find development, so all that's left is carnage.<br/><br/>If they made ""Alien V"" I would watch it so long as I don't have to see this one again. Most of the movie is elaborate special effects, including an unwanted surprise at the end that looks horrible. It's called the Newborn, and I have no idea what they were thinking with this thing. It suffers a violent death, which is just over the top and disturbing to watch before Ripley seems to be attracted to this thing. I don't know. My significant confusion is why the aliens are setting up traps, I guess, early on in the movie. One of the characters falls for a setup involving a slimy gun, and I didn't buy it. The director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, does not want to be there, and it shows. Every decision was wrong, and there is nothing on offer here expect violent carnage, an out of place actress (Ryder) and for some reason, Weaver agreed to do the movie."

","'Alien: Resurrection (1997) is markedly worse than its predecessors. With its confused tone, bland characters and ridiculous story, it makes for a less than compelling experience. It isn't scary and, worse still, it isn't particularly entertaining, either. It does, however, feature a few scenes that are so silly they're actually laughable. They feel like scenes from a genuine comedy, more parodic than some of the stuff seen in 'Scary Movie (2000)', and are the only really memorable or enjoyable sequences the film boasts. The screenplay is peppered with little jokes and tongue-in-cheek moments that simply don't translate to the more 'straight' version we see on screen. This makes the more overtly funny stuff all the more perplexing; surely, these scenes are so over the top they had to be made like that on purpose? In either case, they don't mesh with the overall vibe of the piece and they don't elevate it beyond the bland action-horror it otherwise is. 5/10"

"anselmdaniel","5","0","1","7 March 2020"," Departing from the previous installments
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection is a science fiction horror movie that premiered in 1997. The movie is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and with the story written by Joss Whedon. The movie stars Sigourney Weaver as Ripley 8, a clone of the original Ripley and Winona Ryder as Annalee Call. The movie is a follow up to 1992's Alien 3. Ripley is cloned and Weyland-Yutani continues to raise the Xenomorphs.<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection is an extremely contrived movie. These is not any reason for this movie to exist other than to create another Alien movie. This movie contrived a ridiculous way to bring back the Xenomorphs. The belief that a clone can contain the Alien embryo is ridiculous and harms the believability of the movie. The movie feels incredibly superfluous because of this aspect.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver feels weathered from the movie. The script does not give her many opportunities to have a varied performance. Instead the movie uses Ripley as a stoic superhuman which has never been the case in the past Alien movies. This departure is one of the reasons why the movie could not live up to the strengths of the previous installments in the Alien franchise.<br/><br/>The story uses the survival elements of the first two movies but it does not execute it well. The movie has a surprising amount of slapstick comedy that is ill fitting for this movie. I did not appreciate that this element was in the movie and it made for a movie that appeared to be parodying the original movies rather than continuing the horror genre.<br/><br/>The newer characters do try to give it their all in this movie. However, it is not enough to save the script from being average to bad at best. The movie has few redeeming factors and I wish that it was enough to save the movie.<br/><br/>I would not recommend Alien Resurrection.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

By the time this movie premiered, many people had a preconceived notion about what an Alien movie ought to be. Jeunet didn't give a s*it about that. I kinda respect that.<br/><br/>Of course, there's moments that are plain stupid and overacted as all hell. But try watching this movie from a trash angle; maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised.

","Despite being the fourth installment to the series, and thus being up against some pretty stiff competition, AND basically repeating a sequence of events we've already seen three times now, this movie succeed by having great storytelling and action, a believeable character gallery, superb acting from everyone involved, and adding just enough new twists.
Sure, getting it as perfect as the two first Alien movies is impossible for many reasons. First, if you're not Ridley Scott or James Cameron, then you're not Ridley Scott or James Cameron. Second, it has all been done before, and there is a limit to how many times Ripley can believably fight off these things. That's why it is very important to devote some time and effort into creating a believeable backdrop and motivation for her. Which I think all the sequels have done exceptionally well. Every time she is placed in the middle of the action against her will, this time actually being alive against her will.
If this happened to be the first Alien movie, many more would not think twice about giving it 10 stars."

It is valuable to note the she was given a co-producer credit for this movie and her sublime individual performance in it testifies to her influence in transforming this movie from a poor parody of Alien into a singularly powerful character driven movie. Yes the rest of the movie is pretty much a mishmash of typical science fiction outer space horror fare. Yes the script and dialogue is pretty lame by comparison, especially the General Perez who comes across as a crazed, weirdo military leader.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the plot outline is decent and the one-liner humor is amazingly spread well throughout the movie and deliciously pungent with irony in reference to the original 1979 classic. There are a number of parallel scenes, particularly towards the end with a shot resembling Ripley and her cat and later in Aliens (1986) and Newt. Ripley's character is likely to have been overlooked by many. The complex hybrid synthesis is quite amazing with Weaver's performance. Her sensual mother-child emotive and psychic relationship is something to really experience.

"DHWaldron","5","0","1","24 January 2018"," For once the Alien has a motive... and maybe even our sympathies
","Alien Resurrection is clouded by the premise of THE WORST ALIEN MOVIE EVER! although, it is not superb, fantastic, and only manages to skim through the OKAY class, it was watchable and, at parts enjoyable and nuanced. In Alien 3 Ripley killed herself after discovering the Alien Queen was nested within her abdomen. Following on from that film, Alien Resurrection begins with scientists cloning Ripley, removing the Queen from her chest, and producing Xenomorphs in a laboratory. The Xenomorphs escape, and Ripley and a team of friends must find a way to destroy the spacecraft and save themselves before the craft reaches its home base: Earth. Starring Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley (and the only returning cast member) and Winona Ryder as Call, the film is home to the new, highly critiqued Xenomorph design: the Newborn, a strange unshelled , disfigured Xenomorph. Despite all the pessimistic views surrounding this fourth installation, the film was pleasantly surprising, greatly surpassing the likes of Alien 3. Weaver's character begins as a mentally unstable human (or clone in this instance) and although she is an interesting and weird character, all the others are one-dimensional with unmotivated acts (such as a guy who shoots a spider with a gun...), as well as these mood-swings some of the characters occasionally suffer from. <br/><br/>Viewing the shorter, Theatrical Version of the film, not the Special Edition, was a shorter yet, I believe, the correct decision. Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director of the film, was happy with the Theatrical Version, although the writer, Joss Whedon (creator of the hit TV Series Buffy the Vampire Slayer) believes that this film is the worst installation in the Alien franchise. Personally, I found it exploring a different, uncultivated avenue for the franchise, at one point, engaging the audience to pity the Xenomorph. Although this pity is felt, it is not supported by the costumes and effects of the Xenomorph and its new hybrid, the Newborn, revealing, for the first time, the eyes of the Xenomorph. The Newborn is a nuanced and interesting character in this movie. <br/><br/>Like the third movie, this film does not manage to derive itself of the unnesseccary violence and swearing, featuring a disturbing sexual scene; not because it is revealing or unconsented, but because the whole premise is disturbing in itself. Whether this deeply wounds or heals the film is decided upon the viewer, but it does lead to strange, confusing matters, which are completely different to the other aspects visible in this franchise."

I think that the theatrical release is better. The film itself is definitely the weakest of the Alien collection. The first three are really good but this one is just a bit crap. Everything about this lacks the standard of the others. The acting is average, the story tot, the direction uninspired, the effects average, the new cycle in the Alien's life at the end pure garbage and overall very forgettable and pointless fourth installment in a strong trilogy.

","Despite plummeting into a fiery furnace while carrying an unborn alien queen inside of her at the climax of David Fincher's messy- but-interesting Alien 3, Fox saw more money to be made in carrying on the franchise started by Ridley Scott back in 1979. For the fourth instalment, French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, hot off the success of The City of Lost Children, was brought in to inject some life in the stuttering series, bringing a unique aesthetic to the ongoing battle between us puny humans and the superior xenomorph. Sadly, this unique aesthetic is muted and ugly, perhaps even more so than the incredibly miserable Alien 3, and the European sense of humour and quirkiness Jeunet also brings to the table doesn't quite fit the tone of the Alien series. If this was a stand-alone, unconnected genre movie, Alien Resurrection may now be fondly remembered as an offbeat, cyberpunk oddity.<br/><br/>It's 200 years since Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself to finally rid the universe of the xenomorphs, but humanity's stupidity apparently hasn't wavered in that time. Ripley is cloned by some mad scientists from a single drop of blood, for the sole purpose of removing the queen inside of her (how the queen got inside her from the cloning process isn't quite explained), and turning its offspring into weapons and/or subjects of experimentation. She tells them, ""she will breed, you will die,"" but naturally this falls on deaf ears. As the inevitable happens and the aliens free themselves from their cells, Ripley falls in with a rag- tag group of mercenaries. But Ripley is different; she can smell nearby aliens and seems to possess super-strength, and when she receives a jab to the face, her blood burns through the spaceship's floor. She clearly shares a bond and possibly DNA with her 'children', and the grizzled space pirates don't know whether they should trust her.<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection is the worst of the franchise for two reasons. One is that the film is so damn ugly. Aside from the wonderfully weird moment in which Ripley writhes in the slimy tentacles of her 'daughter', there isn't one shot that feels truly cinematic. The sets look expensive, certainly, but there's a TV-quality running throughout, backed-up by a pre-Buffy the Vampire Slayer show Joss Whedon script, which often feels like a precursor to the wonderful Firefly. The second is the casting of Winona Ryder as daughter- figure Call. Ryder is a terrific actress, but every line she utters here is without conviction. She stands out like a sore thumb when sharing scenes with such reliable character actors as Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Dominique Pinon, Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif. Jeunet amps up the gore factor, which is something the Alien series was never about, and neglects suspense and terror in the process. The climax is weird and disgusting, and may have been delightfully bonkers if this was unshackled by a franchise tag and was the director's way of letting loose with a generous budget. But this isn't the Alien I know and love."

","The year was 2010 and a re-release of all the first 4 ""Alien"" movies in one complete set on BluRay disk, along with two extra disks of extras. A total of 6 BDs. I found that my local public library has the set and I now have watched all 4 of them within a few days. Picture and DTS sound are excellent as we have come to expect for BluRay. And seeing them in sequence over a short period of time enhances the enjoyment of all of them.<br/><br/>As the commentary track states, there never was an intent to make more than 3 movies, that is why the 3rd one ended the way it did. But they set this 4th one 200 years into the future and a deep space ship has scientists and technology to allow cloning. The former space ship of Ripley's had traces of her DNA and early in the movie we see them fabricating a new one, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.<br/><br/>Each of the 4 movies has a different script writer and different director so each has its own mood and look. This one is a bit cleaner and brighter. In fact the first half of the movie is superb as the stage is set for cloning and studying the aliens. <br/><br/>The second half degrades quite a bit with more craziness among the characters and more fights and chases involving aliens. A big reveal is that the ""new"" Ripley has some alien characteristics of strength and quickness. But in the end Ripley once again has to be destroyed. <br/><br/>The movie ends with several surviving in an escape pod to Earth while the larger spaceship with aliens crashes at a terrific velocity in an uninhabited part of Earth to destroy all remaining aliens and eggs.

"Screen_Blitz","4","0","1","25 May 2017"," There is plenty of gore and gross special effects to go around, but not enough flair and scares to resurrect the series
","The Alien franchise had a promising debut when Ridley Scott ignited the first film in 1979, and James Cameron embraced the spirit of the film with a highly enthralling follow-up in 1986. This series however, met an unexpected downward turn when the third installment came in, not only butchering the franchise but placing director David Fincher on a not-so-compelling directorial debut. Since then, Fincher is now disowned the film. There was only hope that this unexpected fourth installment would be pull the franchise out of its rusty pit. Unfortunately, that was a dream that went to die. Taking the director's chair this time around is French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet who manages to strip the film of the beauty that made the first two entries hits and slaps it with an inept script by Joss Whedon, placing this installment in a borderline laughable debacle. Now the franchise opens the door to the question of how and who is supposed to get this now-gloomy franchise back on its feet. Set in 200 years after the events of 'Alien 3', this film follows a space crew consisting of Call (played by Winona Ryder), ""tough-guy"" Johner (played by Ron Perlman), wheelchair-bound Captain Vriess (played by Dominique Pinon), Christie (played by Gary Dourdan) along with several others who conduct a biological experiment to extract the Queen Alien out of the long- dead Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver)and resurrect her back to life. However, her DNA has already been paired with the Queen, and the crew must now face against a vicious alien bloodbath that places the lives of everyone in grave danger. <br/><br/>This dour fourth entry suffers from not only failing bring anything new to the table rather than recycling the nearly all the same elements from before, but somehow managing to produce more unintentional laughter than scares. If there are any accolades that surround this movie besides taking the crown of drenching the screen with most gore and slime, is coming up just a few fun action sequences involving the space crew chased down the tunnels by the ugly extraterrestrial creatures and a few scenes of our heroes mowing down the aliens with loud, noisy bloodbath. Beyond that, it appears that Jean- Pierre Jeunet struggles to execute the action without it feeling like a tug-o-war between the grim atmosphere and Joss Whedon's otherwise more light-hearted script. Recycling on run-of-the mill formula, this movie journeys through the characters' battle for survival, while adding some awkward elements to the mix including giving Ellen Ripley what appears to be sexual tension between her and the Queen Alien. This accounts to an awkward scene toward the end that is bound to spear viewers with a sense of embarrassing discomfort than scare. Who wants to see Ripley get intimate with a flesh-eating xenomorph? If that isn't farcical enough, Whedon's script also manages to pair each character, particularly Ron Perlman, with a large surplus of one ludicrous one-liner after another. In addition, how funny does this trying to by poking fun at Dominique Pinon's character being in the wheelchair in the midst of all the chaos? As for the performances, there is not much gold to offered here, even from Sigourney Weaver. While her performance is not necessarily bad, the unwholesome portrayal of her character strips the actress of all her charisma that made her a powerful character in the beginning. <br/><br/>Alien: Resurrection marks a dismal attempt to revitalize the broken franchise, and settles for both an unpolished direction and script that accounts for more silliness than white-knuckle thrills. Not many can doubt that this entry had a fair amount of potential. But oh boy! It only corresponds to a soul-sucking letdown."

","Alien: Resurrection is a poor film with a really mediocre storyline and a decent cast that weren't enough to make this any better.

Sigourney Weaver is the only returning cast member as her character is resurrected 200 years after the events of the third film, but this interesting and unique set up never manages to bring any real excitement, Weaver's heart wasn't in the performance, it was clear she didn't want to do this movie. It also tends to drag far too often, investing too much time on a certain scene and over developing characters that no one cares about, it focuses a lot on Winona Rider's Call, easily one of the most irritating characters in sci-fi history, the writers clearly struggled to make her likable and never achieved that goal. Alien 3 wasn't outstanding, but it's just as good as Alien or Aliens in comparison to this mess, Alien: Resurrection is s boring, slow and underwhelming fourth installment. <br/><br/>A replicated Ripley must fight the creatures once again in the far distant future. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Ron Perlman"

"hall895","4","0","2","7 June 2015"," Let it die
","Ellen Ripley is back for another Alien adventure. Kindly ignore the fact that when last we saw her Ripley was quite dead. How to continue a franchise when you've killed off your star? Cloning of course. Duh. So 200 years after her demise Ripley is back, the military having cloned her because they want the Alien queen that was inside her when she died. You think the military would have learned better by now than to try to harness these Alien killing machines. But of course had they learned their lesson there would be no movie. And the studio wanted to make some easy cash off another Alien movie so here we are. After the disaster that was Alien³ the franchise should have been allowed to die. This movie is slightly better than the last but that's not saying much. Enough is enough.<br/><br/>As ever with this franchise Sigourney Weaver is the best thing about this film. Another strong performance as she portrays a strong heroine. And this time there's a little mystery to Ripley, with the cloning process she's got some Alien blood mixed up inside her. That raises some interesting issues. Indeed the first part of this film does show some promise as we get to know this new Ripley. But it devolves rather quickly. It turns into just another rehash. Aliens attack, blood and gore, repeat as necessary. We've seen all this before and quite frankly we've seen more than enough of it. The story does have a few new twists as it moves towards the finish. But by the time the ""big"" moments come you'll probably have lost interest. Weaver gets very little support. Winona Ryder is the big co-star here and she's all wrong for this movie. Sci-fi action is not her thing. The only other actor who stands out at all is Ron Perlman. Unfortunately he only stands out because of how annoying his character is. Reminiscent of Bill Paxton in Aliens. Perlman isn't quite as annoying as Paxton was but it's close. There aren't enough good things here to make the resurrection of this franchise remotely worthwhile. Let Ripley and the Aliens rest in peace."
"lucasversantvoort","6","0","2","5 May 2015"," Too postmodern for the franchise, but still quite fun
","I suppose people should have been wary once they saw the subtitle... Alien: Resurrection hit theaters five years after Alien 3 received a mixed response and that's putting it lightly. Whereas 3, while not as tight a film as its predecessors, still had a number of things going for it (dark humor, religious themes, acting), this film is the first within the franchise to suffer from nothing less than a full-on identity crisis.<br/><br/>If you thought Alien 3's opening ruined Aliens' happy ending, wait until you see Resurrection's opening: Ripley—and therefore the alien inside her—are brought back from the dead through the wonders of modern science. Yep, no sacrificing herself for humanity this time à la Alien 3; Ripley's just brought back. (Technically though, she's cloned and it's only the eighth one that's a success.) What's especially bad is Ripley could have very plausibly been written out of this film. The doctors extract the alien from her stomach and the lead doctor is asked what they should do with the Ripley clone. He decides that though the alien queen is their priority, they might as well keep her alive for further research. He might as well have shrugged and said ""meh, why not?"" Anyway, the Ripley clone and the alien queen are alive and held in separate parts of a ship that belongs to the military. Then another ship arrives, controlled by a mercenary crew. They're there to deliver some cargo, another ship's (now unconscious) crew. The trade is done and the mercenary group's leader asks if they can stay for a few days. The general in charge of the entire thing agrees. Naturally, things start going south very quickly from here on out. Several aliens birthed by the queen escape and crew-members are quickly picked off. Ripley also escapes and teams up with the mercenaries. The ship is now on auto-pilot and returning to Earth. Realizing it'd be the end of humanity, Ripley and the others seek to simultaneously destroy the ship and escape from it.<br/><br/>If Alien 3 sought to replicate Alien in terms of the overall narrative and pacing, then Resurrection is trying to replicate Aliens. There's more action here and much of it is overly choreographed, the worst offender being a bullet that ricochets two times before landing in a guy's dome. And it's scenes like that make you realize you're watching a film that's afraid to be dramatic without simultaneously being self-aware. On the one hand, you've got pretty riveting scenes like the one where Ripley discovers a lab filled with her failed clones, but on the other, you've got stuff like the ricocheting bullet scene. Needless to say, the film doesn't marry these elements together as well as it should. The presence of director Jean Pierre Jeunet and writer Joss Whedon attest to that fact. While Jeunet's sense of visuals ensures the film looks mostly great and atmospheric, one has to agree that the future director of Amelie directing an Alien film isn't a scenario many would label 'ideal'. Writer Whedon has also gone on to claim his final script was adhered to, but executed in a different way than he intended. It's obvious that, despite all the talent involved, there was a lack of a singular vision for Resurrection which resulted in this walking identity crisis of a film. I find it really ironic that what makes Resurrection unique within the franchise is its identity crisis.<br/><br/>So what do you do as a viewer? The only way to approach Resurrection is by realizing it's an incredibly self-aware postmodern flick. In other words, lower your expectations. Maybe then you'll get a kick out of the handful of action scenes that are moderately well-executed (the underwater scene) or some of the underdeveloped ideas (the newborn and the concept of cloning). But save for scenes like that, it's as far removed from being a true 'Alien' film as can be. Oh well, at least we got Sigourney Weaver's basketball shot out of it."
"Leofwine_draca","5","0","1","17 March 2015"," Dodgy sequel in which the aliens feel like an afterthought
","In the beginning, in 1979, there was ALIEN. It was more of a horror film than anything else, and had a lot of suspenseful and sickening moments in equal amounts. In 1986, James Cameron made ALIENS, which blended action with horror brilliantly. In 1993, there came the much maligned ALIEN 3, which most people hated but which I thought was pretty good, and suspenseful like the first. And now there is this, the fourth instalment in the series.<br/><br/>Sad to say, it doesn't reach the heights of the first film, nor the second, nor even the third. The trouble is that it doesn't really feel like an alien film at all - just another science fiction piece, with some alien creatures as the monsters. I mean in the other films we felt that the aliens were powerful, prowling and totally terrifying. Now, they pop up now and again to kill some hapless person, but most of the film is spent in conversation as we learn of Ripley's new character.<br/><br/>This was, I felt, the film's main failing: the lack of the Ellen Ripley as we used to know her. Weaver played a strong, yet sympathetic heroine in the first three films; now, she is a half-human, superhuman alien clone with whom the audience shares zero sympathy or understanding; she is not even likable. Or hardly believable. Weaver does the best with the character she has, but too much of the dialogue is given over to stupid, repetitive one-liners, or incessant swearing.<br/><br/>Jeunet at least assembled an interesting, international cast for his film, which makes the proceedings a little easier to swallow than if it had been some group of B-movie nobodies. Winona Ryder is top-billed as a woman who turns out to be hiding a secret, unfortunately I knew what this secret was long before I actually got around to seeing the film, so I knew what to expect. I've never liked Ryder much and don't really consider her as much of an actress, and this film does nothing to make me respect her further.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the supporting cast itself contains some notable character actors. First up is Brad Dourif, who enjoys himself in a small role as a nervous scientist who brings Ripley's character 'back' to life. Dourif is as good as ever, and proving himself to be the king of the bit-parts. Secondly we have Ron Perlman as a tough, scarred soldier, and although his character is highly clichéd, he's about the most likable of the bunch and lends plenty of humour to the action. Michael Wincott also appears as the leader of a band of smugglers, and it's good to hear his gravelly voice again.<br/><br/>Which leads me on to one of the main criticisms I have of this film: the lack of originality. Much of the action, when it eventually comes, has been lifted from the other films in the series, so what we're seeing is merely regurgitated. Saying that, the action parts are all quite good, especially the famed underwater sequence. Unfortunately, as so much of the film is given over to dialogue and banter, there is little action to enjoy and hardly any suspense built up.<br/><br/>The special effects themselves are all average, with the CGI aliens looking reasonable although not as good as their counterpart in ALIEN 3 did. Unfortunately the much-touted alien/human hybrid at the end of the film is a huge disappointment and laughable, and feels totally out of place. And it looks like a pining dog too, which is damned annoying, although the death sequence, where it gets sucked out of a window, is quite good. There is also a high level of gore for horror fans, but Jeunet frequently overuses this in favour of building up suspense as in the previous films, and there is a noticeably 'empty' feel to much of the film.<br/><br/>Which leads me to my final point: if this were not the fourth part of the ALIEN saga, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more. But, with such competition from the other three, Jeunet comes across like he's more interested in set design and style than the actual aliens themselves, and betrays the series fan by seriously losing touch with the 'feel' of what an ALIEN film should be like. Not totally bad, but not very good either."
"Gcrispey","3","0","2","28 August 2014"," Why are we discussing this movie?
","I was and always will be a big fan of the Alien series. Alien is a very sensitive movie, introducing a then maybe unheard range of terror. Aliens for me was a climax as the claustrophobic situation amounts to a ""best nightmare ever"" scenario and the pace and idea of the original movie is very well followed. Dark, rather slow, characters mostly carefully chosen, presented and evolved. Aliens 3 was somewhat of a necessity to close the thought, to kill the beast, to end it for the viewer and Ripley. Even though a little less fascinating it was still colour- , sound-wise as well as felling-wise in the range and did do the job. And now this. I understand the interest to continue a winning story, but it has to be done in a decent way that does not damage an excellent series. Alien: Resurrection would do exactly this, if you counted it. But it should not. The biggest surprise is the introduction how Ripley and the alien inside can live as she was burned in Alien 3. It is the most uninventive explanation, cloning. Well, cloning from blood samples might once become possible, but the alien queen in her chest is actually depicted in her genetic information? Really? So this starts a reign of horror concerning ideas how to make a movie that does not really need to be made. The characters are flat, simple, the dialogues are atrocious most of the time. The pace of the movie is so much quicker and uneven that you feel put into an splatter action B movie. Yes the pictures are nicely done in some scenes, but this does not help a lot, as dumb and uninteresting people are getting killed and you really don't give a damn about it. If there was not Sigourney Weaver, who sometimes herself seems disgusted by the sentences she has to speak, the movie would deserve less than my 3 stars. She holds up her acting in what could be a very interesting character, changed from the first 3 movies. But this potential subsides in very little genius of developing something. On the whole, if you like the series, it might not be a good idea to watch it, you might be disappointed."
"GeorgeRoots","3","0","2","28 June 2014"," In The Multiplex, Everybody Can Hear You Scream.
","This is where the series got REALLY far-fetched and considering what this franchise is about, that's saying something. In the first 5 minutes they completely retcon the final events of ""Alien3"" (1992), by cloning Ripley to the point when she was carrying the Alien. Obviously money grabbing scientist's (One played by Brad Dourif) never learn, and of course (SHOCK) the aliens escape.<br/><br/>Our supporting cast comes in the form of mercenaries, namely Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman. Not one of them are likable, but hell what can you do with such a p*ss poor script. Even with Joss Whedon coming off ""Toy Story"" (1995), I just did not connect with it considering how much I am a fan of his other work. And now this is what I really want to dig into, the handling of Ripley is horrendous. As much as I enjoy Sigourney Weaver, even she cannot save this emotionally detached performance. We became her in ""Alien"" (1979), became stronger with her in ""Aliens"" (1986) and ultimately conquered everything by ""Alien3"". There is nothing left to do, and nothing new to overcome as she has pretty much became an alien now (I don't know she has acid blood or something). Some new alien comes along with pinkish flesh and looking back it was ridiculous, telling me that this movie just doesn't know what to do with itself and would rather sacrifice suspense for a few oddities here and there.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: When I first saw this, I was 15 and accepted it as decent conclusion to the series. Seven years on however, I can't believe how they got away with something so half-baked. In a sense the movies style is reminiscent of ""Aliens"", but in the end all it does is make you wish you were watching that movie instead of this trash. 3/10."
"TheSeaLion","4","0","2","14 August 2013"," Resurrection is the death of the ""Alien"" franchise
","While I found ""Alien 3"" to not be that great and be extremely mediocre, ""Alien: Resurrection"" proves to be the worst of the ""Alien"" films in my opinion and does many things that I find infuriating in film. The third film had a great ending to it with the intense game of cat and mouse through the prison and Ripley's sacrifice so that the Weyland Corporation could not get its hands on the alien. Everything is tied up nicely and there are no lose ends.<br/><br/>Then, along comes ""Alien: Resurrection"", which is the true road to ruin for the ""Alien"" movies. We open up at least a thousand years later after the events of ""Alien 3"". Ripley has been cloned and the Weyland Corporation is also trying to recreate the alien species, succeeding in making several clones using kidnapped humans collected by mercenaries as hosts. The aliens soon mature and escape, damaging the ship.<br/><br/>The first things that really infuriated me with this movie was with Ripley being alive because she was cloned. I do not like characters who die to come back to life in movies unless they are like ghosts or the method for their resurrection is set up ahead of time. So, Ripley is alive because she was the star of the first three films so they need her to be in it or it will not be a true ""Alien"" film. That is what it felt like to me.<br/><br/>My next biggest issue was with the new creature introduced in the movie. The three movies before it had clever ideas, even if they were mild. ""Alien"" introduced us to the species and the face-huggers, ""Aliens"" gave us the idea of a queen alien, and the third one had an alien but since it came out of a dog and not a human, it behaved a little like a dog would. What this film did was not even remotely clever. They had a half- human half-alien hybrid. This just screams to me that they wanted something new but could not think of something remotely clever so they did one of the most cliché things imaginable, mixing a human with the creature.<br/><br/>Another problem I had was with the movie all together. It had nothing for the audience besides aliens hunting down and killing the humans. The characters were uninteresting--not that the characters from the first three films were works of art but they at least made you care--so we did not care if they succeeded or not as the only person we might be able to relate to is Ripley, but she's a clone and not the real Ripley so there is nothing from that. The film is played off more as aliens in ""Poseidon"" as the characters are escaping from a ship, going through different obstacles while aliens instead of rising water are following them. There is little tension as they could easily defeat the aliens. They have firepower and there is less than ten aliens. In ""Alien"" and ""Alien 3"", they had little to no weapons and in ""Aliens"" they had weapons but not enough to fight them all. There was tension with that. In this, the characters are all armed and there are few enough aliens that they could just fight them off, ergo, no tension. To try and compensate for this, they have one mercenary in a wheelchair and a guy with an embryo in him that is about to erupt from his chest, but both of these fail to bring tension to the audience.<br/><br/>While I would watch ""Alien: Resurrection"" over other films I have seen, the film fails on multiple levels and takes the ""Alien"" franchise from having an ending that was pretty good to a lousy ending where we are left with our surviving characters sitting around with a ""what happens now?"" thought running through the audience's brains."

Throw in a preacher and a prostitute, and it would have been feeling like old times. <br/><br/>So anyway, through the magic of cloning an a co-producer credit for Sigourney, Ellen Ripley is back from the dead. Except this time, they kind of got the alien and human DNA mixed up. So Ripley has alien acid blood and the alien Queen has a womb.<br/><br/>I really think the problem is in the direction. You have this French director who managed to screw everything up, because he didn't realize he was directing an American film. The first time I realized something was wrong was when the Dan Hedaya character gets a crazy look on his face when they explain to him that the Ripley Clone might have memories.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other scenes in the film that just seem odd or out of place.<br/><br/>Whedon's script is actually pretty decent, if it was better directed and they didn't make some of the acting choices they made. The real problem, though, it the aliens themselves. There's nothing really new about them. they're doing the same thing they've been doing for the last three movies. Who cares anymore?"

","Everything has pretty much been said about this film, so I would like to take this in a slightly different direction.<br/><br/>Forget the plot. It steals left and right from the other films: the traitor from Alien, the guns and action of Aliens, the color palette of Alien 3... Joss Whedon's screenplay tries to shoehorn in character prototypes from his aborted ""Firefly"", and Jeunet's bite is less fierce without Marc Caro. Forget the idea of cloning, we've seen this before, and while Sigourney Weaver takes the character to interesting places, the opportunity isn't explored as fully as one would wish.<br/><br/>And therein lies the problem of this film. The Alien saga is unique because it has two central pillars: - strong main character - fascinating mythology left almost completely unexplored<br/><br/>All successful film series built around a recurring film character are either episodically built around a main conflict (Harry Potter) or inevitably are ""comedies"" because there's only so much a main character can take (Indiana Jones and James Bond, we're looking at you).<br/><br/>The Alien saga could have gone back to the roots of the mythology Ridley Scott and Giger brushed up against in part 1. Instead it tried to emulate what James Cameron did in part 2. It worked in part 2 because Ripley was playing against type, an emotionally limited intellectual having to be a soldier and a mother, and face her worst fears. We were all the better for it.<br/><br/>And then came parts 3 and 4, and while the budgets rose, the ideas dwindled. Attempts to breathe new life in got stiffed, and however bonkers - Vincent Ward's medieval take, watch the DVD special features to believe it - original concepts were better than what landed on the screen.<br/><br/>Maybe, more than anything, this is a perfect case-study for how badly Hollywood can treat its star franchises: with total aversion for risk-taking. Nobody expected the first film, and it reinvented horror aesthetics. Few people knew what to expect from the second one, and James Cameron turned the tables on them. But as the franchise grew in fame, so did the stakes, and for all the talented people involved behind the camera - Giger, Fincher, Jeunet, Ward... - the series lost the power to awe and terrify us.<br/><br/>And now, after all these years, we are headed back to the darkest recesses of Scott and Giger's minds, with Prometheus.<br/><br/>We will see what that brings. Its colossal budget might bode ill, its refusal to claim too close a relation to the Alien universe is probably wise. Until then, we will have the sometimes fascinating wreckage that are Aliens 3 and 4 to marvel at."

","In my opinion this movie was just released to make Fox some easy money. The trilogy was over but they had to ""resurrect"" it. <br/><br/>Although the director has several other great movies I believe he was the wrong candidate to helm an Alien film. Jean-Pierre Jeunet injects the film with his signature French humor, which is great but does not work for me in an Alien movie. I want to take my Alien movies seriously, I want to feel scared, care for the characters but this movie jokes around with everything, never gets you scared (just disgusted), and I couldn't care less for any of the cardboard characters. I would say they could have cut down on the characters but believe that David Fincher pulled off the suspense with the huge cast from the previous film so I will just label the new bunch as incompetent.<br/><br/>The best part in this movie is the final creature. I would always prefer Fox stuck with H.R. Giger, the artist who created the iconic alien in the first place, but think they did a good job by creating a memorable new addition with the ""newborn."" The animatronics, the facial expressions, characteristics, movements and sounds for this final creature are lifelike and believable. I only wished we'd seen more of it like having it stalk/hunt the crew throughout the movie for extra suspense.<br/><br/>I saw this in the cinema when it came out with my die-hard Alien fan friend and we both couldn't eat dinner after-wards; now I stumbled upon the DVD in 2011 and watched it again but couldn't help fast forwarding and all I can appreciate is the end as described above. From what I read here it is evident there were several disappointed viewers and I just hope the studios would take these things more seriously but I am losing hope with AvP and it's sequel (at least the video games are great)."

","Credit IMDb 200 years after the conclusion of Alien 3, the company is able to resurrect Ripley through the process of cloning and the scientists successfully take the Queen Alien out of her. But, Ripley's DNA gets mixed up with the Queen's and she begins to develop certain alien characteristics. The scientists begin breeding the aliens, but they later escape. Soon the Xeno-morphs are running amok on the ship, which is on course to earth. The Queen then gives birth to a deadly new breed of alien, which could spell disaster for the entire human race. It's up to Ripley and a band of space pirates to stop the ship before it reaches earth.<br/><br/>Where do I begin? For starters, where's the effort and passion I saw in the first three movies? It's nowhere to be found here. The Aliens, while visually impressive, appear way too much throughout the film, and the essence of surprise is gone. The first Alien was so great, because it always seemed to lurk in the shadows. We never really got a full glimpse of it, and when we did, it was terrifying. I dug the Ripley bonding with the Aliens, but there isn't much else. Grating characters, overblown action, and too much CGI ruins it. Ripley's character meant nothing to me here; it was cold, just like the film itself.<br/><br/>Performances. Sigourney Weaver actually does very well, considering her thin part, and it was fun to see a playful side of hers, but it doesn't change the fact I couldn't get into her character, and it was thinly written. She has traits of the original Ripley, and I know it was duly documented that it wasn't the original, but I just felt so cold by her part. Her charisma with Ryder was actually above average. As such an admirer of her role in the first three, it was disappointing to see her go out this way. Winona Ryder was actually good in my mind. I've seen plenty of criticism with her performance here, but I liked it. She showed the right amount of emotion and vulnerability. Dominique Pinon is annoying as the guy in the wheel chair. I felt no sympathy, and he got on my nerves quickly. Ron Perlman is funny, and annoying at the same time. His constant yelling made me wanna shut him up though. Gary Dourdan's role is cool, but that's about it. Dan Hedaya can play these types of roles in his sleep. Brad Douriff is a hoot in his role.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Couple of good moments is not enough to just barely maintain this above the Mendoza line. It felt like a pure cash in. No heart, no soul. They should have stopped at number three.<br/><br/>4 ½ 10"

","This movie was horrible. I can't believe that they did this. We all saw Ripley not only die but practically melted and disinigrated. And they brought her back to life. That was probably the biggest mistake. When I saw the third alien movie, I thought it was pretty good but it was no where near as good as the first two alien movies. This movie was just a disgrace.<br/><br/>And this movie was scary no doubt, but it was really weird scary. And when I say weird scary I mean like imagine yourself at the most emo, goth, extreme heavy metal concert and you're in the middle of that giant crowd. Now imagine what they're doing, their faces, and they're behavior. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little but you get the idea.<br/><br/>And in all of the alien movies there was some kind of final fight or battle at or near the end. First alien movie was the alien getting thrown in space. Second movie was Ripley vs. the alien queen. Third movie was getting the alien into the led pit. In this one, there really wasn't one. The closest I can say it can get to that is when that weird human/alien hybrid (I have no idea what it was I'm just taking a guess) got sucked out that little hole in the window.<br/><br/>First of all that alien hybrid was just a screwed up idea. Second of all how do you make a circular hole in a window without a gun and without shattering it when you're travelling at 900 mph through space, and third that was just really weird/strange scary when the alien got sucked inside out through space.<br/><br/>Another thing, critics gave this movie two and half out of four stars. what is wrong with them.<br/><br/>This is just another example of why they should not make a fourth sequel or more to anything. They should just end it in the third movie. And not a never to be revealed cliffhanger at the end, I mean an ending where there aren't any holes in it. Do you know why there's trilogies and no such thing and if there is no one uses the word, as quadrilogy? B/c things come in three's. Just look at Blade or terminator or tremors, and many others and this. The fourth sequel of any movie series sucks (usually). And anyway three is enough.<br/><br/>So for all you actors out there who is ready to star in the fourth sequel, think about what you're doing. Consider that three is enough. The fourth of any movie sucks. And alien resurrection is the worst of them all."

","I loved the film Alien and Aliens. I thought the film Alien 3 was pretty stupid, maybe not a terrible film, but I hated what happened in the film. Alien Resurrection was nothing special to me and it really did not stand out at all.<br/><br/>Basically Ripley gets brought back by some scientific process so that they can remove the Queen Alien from her. The people that remove it then plan to use it to produce more aliens that they can use for research with the military. Ripley then has to help a group escape the complex they are on before it is destroyed and also stop the Aliens from getting to Earth.<br/><br/>The story was all over. It seemed simple enough at the beginning, but then it got really complex and scientific. Also it had lots of holes in it. If they used a sample of Ripleys blood to bring her back, why would that contain the Queen Alien that was in her? I know breaking down science fiction films is not a good idea, but come on.<br/><br/>The aliens are cool as always, but I think they looked better in other films when they were not just CGI. These CGI aliens just look fake to me, and I strongly prefer the aliens from the other films that were guys in costumes. Those looked way more real. Also, in this film why do the aliens roar like lions? They always made that screeching noise in past films, but not this time.<br/><br/>The aliens do get in a lot of violence that is pretty cool, probably the most redeeming factor from the film.<br/><br/>Ripley is different in this film, not bad just different. Sigourney Weaver does a decent job with the new form of Ripley, part human and deep down part alien. Very layed back and quiet and just odd in a way. More so the directors idea than Weavers I am sure, but I am not entirely sure what to make of Ripley in this film.<br/><br/>The other human characters are just bland and not interesting at all. I did not feel like I could get behind any of them. Pretty much the opposite of the film Aliens where there was a great cast of humans that you could root for and felt you understood. Winona Ryder was OK, but probably over rating her because I think she is hot.<br/><br/>The idea of having a human and alien hybrid is an interesting idea, albeit a disturbing result.<br/><br/>THis is not a great film. It is not original, exciting, or for the most part memorable. I do not recommend this film, but it is not terrible. Just did not do it for me."

","I LOVE the alien movies. And I love Joss Whedon. I was extremely surprised to find out that he wrote the screenplay. I console myself by assuming that the character writer wrote the awful dialog, and that the producers made changes that he would not have agreed with. And that he did not cast wynona ryder. she is horribly annoying in this movie. I loved Heathers, and this was the movie that made me start to dislike her. The aliens are scary. The new Ripley-hybrid is an obvious Whedon powerful superwoman. But the story is not as good as the others. It is less coherent in places- perhaps it was edited poorly. And some of the dialog is Embarrassingly Awful. I really did not expect that from a movie in the alien series. Even though Aliens, the 2nd one, is mostly an action film, not at all a serious Ridley Scott scifi work, and has a corny line or 2, it was well done, enthralling, and scary as hell! There are some of great actors in this movie(Brad Dourif, Michael Wincott, Ron Perlman -although his performance was terrible), Ripley kicks some ass, more corporate horrors are revealed, and the aliens exhibit some new and terrifying behavior. But it is definitely my least favorite of all the Alien movies. And if you are just starting the series, you can skip it. You don't miss any information relevant to the AvP movies or any future installments. There was no super secret Bishop or Weyland Industries revelation that mattered."

","Resurrection? Why, what's the point?, what's the logic? what's the reason?, what's the meaning? Why? These are questions that should have been asked before Fox greenlighted Joss Whedon's piece of work, ""Alien Resurrection"". This film is a failure on so many levels it's almost unbelievable.<br/><br/>After the troubled production (and obnoxious, studio-meddling) of Alien 3, you would think that someone would just have enough brains to leave it be. Just let it end on a relatively good film (who's only flaw was the studio's editing after Fincher's walkout). But no, they just couldn't leave it alone, the resurrection of this franchise has absolutely no logic behind it. How could this film possibly succeed? Someone should have said.<br/><br/>Let me begin my walkthrough of this horrible injustice. The beginning problem was Joss Whedon's script. Who on earth said ""Hey! let's have the buffy the vampire guy write our new Alien movie!"", And then the next big question is: Who agreed to it? The funny thing about it is that Joss has apparently escaped all retribution for this movie by stating that they filmed his perfectly good script wrong. But this argument doesn't hold up when you know the contents of the actual script, in fact, the resulting film did the original script justice (maybe even improvement).<br/><br/>The film starts off with no setting, and no background. Where are we now? Why is this ship here? Who are these people? What is the universe's current condition? Are questions that are never fully or satisfactorily answered. In fact the film is so restricted by it's limited scope that it doesn't even seem to know the answers to these questions. It just makes a large amount of excuses to get both weapons and aliens into the picture, and let me tell you their excuses involve, cloning, evil governments and pirates or ""mercenaries"" or whatever they called them (they seemed like pirates to me). Where these people came from, and why are they pirates are questions that no attempt was ever made to answer.<br/><br/>The biggest of the script's issues are the mind-numbingly wide plot holes that cause the entire film's premise to crumble. The excuses used to drag our battle-weary Ripley out from the grave is so clearly ridiculous they really can't fool even the most unscrutinizing audience.<br/><br/>The foolishly ignorant use of science is used repeatedly throughout the film, most evident in the arrival of the ""Newborn"" (highly original name, ain't it). Apparently.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS) Since a group of scientists removed an Alien queen out of a cloned Ripley (not like that even makes sense to begin with), the queen apparently takes on human traits, such as a human reproductive system, resulting in the birth of an alien-human hybrid. The hybrid kills the queen and then identifies with Ripley as her mother (which also, doesn't make any sense). The original Whedon-design of the newborn was so ridiculous that it had to be redesigned into a better (but still awful) combination which is somewhere between the hunchback of Notre-dame and Casper the friendly ghost. (NOTE: All this info is thrown at you within a 4 to 5 minute period towards the end of the movie). (SPOILERS END) <br/><br/>So at about this point I was asking, why? what kind of plot device is this. Randomly thrown in, it doesn't help or move the story along just simply makes it more inconceivable than it was to begin with.<br/><br/>So aside from Whedon's completely non-plausible script, the entire air of the story itself was a major problem. It successfully rips all terror and dark intensity from itself, only to replace it with what can best be described as swashbuckling campiness. Scenes with humorous intent were thrown here and there with no particular meaning, although the ending result was not humorous at all. There is no substance, not even one original piece worth noting, the entire film reeks of the staleness of it's own concept.<br/><br/>None of the acting was really worth mentioning, almost all of the performances felt weak and contrived, none of the characters had any depth or soul to them. Even Ripley has been leached of all her relatability, replaced with weird alien-hybrid version of herself that really leaves no character relatabilty in the film at all especially after a disturbing ""sex"" scene between her and an alien (oh yes, that was in there), they all just seem like disconnected people that we just don't know or care about.<br/><br/>As I wrap up here, I will say this, if you are dying for some alien action, this will not satisfy you no matter HOW desperate you are. In fact you would be better off watching AVP, which, regardless of how weak a film it was, was WAY better than this crap.<br/><br/>3/10 stars"

","Two hundred years after her death, Ellen Ripley (Weaver) has been resurrected into a human/alien clone that sets on continuing the ongoing battle against the aliens.<br/><br/>The forth instalment of the series sees Sigourney Weaver (Working Girl) reprise her role as the Sci-Fi icon Ripley, the character who sacrificed herself to rid the world of the alien inside her. One of the few things good about Alien3 was that ending. A dramatic turn of events that not even the most critical of person could foresee. 200 years on from the third part and she's back, brought through scientific experiment to bring the Alien queen out of the opinionated experienced warrior. The whole question of science and resurrection in this manner over such a long time and the effect on the character is exceptionally questionable, especially with the scientific jargon the scientists use.<br/><br/>But this is almost irrelevant, Ripley returned, and she is the Alien series. Weaver is the star of the poorly constructed narrative, making the new Ripley an intelligent and cunning protagonist, and her facial expressions convey that she has something to hide, which makes her an absolute joy to watch.<br/><br/>Alien3 made its mistake by justifying itself to the action convention cinematic formula and not focusing on the domineering presence of the finest Sci-Fi villain ever. Whereas this 1997 picture is more sophisticated in its approach to storytelling, the action, illogic and narrative in general still bring the premise down.<br/><br/>Action-wise this feels very basic and ordinary, with the Alien hardly scary once again. Not hiding and always inevitable, it's hard to imagine it was scary in the first place. There are however some finely directed scenes. Rare, but on screen critics are forgotten, particularly the underwater chase which is a fine adrenaline soaked thrill ride.<br/><br/>The science behind number 4 is frequently questionable. The film raises eyebrows with its debate over lengthy survival, alien/human relations and history. It seems very incidental, throwing in these concepts whilst the action does the talking otherwise.<br/><br/>Apart from some fine direction during the action sequences, the narrative is inconsistent with these bizarre topics and the predictable action and incomprehensible science destroy the promise of another horror.<br/><br/>Though Weaver once again shines, Alien Resurrection is as much of a let down as its predecessor was, though with thankfully better characters and direction"

Not in the least. <br/><br/>What I got was unlikable characters, unused potential and almost no ****ing Aliens for the past 90 minutes.

He did great, it's just the story that falls to bloody acid pieces. Aliens 3 was just passable in some story aspects making a good conclusion to a movie series with Ripley killing herself along with the Alien inside her in a pit of lava...however it seems that she was to likable of a character to die, so they brought her back through some weird excuse such as ""cloning"" her. <br/><br/>How original.

Then the Aliens escape from their cells and all hell breaks loose. Now I know there should be only around 50 Aliens or so but really we don't see many Alien encounters in the movie. Then they had to leave the ship and destroy it since the ships on it's way to Earth...for some unexplained reason...<br/><br/>Just as the story was coming to an end I was thinking to myself, ""Well, it wasn't that bad-"".

","If ever a franchise needed a new direction, it was the Alien series. With Ellen Ripley gone, there was an opportunity to do something totally new and original. Instead, the studio insisted that Ripley return and thanks to the cloning of the deceased character (cardinal sin #1 when making a movie), she did, with the alien queen in tow. But that was forgivable because of the idea that came with Ripley (ie the failed clones). Then the director decided to crap all over it and make another bad horror/sci-fi movie with bad cgi.<br/><br/>The story is fairly basic. Ripley is somehow cloned 200 years after her death, with the alien queen somehow still in her. The doctors cut it out of her and keep her alive for some reason. Some space pirate types bring the scientists some hyper-sleeping miners and shortly thereafter, we have a bunch of aliens in cages. But these aliens (and Ripley) had some genetic crossover due to the cloning and are much smarter, leading to a fast escape. The rest of the movie is spent with Ripley and the pirates trying to escape the ship, all leading up to a ""shocking"" revelation after Ripley is taken into the alien nest: the alien queen now has a humanlike reproductive system from the genetic crossover. She then gives birth to a nasty looking hybrid, which quickly kills her and sees Ripley as it's mother. Ripley eventually escapes to the pirate's ship and kills the hybrid by letting it get vacuumed out a broken window.<br/><br/>A lot of the concepts in the movie could have worked very well. The scene with Ripley finding her failed clones is the best scene in the film. The rest is... well, questionable. Most of the cast (save for the pirates) is just poor, reading their lines more like a dark comedy (although that is mainly the fault of the writer). Save for the clone scene, Sigourney Weaver is borderline terrible and the fact that she got paid more for this movie than the entire budget of the original Alien is horrendous. The aliens themselves look like crap, both in color and how they are portrayed. The little bit of cgi used for the aliens is appalling, even by late 90s standards. And the hybrid alien is a f***ing travesty. It's not scary or interesting, just plain ugly. And the fact that it was designed with genitals (which were removed post-production) pretty much says it all.<br/><br/>This movie could have been the start of a new, unique trilogy. Instead, it effectively killed the original Alien franchise and led to us having to endure those horrible alien/predator crossovers. For that reason alone, this movie loses a few points. All in all, this whole story should have never been adapted into a movie."

","Ugly. Slow. Tacky. Stupid. I have a truckload of negative adjectives that I feel like applying to Alien: Resurrection, and I think they all fit.<br/><br/>I know some people don't share my appreciation for Alien 3, but good grief, I think it's miles better than this installment. Indeed, Alien: Resurrection strikes me as one of those train-wreck movies that leaves the average viewer scratching her head, wondering why a studio would ever give the green light to such a misguided project.<br/><br/>Alien 3, unpopular though it was, brought the Alien saga to a very definite close by killing off the protagonist, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. In this film, Ripley is not-very-convincingly brought back to life as a clone. Indeed, this whole movie focuses on the cloning issue to the exclusion of all else; it's clearly trying to say something about genetic manipulation, or parenthood, or whatever, but the message (if any) is lost in a quagmire of grossness and bad writing.<br/><br/>Speaking of bad writing, the movie's scriptwriter was none other than Joss Whedon, he of ""Buffy"" fame. I gather that Whedon has sort of disowned Alien: Resurrection because he doesn't like the way his script was realized, but I'd argue that the script was fundamentally unsound to begin with. It's loaded with techno-babble, profanity and pilfered ideas, and populated by a cast of seedy, cardboard and thoroughly unlikable characters. Apart from Ripley, the only character who gets any development is Winona Ryder's cyborg-lady, but Ryder's acting stinks and her motivations aren't that interesting anyway.<br/><br/>Really, this film is the worst possible blend of elements from previous Alien movies. Unlike the first Alien and Alien 3, it lacks the presence of a single, unstoppable, awesome alien creature - and unlike Aliens, it lacks the excitement of a whole hoard of alien creatures. In Alien: Resurrection, there are 12 *somewhat stoppable* aliens - ho, hum. So we haven't got the sheer terror value of the first film here, or the raw energy of the second. We've got 12 aliens milling around yet another boring spaceship setting. What an ill-conceived idea.<br/><br/>There's only one really good scene in this film - the underwater action segment, which is more sophisticated than any of the battles in the other Alien films. But since I don't care about the characters, I don't care about who dies in that scene. And, apart from that one exciting bit, the film has few merits, choosing to get mired again and again in disgusting concepts and disgusting imagery of mutants, clones, and a half-Alien half-human creature with saggy boobs. Gross.<br/><br/>If the tagline for the second film was ""this time, it's war,"" the tagline for this one should have been, ""this time, bring a barf bag."" Or, better yet, ""this time...stay home."" Atrocious stuff."

Whedon's fingerprints are all over this one and although his sarcasm-laden dialogue works for some of the mercenaries, it does not quite jive with the Ripley character (despite her being somewhat more ""ruthless"" thanks to her combined DNA). Nothing will beat the rapport the marines had with one another in Aliens. The one area where this film succeeds is the display of the Company's tinkering with the Alien embryos and DNA, presenting a truly frightening gallery of failed experiments. This was something only hinted at in the previous movies and it was satisfying to finally see the twisted fruit of Weyland Yutani's tree."

I absolutely dread ever watching these and feel the utmost sorrow for those - other than me - who did as well. I strictly believe fincher and jeunet should make a public apology for making these.

"stewiefan201","3","0","2","3 May 2008"," Alien Resurrection is completely different from the first three movies, and I mean that in a bad way.
","200 years after Ripley's suicidal death in Alien 3, she is back in Alien Resurrection. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has successfully been cloned, after 7 clones gone wrong, with the alien queen inside her by scientists (Brad Dourif, J.E. Freeman) on the ship Auriga. Ripley has alien DNA in her blood and seems to take on a few alien characteristics. The ship researches the queen and uses her eggs to facehug kidnapped people, for the purpose of studying the aliens that pop out of them. Soon a group of smugglers led by the tough Elgin (Michael Wincott), Johner (Ron Perlman), Call (Winona Ryder), and two or three others, board the Auriga to collect owed money. However the aliens soon escape and run rampant all over the ship, just as the smugglers begin pulling guns on the crew. Almost everyone on the ship has been killed by the aliens. And when the smugglers find out the ship is automatically headed back to Earth, they band together with Ripley, a scientist, soldier, and a man who has an alien in his chest. They have to find a way to stop the ship before it lands on Earth, and the aliens infest home planet.<br/><br/>Alien and Aliens are sci-fi horror classics. Alien 3 is much less favored, but it's still one of my favorites. However I can't deny that Alien 3 is way better than the awful 4th Alien Resurrection. Even the new Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is better than this movie. Alien Resurrection contains dangerously low character development, mostly bad acting, a terrible script, and a completely different style from the first three films. The first three Aliens were very dimly lit to the point where it was hard to see the whole creature. That effect really added to their mystique. However Alien Resurrection leaves leaves nothing to be wondered about, since it is disappointingly brightly lit up. The bright atmosphere felt all wrong because the aliens don't really belong in the light, they belong in the dark. We can see the whole entire alien in their slimy brilliance, and there are actually a few good scenes with them. The scene where they escape from their containment by killing one of their own, and letting his blood burn through the floor creating an exit. This is one hell of a scene and most definitely the best part of the whole movie. It shows that the aliens may seem like mindless killers, but they are actually kind of intelligent. Other than the terrible CGI action scenes (where the aliens seem out of place), the aliens actually look great. In fact the close-up shots of them are fantastic, and really make them look hugely threatening and creepy. But then we get extremely Hollywood-style action scenes such as when the aliens attack underwater. It's scenes like this one that even further ruined the movie and the creatures.<br/><br/>Once you get past the great looking aliens, you realize how stupid and shallow the whole movie really is. The band of smugglers are basically one-dimensional (save for Winona Ryder), as are the scientists, soldiers, and pretty much everyone else who shows up on screen. The acting is poor but what can you expect, the actors were given terrible material to work with. Upsettingly Sigourney Weaver is not good in this movie either, but then again she is just like the rest of the actors, her dialogue and character are awful. I think it was really stupid to bring her back into the series. She killed herself...that should have been final enough! They could have done an Alien movie without Ripley, but I guess since Weaver decided to come back the filmmakers just said ""Let's find the most preposterous way to bring back Ripley from her suicidal grave. I got an idea, she can be an alien/human clone with no personality. Alright high fives all around!"" These terrible human characters are housed by an absurd, shoddy plot that makes absolutely no sense. Ripley apparently has alien features within her, but this is barely mentioned or played on till the end. There is also a side-plot that the scientists are breeding aliens through kidnapped civilians, but it's really only mentioned once or twice. These extra little side-plots don't really matter to the story once the crappy action cranks up. It doesn't even make sense how all the aliens got loose. We only see two aliens escape their cell, but how do ten more get out? This is an enormous plot hole that made me laugh at how stupid the writers must be. There is another scene that also makes zero sense, and that is when the characters swim away from an alien underwater. They break through a cocoon covering an opening to the surface, and when they get through they realize they are surrounded by eggs hatching facehuggers. One of them yells ""They set a trap! It's an ambush!"". We find out at the end that the queen never moved from her cell, and if that's so then how the hell did all those hundreds of eggs get there for this ""ambush"". And even if this was plausible, which it's not, why would the aliens need to put all those eggs there? They already wiped out pretty much the whole ship's crew.<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection is a pretty awful film. Its story, characters, and even its action are all extremely shallow. Just about every single element in this third sequel barely makes any comprehensible sense. The only good thing were the close-ups of the aliens, they looked very good here. But everything else about them felt misplaced in this action flick. And don't even get me started on the whole newborn plot at the end. That was just painful to look at and think of. I give Alien Resurrection a 1 out of 4, just ignore it and go watch the first three."

","Quotes a line from Call,yes,it looks not right and it feels not right.<br/><br/>The Alien trilogy has impressed me a lot and they will remain one of my favorite sequel sci-fi films in the years to come.So,here comes the Resurrection, with a French director,with quite different storyline,so I thought to myself I might as well check it out.<br/><br/>God knows what a sequel it is.I don't want to be over-critical and I must admit there're a few merits about this film such as the special effects and use of lighting at some moments.But unfortunately its downsides outweigh its merits.Firstly,the characters are rather clichéd and generic,there is almost no psychological depth,all you got are rushed and blank dialogues and some boring jokes.Think about Bishop,Hicks and the ""mad guy""(forget his name)in A3,these characters won't slip your mind so easily.Secondly, I actually dislike the idea that you got a cloned Ripley and a robot Call in this film,and yeah,they happen to be almost the only two persons in this film that are very compassionate.The idea that cyborgs are more humane and humans is nice,but here it's presented quite unskillful,or,is it a gender stereotype again?Lastly,Ripley's baby alien at the climax is so very unpleasant to watch(gosh,it's a monster from B-movie!)and where did they get this idea to have it touched and pitied by Ripley?It just feels odd and funny.<br/><br/>I have high respect for the trilogy and my personal favorite one is A3.They could have wind up the trilogy perfectly but they did this,which,like a dude mentioned,made Alien series became a franchise.Resurrection is a daring experiment which may appeal to people after gore and flashy effects,but it's not even in the same level with the first three.It's irresponsible,odd and ultimately not original at all.Sorry but we really don't need one more,and Ripley,I like you,but aren't you tired anyway?"

","I was to young to watch any of these movies when they came out. I have only seen them now at the age of 13. Even at my age I say it's a bad movie. ALIEN3 was a perfect way to end the series but FOX just had to make another. I wasn't scarred once by this movie and that is what really killed it for me, there are even scenes in ALIENS that made me scarred but this one was just horrid. The Queen alien was not justified like in ALIENS. They added a gross ""new born"" alien which was unique yet wasn't a great idea. The fact that they brought Ripley back was a horrible idea. They killed her but they JUST HAD to bring her back. Lets see a raise of hands for how many think that was for the money...okay. Although the visual effects were astounding, everything else sucked. What really killed my enjoyment was the fact that the aliens were brought out into the light for the majority of the scenes that they were in. The only thing that forced me to put 4/10 was the visuals. Everything out sucked"
"BruddanChrist","5","0","2","7 March 2008"," The bastard Alien
","The death of Ripley in Alien 3 should have put a cap on the Alien series. But 20th Century Fox, in its infinite wisdom, wasn't quite ready to plug a money hose like the Alien franchise. So, it was resurrected (pardon the pun).<br/><br/>I like the idea of cloning Ripley. It makes sense to me, given the Company's background, that they would go to such great lengths to obtain the alien. I also like that the clone Ripley is a little ""off"" (for lack of a better term); it makes her a little unpredictable. But the ragtag team of mercenaries facing off against the aliens doesn't work. They're too nihilistic to care about getting scared, so there's no tension. The real trouble starts about halfway through the film, though. The aliens take the backseat, so the characters are left to push the plot. They squabble, exchange colorful language, and push each other around. Then things get rather surreal. Ripley finds the Queen, which gives birth (like a human) to a alien-human hybrid. The alien-human hybrid kills some people, then dies, serving no purpose other than to repulse the audience.<br/><br/>The special effects is a coin toss. Some of them are utilized pretty well, while others are poor enough to laugh at. The amount of slime is ridiculous, as well. Yes, the aliens drool, but there's way too much here. It gets rather grotesque, actually.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is good, as usual. Her performance is a little odd, but that's due to the character change. Ron Perlman is good no matter what he's in, so I have no complaint with his performance. Winona Ryder is my biggest bone to pick with the acting. It's not necessarily that she's bad, just that she doesn't fit with the rest of the cast. She doesn't make a good tough chick. The other performances are OK, a little overdone at times, but nothing Razzie-worthy.<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet really screwed up on Alien: Resurrection. But, in his defense, 20th Century Fox screwed up even more by attempting to keep the Alien franchise alive. After Alien 3, there was nowhere to go. Honestly, there was nowhere to go after Aliens, but I (unlike most people) liked Alien 3, so I forgive it."
"prohibited-name-2023","3","0","1","19 September 2007"," Part of the ever worse decline of the Alien franchise
","This movie is further proof that the Alien series should have been left to rest. Instead of growing, becoming more gripping and keeping the same intense, dark and bewildering monsters that made man look so inferior as a species and so alone in space the Xenomorph's powers wavered sporadically from immortal to easily killed by an obnoxious and poorly cast group of space bums, the idea of the ant-like hive and all the subtle connotations involving gender and Darwinism were lost making them nothing more than boogie-men. The fact that the movie was toned down so much in terms of violence and gore, a classic Fox tactic for shooting themselves in the foot, renders even that rather pointless.<br/><br/>The cloning idea was not only a stretch but utterly ridiculous even for the nonsense-tolerant genre of science fiction and all the menace of the alien hoards is lost, not to mention anything special about them by the time they have adapted to human DNA. This movie will go down in history as the slayer of any hope of a return to form for the Alien franchise and a stain on the career of the creative genius that is Joss Whedon."
"PsicoticX","Null","0","1","1 August 2007"," All was lost.
","Alien Resurrection was a movie that started up with an exciting and promising script. The idea of bringing Ripley back was thrilling to Fox and they went right away and chose Jean Pierre Jeunet for his and my own surprise because it was one of the things that ruined the film (but not the series).<br/><br/>The problem is that the creatures are no longer menacing. The humor concerning the concept of the aliens and Pierre's parody of all that was built in previous installments join the cgi aliens that are completely shown at every occasion to bring down the credibility and mystery of the alien and therefore all possible attempt at making this film tense or scary. This is further aggravated by the ridiculous looking Newborn, they could have simply asked H.R.Giger to design a new breed of a giant xenomorph but they instead came up with an orange hybrid that has a tongue and eyes, moves stupidly and even has breasts.<br/><br/>There are a few good points however: Sigourney's brilliant performance and some character development is given but it is still very injured by the stupid humor and self parody of the concept of the creature.<br/><br/>It is still a must have for Alien fans but, in any occasion, should a new fan or person who has never seen the series before see this movie first (nor Alien vs Predator)."
"lemon_magic","5","0","1","6 May 2007"," They gave it a good try, but ""Resurrection"" just doesn't work
","Part of the problem with Alien: Resurrection may be the sheer amount of time that has passed between the first one and this one, and the fact the Alien 3 was such a depressing downer. 20 years is a long time for a movie franchise, and there was no real reason to make another sequel; that they did it anyway betrays the audience's love and respect for the first two movies. <br/><br/>""Alien: Resurrection"" probably looked good on paper: Get a good European director with great credentials (the guy who did ""City Of Lost Children"") who might bring a fresh sensibility to the franchise and take it in a new direction; get Sigourney Weaver to reprise her role as Ripley; get some excellent character actors to back her up (Brad Dourif, Ron Perlman and Micheal Wincott are always interesting to watch no matter what they are doing), and give the characters lots of snark and dry gallows humor to keep the viewer happy between action scenes. But somehow the whole came out less than the sum of its parts <br/><br/>I've watched this movie on cable a few times in the last few years, trying figure what went wrong. My conclusion: I think what screws things up is the pacing, the inability of the screenplay that to live up to the idea of a centuries long time lapse, and the portrayal of both the evil Corporation and the military as dim-witted, fumble fingered clods. <br/><br/>Two whole centuries have supposedly passed since the last ""Alien"", but apparently the only advances in technology since that movie have been in cloning. (Compare the differences in military technology and air travel between 1797 and 1997). That's a plain failure of imagination. And the Corporation scientists work for 200 years to be able to recreate Ripley and her alien egg, but once they have the aliens they are able to hold them for less than 24 hours before their security measure fail and the aliens infest the ship. That's a failure of respect for the shadowy figures who've been driving this plot's backstory for 20 years. And meanwhile the military has apparently degenerated from hard-core veteran Colonial Marines to a a bunch of wimps who can't handle a bunch of free lance traders on their home ground - and who cut and run the instant there is a problem on their space station. This is completely unlike Alien 1,2 and 3 where the Corporation goons are ruthless and powerful and oppressive in its power, and the military personnel are hard-nosed and ruthless xeno-killers who are simply outmatched. That's a failure of nerve, to have to portray the bad guys and soldiers as simps and wimps. <br/><br/>IMO. these failures drain the movie of most of its potential gravitas. Instead of being horrified and angered by the sheer ruthlessness and sliminess of the ""suits"" who throw away the human lives for a buck, or dismayed and frightened by the way tough veterans of dozens of campaigns were summarily dispatched, I was angered and irritated by their stupidity and thoughtlessness. <br/><br/>In the movie's favor: the rag-tag crew of the Betty are fun to watch in action, and I think the screenwriter is at his best portraying their interaction with each other and Ripley, both before and after the crisis breaks out. Winona Ryder is (surprisingly) the least interesting actor here (not entirely her fault, given the nature of the character), but it was good to see her on-screen again, even in a place holder role like this one. <br/><br/>The other problem is the visuals. The movie looked pretty good, but it just didn't have the punch and grandeur of the previous installments; it's as if the scale was simply too small. (Although Alien was pretty claustrophobic in spots, the ""Nostromo"" seemed to go on for miles). Even though I didn't care for Fincher's oppressive visuals on Alien 3, they were at least as striking and memorable as Scott and Cameron's visions in 1 and 2...but visually, A:R is just another science fiction movie. <br/><br/>At some point during the making of ""A:R"", I am sure that the director and the producer knew that they had lost the chance to make a great movie in the labyrinth of collaboration and production choices that every movie entails. So they went ahead and put out a flawed one and hoped that no one would notice. Well, everyone noticed, and I'm pretty sure that there won't be another ""Alien"". It's probably just as well."

Winona Ryder - wow, talk about a terrible performance. Far too much attitude in her android. The script is pretty bad; the terrible acting combined with cheesy dialogue makes it sound even worse. Not to mention the story is just lame. The 'love scene' was one of the funniest scenes I've ever watched. The visuals are a marked improvement over the other films, but it's to no avail. The underwater scene is kinda cool, but ruined by the acting; the scene with the hybrid getting sucked out of a tiny hole in the window is incredibly gory, but, again, ruined by Weaver's crying face. Just a terrible attempt at an Alien black comedy."

If you look closely at the film, the people die in very gruesome ways that it would make the Jigsaw Killer from Saw cringe. The characters are so stupid in this film that you have the feeling like your just watching a documentary on how stupid people can be. There is one scene where the captain of the crew ship that boarded the main ship heres a noise in the distance in a separate hallway. Instead of running, he investigate and I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you what happens next. Now I like how director Jean-Pierre Jeunet puts a twist to this film but the screenwriter should have studied the first two Alien films (at least the first one) and see how they killed people instead of putting close up shots in and depict the grossest way a person can die. In other words Jeunet should have written the script himself."

There is plenty of action, attitude and gore to keep everyone entertained for a few hours. Unfortunately, after all that concludes, one is going to say that the movie sucked and that would be especially true if one has seen the previous three Alien movies.<br/><br/>Only Alien and Aliens ever did justice to the franchise. The rest of the series have directors and writers totally confused. They don't know whether to do action or horror and end up doing either one of them, totally failing to achieve anything on the level of either Alien or Aliens. There is of course one director called Paul Anderson who actually made an Alien(vs Predator) comedy movie as well.<br/><br/>The entire premise of AR does not appear to be serious. It plays out as a semi-serious flick especially when compared to Alien-3. Some instances of poor CGI have ruined the fright value of the Alien. But the film does try to increase the same through extensive use of violence and gore. While you may be entertained by AR, at the end, you are going to come out, slightly less frightened or intimidated by the Alien, which makes the scope for sequels were unlikely."

","As with most sequels, this doesn't have the impact of the original and suffers in comparison. Add in the factor of second and third instalments, both very competent in their own right, and Alien 4 never really stood a chance. Plus, the options for expanding on the theme of 'nasty alien infiltrating spaceship' are severely limited. Given the number of years between these films, it is almost inconceivable that anybody might come to this one without having seen the previous three, perhaps many times.<br/><br/>I believe that explains some of the critical reviews, and it does tend to dull the experience even for die-hard fans. I think this movie would stand up in it's own right, but I could never know that. I think the Ripley plot is an interesting twist, and the presence of Winona Ryder is most welcome to me, one of her greatest fans. Ron Perlman is perhaps not at his very best here, but still very watchable. I can't really say this is a bad movie, but it's getting tired now, 18 years after it's incarnation. Perhaps a change of scenery would have helped - space may be big, but it is very 'samey' unfortunately. They say familiarity breeds contempt, and I think that's what I feel for the alien. It doesn't scare any more, in fact it's all a bit boring. No amount of tinkering with the script and the characters will make up for that."

","It should have ended in 1992 with Ripley's self-sacrificing jump into the pit, clutching the baby alien bursting out from her chest, forever denying science any chances to use this species as a springboard for heinous experiments. But of course, when scientists and corrupt organizations want something they go after it No Matter What and ALIEN: RESURRECTION, like its human villains, ensures that the franchise lives on. Setting the events 200 years in the future, scientists have done wonders with the trace DNA they have found in the pit and have genetically created not only new aliens but hybrids as well: progressive clones to what they will call # 8, whom we know as Ripley. Why, that remains unclear: perhaps because it was necessary to bring Weaver back on board? Not that it matters, in no time she's being trained to speak and act human, and contrived events have her half-battling the aliens kept in captivity, half embracing them. There's not a shred of the old, real Ripley in her: not even when in horror she kills a live clone gone bad and destroys a lab filled with botched experiments. Female angst aside, Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to make the production look gorgeous and takes the opposite direction that Cameron usually does with his characters: he makes stereotypes behave like they knew what they were and reacted against it with horrible performances. Clever. Winona Ryder plays a fem-bot; Dominique Pinon is a cripple who is actually the strongest of the bunch, Ron Perlman plays a tough guy who is funny, and Gary Dourdan is the black guy who isn't as black as he seems (but gets killed off, if late in the film).

","I watched this film simply out of interest because I am the biggest fan of the Alien trilogy (and yes, to me it remains a trilogy!). I was reluctant, however, as Ripley had died at the end of the third film, and the only reason I could see for making a fourth where she is 'resurrected' was purely to cash in at the box office. That's fine I suppose since, let's face it, that's what Hollywood is all about. However, I really feel that this film was a plain insult to the classic 'Alien', and it's wonderful sequel 'Aliens'. Although 'Alien 3' wasn't quite as brilliant, it was still a very good film which followed in the footsteps of the former two by using tension building and atmosphere as a way of creating fear. 'Alien: Resurrection' fails to do this, and instead relies upon gore. The thing that makes 1-3 of the series so great is that it is kept so simple, despite its setting it is believable, and the characters can be related to in some way so the audience can identify with them and understand their fear. The fourth in the epic has failed to do this as it has gone too far and become 'silly'. I still consider the 'Alien' series to be a trilogy, which I continue to watch and admire. I won't be watching Resurrection again!!"

","I've always thought, in the original movie, Alien, that the S.O.S. signal that the crew responded to was from a derelict ship of some unknown race. In both the first two movies it was what appeared to be an uninhabited planet. If this is true, then the derelict ship from the first movie must have picked-up the Aliens somewhere else...perhaps the Aliens homeworld. This gives two possible sequels. First, explorers come across the Alien homeworld, trapping the Explorers on a hostile planet with millions of Aliens. Second, a team could be sent to back-track the derelict ship from the original movie, and encounter a planet under siege... the giant sentient creatures from the derelict ship defending their planet from being overwhelmed by the Aliens. The Earth team could be pulled into battle and discover a new ally against the Aliens. In either version Ripley could be brought in as ""The Expert"" on Alien tactics etc. Comments welcome. And if I just outlined Alien 5 & Alien 6.... I want writing credit...lol"

","Personally I put the third Alien film at the bottom of the franchise. On a recent re-watch from the Quadrilogy I realised that it's really quite a decent film but my problem is that it provides nothing to the franchise that Alien didn't already do.<br/><br/>Comparatively, while 'Resurrection' isn't a fantastic film in its own right, it is a different sort of film to the others by virtue of being a darkly ironic comedy. The set-up alone is preposterous (to do with cloning and memory-containing DNA) and drives the whole film to be of a different level.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon has disowned his script...which is a shame because it smells strongly of his style: We have characters who are sharply defined and somewhat comic book in style, and they are quick to throw out humorous one-liners. Moreover, the sort of tensions between them are the same that we saw in the original Alien film and it adds a little to the feel.<br/><br/>There are definitely some terrible aspects to this film: the final act is hampered by some bad SFX and the typical Hollywood thing of ""Okay, everything's got to be BIGGER this time!"" but even so, this film has never deserved the slating it always received and as a fourth film in a series it's certainly winning out by far against crap like Jaws: The Revenge, The Phantom Menace, Police Academy 4 and Superman IV..."

","Until now, the ""Alien"" films have been a trilogy of movie-making mastery. Scott, Cameron and Fincher all gave unique glances into the future and the story of Ellen Ripley. There was only one curse that followed these films, they made money. So a fourth installment had to be made, seemingly for that purpose alone. The plot is set several hundred years after ""Alien 3"" where military scientists have cloned Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) along with the alien queen inside of her. They then proceed to breed the aliens until everything goes nuts and they escape. The plot....pretty much ends there. There's no real story in this film. Each of the others had strong, different stories being told throughout the mayhem and blood. This is purely a money-maker film. Flashy special effects and some pretty nice violent scenes simply cannot save the film from its failure to let you identify with even one character in the film. Since Ripley is a clone, her story has changed because she's no longer human. The filmmakers hope was that the sci-fi action and gore would be enough to carry the film for 2 hours. They were wrong. Its no fun seeing the aliens up-close all the time. There's no mystery to it, nothing to scare you. The essentially become another 'Jason' or 'Michael Myers'. But, for die-hard ""Alien"" fans, this film could be interesting simply if you want to see new stuff they can do with the Aliens in terms of special effects. Other than that, do what I did and consider "" Alien 3"" the ending of the story and completely forget this film exists. Kind of like ""Halloween: Resurrection""."
"pumpkinhead_lance","Null","0","1","10 February 2005"," Not the best of the series but still entertaining *** out of 5
","Alien Resurrection is an enjoyable entry all though it's the worst in the series. I think the action scenes (especially the underwater segment) are outstanding. Sigourney Weaver is terrific as usual. It's a neat twist on the Ellen Ripley character. Ron Perlman and Winona Ryder are terrific as well. But when you have a cloned Ripley making out with one of the aliens, you know that the series has gone one step too far. I'm kind of indifferent on this one, because the story about cloning and creating alien hybrids is kind of interesting and takes the franchise to a whole new level. Something COMPLETELY different. But at the same time, with such a story we see every slimy detail of the alien creatures, when this was something that was avoided in the previous entries. In the first three films we see the aliens just enough to whet our appetite until the final confrontation, which still keeps the aliens somewhat in the dark. I think it's a lot scarier that way. But in Alien Resurrection, we are invited to see Ripley tear out the inner mouth of an alien with her bare hand. There it limps like a fettuccine noodle, when I had always thought they were more metallic. I do like a little more subtlety, and I don't think this film believes in that. The special effects are outstanding, but do we really need to see the aliens SO much? I will say though, it is neat to see the aliens communicate and gang up on a third and slaughter it in order to make an escape by acid. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's direction is quite different from the previous directors' visions, but it's an interesting look. It's a good film, but it's not quite like the first three. But over the period of eight years since it's release, it's hard to imagine the alien series without this entry. Only after you've seen the others, see this one."

","ALIEN RESURRECTION <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br/><br/>Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS<br/><br/>200 years after events in ALIEN³ (1992), a clone of Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is created by scientists on board an intergalactic research vessel where she's forced to incubate a new generation of aliens. Naturally, they escape...<br/><br/>Against all the odds, ALIEN RESURRECTION is a popcorn triumph. The quirky humour evident in previous works by Gallic director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (DELICATESSEN, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, etc.) has been replaced by an American sensibility - Ripley's clone is much stronger than her 'regular' counterpart, which allows her to physically dominate an otherwise imposing cast of strong alpha males - but the film retains the director's unique visual sense (evident in the fantastic spaceship designs and muted colour scheme), and Joss Whedon's pacy script acknowledges previous entries in this particular franchise whilst adding its own distinctive layers to the mythos. As might be expected, the alien threat has been upgraded and expanded from previous entries, culminating in the emergence of a truly nightmarish (though oddly pathetic) creature during an extended climax which reworks a similar scenario from the original ALIEN (1979) before closing on a uniquely gruesome image of death and horror.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder takes second billing as a secretive young woman on a mission to prevent the aliens from making their way to Earth, while Michael Wincott (THE CROW), Ron Perlman (THE NAME OF THE ROSE) and beefcake Gary Dourdan (TV's ""C.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation"") provide excellent support as members of a pirate ship which docks at Ripley's research vessel shortly before chaos descends. Brad Dourif steals the show as a scientist with a hidden agenda (he shares a priceless 'personal' moment with one of the captive aliens when they pause to contemplate one another through a glass partition, one of the best scenes in the entire movie), and Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon makes his Hollywood debut as a disabled member of Wincott's crew whose wheelchair proves a hindrance during their headlong flight from the alien beasties. Mean, moody, but only slightly magnificent, the movie is sleek, engaging and fun. Followed by ""Abbott and Costello Meet the Alien""... er, I mean, AVP: ALIEN VS. PREDATOR (2004)."

I even like the story and the small twists such as that Mother has become Father and apparently you can confess to the mainframe.

"kingtanichi","Null","0","1","13 January 2004"," Crap
","WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>The most irritating thing is that the blame can't be heaped all on one person. Everyone involved in the making of Alien: Resurrection has made their own contribution to sinking the project. What's less irritating is that taken as a whole, the film cannot stand up to even the most lenient critical analysis, making a review less a challenge to one's analytical talents as an exercise in creative writing.<br/><br/>The film's plot is hamstrung by the same problem as its predecessor - namely that it cannot by conventional logic exist at all. It handles the problem just as deftly as Alien 3 - it provides an explanation that is blatantly impossible, but serviceable enough to launch the film. Where Alien 3 claimed that a face-hugger was somehow on the Sulaco's lifeboat, Alien: Resurrection has Ripley being cloned from a drop of blood 200 years later, bringing along both the alien embryo and her memories. Both films' scripts had the sense not to dwell on these and simply get on with the story they've opened up for themselves.<br/><br/>From here, it follows that the queen from Ripley has been put to work by the army laying eggs for the deliberate impregnation of some luckless human subjects. The resultant aliens will then tamed and used as the next generation of attack dogs. A six year-old fan fiction author could predict that the aliens will prove more belligerent that expected, get loose, and start killing.<br/><br/>The film's sole creative coup, however, is the treatment of Ripley. Apparently some of the alien's DNA has worked its way into her. This gives her some new traits like phenomenal tolerance for pain, a border-line sixth sense about the world around her, and of course, the old ultra-corrosive blood. There's also been some human spill over into the aliens.<br/><br/>It's an inescapable truth about film history that third sequels usually have the cards heavily stacked against them, both in terms of budget and creativity. Alien: Resurrection clearly does not suffer from the former, being budgeted at $70,000,000. Even the latter doesn't seem lacking at times. The basic premise is of course flawed, but adequate to get the movie going, and the film is definitely not squeamish about introducing new ideas. And this may be its chief stumbling block. The new scenario was sufficiently different that even a recitation of the formula would have worked decently. The first half of the film seems to be along these lines, and so if not great, it's at least watchable. But the second half veers too far into new territory, and leaves behind anything that was comfortingly familiar, dragging the film down to the point of being almost unwatchable.<br/><br/>Regarding the most important aspect of the film - the aliens - things are muddled. On the one hand, they have never had more screen time. Excellently digitally rendered, they have a fluidity of motion to them that evokes the Jurassic Park velociraptors (indeed, in one scene, a low-angle shot of their hip structure reveals them looking exactly like one of Spielberg's raptors). On the other hand, the digital trickery becomes painfully obvious at times, robbing the aliens of the physical menace they've had before. Also, they're slimier than ever. Their complexion was always rather greasy, but now they seem to drip and drool in never-ending streams all the time. It does have a certain visual appeal to it, but can also be distracting at times. Also, their trademark hisses and strange alien scrams are gone - replaced by a standard issue set of roars and growls. This is less appealing. Totally indefensible, however, is what's been done to their deadliness. In Aliens, James Cameron deflated the myth of the aliens being all-powerful and showed them to be perfectly mortal, but they were still very tough customers. Not so here, where the aliens' deaths are swift, perfunctory, and unmoving. And regarding the legendary reproductive system of the aliens, even this movie's chest-bursting scene is almost completely ineffective - an entire world removed from John Hurt's timeless demise in 1979. One of the film's most inexcusable crimes comes during a scene where the team has to swim through a flooded section of the ship. The flaw of the scene taking far longer than anyone could hold really hold their breathe is forgivable - it's one of the most common in the cinematic world. Even the ultra-clichéd victimizing of one disposable character doesn't draw too much ill will - it's too familiar. What cannot be forgiven, however, is the treatment of the aliens following them and attacking. It's exactly like Deep Blue Sea, right down to the way the aliens move - unconvincing streaks of CGI moving in sweeping arcs with far more speed than they could possibly generate. Ridley Scott's original was often called `Jaws in space.' It's as though all pretence has been abandoned, and we're back in the water.<br/><br/>This failure is built upon in the next scene, which surely must deserve an award for the compression of the most idiocy into the shortest stretch of screen time. An intriguing plot point about the aliens having set a trap on the other side is robbed of the tension it deserved, and resolved in one of the most unconvincing displays of movie physics ever. In an ensuing chase scene, an alien spits that a jet of that lethal acid that we've come to fear over the last three movies, and it gives its victim the mildest second-degree burn possible. And the alien is then killed with a single bullet to the head. The climax is even worse, taking a monumental decision for Ripley that ought to have been character-defining in the extreme, and instead giving nothing more than some disturbing gore, followed by another display of movie physics at their most blatant. We don't even see the aliens again for most of the third act.<br/><br/>Jean Pierre Jeunet obviously wanted to put his own personal stamp on this film, but in doing so he shows far too little respect for the franchise he's working with. Alien is now more in need of resurrection than ever."

","*major spoilers-mention of earlier alien installments*<br/><br/>I have recently watched this movie via the Quadrilogy Boxset and came away with some thoughts. I was amazed at the art departments well executed work. The influence Giger had on the team was obvious (as was on the first three films), however if one has looked at his (HR Giger's)art books in great detail you will see that they went two steps further into research. The interior sets although less foreboding because of poor lighting methods were excellent. The space ship designs were less than stellar save that of the ""Betty"" and some of the shots of the science ship were poorly executed. The other Ripley's especially the infant's really grabbed my attention in details of evolution of Ripley ""8"" (one of the better special effects).<br/><br/>The special effects (overall)were over the top, which really hurt the mood. I will state that i love gore, but with an alien movie i prefer less of the stuff because the movie depends so heavily on story and character development to bring the viewer into its world.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon penned this with a sense of parody, which really hurt the project from the start. The scripts use of one-liners is something that should of been toned down with a whole lot more serious dialogue. This isn't Buffy the vampire slayer, its Alien.<br/><br/>The action sequences worked well (I loved the bullet bounce). The cast as a whole were good and did their best with the script. Ripley's baby is both scary and sympathetic (it knew who it's true mother was and protected her only to be sacrificed). The vocalization as it was dying was heartbreaking (it's a newborn and wasn't evil much like Mary Shelly's Frankenstein creature). In the end the movie and series as a whole is formula and while not an entirely bad thing the calibre of the Director, Script writer and head Cinematographer is paramount. Ridley Scott, James Cameron and Finch (Alien 3 was under-rated) worked hard to make the film the best it could be under the circumstance(check out the director commentary's). The director of this installment simply didn't deliver the goods as promised and ironically is the fourth and least likeable of the films."

It has finally happened . After 200 years the unstoppable hostile beasts called aliens are resurrected . Lieutenant Ripley Ellen is long dead but the scientists found the secret to bring her back along with the alien queen embryo that she carried inside her . The greedy corporation Ripley worked for doesn't exist , but as long there is money and power hungry governments , somewhere , somehow , there will be someone who will fund an illegal program of bio-engineering in order to find the secret of the alien power . In this case the United Military Organization is behind this project although it is obvious that they are not even authorized by the Congress . They want to breed a new alien species to study them for purposes such as vaccines or alloys (but who are they kidding ? Inevitably the aliens will be exploited as a new super weapon) . The space base Auriga where the experiment is being conducted , is in orbit behind Pluto (naturally every illegal program takes place beyond the borders of the solar system) . The leader of Auriga is General Perez (Dan Hedaya) a rather mild mannered military officer who wants the project not to take a single risk . The scientists are led by Dr Wren (J.E. Freeman) and Dr Gediman (Brad Dourif) who are very enthusiastic about the potential of their task . They use frozen samples of Ripley 's blood in order to get the mixed human/alien D.N.A. and eventually clone Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) , resurrecting her and the alien fetus . The clone has not only the looks and physical shape of the deceased Ripley but unpredictably it has inherited all her memories and her psychological characteristics . There are also other side effects due to the genetic crossover and the clone shows some special features . The scientists isolate Ripley to study her later and focus on the Alien Queen which grows rapidly and incubates . In order to find some hosts for the face-huggers and the alien larvae , General Perez allies with a team of space smugglers led by Captain Elgyn (Michael Wincott) . They are black market merchandisers and in this case they supply Auriga with people they hijacked from other spaceships while they were on suspended animation . The unfortunate victims against their will are destined to be the first alien fodder . If you think the colonels are scumbags wait to hear where they get their financial sources : they cultivate vast quantities of cannabis ! This was an abandoned scene from the initial script and I thought it was best for you to know . Anyway , within a few days a bunch of aliens blossoms and everyone seems to be happy , but not for long .<br/><br/>Captain Elgyn lands on Auriga with his spaceship called `Betty' and they stay for a couple of days for refueling . Elgyn definitely is not aware of the classified project and just wants his fee . The rest of the Betty 's crew are Johner (Ron Perlman) a tough , foul mouthed and ugly sexist goon , Vriess (Dominique Pinon) a handicapped short man who is stuck in a wheel chair and is a mechanic with quite `long hands' , Hillard (Kim Flowers) an attractive woman who is Elgyn 's girlfriend and Christie (Gary Dourdan) a skilled and methodical shooter with rasta hair who is calm and seems to be the second in command . The recently added member is a short young girl named Call (Winona Ryder) who is a talented engineer and is the misfit of the group . Call has read the banned books written centuries ago by the convict Morse (another abandoned line) and is the only one who knows the legends about Ellen Ripley and the aliens . Ripley on the other hand is kind of a savage and autistic child in an uncomfortable environment . She hates the scientists for bringing her back to revive her worst nightmare . The inevitable occurs very soon as the aliens break loose and all hell with them too . The gory killings of the Auriga staff set everyone on alert . General Perez and the vessel 's central computer Father (he he) command the immediate evacuation of Auriga . Very soon all the remaining military members have left via the emergency exit vehicles , while the aliens have already formed a cocooned nest for their queen so she may reproduce more eggs . The space smugglers finally listen to Call 's warnings and head to the Betty . Unfortunately their spaceship is on the other side of Auriga . They form an uneasy alliance with Dr Wren and a soldier called Distephano (Raymond Cruz) who know the ship's design in order to get to the Betty fast and safely . They also take the cloned Ripley with them since her advanced knowledge on the species may be useful . The space shuttle is wrecked and under inner siege . Will their weapons help them survive ? See the movie and judge for yourselves .<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet gives great imagery to the 4th and last chapter of this immortal sci-fi / horror series . Art direction and the magnificent photography deliver one of the most imaginative science fiction films of the decade despite the overused concept . The plot is rather predictable as we all have seen everything recycled in previous films (like the ending) . The visionary director provides us a beautiful film and the script gives us one of the most successful aspects of cloning in cinema generally . Jeunet and Joss Whedon who wrote the script gave their own approach on the series . The movie relies heavily on blood , gore and violence although it is sometimes depicted in a twisted , black humored , cartoonish manner . This the `funniest' in a dark way chapter of the saga and there are a few moments which tend to self-parody . It doesn't matter at all . The message of the script is the obvious catastrophic impact of the cloning experiments that are bound to happen in the next years . The aliens are now visible more than ever in the screen and they spend a lot of time gutting soldiers in the most vicious way (splatter fans will find their favorite element and glee) . We have seen the stereotypes `Man cannot tame nature' and `Greed is always punished' in numerous films but Alien Resurrection pulls it off with utter success . The sanguinary beasts dispatch the naive humans who foolishly thought they could control them , in the most revengeful way . Yes there are numerous films which have dealt with cloning but never this successfully . From the 7 mistakes preceding Ripley to the final `rebirth' the side effects are clear as crystal : messing with the genes can only generate trouble and atrocious monstrosities . The former scene is the most tragic one of the movie and will truly be the one Alien Resurrection will be remembered for . It sums up the poetic vision that Jeunet tried to give us and it is a chilling dramatic scene about what we might all experience in the (not so) distant future . Weaver 's character includes some surprises and twists and this really helps because a series needs evolution in order to survive . This is the most intriguing aspect of the Alien quartet . Each part was directed , written , photographed etc. by different people and each one gave his addition in the mythology like for example the biology of the creatures.<br/><br/>
Alien Resurrection suffers from a great deal of problems which made the fans turn their back and despise it . Many of them thought that the film was way over the top and not terrorizing enough and lambasted Jeunet as improper for the job . As I already mentioned Alien Resurrection combines perfectly the dark shadows of a possible future with spoofing sequences and at the same moment grotesque images : the evacuation scene seems to be inspired by the respective one in Spaceballs ! Indeed some of the one - liners suck BADLY and almost turn the film to a typical Hollywood urban chauvinistic action flick  `Who do I have to f*** to get off this spaceship ?' . Others are smashing and pull your leg nicely `Hey , Ripley , I heard you like , run into these things before' `Yeah !' `Wow man : so , what did you do ? `  ` I died !!' . The profanity here has hit the ceiling but I think that there is some background to it and let us not forget that the leads are criminals or rough military members . The greatest problem is the newly introduced characters . Ripley 's transformation and the ethical dilemmas she faces are nicely executed . Weaver gives a standout performance and she may be a bit more cynical but after the odyssey she has endured it is quite logical . After all , her new capabilities and enhanced power breath a touch of fresh air . It would be dull and repetitive if she was the same character . Winona Ryder is also very good as the mysterious Call . The two of them share good chemistry and accomplish the best acting of the film. J.E. Freeman is solid as Dr Wren too . Unfortunately the rest of the leads stink badly . I don 't care if it was intentional but Ron Perlman's character is thoroughly dislikeable and unbearable . Dominique Pinon is not especially amiable either . It also puzzles me why did they bother casting Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif in virtually non existing roles . Just for the billing I guess . Both of them are literally wasted here and I am talking about less-than-cameo status . I have never heard of Michael Wincott and can 't see why he is so popular . His coarse voice makes him another repulsive character (probably he is the most chain-smoking person on earth) and he is also wasted . Characters worth caring for are Christie and Hillard . Kim Flowers is the only one who managed to insert humanity into her character , save Ms Ryder . Gary Dourdan has an underwritten role and too bad because he could have done much much more .  Raymond Cruz is the extra / lead (thought it could never happen in a movie ?) playing the soldier who serves as the guider of the gang and I won 't omit Leland Orser as Purvis , one of the abducted by the smugglers hostages for the aliens harvesting . All the aforementioned characters had great potential but their screen time is little and are never fully developed .Too bad that the main characters are a**holes like Johner or Vriess whom you don 't give a damn for . The worst aspect of the movie is the ending . The baby alien is stupid but what comes as a great disappointment is his showdown with Ripley . OK the scene can be interpreted as hilarious or tragic at the same time but what happens is totally unrealistic (I am talking about laws of physics). The finale is totally rushed and feels a bad cop out . Rumors claim that it was reshot at the last minute (originally the movie ended on Earth) and it shows. Apparently they didn 't have the time to support it with some decent SFX . Another little nitpicking I would like to add is that the music score could have been better and at many parts it feels out of place .<br/><br/>
Nevertheless I enjoy the film for many other reasons . The opening line is brilliant and it is quite obvious who Ripley refers to . Secondly , aside from Jeunet's inventive direction and the horrifying messages about cloning , the script finally answers a much debated subject . It is clear now that the aliens ARE intelligent creatures who know where to strike and can even outsmart humans . Another aborted line from the script stated that the aliens communicate with supersounds `just like bats' . The evacuation scene is also the most realistic one I have ever seen in a science fiction film , instead of waiting for the cast to be decimated and finally the 2 - 3 surviving leads go to the EEV , something they could have done right away . Here , when Father sets the distress mode , the soldiers INSTANTLY and without the slightest time waste abandon the vessel . The movie is actually plotless : the first hour is the introducing of the characters (although it is bare) and after the release of the aliens and the mass departure , the second hour is quite simply  and frankly , the course of the leads to the Betty . No intermediate battle scenes just for dwindling of the cast . The SFX are for the most part believable , like the acidic blood , the alien agile moves or the super weapons that the smugglers have . Ripley's bilateral nature makes her and the movie far more interesting than a typical sequel . The acclaimed European director uses astonishing cinematography and brilliant sets to join forces with a genuinely American genre such as science fiction . The combination of Jeunet's psychedelic imagery and ordinary futuristic themes (a la Star Wars , Star Trek etc) is achieved quite balanced and we have an artistic approach to the series.<br/><br/>
Alien Resurrection is certainly nowhere near as good as Aliens . It is quite good on its own merit and a decent 4th installment in the Alien universe . It is one of the best samples of sci-fi from the 90's and is bound to earn more recognition in the future . It was actually one of the most anticipated movies in history . Although some were disappointed , it is worth noting that everyone's favorite heroine lived again simply because an Alien film without Sigourney would have been a plain cash-in . The opening scenes with the cloning experiment is what everyone was eager for . This vertical glass tube with the reformed naked Ripley is already a distinct landmark . These sterilized labs with the subtle greenish lighting are uniquely conceived and the depiction is P-E-R-F-E-C-T . The entire film seems a nightmare transferred to the screen . Gross in some points with a wicked sense of irony and some parts that ignore common logic (like the cartoonish ricocheting of the bullets) . This is what Jeunet wanted and the execs did well hiring him . Alien Resurrection stands alone as a lyric vision of the fantastic intergalactic society that cinema tries to predict or warn us . It is not only for strict Alien fans but any casually interested movie fan should check this out . To put it in one word part 4 is one beautiful film . Witness the resurrection !<br/><br/>ALIEN RESURRECTION    8 / 10"

","What do you do when in the final sequel (Alien 3)commander Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver) is dead and you wanna make an other sequel? You just clone her, simple as that. The big thing is of course can Alien 4 give us something that hasn't been showed before. I think not... Alien 4 would have been a brilliant movie if the other three weren't around but now it's just a sort of rip-off from a rip-off. But still the movie works and not in the least because it's been directed by Jeunet (maker of Amelie Poulain) as some special effects (the one in where Ripley enters the lab) are superb and it's always nice to see Winona Ryder back as well. It's time they stop but Alien 4 can be added to the list though."

","Okay, I will admit that I am one of the most disturbingly Hardcore Alien fans on Earth. I spent an entire summer watching Aliens 2 to 4 times daily just to learn how to draw the damn things. And I like Alien 3.<br/><br/>But i had a hard time swallowing Resurrection. I love Ripley, we all do, but c'mon. Cloned? Grown up in a few weeks? Retaining Memory?!?!<br/><br/>Movies do require suspension of disbelief, but the other Alien movies did not require very much. The 2 originals were masterworks done by two people I believe to be geniuses. The third was done by another incredible talent (Fight Club is another favorite of mine and Se7en made me sick to my stomach, for all the right reasons). Resurrection...... I'll admit, ive never seen anything else this guy had directed. All I can assume is that he figured he was making a movie for an American audience, so he decided to make it nasty, gross and disgusting.<br/><br/>Do the others have their share of gross? You betcha. Did it drive the plot foward? For the most part, yeah.<br/><br/>But I can't eat through much of Resurrection. That friggin baby-thing at the end makes my skin crawl every time, and I have to put my drink down when it comes on the screen. It seems to be that in some director's hand-book it says ""When a creature bites down on a head, blood should spew forth like the mighty Old Faithful"". I never realised that death caused the blood vessels suddely gain the power of fire hoses, but here is the proof.<br/><br/>All the ""so-so"" parts aside (it is a pretty good movie, it just stinks for an alien movie), the only real gripe i have aginst this movie is the scene where Christie (Gary Dourdan) dies. It has always grated on me, because it was so completely unnecesarry. I never understood how acid-scarring and a high-dive into very deep water killed him. He was tough. It always struck me as the writers said ""Well, the black guy always dies in movies, so I guess we should kill him"". Irritating. Christie was one of the best characters in the movie.<br/><br/>I will mention that I miss the old Ripley. The new one is cool, but it's more ""Siguorney Weaver in another Alien Movie"" than good old Ellen Ripley. She has the same name, but is a different character entirely.<br/><br/>All complaints aside, i do like the movie, and was not at all let down that it was included in the Alien Legacy set. (which , of course, i have). The characters are a tad shallow, but still enjoyable. The references to the other movies reminded me of a Simpsons episode (that is a compliment from me). I like Ron Perlman, he's always welcome to any cast. Michael Wincott rocks. I've liked him since Robinhood: Prince of Thieves.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a creative, enjoyable sci-fi action movie. 6 out of 10"

Well, one of the great things about the Alien movies is that they were kind of intelligent. Interesting and scientific even. Pretty much throw that out the window here. Also, one thing that distinguished the other Alien movies from other ""Monster"" movies were strong supporting characters. You got to see them vulnerable and scared before the creature attacked. You actually cared about them. But here there is no supporting character development, they are just pieces of meat. Characters that the under-developed script writers drag along(characters that serve no purpose), just to kill them later. You can pretty much who will be next and when it will happen.

ALIENS had all the suspense of the first film, and added action to make it just as good as the first.  ALIEN 3 was not as good as the first two but had enough suspense and some good camera work to make it enjoyable.  ALIEN RESURRECTION seems to lack most of the things that made the first three films good.  Despite a couple of decent action scene's and a few likeable characters, most of the film was dull.  Ripley is not likeable at all in this one, since you dont know whether shes good or not. The script was pretty bad too, full of plot holes and bad dialogue.<br/><br/> ***SPOILER*** The worst part about this one was the retarted looking alien/human.

Ripley has superpowers and the suspense, which the other films had (a bunch of people with no superpowers, little ammunition, inferior weapons had to fight the aliens),all that is now all gone. With this Ripley, they can do everything now. I don't know which person wrote the script, but he should go back to school and start learning again. If you want the series to live on and want the next films to be in line with the other ones, this result is the worst you could have done.

It is a horror/action movie that has a lot of interesting ideas, but at the end, to the viewer's disappointment, fails to develop them into an interesting plot and a good movie.<br/><br/>Special effects, sound, music and the atmosphere are just perfect. Some problems appear with some minor detail, for example towards the end we see the spaceship Auriga passing by Jupiter with a speed that seems to be close to the speed our 20th century satellites use, but we are informed that in less than 40 minutes the ship will land on Earth. I don't remember exactly the distance between Earth and Jupiter but it has to be an hour of light more or less, which means that they used a speed close to the speed of light. Warp speed? Then why did they have to use cryosleep? Or another one where we see two Aliens attack a third one killing it so the acid they have for blood to make a hole through the floor and escape. Ten minutes later we see an Alien spit acid and the question is, if they can spit acid why did they have to kill one of their own?<br/><br/>Scenes with action or horror are well directed, but the good work ends here since the rest of the film fails to give anything more. It fails to talk about the special relationship developed between the Aliens and Ripley. As it fails to give life to the military and scientists aboard the vessel, they are just puppets waiting to die just to make a good action scene.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver as Ripley is below average, a disappointment for the heroin of the other three Alien, but it is to consider the difficulty of the part as the complete failure of the director of giving something more than action.<br/><br/>Average Winona Ryder as Call.

"davideo-1","8","0","1","19 October 2002"," The only place for the series to go.
","One of the great things about the 'Alien' series is that it has benefited from a staggeringly bizarre range of directors, each of who-- from Ridley Scott to James Cameron to David Fincher to Jean-Pierre Jeunet -- brings an almost totally different vision into the mythology. As mythology, the 'Alien' series has also always been more than just the sum of its parts--consider that famed fantasy/surrealist artist H. Geiger helped design the look for the original Alien and its hive, and you begin to get at the 'intangible' elements to the series; 'Alien' has always wanted to be that thing crawling straight out of our nightmares. The '79 and '86 films were stark, simple, and brutal, and the '92 film was brooding and disturbing (to say the least).<br/><br/>Well. The interesting thing is, the Alien meme doesn't belong to the mythology, but to whoever is creating it. David Fincher's directorial debut was Alien 3; his version of 'nightmare incarnate' seems pretty prudent when you consider his work in something like Fight Club. Why bring this up? I think that Jeunet is just about the most interesting directorial choice for this series, at this point. What, exactly, can we learn from the nightmares of the director of 'Amelie' and 'City of Lost Children'?<br/><br/>Simply, I think there is a lot more subtly and a lot more depth in this movie than people are giving it credit for. Many of the spiritual, religious, and human relationships are, in a way, very simple (as they are in Amelie or C.O.L.C.), but they cross-over in some wonderfully complex ways. This is the *only* movie in the 'Alien' series to truly recognize how much the 'Alien' phenomenon comes from our own heads, our own dreams & nightmares . . . the direction of the Alien series is inwards, and this is further 'in' than any of the previous films. The cinematography is appropriately wonderful, too-- fans of the series & genre itself are already spoiled on mood lighting and tension-riddled close-quarters shots, but these things are expressed with all of Jeunet's tremendous gift for mise-en-scene. Ryder is great, and of course so is Weaver; she may be tired of playing Ripley by this point but she has brought to ""Resurrection"" a curious maternal passion for Ellen Ripley, who by this point must be pretty damn sick of being chased through air ducts.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a beautifully realized vision; it is even, in some strange ways, a comic treatise as well, while still keeping that requisite 'Alien' creepiness. The last scene in the movie is, of course, horrific and even horrible, but even that has its grotesque place within the nightmare vision. Oh - and a fun factoid: Sigourney Weaver actually made that over-the-shoulder basketball shot-on the first try.<br/><br/>In the end, consider something dear old Nietzsche said (perhaps in anticipation of this series, eh?): ""If you stare long enough into the abyss, the abyss stares back."" Indeed."
"ParanoidAndroidMarvin","Null","0","1","23 September 2002"," Resurrection: In Retrospect
","After its release in 1997, 'Alien Resurrection' has become the victim of harsh criticism.  The harshest comments often come from fans of the series-the same people one would expect to seek out the positive elements in the film.<br/><br/>Much of the blame has fallen-unjustly-on the shoulders of Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  However, I must agree with those who fault Joss Whedon, who wrote the movie.  While his style of writing might lend itself well to his 'Buffy' franchise, it is somewhat a misfit in our Alien environment.<br/><br/>As for those who voiced annoyance with the acting, specifically Winona Ryder's Annalee Call, all I can say is 'sorry'.  Personally I enjoyed her character the most.  Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley.  The fact that this incarnation of Ripley isn't Ellen Ripley at all is where a lot of the criticism stems from.  I agree, this is not the Ripley of Aliens past, but I can appreciate the light hearted comments of one fan- `Well, at least she's got hair this time.' Bringing back Ripley as a human/alien clone was simply a big risk that didn't pay off.  The supporting characters, like the movie, are enjoyed by some and hated by others.  I enjoy them, although I'll be the first to admit they're a far cry from the supporting characters of Aliens, the tough, callous and humorous Colonial Marines.<br/><br/>Another large complaint was centred around the fact that the Aliens were over exposed, and this diminished their frightening aspect.  I don't believe that the Alien has been scary since the first movie.  In 'Aliens' the beasts receive much exposure, many of them being little more than fodder for the Marines. 'Alien 3' presents us with a lone monster, as the first, but by this time we're familiar with the Xenomorph anyway.  Are we not all familiar with the alien?  Its form has ascended into the sci-fi lexicon, a god among movie monsters.  To claim that Jeunet has taken away from the horror of the creature by exposing it is absurd: There is nothing left to expose. Furthermore, the films attempt to create a new horrible creature-the alien/human hybrid -left most fans largely unimpressed.  This tells us that they have come to the film with unrealistic demands: to be horrified by a creature that was terrible decades ago, but has been made harmless by years of mainstream exposure in the form of video games, action figures, novels, comics books and parodies.<br/><br/>'Alien' is a classic of suspense.  'Aliens' is Cameron at his best: loud, flashy, unforgettable.  'Alien 3' is a respectable effort to keep the series firmly grounded in reality-after all, the sequel to 'Aliens' could have easily attempted to be louder, faster and flashier, resulting in a battle of absurd proportions between Human and Alien.  This is a fact overlooked by most fans, although, over time, David Fincher's vision is being accepted on a wider scale.  Where to go from here?  Fox decided Joss Whedon could write the story, after all, he was he was the man behind the success of televisions 'Buffy'.  Working from this script is Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who crafts a film as visually pleasing as the others in the series.  This, I feel, can not be denied.  While I am forced to agree with certain grievances that many fans have, I hardly feel that the film deserves the reaction it has received.  Fans should be pleased that every film in the series has been a theatrical release, and has not degenerated into the direct-to video market, as many sci-fi franchises do.<br/><br/>What does the future hold for the Aliens series? Time will tell. Whatever happens, I feel that it must include Ripley, however that need not mean Siggy Weaver.  Personally, I think Hillary Swank would make an excellent Ellen Ripley.  Hopefully the series will solidify it's reign at the top of sci-fi horror, and continue to make us scream into the vacuum of space with terror and delight."

This movie left me with the same feelings as Attack of the Clones, a really great series shot to hell.<br/><br/>I agree with some other posters, that we feel no compassion for Ripley any more and she just becomes this stupid cyborg type creature. Also, Wynonna Rider is awfull as the android, who was the casting genius who came up with this? Ron Perlman's character is stupid, boring and a ripoff of every ""hard-ass"" wise cracking tough guy in every movie ever, only done really poorly.<br/><br/>Also, the ending is very stupid, somehow I doubt that a huge creature of flesh and bone with be sucked out through a tiny hole in the hull. I know the vacuum suction in space is strong, but is it that strong? Somehow I doubt it.<br/><br/>Of course, the absolute worst thing about this movie, the scene that made me so mad I wanted to pull out my own teeth, was the scene where Ripley finds all the ""mistakes"" of her cloning. This was actually a very powerfull scene, extremely disturbing and an effective comment on genetic cloning. Yet after we see all this awfull, frightening footage, Ron Perlman's character comes in with his ""Must be a chick thing"" line that made me so frickin angry!

"Fyarl","Null","0","1","7 June 2002"," I don't use the word ""Crap-tacular"" very often...
","but Alien:Resurrection was crap-tacular. Crap-tastic, even. This is a great example of the ""ruin it with pointless sequels"" theory. The first two Alien films are brilliant. They are truly scary, feature great characters portrayed by great actors in a well thought out, well executed story. The third one began to slide towards silly, but Resurrection was down right slap in the face to all who loved the series. First problem: Sigourney Weaver. While the name of the character is Ripley, lets face it, that ain't Ellen Ripley. She has none of the insurmountable determination coupled with sickening compassion that she featured in the fist three installments. Instead, she is some sly, ultra tough comic-book villain in a lead role. Second problem: too much pointless gore. The scene where Dan Hedaya reaches around and pulls a piece of brain out of his open skull was waaaay over the top. I mean, the chest busting scenes of the first few were shocking, and that set the tone for the shocks to follow, but the brain scene was simply gratuitous. Another scene is where the science experiment guy is about to have a chest buster emerge from himself. What does he do? Runs around like a circus clown until he can grab a bad guy from behind, and has the chest buster exit him, and enter the back of the bad guy, essentially, taking the bad guy with him. Stupidest death ever. Third thing wrong with the film: The director is taking a hard advantage of the fact that everyone knows what the alien looks like. Take a look at the aliens of the first three movies. We never really get a good hard look at them before they leap out of the shot or the camera cuts away. That helps create the suspense of ""Oh my god, what is that thing??"". But when you get a full body shot of the aliens over a period of 15-30 seconds, suddenly, they just don't seen very scary anymore. Final thing wrong: the whole stupid plot. While I did find certain scenes to be interesting, a few scenes can't save a stupid movie. Why was it set in an even more distant future? Wasn't the distant future of the first three distant enough? Obviously not. What happened to all those intriguing characters at the end of the third movie? The lone surviving prisoner, the Bishop creator? Those were great characters, and the possibility of a further conspiracy through ""the company"" was completely ignored. And of course Winona Rider as the hidden android. She was a subtle a a baseball bat to the face. Terrible casting there. Overall, I highly recommend the first two, see the third movie if you are curious, but I can only recommend Resurrection if you want to see how Hollywood can poop all over a great series."

This film is a continuation, and none of the other films are the same anyway. The plot involves a military ship that clones Ripley from blood samples, but in doing so she becomes part alien.

The amazing cast - Sigourney Weaver as the cold, angry Ripley; Winona Ryder as the not-so-innocent Annalee; Dominique Pinon as the sly Vriess; and Ron Perlman ( also from The City of Lost Children ) as the masochistic, mean Johner. All these actors provide amazing performances, that really bolster the movie.<br/><br/>Almost everything about this movie, the directing, special effects, and acting, were excellent.  The only major flaw is the dialogue.  It was CRAP.

No, you'd be lounging around with a joint reading a comic book, so don't complain about 'Alien Resurrection'. It's only an hour of my life I won't get back. Some people do get their life back however, like Ripley for instance. Goodness, she's in need of a trip to the hair salon. Perhaps she went and displeased with the results, burned the stylist's hands off. Her attempts to be a bad girl are embarrassing. The director has a vision. Hire as many actors as possible that will frighten the aliens with their looks. I thought it was supposed to be the reverse. Poor Ron Perlman, a talented actor, is called in to play a grotesque again. But the casting director has screwed up and there is someone fanciable in the mix. So he quickly disappears screaming into a hole and the natural order is restored. But come on, I hear you say, what about Winona Ryder, is she not fragrant? Yes, but she is rendered ugly by profane dialogue which always smacks of desperation. Surprisingly, Buffy maestro Joss Whedon is the culprit. With her pixie face and big eyes looking up at you, Ryder invokes the memory of Bambi, although you wouldn't put up with this from Uncle Walt. ""Hey, Thumper, some **** just shot my mummy."" - ""Now, Bambi, if you can't say anything nice...."" No, the F-word is not for Winona, just marshmellows. The cast have big guns and spin around 180 degrees hamming wildly but cannot disguise the lack of story. These are desperate times for actors. Brad Dorif hangs by his finger nails on the outside of the Hollywood lifeboat. Yes, I am old but I have a pony tail, please let me on board. I can do sinister. I can do dead. Please! Oh, alright then. I've never understood the word 'franchise' in respect to film, I associate it with burgers. The budgets plummet. One scene in a space ship cockpit (are they called cockpits?) Seems to have what looks like a painted backdrop outside the window. Look closer and there are probably five sharp edges on the stars and a half moon with a cow jumping over it. Tacky stuff. The plot is confusing. They hired a european director. They hired a French director.

So she is cloned, but only the eighth copyÂ…works. All of the others crashed, like computers, and look way gross. She has partial memories of her past, has superhuman strength, has acid for blood (cool) and is connected to the creatures in a weird way.<br/><br/>The mad doctors want more hosts for the aliens so they can breed them and train them for Biological Warfare. The space pirates bring a cargo full of frozen prisoners to them for that reason and bring with them Call, an android, who takes a large interest in Ripley. It was inevitable that the aliens would break loose and when they do, all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>
This time round the Aliens seem cooler and smarter, unlike in Aliens when they were just there as a reason for gunfire, they can talk to each other and can figure out how doors and buttons work. Although they are mostly CGI, they still look scary and the swimming sequence in the flooded dinnerhall is cool to the max.<br/><br/>Many critics disliked the ending immensely, but I think that the beautiful sunset over earth infinitely better than the ending in Alien 3.

","As I am not a fan of suspense (My favorite Hitchcock movies are 'Lifeboat' and 'Rear Window', his movies with the best dialogue) I didn't find ALIEN the best movie I'd ever seen, but certainly the best MONSTER I had ever seen (slo-moed those brain snatching scenes to death). ALIENS added more creatures, action-adventure, Paul Reiser as an excellent badguy, a really annoyingly whiney Bill Paxton, and the last 20 minutes as possibly the most interesting, intense, monsteralated, and female (if not non-gender specific) heroine confrontational scene/climax of all time (or at least since IT CONQUERED THE WORLD......That's a joke, by the way....I mean the IT CONQUERED THE WORLD part)...I still can't believe they cut out the Ripley's daughter scene or the machine-gun slaughtering of the Aliens. ALIENS 3, I believe, is the best acted movie, and I love the idea of no firearms. But after reading IMDb's scenes that were deleted, a great movie was turned into a good movie. Which brings us to ALIEN:RESURRECTION, possibly my favorite movie. First, Ripley is no victim, at any point, during this movie. There may have never been a more powerful, yet sympathetic hero/ine, in movie history. She is one step ahead of/behind all the other characters. Speaking of which, all the other characters are played to peak performances, not to slight anyone, but I thought perfectly played by Dan Hedaya, Leland Orser, Michael Winscott, and really, all other performers, including Winona Ryder (""Okay, she's a toaster oven. Can we go now?""). Best Dialogue and characters in all 4 movies. Without a doubt, best views of the Aliens (and Alien:the next generation). In your face effects. Brad Dourif excellent also. But main strength of movie is power of Ripley, Eight. Absolutely, hands down, the hero of this movie. Only thing from rest of ALIEN series that can touch it is last 20 minutes of ALIENS.

","Alien: Resurrection is a real head scratcher of a film.  Each Alien film represents a different style of filmmaking.  Alien was a good representation of 70's style films.  Kinda slow, almost boring, but none the less jarring when it needed to be.  Aliens is the primo example of 80's action films. It's about the best of all action films from the 80's.  The underrated Alien 3 makes a case for taking established series down very dark and painful paths.  It's plays out like a big budget independent film.  Alien: Resurrection on the other hand comes across like some trashy European horror film.  It's not necessarily a bad film it just chooses to follow the road even less taken.  Its gory from beginning to end and one has to question the validity of the film after Alien 3.  I suppose the biggest drawback is that the film feels incomplete.  The feeling of pointlessness you get at the end doesn't go away.  It would like to lead into a new storyline as its ending is all geared up for Alien 5, but as both 3 and 4 were marginal failures, it'll never happen. That trashy European horror film feel is obviously due to the direction of Jeunet.  I guess this can be interpreted as Alien in the hands of a Frenchman.  He works out all kinds of loopy visuals to help along the saggy story.  In the long run this film is more for genre fans only.  No mass audience could ever accept it widely as was proven upon its initial release.<br/><br/>It's sort of depressing to see the Alien franchise end like this.  I felt Alien 3 brought everything to a fine conclusion.  Now the ball has been sent rolling again only with nowhere to go."

","""Alien: Resurrection"" is the last (so far) of the ""Alien"" series started in 1979. It breaks new ground with new characters and a new Ellen Ripley. 200 years after she killed herself on Fiorina 161, the United Systems Military has acquired her blood samples and cloned her in order to get the alien queen she was carrying at the time of her death. They use the queen to lay her eggs and the crew of the ""Betty"" brings in a shipment of people cryogenically frozen to use for the facehuggers. The aliens are born but soon all hell breaks loose and they break loose. Ripley, who is now a half human/half alien because of the DNA mix of the cloning, teams up with the crew of the ""Betty"" in order to stop the aliens before they head to Earth. The film is an improvement over ""Alien 3"" but still doesn't deliver the punch that we got from the first two films. There is action in this however, including a great underwater scene and the gore in here is plentiful (this is by far the goriest entry in the series). The characters aren't that well developed, all except for Ripley, who is sarcastic and developed a Groucho Marx-like one-liner syndrome. Also added is this hideous newborn creature that thinks Ripley is it's momma or something like that."
"Eviljomr","Null","0","1","13 December 1999"," Mediocre script saved by great visuals
","1997 was a really good year if you wanted to see sci-fi movies by non-American directors (the directors of this film and The Fifth Element are French, the director of Starship Troopers is Dutch (but lives in the US), the director of Mimic is Mexican).  It's interesting to see the sensibility brought to the films by these directors.  I think it's really interesting to see the style of Jean Pierre Jeunet, director (with Marc Caro) of Delicatessen and City of Lost Children, both visual wonders and among the best films of the 90s (up against some stiff competition); applied to an Alien film.  I think it's interesting how  all the Alien films have different directors, and the series is kind of like that game children play where one writes the beginning of a story, and another writes the next part, and so on.  Of course, a lot of series fans don't like this, and were upset by the unfairly maligned Alien 3 after the slam-bang actioner Aliens.<br/><br/>In a lesser director's hands, Alien: Resurrection would probably be the worst of the Alien films to date.  The rather hackneyed script by Joss Whedon doesn't help anything.  What saves the film is the remarkable visual style of Jean Pierre-Jeunet, along with the photography of Darius Khondji, one of the best cinematographers working today.  Some of the action scenes are good too, like the long underwater sequence (I think underwater scenes are a Jeunet and Caro trademark).  John Frizell's score is serviceable, but far from the eerie Jerry Goldsmith score for the original film by Ridley Scott.  I would've liked it if Angelo Badalamenti had been retained from City of Lost Children.<br/><br/>I think the film has a very French, avant-garde style to it, much like HR Giger's designs (Giger is Swiss, I know); and has has a similar Gothic feeling to David Fincher's Alien 3.  The script and some of the performances (like those of Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif [not that I don't like them]) lend the film a slight tone of camp, which feels a little incongrous with Jeunet's direction.  Sigourney Weaver is good as usual, and I enjoyed seeing Dominique Pinion, from Delicatessen and City of Lost Children (his line ""who were you expecting, Santa Claus?"" is from City, although it was Miette who said it, not him); I probably would've cast someone other than Winona Ryder in the role of Call, though. Even though this is the first Alien film with a European director, the series has had a European connection from the first film, with Giger's designs, and much of the first half of the film being inspired by Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires.  I think if Dario Argento directed an Alien film (that would go against the pattern of the Alien films being helmed by fairly new directors), it might be a little like this one.<br/><br/>Another complaint I have is that the screenwriter doesn't really explore the possibilities of the technology that must have developed during the 200 years between Alien 3 and this film.  I know it makes for an interesting horror film concept, but why did they have to kidnap people in hypersleep to infect with the aliens?  You'd think they'd be able to clone humans by then or do something else.<br/><br/>I think Jeunet was a really interesting choice of director for this film. I nominate the Wachowski brothers to direct Alien 5 (with Bill Pope as DP, of course).  This film certainly isn't as good as Ridley Scott's classic Alien, but still a worthwhile entry into the series."
"nick L","10","0","1","24 November 1999"," A flawed, fascinating and distinctly Freudian monster movie.
","I have to admit that this really is not the film that I had anticipated for so many months leading up to the release. Viewing some snapshots on the web page, I could almost feel that Gallic style that had oozed out of Jeunet's City of the Lost Children in this, the fourth of the Alien franchise. Yet, Alien Resurrection manages to be the most unremarkable of a series of films that has virtually defined the modern sci-fi action film. And while it may not be as frustratingly hamstrung as Alien3 was (which I actually thought was far better than people gave it credit for), Alien 4 has little of the action, suspense, tragedy, plot and unique style that the three previous films gave us. Perhaps that's just a bit too harsh, but for a film with such high production values and from such a diverse series of films, I don't think it's fair for the audience to have to put up with such an anti-climax (although scribe Joss Whedon, has said that this film is merely a prologue to the planned fifth film, which he will now script).<br/><br/>For those of you that opted not to see Alien3, at the end Ripley chose to sacrifice herself so that the alien inside her would never be born. 200 years on, however, scientists on the USS Auriga have been attempting to clone Ripley so that they can get at the Alien Queen she was carrying when she died. Ripley's gene pool has been mixed with that of the Alien's, meaning that she is now a sadistic schizophrenic with superhuman strength and acid for blood. However, the scientists keeping Ripley overestimate the power of a glass box and (Surprise, Surprise) the aliens break out, causing the inevitable mayhem and frantic running around corridors. The band of likeable but morally cloudy alien fodder (re - the nostromo crew of Alien, the marines in Aliens, and the er... murderers and rapists of Alien3) are this time provided by the crew of the Buffy, sorry I mean Betty, the pirate ship which delivered the bodies needed to incubate the alien embryos. Jeunet regulars Perlman and Pinon make up part of the crew, while Winona Ryder is call, the ships engineer. A slight problem occurs when the survivors realise that the ship is heading straight for earth, finally allowing the Aliens the buffet meal they surely deserve for turning up in space uninvited so many times. Along the way, the Betty crew must weed out the traitor in their group and a confused Ripley must decide where her destiny lies.<br/><br/>Writer Joss Whedon really has tried to make as good an action movie as he possibly can (and he can make good ones ... Speed). That's fine for a Die Hard movie , but it sure as hell is not what is wanted in an alien movie. Jeunets freaky French style is similarly unsuitable, due to being overly stylistic (which, again can work well in the right movies as his previous features have shown us) and never gels properly with Whedons script. However, the most excruciating aspect if the entire film has to be the way that so many elements are interchangeable with previous Alien films, notably Aliens. For example, the crew of the Betty, with their sexism and gung-ho attitude are bad copies of the marines in Aliens, with Perlman's Johner particularly similar to Bill Paxton's Hudson. Also, Ryders sole purpose in the movie seems to be to act as Weavers foil and someone who can outfox the males of the movie, in true newt style. But while Newt was endearing, touching and yet remarkably unnauseating, Ryder seems lost and dizzy for the entire movie.<br/><br/>But it's not all bad news. Weaver gives possibly her most varied and difficult interpretation of Ripley yet, proving that she is one of the worlds most underrated actresses and making Ripley by far the most complex character ever to have appeared in a series of sci-fi films. And if this is the prologue to a more eventful fifth film, this could work better in context (a La Alien3). There are also some gruesome and highly inventive death scenes and the design and FX of the film are stunning . The highlight of the film has to be the truly suspenseful and original underwater chase, closely followed by a dark and tragic scene in which Ripley discovers the not so successful Ripley clones, with one agonisingly alive. The scene allows Weaver to shine fully and I was stunned after seeing that scene for the first time. Overall, the film is a very mixed bag indeed, with some good ideas, underutilised ideas, brilliant ideas and just plain stupid ideas."

","Now, this film might be better than the others I've deemed with ones, but it just had so much HISTORY behind it, y'know?  They tried ""resurrecting"" a series that had maybe not ended on a good note, but was one of my favorites growing up.  With this new version they add comedy (a la Gremlins 2), and a very weak plot to bring back Sigourney Weaver.  It was very disappointing, and it tore down the Alien legacy with it, deserving the 1."
