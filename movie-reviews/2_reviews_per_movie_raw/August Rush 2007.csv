"bobinpr","10","212","244","9 December 2007"," ""August Rush"" touched something buried deep inside my soul seventy six years ago.
","This movie ""August Rush"" really touched my soul. I was an orphan and identified with this child's yearning and searching for his parents. Near the end of the movie, I started to cry like a baby. ""August Rush"" touched something tender buried deep inside my soul seventy-six years ago.<br/><br/>My father was killed in a car accident three days before I would have celebrated my third birthday. My father was also Irish and looked a lot like August Rush's father. It was during the Great Depression and my mother gave me up to the county's foster care agency.<br/><br/>I am now seventy-nine years of age. How I yearned down through the years for my parents, especially my Irish father. My mother was French. I met her many years later in New York City when I was in my early twenties. She was cold and rejecting towards me. I could not understand why. I was abandoned a second time by one of my parents.<br/><br/>The movie ""August Rush"" was healing to my soul wounded since early childhood;and again, in my early twenties. I knew where he was coming from as he longed for his parents. Instead of music, I used my talent of writing to deal with the lost of my parents.<br/><br/>""August Rush"" made me fantasize during the movie that my yearning and searching for my parents were like this remarkable child."
"gailalong-1","9","253","310","18 October 2007"," This modern Oliver-style plot has some of the best music around! The ""artsy"" approach is often mesmerizing, and will hold your interest from beginning to end.
","I totally enjoyed this movie. The scenes have an appealing fantasy element, while at the same time, the plot manages to explore true-to-life human situations such as bullying of those who are different.<br/><br/>The music is incredible, and mostly consists of original scores. It includes gospel, rock and classical, seamlessly integrated in a new way that works extremely well.<br/><br/>The plot is somewhat predictable and possibly a little ""sappy"", but those elements are easily overcome by the moment-to-moment execution of the story. Think of a modernized ""Oliver"" with Robin Williams as Fagin to a group of homeless, musically talented kids...plus extra elements of romance and intrigue, and you will have a bit of an idea about this movie.<br/><br/>The three main characters are all physically ""beautiful"" people who manage to convey the story with a minimum of dialog. Additional characters, including Terrence Howard as the social worker, Jamia Simone Nash as the young girl in the church choir, and Leon G. Thomas as the young boy who befriends the musical prodigy, contribute strong performances and pizazz.<br/><br/>Someone sitting near me stated it is impossible for even a prodigy to learn music so quickly and at such a young age... However, this is not true. Check out Jay Greenberg, a young music student currently studying at Julliard. In the end, this movie is at least an endorsement and celebration of the significance of music in our lives and at most a transcendent, fun experience to watch.<br/><br/>I rarely like to see any movie more than once, but definitely want to see this again. Take the familythis is for children, teens and adults. Don't miss it is my recommendation!"

","This is an urban fairy tale. If you go to AUGUST RUSH with the intention of poking holes in it, you can find little glitches and logic flaws. On the other hand, if you are looking for a movie that will sing to your soul (and show you some beautiful eye candy as a bonus), look no farther. The casting director and cinematographer should each get an award. This gem of a movie takes us on a journey, and the people we meet along the way are well worth the ticket price. <br/><br/>A trio of beautiful performances form the heart of this film, although the secondary characters are also crisply compelling. A day after seeing it, I find that specific shots of their faces still glow in mind like pieces of a mosaic. And the music is a genuine addition, as it should be in a film of this kind. I was genuinely moved."

","If you love it, you'll LOVE it. If not, then the most you'll probably give it is an 'ok'. The movie requires the audience to have a somewhat willful suspension of reality as there are some slightly mystic themes interwoven in the storyline. But as the movie is basically centered on the power of music, the mystic elements make sense. It's completely about belief and faith in the intangible.<br/><br/>Personally, I loved the story. And the music was amazing. I had goosebumps throughout the entire movie. In fact, there was probably so much emphasis on the music that there was less character development than a lot of people would like. I liked this element of the movie, though, as it requires you to read between the lines. Not even the ending is handed to you nicely wrapped and on a platter. There's no wrap-up dialogue or epilogue sequence, just the audience's own inferences. Hence, if you don't have an imagination, you should stay home."

","""August Rush"" is sort of a feel good, modern day fairy tale involving a parent/child separation and a boy's unrelenting search to be reunited with his parents. But the primary theme is Music as a healing force in the Universe that draws us all together. The film stars Freddie Highmore, as the orphaned musical prodigy; Keri Russell, as the sheltered cellist from Juliard; Jonathan Rhys Meyers, as the Irish singer/songwriter/guitarist; Robin Williams as Wizard, the street performer who takes August under his wing; and Terrence Howard as the social worker who works with the orphan boy and his mother.<br/><br/>The acting was superb. There's not much dialogue in this movie. So the majority of the story is told through the emotional expressions of the actors and via the music. Although, Robin Williams does have a great monologue where he talks about Music being the tie that binds all of us together. Freddie Highmore (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) is the cream of the crop as far as child actors go. He amazed me in this film. I can't wait to see more from him.<br/><br/>""August Rush"" was perfectly directed and co-written by Kristen Sheridan (In Amercia). It is so wonderful to see a work like this from a female film maker for a change. Beautiful cinematography! The opening scene in the wheat field is just breathtaking. The score is fabulous. Let's face it, in a movie like this, you've got to have great music to pull it off.<br/><br/>There are some exceptional musical performances, especially from relative newcomers, Jamia Simone Nash who sings up a storm and Leon Thomas who croons and plays guitar. But the most impressive thing about this movie is that all of the actors really played these instruments themselves. Meyers did his own singing as well. Highmore plays the guitar in an unusual slap-harmonics style that reminded me of Michael Hedges.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""August Rush"" so much. I haven't been moved to tears like this by a film in a long time. The story was very inspiring and the boy's unyielding faith and will to never give up on his dream to find his family really hit me. Kudos to the writers and director for ending the film the way they did. Instead of a sappy reunion scene that would've ruined the tone of the movie, they ended it beautifully with the crescendo of the music and just the close-up on August as he sees his parents standing there for the first time. Add August Rush to your must see list for the holidays. It is well worth the price of a ticket on to see it on the big screen."
"nannmeroo","10","227","304","19 November 2007"," Wow
","This is a fantastic movie. Well done. During our screening at a particularly tough part for the title character, I heard people in the theater say ""No, no..."" The level of ""buy in"" and suspension of disbelief is high. <br/><br/>Even the dissonance of Wizard and Lila's father was handled superbly. Robin Williams hit just the right note in his portrayal of Wizard. The actors playing Agust Rush/Evan Taylor and his mother and father were amazingly well cast. <br/><br/>This is truly a symphony of a film. You'll enjoy it, your children will enjoy it, and you will walk out of the theater knowing that, for once, your ticket money was well spent."
"Arkladybug","9","131","173","18 November 2007"," Wonderful movie
","I never comment on movies here, usually I just use this website to get an idea of what I am about to watch but I saw this movie last night and loved it. <br/><br/>This movie is a fairytale set in real life circumstances. I really like that the film was never advertised as an Oliver Twist take, but I loved all of the allusions to it. It was a very creative take on the classic story. The poor orphan boy who wants nothing more than to be loved.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of the movie was how infused music actually was in the movie. I am a musician and I liked the touches that the filmmakers went into to make the film seem as credible as a fairytale can be. I also like how it brought together modern rock, classic symphonic music, and modern symphonic music. It didn't really glamorize the life's of everyday musicians. I like all of the extra little things that were thrown into the movie that only a musician would get. There were some errors but for the most part I applaud the film makers for the attention to the musical details.<br/><br/>Yes the movie was a bit bit corny, and a little over the top, but for the most part I loved it and suggested it to every one."
"marsbeyond","10","127","172","18 November 2007"," a triumph of love, spirit, and imagination thru the art of music!
","I saw a sneak preview tonight, not knowing anything about this film. If you still have an inner child, and an imagination that has not been beaten out of you by the ""practical and mature"" world, then you will love this movie. I wish I had taken my daughter. The only people that I have seen complain about this movie are people that probably consider playing music ""hard work and self-sacrifice"". If you don't play the cello, you are not going to notice how bad she fakes it. During certain scenes, I found myself sitting way back in my recliner, with my eyes closed, soaking up the sounds that inspired this young man. Not since ""Strictly Ballroom"" have I been so moved by a film."
"GearMaven","10","125","175","30 October 2007"," Loved this Movie! Must see for lovers of happy endings and music!
","I absolutely loved this movie during the free screening in San Francisco this evening. At its end, the film received claps, cheers and shouts of approval by the majority of the audience. The child actors were terrific, especially Freddie Highmore whose facial expressions alone carried more emotion than any screenwriter's words could. The music was amazing...the guitar work, incredible singing by young Leon G. Thomas III, and the gospel singers (especially Jamia Simone Nash). The blending of classical, rock and street-sounds music was phenomenal. The movie was funny, poignant and a tear jerker. Heck with realism...I'm more than ready for a little bit of magic in my entertainment these days! Great film for families with teenage children. Younger ones might be a bit frightened by, as someone else said, the Fagan-like character played by Robin Williams and the intro bullying. So this may be a film to rent on DVD to show the younger ones so parents can discuss scenes with them or provide parental oversight for your particular child. But no bad language, no visible sex scenes (although we do know it occurred), and overall a delightful film. I rarely if ever buy DVDs except for old classics but this will be one of the exceptions. Also, the soundtrack should be terrific. When can I see this again?"
"the_Poppuns","9","66","89","24 November 2007"," Better than expected
","Firstly, being a fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers I had been hearing about this project for a while and I couldn't figure out how they'd make sense out of it. It does end up making sense even if it's a little far-fetched. It's about a son and his parents who all have to find each other, but my problem was that I couldn't figure out a way they could have gotten so separated in the first place. But luckily the writers did. It's pretty sappy and sentimental but if you're not that kind of person, I can't imagine you'd be interested in something like this anyway. It's the type of story that always comes out around this time of year, which is also the most sentimental time of the year. It gives you warm fuzzies so if you like something like 'Mr. Holland's Opus' or 'About a Boy' or 'Love Actually' you'd more than likely enjoy it.<br/><br/>I don't know if this qualifies as a musical but it should. It had lots of music in it although people didn't burst into fits of singing dialogue. The songs were normal songs, mostly original, and they were great. The young people involved were very talented, especially Jamia Simone Nash and Leon G. Thomas. Robin Willams and Terrence Howard had smaller supporting roles. (I've been saying that Williams and Bono resemble each other for 20 years so I'm glad he put the hat on and finally proved me right.) JRM and Keri Russell are co-stars who do their jobs well. But the star of the movie is Freddie Highmore. He's a good actor and I believe this was the first thing I've seen him in. I wouldn't be surprised to see him nominated for this.<br/><br/>I actually think this movie would be good for kids. I think there is maybe one bad word in it and maybe the way he came into the world might bother the extreme conservatives. But it's uplifting and a story about belief, especially belief in yourself. And I expect that'd be good for anyone to see, except maybe those who really hate too much sentimentality."
"rooprect","7","6","6","23 September 2014"," An absolutely beautiful story... with a few major problems
","""August Rush"" is the most magical story I've seen in years. It also has some of the biggest plot holes I've seen in years. But in the end I have to say the magic triumphs, and if you watch this movie you'll probably enjoy it IF you are aware of a few things up front.<br/><br/>First, this must be treated as a fairytale. That is, just as we accept that a big bad wolf can talk and a family of bears can cook porridge, we must make some large allowances for this film if we are to accept it.<br/><br/>I won't go into too much detail what these errors/allowances are (other IMDb members have already compiled quite a list in the goofs section), but if you are a musician, particularly a classically trained one, you'll need some serious suspension of disbelief. The story is predicated on the idea that a young boy is a musical prodigy. That's fine, but this kid is downright supernatural. If you can accept that he can see a guitar for the first time and immediately rock out like Stanley Jordan, then you're OK. If you can accept the notion that he leafs through a 1st grade music book for 10 seconds and immediately knows advanced musical theory (the equivalent of leafing through a basic arithmetic book and suddenly knowing calculus), then you're halfway there. And if you can accept that he has the power to change into a tuxedo faster than Clark Kent can put on his blue tights, then you're gold.<br/><br/>OK, enough cynicism. If you can get past all of that, then ""August Rush"" is really a wonderful and original story that will charm your pants off. Very loosely based on Charles Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"", it's the story of an orphan in search of his parents. But this story revolves around the intangible power of music to draw people together. I've never heard of any story that makes such a powerful & moving metaphor for the power of music, and like I said up front, this powerful metaphor was enough for me to lose myself in the fantasy of it all. I probably would've fallen into it more readily if someone had told me to expect a fantasy. But instead I was halfway expecting realism, making much of the movie hard to swallow. Well now you've been warned, so go into it expecting a dreamlike fairytale and just let yourself be swept away by the magic.<br/><br/>A word of admiration for the late, great Robin Williams who plays a very complicated role here: a man who is basically a good guy but prone to inexcusable bouts of selfishness and violence. Not a particularly charming character but a memorable one, played with great skill."
"Jesusgrl792488","9","114","170","7 November 2007"," A brilliant movie.
","This was an absolutely brilliant movie. I saw it at the special premiere to the Grammy Recording Academy members a the WB studios in Burbank. It's an absolutely amazing story with a brilliant cast and a soundtrack that will blow you away. Apparently, both Freddie Highmore, keri russell,Jonathan Rhys Meyers learned most of the songs and played/sang them themselves, which is very impressive once you see the movie. John from five for fighting wrote a few songs on the soundtrack as well. Music is the common thread that keeps the entire movie together and completes it into the masterpiece of a movie that it is. Although at times, there may seem like there are gaps in the story line/character development, the point of this is that the music is what communicates those hidden details of the movie.Overall, this film is a masterpiece that should be cherished by music-lovers everywhere."
"identify_yourself","Null","23","30","26 February 2008"," Not a matter of cynicism or lack of imagination
","It is not a matter of being a cynic, or lacking the level of 'imagination' *required* to like this film. I am more than able to suspend my take on realism, when a good film warrants it, (note there ""good"" film). I have more than enough imagination, in fact my problems with this film do not even begin to touch on the lack of reality in the situation. When it comes to a film, I'm more than happy to buy the whole mother thinks she loses baby, but are reunited in a wonderful climax shtick, I quite like the idea, it could have been a pretty neat feel-good flick. In the end, I wish that it was only a little imagination that was needed...<br/><br/>My main issue stems from the script itself, namely the dialogue. I don't think I have heard such stilted, forced dialogue in a highly regarded feature film. They *roped* us in, only to present this completely false interaction between two people who have almost no on screen chemistry. This schmaltzy 'what are you doing up here?' 'just thinking' scene, which somehow lead to complete love and a 'surprise' pregnancy, was just the beginning. It was downhill from there. I tried to count the clichés, and I'm not talking in the plot, merely the one liners. ""I can hear him, I swear I can"" ""music is all around us"" ""I thought he was an angel"" etc, painful etc. And I must stress that this has nothing to do with the plot itself, this is the script, the horrible, horrible script.<br/><br/>It was only during the music scenes that I found myself not wanting to walk out of the cinema (something which I have never been compelled to do). The cast was stellar, I thought Ryhs Meyers and Keri Russell would be able to make something of this, but alas, if it weren't for the adorable Jamia Simone Nash, and Freddie Highmore I doubt I would have stayed.<br/><br/>Maybe, someday, someone will re-write this with believable dialogue, and three-dimensional characters. Maybe then it will be a movie bordering on bearable."
"MartinHafer","9","4","4","7 July 2018"," Not a remake of ""Oliver Twist"" but an odd new reworking of the classic tale with a supernatural twist.
","""August Rush"" is a modern fairy tale that is based on ""Oliver Twist"". However, while it shares many story elements, the film diverges from the novel in many ways...so much so that it truly is a unique viewing experience.<br/><br/>When the film begins, two young musicians meet, have a one-night stand and are soon separated by her father. This father turns out to be a very manipulative person, because when he discovers his daughter is pregnant, he arranges for her to believe the child died at birth....though he instead put the child up for adoption and forged her name to the surrender papers.<br/><br/>Years pass and now the boy, Evan, is living in a miserable orphan asylum. He is ridiculed by the other kids because Evan has a strange gift....a musical talent that makes him more than just a prodigy...more like a savant with super-human musical skills.<br/><br/>Eventually, Evan escapes from this facility and ends up in New York City. At the same time, inexplicable forces draw his mother (who JUST learned her baby was not dead) and his father to the city as well. While the viewer knows what will eventually happen, there is still much film to go...during which you see Evan's amazing talents burst forth AND an evil manipulator, 'the Wizard' (Robin Williams, sees the boy's potential and takes him in and puts him to work. However, the Wizard is no humanitarian....he's pretty much like Fagan from ""Oliver Twist""...a man who keeps a hoard of runaways and uses them as buskers to make himself rich. How will Evan escape the clutches of this evil man? And, how will he locate his parents?<br/><br/>
This film is very magical in style....with wonderful music and so much to like. Yes, it IS predictable...but it's also lovely in how it gets to where you think it should go. Well worth seeing and a nice family film."

","Reviewed by Elliot V. Kotek (from HATCHfest 2007 in Bozeman, Montana)<br/><br/>Director: Kirsten Sheridan Starring: Freddie Highmore, Keri Russell, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Jamia Simone Nash, Marian Seldes, Robin Williams.<br/><br/>If you've ever questioned the impact of music on emotion, August Rush is a must-see that will bury any doubt for all time. Featuring Jonathan Rhys Meyers as rock-star Louis and Keri Russell as New York Philharmonic cellist Layla, and starring Finding Neverland's heartbreak kid, Freddie Highmore, Rush delivers an experience that borders on the sublime and somewhat sentimental in a manner that rivals Neverland and would be reminiscent of Titanic if that ship had not sunk. A stirring performance here by Russell will definitely remind end-of-year voters of her work in Waitress and should serve to solidify her chances for an Oscar-nom.<br/><br/>The premise: A promising musician (Russell) is impregnated by a brooding but romantic Irishman (Rhys Meyers) in a one-night affair overlooking Washington Square Park that will change the course of their lives. Despite splinters of wooden dialogue and the obvious, yet ultimately satisfying, use of the music of Van Morrison early in the proceedings, the movie moves past both and bowls audiences over with poignant performances and stunning visuals in a first-class production. Layla's protective father falsely informs his daughter that her love-child did not survive birth, and delivers the boy, Evan, to the State, where the influence of all sounds great and small fill the boy with musical ambition and intuition.<br/><br/>In addition to the above-the-liners already singled out, Robin Williams wows in a blinding turn as Wizard, a menacing Fagin whose Oliver Twists are young, homeless musical prodigies and whose milk-cart careers he manages in exchange for their daily take and a fancy stage name. Onto the young Evan, he bestows the moniker August Rush (inspired by a passing grocery van). Director Sheridan (Jim's daughter, Kirsten) keeps the reins on her comic Wizard, and Williams seems to subtly straddle the line between sympathetic and psychotic. Also more than merely noteworthy is Jamia Nash, an 11-year-old with some of the best lines of the flick, who boasts a healthy dose of moxie that provides the perfect counterbalance to some of the heavier themes that accompany a film about an orphan searching for parents he isn't sure exist.<br/><br/>While the genesis of the film may have started with producer Richard Barton Lewis's vision of his then-newborn son's little digits directing his own symphony in a Santa Monica delivery room, the screening of this film is sure to inspire many more digits to pick up and pick at a six-string just to see what happens. Here's hoping studio support for the film will see screens increase after opening to take advantage of what should be great word of mouth. With screenings set for the upcoming Heartland FIlm Festival (where the film has been branded with a Crystal Heart Award), the Rome Film Festival and elsewhere, this moving tale is sure to find itself a fixture with families worldwide."

","There has never been and can never be a musical genius with even a fraction of the main character's talent. Mozart would be an absolute imbecile compared to this little kid August Rush, and for those familiar with music, this aspect (the foundation, really) just kills the movie.<br/><br/>It is impossible to play like Michael Hedges in your first few minutes with a guitar. Ditto with a piano, and any other instrument. If it were a martial arts movie, the kid would beat his master to death two minutes into his very first lesson. Too impossible, even for a fairy tale.<br/><br/>But, if you don't know a saxophone from a sitar, or perhaps if you are _infinitely_ forgiving, maybe you can enjoy it."

","If you have absolutely no clue about making music or art you probably will catch the fairy tale wave and be carried away by this movie. But be warned, if you have the slightest sense of playing music yourself or are an artist, it is more likely that you find this movie ridiculous or are even offended (like some of the other postings stated)<br/><br/>My only explanation of this very mixed movie (great premise/story, some of the actors great, but everything else quite a mess) is what must be the inexperience and ignorance of the director. There is a reason why good directors and actors spend weeks on studying character/environment. Because if you don't, you run the risk of creating something laughable that isn't a comedy.<br/><br/>This movie is neither art nor does it portray art very well. It's as cheesy as a fast food double cheese burger can get without the burger and the bun and as valuable. Too bad for this great story."

","(*Spoilers*) Famous concert cellist Lyla has a one night stand with rocker Louis that produces a son Evan (aka August) who is surreptitiously sent to an orphanage by Lyla's controlling father because he believes the child may harm Lyla's career. After these opening scenes we rejoin the story when August is about twelve. Then the separate paths of the three protagonists are traced until their inevitable reunion. It would take more than a thousand words to detail all the preposterous story lines. Let's just consider a few. August is a musical genius who would easily put Mozart to shame: he becomes a skilled guitarist within the first hour of exposure to a guitar; he starts composing and notating a symphony immediately after being shown the basic scales; he can play an organ, complete with pedals and stops, on a first try; he is skilled enough to conduct the New York Philharmonic; in the final scene we come to understand he has a certain level of extrasensory perception. There are some equally absurd things that could be said about Lyla's story.<br/><br/>I suppose this would all be well and good if this were clearly presented as fantasy, but as far as I could tell we are expected to ascribe some element of belief to the happenings. There is a serious problem with this--such stories advance the ""you can be anything you want to be"" philosophy without any discussion of how that can frustrate kids when they realize that it's simply not true. Young people who watch this movie could be led to believe that accomplishments occur without the long hard work required, no matter how talented they are.<br/><br/>Freddy Highmar (as August) has a winning screen presence and an infectious smile, but I am not sure his acting ability is beyond that of the charming kid next door.<br/><br/>The most infuriating thing is that there is the kernel of a good movie here. The scenes illustrating August's sensitivity to all manner of sounds is well done. I'm sure that this is true of most musicians and I would liked to have seen that explored in more detail. Some of the guitar work is excellent and I think there must have been someone behind the scenes with a developed musical sense, it's too bad that that person (or persons) was not given more free reign.<br/><br/>This is an unfortunate misfire."

","August Rush is, from one vantage point, a quintessentially mainstream film. It's a feel-good movie. As such, it's slickly polished into something that will be digestible to a wide audience - the downside of which is that somewhat generic quality that pervades films which swim safely in the shallow end of the pool. Of course, being commercial doesn't make a film bad. This one will have its audience, and there is enough emotion and good intention there to give the right movie-goer the quasi catharsis he or she is looking for.<br/><br/>To my mind, though, this film has a fundamental, glaring problem. It centers itself thematically around music, yet it demonstrates a thorough lack of musical understanding. People who have never considered nor been exposed to the processes behind music might not notice a problem, but to those who have, the film's central character will more closely resemble a comic-book-superhero version of a musician than any musician, genius or no, who has ever lived.<br/><br/>This young lad's extraordinary ability (to reach professionalism at any instrument, and even theory\notation, within seconds of coming into contact with it for the first time) is only a symptom of the problem. Another is the film's complete lack of effort to realistically correlate the music being produced with the way the instruments are being played. For instance, the camera may close in on a hand playing ascending notes on a piano, and yet we hear descending notes. Or more glaringly, an intricate song may be formed by swinging both arms at the strings of a guitar without even dealing with frets. In another scene, synthetic sounds are used in the score to represent real instruments being played.<br/><br/>This sort of thing is common in a lot of commercial cinema, and I can usually accept it. The reason I can't here is that this film purports to be ABOUT music, yet is entirely ignorant and pedestrian in its representation of it.<br/><br/>Floating somewhere near the heart of the problem is the fact that neither the music in the film, nor the film's fallacious representation of the musical process, does anything to convey the true depth and power of music, even remotely, despite some early dialog which suggested it may at least scratch the surface. To every musician watching the film, it will be glaringly obvious that the director is not a musician, nor truly passionate about music, and should therefore not have directed the film.<br/><br/>Here, in my belief, lies the biggest mistake of the Hollywood system - When the primary force determining what project gets made, and by whom, is money, filmmakers are rarely expressing their own voice. I don't remember the last time I saw a Hollywood film which genuinely felt like it was the vision of an artist who really had something to say.<br/><br/>Perhaps this film actually was written by someone who loves and understands music and wanted to convey something about it, but the fact that you can't tell simply by watching the film is a testament to its failure."

","Kirsten Sheridan got to direct this screenplay through her Father Director Jim Sheridan. This Film is truly ridiculous its about a filthy rich spoiled girl Lyla Novachec (Kerrie Russel) who is a concert cellist who meets a wealthy contrived cliché Irish prima-dona Rock Star Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and has unprotected sex on the first night without even getting undressed to do it. As with the dumb Juno she manages to get pregnant straight away. Louis's accent is more Scottish than Irish. <br/><br/>Lyla has the baby but somehow her father tels her that the baby was lost whilst adopting it out. Of course this is totally impossible in the American Private Hospital system and she would have had to sign a thousand forms , and with her wealth she would have been a private insured patient and the nurses and doctors would have informed her of every detail. Finally what of the funeral of the baby? Look it was totally pathetic from that point. The music in the film was the epitome of mediocrity with the exception a precocious African -American girl who was part of a soul Gospel choir and these types are not rare in the USA these days. Lyla's baby Evan Taylor alias August Rush (Freddie Highmore) grows up to be a grinning introvert who makes his way back to New York and becomes part of the this busking empire headed by a busking pimp Maxwell played by Robin Williams. August Rush has this extraordinary ability to play guitar like a fifty year old accomplished genius on his first try and a few days later is writing symphonies with full musical notation on his first attempt which is absurd and impossible. <br/><br/>The whole idea of the story is the fated re-union of the mediocre musicians Lyla and Louis with there genetically inherited musical genius son August by magical coincidence at the famous Julliard School for the rich concert. Apparently August had won a scholarship to Julliard which is ridiculous as it is a school for the very wealthy only. <br/><br/>A schmaltzy movie for morons"

But I, like some pathetic boob, watched it to the dreadful conclusion. By the end I was laughing out loud at the painful, unintentionally hilarious clichés. There are too many illogical, vapid, um ..... cheesy (it really is best descriptive adjective for this tripe) scenes, which crowded in on each other like rats trying to escape a flooded sewer. Speaking of sewer -- Oh the smell! Oh the humanity!<br/><br/>Never mind all the schmaltzy lost child and quixotic Fagin references. However, I ask myself in retrospective incredulity, could a movie about music be so utterly devoid of musical quality? Didn't any of the producers or directors even have a modicum of knowledge or appreciation for music? They had to all had to have totally tin ears to allow such musical trash to permeate nearly the whole misguided effort. And what of the classical musicians who were forced by some demonic overlord to perform this wretched stuff? They must have been wearing ear plugs under their long hair. Awful, awful, awful! <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, stay away at all costs. I will never regain the brain cells destroyed by this menace! I will live the remainder of my life haunted by images of o-so pathetic street urchins, gospel choirs (who never sing about God or Jesus?), faux Irish bands with fake accents, and beautiful cello ingenues, who seem to have masted the instrument without knowing any bowing or fingering technique, only to play the most insipid music ever to despoil a sheet of manuscript paper.

Wrong. Instead, this is by far the cheesiest, most predictable trash I have seen this year. Jonathan Rhys Meyers sleepwalks through the movie and the Irish angle that did wonders for Gerard Butler in PS - I love you, only ends up sounding clichéd here.There is no hint of romance between the lead pair. Freddie Highmore who did wonders in movies such as Finding Neverland and Charlie and Chocolate factory, just comes up looking like a kid who has no clue what he is doing. Robbin Williams is entirely wasted in a role that neither has the melancholic undertones that it ought to, nor the dilemma his character must have had. Terence Howard manages to look serious and mournful through out the movie, and while those very traits did wonders for him in Crash and Hustle and Flow, here, they only make you wonder what he is even doing in the movie.<br/><br/>The final verdict? While the makers seem to been successful in assembling a powerful star cast, if only they had paid half as bit importance to the script, they would have a much more watchable movie.<br/><br/>Chances are, you will yawn when you see the kid in the field for the first time, and right through the movie till the credits roll.<br/><br/>5 on 10."

None of the interactions between Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers make any sense. Terrence Howard and Mikelti Williamson are wasted as mere, inconsistent plot devices. Robin Williams seems to be making a different movie than everyone else.<br/><br/>Look, we're not cynics; we love ""Love, Actually,"" ""About a Boy,"" and all of Frank Capra, but the story has to seduce you in, not knock you to your knees; has to have a level of believability that doesn't require you to swallow logs when straining at gnats.<br/><br/>This was a dud.

"annevealius","2","62","114","2 December 2007"," I really wanted to like it... and, as an artist, was angry and offended
","OK, so I was ready for this movie to be schmaltzy. I wanted it to be schmaltzy. And schmaltzy it was... but it lacked any of the character development or dramatic arc to make an audience care enough to embrace the schmaltz and let it move them. I was actually angered by the quality of this film.<br/><br/>The basic premise, as some have commented, has potential. I'm an actor and the friend I saw it with is a musician. We both love music and I'll be right there cheering anything that heralds the transformative power of art. Unless said piece of art was itself crap. This was.<br/><br/>I don't think the director, writers, or editor knew what exactly they wanted this film to be. Is it three stories (of prodigy, mother, and father) which we watch simultaneously and see them drawn together? Is it the story of this child's genius? Is it a story of the power of music? It is attempting to be all of these, without ever succeeding. The primary problem is the script, which perhaps (to give screenwriters credit) was edited severely. Nothing is ever shown, it's told to you. We don't see the magical night Lila and Louis spend together, we merely here her say ""It was the best night of my life."" We see no backstory on Evan/August's life at this orphanage--we're just made to believe that his educational and social development was put on hold for 11 years. Really, he's NEVER seen a music staff before? Strange that an orphanage that lacking could afford to dress him so well. What finally made him decide to run away? Nothing had changed for him, nothing had changed with his parents to ""draw"" him to them. He did it, you know, just cause. I don't want to give anything away, in case for some insane reason you want to see it, so I'll only go into the story problems in the first 15 minutes.<br/><br/>The actors were trying their hearts out--except Robin Williams, whom I normally love but found false and unsatisfying--and in some cases were able to overcome the material and give fairly good performances(Terence Howard, Kerri Russell). Freddie Highmore is cute, but is really called upon to do little more than look glowingly happy while playing music and sad while thinking about his parents. The kid's pretty talented, how about we give him a freaking CHARACTER to play rather than an amalgam of heart-warming looks.<br/><br/>The attempt is noble, I suppose, but unfortunately my recommendation is to stay far, far away."

It has a disgustingly non-believable plot, a wholly indolent protagonist (actually the whole cast seems to go about with no commitment to the film whatsoever), an utter lack of any personality and a shallow treatment of everything.

","I was more-than-willing to give this a good shot and enjoy a nice feel-good film starring the likable Freddie Highmore (""Charlie,"" of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" fame). However, when I start hearing 10- year-old uneducated street urchins talking with vocabularies like college professors and saying things that no little kid would say, I get turned off. Add to that more Hollywood politically-correctness and low morality.....and so much for the nice, feel-good story. <br/><br/>The sweet-looking ""good girl"" of the story meets a guy on the roof of a building, sleeps with 20 minutes later. They agree to meet somewhere the next day but her parents whisk her back to where she came from, and the two don't connect. Nine months later the baby arrives right when the mother has a car accident. The father says the kid died but really he had given the boy to child services.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the boy - now 11 and living in an orphanage - runs off to New York City somehow figuring that magically, through hearing music, he'll meet his parents. Sound a little far out? Yeah, it is, and even more so as you see if play out. <br/><br/>It's a nice message of young boy never losing faith that he would meet his parents some day but the way he eventually does is so ridiculous, so far out, so unrealistic.....that it insults your intelligence. This turns out to be an Oliver Twist wannabe that isn't even close to the latter in quality and believability. Robin Williams as a ""wizard"" (""Fagin"" in ""Oliver Twist"") ought to tell you something.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, ""Evan"" (Highmore) meets up with this street kid (""Arthur,"" played by Leon Thomas) is verbally annoying as hell...and things progress from there. There are so many plot holes and contrivances in this film, you couldn't count them all. Examples? Well, the kid learns about sheet music one day and two hours later he's written compositions that would make Beethoven proud. Later, he gets accepted to the Julliard School of Music despite the fact he has no credentials or background on who he is and where he's from!! <br/><br/>If you have any brain at all, this movie is a slap-in-the-face to you."

","AUGUST RUSH is a bit similar to OLIVER TWIST. However, while the movie has a modern setting, it shares many plot elements with OLIVER TWIST, ending even better.<br/><br/>It begins with a young couple of musicians that meets and has a one-night stand, and when she becomes pregnant her dad does everything to make her believe that the child died at birth, although he just put the child for adoption.<br/><br/>A decade later the boy, Evan, lives in a orphanage and is mocked by the other kids because of his talents in music, that makes him like a savant with powerful skills. In the meanwhile an inexplicable series of circumstances draw his mother and dad that search for their son (after they discovered he is NOT dead), but also Evan ends in New York, becoming a star for his talents in music while a evil man, Michael Wallace known as ''the Wizard'' (Robin Williams in a rare villanious role) takes advantage of the boy and wants to make money with his talents. BTW the Wizard is NOT nice, he is very reminiscent of Fagin, the keeper of a hoard of foundlings that uses for his own personal interest. Will Evan escape from this evil man, and will he relocate his parents? Just see the movie by yourself.<br/><br/>This movie is very unique in its own way, thanks to the wonderful music and great cinematography. Yes, it has SOME flaws but it makes you reflect and care for the leading character. A nice movie that I strongly recommend for families and music fans alike."
"forkingpaths","1","19","31","7 September 2008"," Painfully Disappointing.
","This movie is perhaps one of the worst movies I've seen, and certainly the only one I've rated as a one. And I know awful. I've seen Meet the Feebles and House of the Dead, and this movie didn't measure up to it. It wasn't even the kind of awful that you could laugh at. It wasn't the sappiness of it, I'm a total sap. It was the sheer transparency of the awfulness. The wretched playing of the harmonica during the ""touching"" one night stand wherein the characters hardly talked, but somehow managed to form a life-long connection was simply stupid. Not just the harmonica, mind you, the whole thing. There were scenes that were okay, but when Evan was playing the neck of the guitar, who was strumming the instrument? Robin Williams delivered his lines with such shallowness, his performance was unbelievable. The dialogue between Lyla and Lori (or whatever her roommate's name was) was so thin and stretched, it caused me physical pain to endure it. For instance, after Lyla had just learned her father had forged her name to put her son up for adoption, and called her friend, who oh-so-sympathetically said: ""Pull yourself together!"" I don't know a single person who would say that to someone after such a terrible shock. Inane.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. and the little girl from the church were probably the only actors in the movie who managed to give their character's life, rather than relinquishing themselves to being caricatures of absurdity. Jonathan Rhys Meyers did an okay job, but his hotness could have been blinding me.<br/><br/>As someone who has always been accused of being a dreamer and having my head in the clouds, this movie is less about dreamers than about those seeking an escape. It makes a travesty of the hard work musicians put into their art by insinuating that if you ""follow the music"" and saw the physics behind it all, you too could be an August Rush. Don't even get me started on the sheer stupidity of his being able to pick up music theory after only being shown the basic notes on the piano.<br/><br/>I found the movie offensive."

Meant to be inspirational, the movie comes off as silly and contrived, and in parts laughable. Too many characters, back stories, and side stories are introduced and left unattended. The love story between Lyla (Kerri Russel) and Louis (Jonathan Rys Myers) is passionless and boring. Freddy Highmore, as the title character, is frankly creepy throughout much of the movie. And since the movie revolves around music and the fact that August is a ""prodigy"", more effort should have been put into teaching the kid to look like he knew anything about music or conducting. The score for the movie is merely adequate, as is the entire movie itself."

What to say, other than that this is the kind of sappy, melodramatic garbage that's more fit for Sunday afternoon viewing on the Hallmark channel? Let's begin with the plot, which actually doesn't exist. The movie simply rambles aimlessly from one episode to the next, shamelessly invoking deus ex machina when needed. In some ways it feels like something Terry Gilliam might have made in his absolute nadir after downing bottles of fluoxetine.<br/><br/>I suppose you could call this movie character driven, but those characters are depressingly shallow. Some of them, such as the one played by Robin Williams, are severely irritating and detract from little the movie has going for it. There is no point in going into too much detail here, but this brings me to the Robin Williams corollary; the man hasn't been involved in an above-average movie in over a decade. It stands to mention that only a small minority of the past decades' films featuring Williams are even actually average.<br/><br/>So in summary; I want my money back. In fact, I want more than my money back; I considered my time watching this movie as working. It was a truly herculean effort not to walk out. Shouldn't I be rewarded for that?"

"MRavenwood","3","26","45","27 December 2007"," Very Disappointing - Missable, Daft, Chick Movie (and I'm a Chick!)
","I am writing this as an alternate viewpoint to the praise heaped on this film over these pages. Bottom line, the film is inoffensive, but really not very substantive entertainment-wise or message-wise. It starts with a CGI treatment of a wheat field on the opening credits, which looks distractingly silly. It weakly conveys that the main character (a boy named Evan Taylor) believes he has some kind of control over the field, but it falls short of the intended correlation to his sensation of ""music everywhere"" which is better illustrated later in the film. The story set up is VERY slow and heavy-handed in establishing Evan's beliefs about one day finding his parents. Only half way through the film does there begin to be any appreciable progress with regard to the plot. Sure, things happen to the characters, but nothing really connects the audience to their emotion. <br/><br/>On the positive side, Robin Williams appears in this film in a role that is suited for him and that he plays in a restrained and powerful way. His character is the least trite, although you can somewhat ""see him coming"" from the moment he enters. Another highlight is the character of ""Arthur X"" a child musician who basically drives the plot forward all on his own for most of the second act. One senses that this actor Leon G. Thomas is capable of much more than the ""official black ghetto kid"" dialog he is given. Terrence Howard turns in an elegant performance with his portrayal of a caring social worker. Overall, the film doesn't require a *little* imagination or suspension of disbelief, it requires whole re-calibrations of reality from scene to scene. Not that you would think it's true-to-life, but it doesn't even make sense within its own parameters. Lastly, the music is all over the place thematically, stylistically and not cohesively or meaningfully - although there are some great players performing. An interesting concept for a film, but I found nothing to take away from it. If you want to see a feel-good film in this genre done correctly, check out Serendipity."

It's music of such quality that one would almost believe that it was written by a little boy who did not know how to read music 6 months ago. Definitely not a work of a genius ;-) It is hard to believe that an institution like NY Phil would go into project like this.

To begin with, the plot is ridiculous. The story is taken directly from Oliver Twist, but the actual events, it isn't even believable in the fairytale context that it is told.<br/><br/>The central love story is based on a night of rooftop sex with strangers who have about 3 minutes of the corniest lines I could possibly come up with before going at it like guinea pigs in heat: Who are you Lyla?""

And it just goes on and on like that.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is filled with similar vomit inducing dialogue; I don't know how many times ""You've got to believe in your music"" was repeated.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are cardboard cutouts: There's rich cellist girl with overbearing father, brooding punk rocker, inner city black kid who talks just like you'd expect, and perpetually dazed and confused skinny white kid who gets picked on but always follows his dream.<br/><br/>The cinematography is mostly boring and standard, what you might see in a car commercial or something similarly mundane. The music isn't bad, but whenever it come on, it sidetracks the movie for another 5 minutes rather than contributes to it.<br/><br/>Lastly, I found the movie incredibly racist as well. If you are white, you fall in love, follow your dreams and go to Juilliard. You might fall on tough times and meet some black people, but you will be later raised up to the position that you deserve.

Not that this makes Mr Williams a bad actor, etc.) This movie gives me that same feel with some 'Pay It Forward' mixed in. The movie conveniently and carefully avoids depicting actions of certain characters as irresponsible instead rewarding and spares us the sordid details other than self-ascribed depression. I recall class-assigned required reading of Charles Dickens novels. The characters behave as high-minded persons who don't respond with common-sense thinking. They feel, but don't think , deep. After this love-at-first-sight, horny-tonight rendezvous... maybe it's just the music they hear---that mesmerizes all..yeah, it's the music's fault. oh, I loved the 'dueling guitars' and no one was retarded, just gifted. No scene to suffer for deliverance (from). I could go on how this movie is crafty, I mean crafted, why bother? ah, the striking resemblance of the primary duo to (is that Nicole Kidman? and Ray (what's-his-face)..oh yeah, Liotta) both younger versions decidedly of course, but damn it's almost like the clone machine was tweaked un-beknownst to us. okay ,they're not the real two; but that's in line with the gist of this movie. ***ROBIN WILLIAMS***, ***TERRENCE HOWARD***...are they really in this movie? funny, I thought anybody could play those parts. Well, I guess I'm not the classy-cal, new-age, old-school, happy-melancholy, techno-inspired type to swatch this movie. But my date said she liked it."

","This film tries too hard to pull at heartstrings. Sentimental movies should just ""happen"" - they shouldn't be contrived messes. I read one reviewer say that this film should have been titled ""Oliver! 2: Electric Boogaloo"" and that about sums it up. The actors plod through horrid direction - the music is as banal as it comes, and why is it that every kid genius MUST play the role as sub-autistic? Not every genius is socially damaged. This movie should be burned or relegated to the Lifetime Movie Network. This film insulted me as a film-goer and music lover. I should have been crying at the end of the film, and instead I just left angry that this one even got out the gate. A lighter touch in directing, and better musical direction would have turned this into a good film - the story is interesting, but it was painted with a jackhammer instead of a brush."

","I rented August Rush a few days ago with good expectations, I just heard wonderful things about this film, so I was excited to see it. I watched the film last night and I am very much in love with this movie, everything about it was just so sweet and lovely. This movie reminded me of the story of Oliver Twist, it's a different take on the story with the power of music and just listening. The cast, the story, the editing, the direction, the music, nothing is off about August Rush. Freddie Highmore has such an incredible talent for such a young age, but his face says so much and his acting is just perfect and makes the audience just fall in love with him. Keri Russell is just pulling in one great performance to another, from Waitress to August Rush, she's just lovely. We also have the talented Jonathan Rhys Meyers from the Tudors, the incredible Terrence Howard, then a disturbing yet memorable performance from Robin Williams.<br/><br/>Evan Taylor is an orphan who is just convinced that he can hear his parent's music, that they do want him and he goes out to find them. Lyla and Louis, Evan's parents, were two young people who found a strong connection and had a one night stand, but Lyla's father takes her away from Louis and when a horrible accident happens, Lyla's father lies to her telling her that her baby died, but behind her back puts the baby up for adoption. Evan is set to find his parents but come across a musical group of kids, who are making money for Wizzard, when Evan plays music, it's magical, Wizzard exposes Evan giving him a new name, August Rush and makes money off of him. But when Lyla finds out about her son being alive, she goes to New York to find him, Louis starts thinking about Lyla and finds out where she lives, Chicago, but when he finds out she's gone, he goes to New York to relive his band days, instead they find each other and the musical genius their love created.<br/><br/>August Rush is one of the first films of the year that I'm rating a perfect 10, because there is nothing wrong with this film, to be honest, I think it deserves a higher rating than a 7.4. Is this a masterpiece? No, I'm not sure if it will be remembered several years from now, but I do know that this was a great movie and I would be so happy to watch it again. It's perfect for the family to watch, it's perfect for a group of friends, or just even for yourself if you are looking for a good movie to watch. August Rush is a movie that I'm sure will work it's way into your heart, it's a magical film that is absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>10/10"

","August Rush is those sickly mawkish movies which almost choke you to boredom. Let me admit that i don't have a palette for such kinda movies. It might appeal to many people which is evident from the 7.5 rating it has on IMDb.<br/><br/>To add on to the stupidness of the movie are the two unimpressive performances, especially the mother who seemed too stupid to be a mother backed by a father who looked too cool to be a father. The characterization is a major issue for this movie. Both the leads give unremarkable performances,backed by their child.<br/><br/>What can i say about the child. A child who is even more talented than Mozart ?.I love Music, but please don't insult music this way. The main idea behind this movie is complete nonsensical. <br/><br/>oh and i forgot Robin Williams. He also gives a forgettable performance. I totally repent having watched this movie.

In addition, the one night stand between Rush's parents seemed SO implausible. (especially since both were sober.) This was a sugary sweet, chick flick done VERY poorly. Even external characters were badly acted. Robin William's character was unrealistic and not menacing enough. Heck, this one was stolen right out of oliver twist.

","(My Synopsis) Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) is a brilliant cellist who has just finish performing a concert in New York City. Lyla goes out on the town with her girlfriend and end up at a party near New York's Washington Square. She meets Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) an Irish guitar player. They share the love of music and end up falling in love and bonding together that night. It was the most wonderful night in Lyla's life. Lyla must rush back to the hotel where her father Thomas (William Sadler) is waiting for her. Lyla promised to meet Louis in Washington Square, but her father forces her to go to her next concert. They are like two ships that pass in the night, never to see each other again, except for the fact that Lyla is now with child. Sadly, Lyla is in a car accident and the unborn child is lost. Eleven years pass and Lyla's father is on his death bed, and he must tell her the truth that he secretly gave Lyla's baby boy up for adoption. August Rush (Freddie Highmore) is her child, who was born with the gift to hear music all around him. He believes that he will find his parents if they only hear his music, because they are truly bonded by their music.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The movie is a human interest story about a young boy's unyielding faith and will power to never give up on his dream. However, the probability of all the events that happen in this movie to make all the connections is a little unrealistic. The scenes have a fantasy element, while at the same time, manages to integrate real life events. There are some exceptional musical performances, especially from a young girl gospel singer named Hope (Jamia Simone Nash). The majority of the story is told through the emotions of the actors by means of their music. The acting was excellent and so was the classical, rock, and gospel music. I enjoyed the movie, but the story has a problem of the lack of believability. So if you go, just remember, it's only a movie. You will like the music and you may even shed a tear. (Warner Bros.

I did figure the stare out though. I'm pretty sure she was looking out towards the stage door in hopes that she could flee from this bad, bad, bad movie. Where to start... events that happen are simply astounding in their flying in the face of convention and believability. Musician knocks up musician on rooftop. Musician's father spirits daughter musician away from randy Irish musician so he can't violate his musician daughter again. Daughter musician winds up pregnant.Luckily for father just before musician daughter has birth, daughter gets hit by a car and baby must be delivered and then given up as an orphan all without the consent or knowledge of seemingly sophisticated musician daughter. Irish musician lad spends the next 11 years doing something vaguely corporate and walking around looking like he's constipated. Musician daughter decides to teach music(go figure). 11 year old bastard orphan child escapes orphanage and goes to the city where every orphan dreams of fleeing to ...New York City. Orphan gets taken in by a orphan/manager pimp for wayward young boys. Cue Robin Williams over acting wildly. Obviously Williams got got paid more by loudness and unstable acting. Can anyone say Hello Oscar?.... Orphan boy plays guitar first time he touches a guitar.... Can anyone say Whimsy?.... Orphan boy gets into Juliard,can anyone say entitlement?..... Orphan boy is conflicted between Fagin type character and professor at Juliard. Fagin type wins out because of the great digs he has provided orphan, old condemned theater with electricity. Cue star-crossed musicians looking for orphan child in New York City because that's where all orphans runaway to. Star-crossed musicians hear and see orphan boy conduct his own symphony and walk up to stage and know that he is their son. Awwwww tugs at the heartstrings doesn't it. Vomit."

","I'm never biased when it comes to rating a movie. If it's pretty good I say it's pretty good and why. If it's horrible I do like wise. If it's great then I say it's great but i still mention the things that to me seemed to flaw it in whatever small ways that they did. However, I just finished watching August Rush and I am in no way exaggerating when I say that it is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It not only grabs your heart from the very first scene but it grabs your soul within the first thirty minutes and by the time the movie's climax arrives you're in it so deep that whether you're Mr. Macho who wouldn't cry at his own mother's funeral or just someone who's bored and wants to see something that will be worth watching you will undoubtedly be wiping your eyes with your shirt sleeve and not caring who sees because everyone around you will be wetting their sleeves as well. Freddie Highmore takes the role of August Rush and delivers what will probably be (and very well should be) an Oscar winning performance. Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers do excellent jobs as well. In fact, everyone --including Robin Williams -- does a wonderful job. I'm not going to go into depth about this movie's plot because I don't want to take away from the surprise of how well written and in depth it is but just keep in mind that of all the movies that have come out this year (including the ones I have not yet seen, and I can say that with certainty after seeing this movie) this one is by far the cream of the crop and for me it will be a long time before any movie does to me what this one did. Go see August Rush, you will not be disappointed. If ticket prices doubled I would gladly pay the twenty plus dollars just to see it a second time."
"therapingleonidas","1","16","30","5 December 2007"," Completely unbelievable, hokey pablum.
","Words cannot express how absolutely horrible this movie was. Not only was it overly sentimental pablum, but considering the huge role that music plays in the movie, you might assume that the writer could write believable dialogue about music... but you would be wrong. Now, I don't expect them to know the intricacies of music theory or the ins and outs of the world of classical music, and I understand the dramatic concept of ""willful suspension of disbelief,"" but when a character says (and this is pretty much a verbatim quote), ""The New York Philharmonic wants you to play again. I got the invite today,"" it pretty much ruins any sort of illusion that this bears any resemblance to the real world.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality is the fact that the guy playing Jonathan Rhys Meyers's brother looks like an Irish version of Jermey Piven.

","This is one of the most ridiculous movies I've watched in recent years.<br/><br/>Essentially its the story of an orphan who is trying to find his parents and does so through music.<br/><br/>It comes across like a fairytale, but even Alice In Wonderland was more realistic than this. Lots of movies have those moments where you go 'yeah right' but usually its only 1 or 2, or the movie is some no-brain action flick where it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>In this case you have those moments right through the entire movie, and they get worse as it gets closer to its predictable climax. Im not sure who would actually enjoy this movie, maybe if you're 70, or under 12 but for everyone else I'd save your time.<br/><br/>The acting itself wasn't bad, though the more interesting characters were played by Terrence Howard and Robin Williams, and they were both severely under-developed as you wanted to know more about them and less about this kid with the stupid smile all the time."
"Siamois","7","5","7","21 August 2008"," A good, modern fairy tale
","There have been strong reactions to this movie, both positive and negative. A lot of criticisms stem from the unbelievable nature of several plot points, which I find strange seeing as this movie has very little to do with reality. To cut to the chase, opinions that this movie is ""worthless"" or ""crap"" should be safely discarded as rubbish immediately. This is actually a solid film, even if it has flaws. There is, however, a certain public that will be turned off by the fantasy aspects and Disney-like elements found here.<br/><br/>The story follows a young boy raised in institutions and desperately wanting to meet his parents, which he knows nothing about. He is driven by his gift and passion for sounds and music. Parallel stories featuring his parents are also told and intersected in this movie. The direction here by Kirsten Sheridan is solid if we except the beginning of the movie, where the quick exposition to the characters and situation is absolutely awful and 80-ish in its rendition. In fact, Sheridan's main weakness seems to be in how to intersect the various bits and characters of the plot. But everything else is appropriate and on target.<br/><br/>The cast is solid, starting with teenager Freddie Highmore. While Highmore doesn't turn a Dakota Fanning or Haley Joel Osment performance, he is endearing and most of the time, totally believable as our main character. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell are great and their scenes together showcase very effective chemistry, which was definitely required. Terrence Howard continues to slowly rise in Hollywood as an actor who should be taken seriously. Finally, Robin Williams has a turn as a stereotypical ""fairy tale baddie"" that may seem over the top but is right on target for this genre.<br/><br/>But the biggest star of this film is probably music. To make this movie work and rise above countless feel-good movies, great, inspired music was required and fortunately, we get it in spades here. From rock to classical to soundtrack ambiances, everything here is well-meshed together, if a little artificial. Lovers of music will be more than satisfied, while actual musicians may be a wee bit disappointed by the treatment. It's still way, way above average. It's very, very good as a matter of fact.<br/><br/>I tremendously enjoyed August Rush, even with its small flaws. And I do believe those who couldn't get past those flaws are either missing the point, or simply do not enjoy this genre to begin with. Family-friendly entertainment has been a neglected genre, plagued with very poor entries that are totally uninspiring if we except a few movies. Lately, it seems we're seeing improvement and some thoughts put into the art of crafting good movies of this type. August Rush certainly exemplifies this and I recommend it strongly."

","August Rush is one of those feel good films that will cause any critic to be bum-rushed with accusations of pretentiousness and/or the malicious desire to ruin the magic. I can assure you that while I may accurately be accused of putting on the occasional air (well, not so occasional perhaps) it is not any inherent malice that inspired this criticism. Rather, it was revenge, completely futile and irrelevant revenge. Not only on the people who took what might have been a truly magical film and turned it instead into a Hallmark Channel meets MTV event with a PTL innuendo thrown in just to tick me off a little more; but also revenge on the people who gave it more than the 4 or 5 stars it deserves, because I actually based my decision to go see it on your ratings. YOU OWE ME! <br/><br/>OK. Some time has passed and I can admit the preceding was hyperbolic. When I wrote it I had just got back from the theater and the score was still ringing in my ears. It's not really that bad just bad enough, and nothing ticks me off more than an OK film that could have been great. <br/><br/>There are parts that I will admit are are very well done and a scattering of clever lines break through the fog of pallid dialog. But these sparkling moments fizzle out under the overbearing (and occasionally trite) incidental score, and the over-doctored script.<br/><br/>The feature songs, the central theme of the film, are actually cool for the most part. The guitar work is brilliant, and the rest is consuming and even inspiring when it is not sounding like corporate extract of alternative rock.<br/><br/>Robin Williams' character, though not given sufficient time to develop, was surprisingly complex, especially considering the three-chord repetition of the others. Like Jonathan Rhys Meyers for example, a ""rocker"" (or something) who spews portentous gibberish when he is not running around the film looking pensive and conflicted and emoting like a teenage girl. Or Keri Russell who is pretty and blond and apparently not much else except for a few good lines here and there.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore might be a good actor, I don't really know because most of his parts are just K-Pax/Rain Man idiot-savant type staring into the distance before he learns how to play guitar or piano in a matter of minutes. But I really can't blame him for the failure of the script. I generally give kids the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>What is most frustrating is that there are occasional moments of  well, I wouldn't say brilliance, but definitely good writing. But it gets stomped out of existence by the next hackneyed moment or drowned in the films manipulative attempts to shove it's message down our collective throats.<br/><br/>Note to filmmakers: You don't have to beat the audience over the head with your message. Let the play say the thing."

The script for ""August Rush"" lays it all out for you and then force-feeds it to you in fits and starts.<br/><br/>What a waste of truly wonderful actors, musicians, and high production values (this picture certainly cost a dollar or two). From the use of ""Moondance"" near the beginning (and then ""sneaking"" a bit of it into a symphony near the end - I am reminded here of ""Leaving on a Jet Plane in the mightily-terrible ""Armageddon""), to some truly awful dialog, to me this film is a badly-paced mess. I was ramping up the playback speed here and there to get from one scene to another, and to keep myself from falling asleep. <br/><br/>Yeah I wanted to see what happened at the end, and (surprise!), the predictable indeed occurs.<br/><br/>If you want to see my idea of cinematic-musical magic, see ""Once""."

Finally, I threw in the towel at the half way mark.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a rating of 2 only because of Keri Russell, the only salvaging element in the first half. And there is a nice but short piece with Terrence Howard. Without these two, this movie is a 1, especially Freddie Highmore. His agent should be more careful in placing him into films or his career will be destroyed at practically its beginning.<br/><br/>The story hops around aimlessly and never develops any empathy for any of the characters.

The movie did not disappoint. It was uplifting, exhilarating and moving.<br/><br/>The music was fantastic, and eclectic enough to suit a wide range of tastes. If the ending was happy and the plot was simplified to return to a reasonable feature length, it was well worth the hokey assumption that a musical prodigy can learn to write music correctly with no training.<br/><br/>While I myself struggle with the bagpipe chanter, my mother and her siblings were musically talented and well known for their ability to play a tune note perfectly after hearing it once. While they eventually learned to read and write music, they composed long before they ever did so. This story is not so unlikely.<br/><br/>This move was well casted. Robin Williams played a role which was different, and showed he can really connect with people in a rather surprising way. I liked the way the movie brought together elements which crossed ethnic and socioeconomic lines.<br/><br/>I will be back to see this film again, and pay cash to do so.

Freddie Highmore is at his best here, playing the title character that never stops believing in finding his parents. He is an amazing actor and his facial expressions really made me feel his pain. The actors who played his parents were also really good, especially Keri Russell who was perfectly cast as the woman who desperately wants to find her son. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was also good, and the scene with him and August playing music together is one of the best moments of the movie. It's such a beautiful scene that's shared between father and son, even though neither of them knew that they were related. The other characters were also amazing, Wizard was really good because at first he seems nice, but then he turns out not be. The little girl that teaches Evan how to play music was such a joy to watch. The last scene of the movie was just so beautiful. It just ended it off so well, instead of making it soppy and predictable. I think it was perfect how in the end, Evan just simply saw his parents and smiled with joy. It would've been ruined, I think, if he had run into his mother's arms or something. I also liked how Louis nodded when he looked at Evan, which leaves the viewer to wonder whether he'd realized that Evan was his son. So all in all, a brilliant movie with beautiful music. It simply took my breath away and inspired me to believe in the power of music, which is truly ""a harmonic connection between all human beings."""
"SGAngel","5","16","32","2 November 2007"," Well-meaning but lazy
","August Rush is about an orphaned boy who is a musical genius and tries to find his separated parents (Louis and Lila) through the power of music. The film is supposed to be a feel-good film and I can see how the talented cast was drawn to its message, but they are let down by lazy writing. <br/><br/>One example is how Lila and Louis meet. The writing fails the actors and cramps them with dialogue such as: <br/><br/>Louis: ""What's your story?"" Lila: ""Me. That's it."" Louis: ""Yeah?"" <br/><br/>It reminds me of the stilted dialogue from Star Wars II. The audience needs to believe these people had such a connection they would hold on for 11 years. The writers use the awkward assumption that since the whole story is based on the couple's love, Lila and Louis must love each other then - even if there aren't many scenes that justify it. Lazy. Lazy. Lazy. <br/><br/>Another example of lazy writing is the character played by Robin Williams. From the trailer, you'd assume the character was an eccentric vagabond that teaches August about music from the heart. Instead, he's an exploitative child abuser who is out of sync with the rest of the film. But why does he exist in the film? His role is merely to create a physical villain to stand up to since hard work, overcoming your fears and believing in yourself are too hard for the writers to show. Lazy. Lazy. Lazy.<br/><br/>Everything also comes too easy in the film. None of the characters give up or overcome anything to reach the end. For example, Louis ends up in San Francisco and obviously he's a suit now because -duh- he wears a suit. (Lazy.) He has a girlfriend (Amanda from Ugly Betty! in a thankless cameo) which could have been interesting if the girlfriend doesn't leave on her own. (Lazy.) he leaves his job to move to Chicago, then New York (but we don't get to see him quit) and gets back into a band seamlessly after 11 years assumed not playing or practicing. (Lazy.) He never even knows he has a son, which seems also pretty lazy for a film about a boy reconciling his parents. <br/><br/>By the way, August is a prodigy and it's like someone out of the Matrix downloaded all the genius level tapes on music into his brain. He plays guitar amazingly without having been given a single lesson. (Lazy.) He can play a church organ by feel. (Lazy.) After being told that piano keys can be remembered as FACE, he can write music using trills, ties and running sixteenth notes. (Lazy.)<br/><br/>He never fumbles and I wonder how long we're going to force ourselves to believe that determination, practice and instruction are less important than talent alone. I'd counterpoint this film with ""Akeelah and the Bee"" which showed the need for both. <br/><br/>Finally, the film misses the essential scenes. We don't get to see Louis trying to find Lila except for after their first night together. No phone book. No Googling. He does sit at the Arch in Manhattan sometimes, but so does she and I guess they go enough times for a montage but not enough to meet each other. <br/><br/>They only meet at the end, which is ridiculous. The two should meet up two-thirds into the film so they can spend the last third finding their son together. But why doesn't this happen? Because it might lead to conflict (how does he feel that he has a son he never knew about? is he still mad that she left him? will they still like each other after a decade?) and the writers want to avoid that at all costs.<br/><br/>At the end, when everyone does meet up, they don't even hug or kiss or play music together. They just stare at each other. I want catharsis. I want to see family stuff. Why did I spend almost two hours if they don't even have a meal together or something?<br/><br/>In the end, the film assumes you have seen countless films like this one and will go along with it without having to explain much. It's like they decided to dramatize the synopsis on the back of a Blockbuster video than actually create a full story. Do I need to say this one more time? Lazy. Lazy. Lazy.<br/><br/>I will disclose that a few people in the audience were sobbing, so if you don't expect too much, enjoy the pretty actors and see the film for free, you're golden. <br/><br/>I think there was a smarter, rougher film in here that got sanded down to its blandest edges. And I can enjoy sappy sugary films. But I can't like ones that pretend to look for meaning, but are actually looking to fill time until the final frame."
"monkeyjunkie","1","17","35","27 November 2007"," What can I say about August Rush?
","I have seen some bad movies in my time, but this one was by far the worst. Cheesy lines and bad acting litter this picture. The only saving grace is the music. Although besides the classical orchestra scenes, August's ""music"" seems to be the same song throughout the picture and annoying at best. You end up hating August about half way through it and his ""creep factor"" is off the charts. Some have labeled this movie as an urban fairy tale, and I guess you could call it that because none of it is realistic, or makes sense, or even flows logically. Save your money by not going to see this at the movies. If you must see it, rent it so you won't feel bad when you shut it off half way through or fall a sleep."
"tw12345","1","12","23","26 November 2007"," Worst movie ever made
","Absolutely unbearable. It was so unrealistic I couldn't stand it. Every time I started to like it a little, they pulled out something ridiculous and I started hating it again. The guitar playing, the cello playing, the piano, the organ - it was so badly done and obviously fake. The kid picks up a guitar for the first time, and in 5 minutes is playing like an expert? In the ""dueling banjos"" scene, his dad shows up out of nowhere, they don't bother to tune up, and instantly play something that would obviously take some rehearsal? The ""instant Mozart"" formula was preposterous. Come on, nobody teaches themselves to write musical notation in a day, much less write a symphony in 6 months with no training. This movie is an insult to real musicians. Robin Williams' abandoned theater where he kept a posse of little kids? Come on, even in New York he would have been thrown in jail. The only good part was that little girl who could really sing - at least I hope it was her and not somebody else dubbed in - who can tell. And other reviewers have said how great the music was - ugh if I hear that stupid 5 note theme again I'll puke. The repetitiveness of it was worse than ""Coming Around Again"" in Hearturn. Ecch."

","I must add to the posted at the top Remay 1. There is nothing worse than a musical snob. Your review made me cringe. Who on earth do you think you are. If you think the music is rubbish to must have a serious hearing disorder. I suggest you go away and be superior somewhere else. You are utterly pathetic. <br/><br/>August Rush I had heard good word of mouth from cinema goers but this was slated by some heavyweight critics. Well all I can say is I don't feel angry at such negative reviews for such a magnificent film I feel sorry for people like French who must be so cynical and cold hearted that he just cannot see a film of great beauty anymore or suspend disbelief. The IMDb rating bucked the critics reviews with an average 7.5 which is a high mark.<br/><br/>My question is HOW CAN SO MANY CRITICS GET IT SO SO WRONG !.<br/><br/>Now this World is full of cynics who will no doubt call me a sentimental old sod but this film knocked me sideways and is the best film I have seen for at least 4 years.<br/><br/>It is about an orphan who was taken from his mother without her knowledge after a 1 night stand. The father does not know of his existence and the mother thinks he's dead. The parents are both musical supremo's in their own rights. The parents never see each other again. Anyway the boy wants to find his parents through the power of music and love. He escapes the orphanage 11 years later to his search for this parents.<br/><br/>It all culminates in Central Park, New York when the parents are drawn to a concert August Rush has written. Coincidences have to be accepted in good faith and by the time of the reunion at the end I felt a tear rolling down my cheek for the first time for many years at a film such was its beauty. This is a film that strikes a chord with me for many reasons and is installed in my top 10 of all time and to hell with what the critics say. Stunning and beautiful."

","Saw the trailer for this movie on another DVD and thought it might be a nice movie to watch. Wow, what a disappointment. I've seen fairy tales that were more believable than this. Each time you saw one of the actors doing something with a guitar, a studio-recorded bit of music was played, as if..... An insult to the audience. An adult woman supposedly loses her child without any proof of what happened with the baby. Did the hospital staff lie to her? Not any kind of death certificate? Come on. And what about the dad. He has this one night love affair, doesn't have a chance to speak to her after that and then walks around like a sad corporate zombie for 11 years? ELEVEN YEARS...get a life! I've seen lots of movies and never before wrote a comment on the IMDb, but I thought I should warn you about this one. Go and rent an old version of Oliver Twist, any version should be better than this."

","My wife and I just returned from a sneak preview and we were blown away. Admitted music fans (I played alto saxophone and sang in my high school choir and my wife plays violin and viola), we had seen previews and were very excited to see the movie. We were not disappointed.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore is mesmerizing as Evan Taylor/August Rush. His potential at this point is limitless and should not be marked by the ""mixed"" reviews this movie is receiving. Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are pitch-perfect in their roles as Lyla Novacek and Louis Connelly, unknowing parents of August. Terrance Howard is sincere in the role of Richard Jeffries, social worker. But the biggest surprise is Robin Williams as Wizard.<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** Only from reading a critic's review did we know that Wizard would turn out to be a bad guy. However, we were stunned to find out that Robin Williams plays a mean, greedy, and controlling jerk whose only goal is to manipulate young people into playing music on the street to make money for him. That being said, the fact that we hated Wizard so much in the movie shows that Robin Williams is as talented an actor as you will find in movies today.<br/><br/>***END SPOILER*** The only reason we are not giving August Rush 10 out of 10 stars is the limited back-story we get for many of the characters. It is not exactly clear why Lyla's father seems intent on ruining her life. Does her mother have any say? Why is Wizard so cruel? Did he grow up without parents and in foster care as it is suggested? These are just a few of the many questions for which we would have liked answers.<br/><br/>However, as August states in the beginning of the film, he thinks of music the way most people think of fairy tales. So a little story left to the imagination is acceptable. In the end, the movie touched our hearts. And though some are calling it too sentimental, it simply hit the right chord with us."

This film delivers in most aspects but there is something I could not put my finger on that stopped me from saying it was great. Normally I blame the director?

","Imagine a modern version of Oliver Twist, add beautiful classical and rock music and finish the mix with a somewhat predictable, but nevertheless intriguing love story and ""August Rush"" is the best that you can possible make out of it.<br/><br/>By watching the opening scene, showing Freddie Highmore in a corn field, I already suspected this could become something very special. It is not very often that a movie kept me hooked from start to end while forgetting everything around me, but ""August Rush"" pulled it of. The main reason for this is the music and the way how music is interweaved with the plot and that is what makes this movie unique. I have never seen or heard anything like it and I sincerely hope that I'll one day watch a movie that does an even better job. Freddie Highmore, who also performed admirably in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", is one of the very few 14-year old actors that can really act without any awkward moments. Jonathan Rhys Myers and Kerri Russell also perform flawlessly and the rest of the cast does an excellent job as well. It was very interesting to see Robin Williams in a role that was somewhere between good guy, which is his regular role, and bad guy. Saying much more about this could spoil the movie and I definitely don't want that...<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where I'm simply not in the mood for finding something to criticize it. But lets get over that for a few moments and look at the few flaws that are in present in this movie. Basically, the movie is a bit predictable and it has some corny elements in it. When you're about halfway in the movie, then most of the plot will be clear to the majority of viewers. However, I'm not going to let this gem of a movie lose any points for that, because most viewers will be so captivated by the movie that they will hardly (or not at all) notice.<br/><br/>The target group for this movie is a bit difficult to assess. It's not the ""Fast and the furious"" crowd that wants to see this, neither is it a real kids movie or a real chick flick. Perhaps it's better to categorize this movie as being targeted at people of all ages, that love music and want to see a feel-good movie with beautiful music and top notch acting. For these people this movie is highly, highly recommended! 10* out of 10"
"maxshelley","1","11","23","2 December 2007"," One of the worst films I have ever seen (up until I walked out....)
","I had the choice of watching a few films at the cinema, but I logged onto IMDb beforehand and read the reviews posted by others for August Rush and saw it's rating of 7.3 so it seemed to be a pretty safe bet for an entertaining watch. A big mistake.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, Freddie Highmore is nauseating as the child at the centre of the story - but his acting is only one awful performance among many, Jonathan Rhys Meyers ranking the worst by quite a long way.<br/><br/>The plot is unbelievable, even in a romantic, fairytale style of storytelling. Why is the father able to give a baby away so easily, even the worst hospitals in the world would at least MENTION it to the mother, surely? Why is the Jonathan Rhys Meyers so emotionally distraught when all he did was spend one awfully-scripted night with a girl - as a singer in a band, wouldn't that be pretty mundane for him? Does nobody else find Robin Williams character, someone who is basically collecting children from the street a little WRONG? I even found the technical side of this film badly done...the boys guitar playing is unrealistic and when they use other people's hands for close-ups they are quite clearly the hands of an adult, and apparently an adult that doesn't believe in great skincare.<br/><br/>The person I was with finally agreed to leave after the girl was told about the father having the baby adopted. I wish I had been able to leave much, much before this.<br/><br/>This movie stole some of my life and I want it back, complete with an apology and a signed affidavit that they will not show it again."
"lisaskap-1","2","13","29","15 November 2007"," The Most Ridiculous Film I've Ever Seen
","This is the sappiest, silliest, most predictable film I've seen in years. The plot is full of holes and, despite some decent acting, has one of the worst scripts in a film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The repetition of the line ""I can hear it in the music"" or ""I feel the music"" is just plain annoying. The idea of a child prodigy that brilliant is over-reaching, and the character is outlandish, even with Freddie Highmore's solid acting.<br/><br/>The sap level in this film is through the roof. Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers barely speak before they are making out, then have casual sex on a roof- but are suddenly ""so in love"" that he gives up his career for her...then, at the end, they ""just know"" that they have spent 11 years pining for one another and Meyers suddenly knows this is the child they had 11 years ago...how? I'm assuming he feels it through the music! <br/><br/>Furthermore, Robin Williams' character is beyond annoying and horrible. Though this is meant to be on purpose, and he's meant to be a sort of Fagan character, he is, in some ways, something of the glue that holds the entire film together, and him arriving at Juilliard is almost a laughable scene. Robin Williams is no longer the wonderful actor we loved in films like Hook, Good Will Hunting and Mrs. Doubtfire.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell are all great actors who do what they can to save this abysmal script, but to no avail. Had there film focuses more on the child's time in the orphanage, or on the fact that the kid was most likely autistic (or at least came off that way), the film could have been far more interesting, authentic, and less predictable. Terrence Howard, Leon Thomas III and Jamia Simone Nash are the best things about this film, as Howard and Thomas are terrific actors, and Thomas and Nash are beautiful singers. <br/><br/>The music is surprisingly lovely, and Keri Russell is a great cellist. However, not even that can save this embarrassing cheese-fest. Save your money and your time."
"schneewindjp","1","8","16","13 March 2008"," Awful!!
","While it is interesting for the first few minutes, August Rush quickly unravels and becomes a horribly illogical movie. Johnatahan Rhys Meyers' Scottish accent thickens about halfway through the movie despite the fact he had been living in America longer. Robin Williams wastes himself in a ""serious role."" Trying to be an outlandish, captivating character, Williams suffers a poor script and should not have made this film because he now seems to be getting typecast for his ""serious roles."" Keri Russell having her baby given up for adoption without her ever knowing, even if she was in an accident, has to be impossible. Freddie Highmore is a great actor but should fire whoever it was who allowed him to waste his time making this. It was one of the worst I've seen in a while."

","This movie has superb actors, beautiful shots, and some beautiful songs. None of those matter, though, because the finished product is terrible. It offends me as a moviegoer that ""August Rush"" made it to theatrical release.<br/><br/>I saw a preview screening here in Hollywood two weeks ago. I can't imagine what the director, producers, and others responsible for quality-control were thinking. Somehow, they made an entire feature film without once asking, ""Wait: does this script have the basic elements of a decent story--or any story--in it?"" Any breathing person with a sense for a fun or interesting movie could have spotted that this one needed *ahem* WORK! I don't mean to say ""August Rush"" is a good story or a bad story. What I mean to say is, it's not a story at all! It's a mish-mash of fairytale clichés and musical sequences that almost distract one well enough to miss questioning, ""When do the characters change, or overcome, or surprise us and themselves?"" It never happens. The characters don't connected with each other, and none of the characters who could be a hero to us faces any difficulty of interest or meaning. Nope, just ""Poof! everything's solved!"" and the movie ends. With more sweeping music.<br/><br/>When our preview screening was over, the audience sat in silence for what seemed ages. A few people laughed quietly. It was as though the overwhelming urge to be polite was fighting with the revulsion and hypocrisy of applauding such a film. In the end, a very few people gave a golf clap and everyone escaped into the night. (NOTE: We appreciated these brave souls who sacrificed their honesty for the good of the many.) My friends and I had gotten into the screening for free, but we still felt mugged, and every one of them said so. If I ever meet the director, I'm going to ask for my two hours back, then ask for humanity's sake that she go direct music videos or commercials in which an interesting story isn't a requirement. Women are starting to make inroads as directors in Hollywood. Ms. Sheridan could single-handedly set them back decades."

"mgstults","10","6","12","24 November 2007"," Over the critics' heads
","Some movie reviewers just don't get it. One calls August Rush, ""a piece of shameless hokum...""; another calls it ""the sort of movie that requires you not only to suspend disbelief, but to check your sanity at the ticket counter."" That same reviewer said the movie Babel was a ""towering dramatic achievement""; I thought it was lumbering and tedious with scenes arguably pedophilic. As one Yahoo user said about it, ""Please let's not confuse art with egothe sensationalism of seeing the naked girl or the masturbating boy was only necessary to compensateTHERE IS NO STORY HERE."" How often do we see reviewers totally out of touch with the opinions of the movie-going public? Back to August Rush. This movie went right over many critics' heads. I believe these are the elements they least understood: August Rush is a story of hope that teaches hope, determination, perseverance, and to never give up on your dream. It gracefully defines the benefits of listening. It takes us to another realm where we can witness there is more to us than our mortal bodies, brains, and intellects. Aha! It teaches things of the spirit, things unseen, things beyond our human understanding, and it does so through a child who is full of joy when there seems to be no reason for him to have any! But, he is a prodigy with a talent kindling in him and he can do things for which there is no logical reason.<br/><br/>My own son, Greg, was reading and doing math beyond a second grade level well before he began kindergarten. Neither his father nor I taught him these things; he just ""knew"" them. His pediatrician suggested tests when he seemed to her to be intelligent beyond his years. The evaluators gave their academic conclusions: Some kids just seem to get these things ""out of the air"" and he was one of them. Honest to God, that was the expression they used.<br/><br/>Numerous other marvelous instances of a ""miraculous"" vein have occurred in my own family's life's experiences. I submit to you, why do the Stephen Kings et al who present almost exclusively the darkside have the corner on the supernatural market? It's okay by today's standards to have the bejeebers scared out of us by the macabre, but to be encouraged by the extraordinary powers of our Creator? Why, that's just ""shameless hokum."" Do you know that each and every one of us has glorious potential within us if we'd just listen to the still small voice within? And that ain't ""hokum,"" folks! My heart truly goes out to those people who are of such a cynical, worldly nature that they cannot set aside their cerebral traits long enough to fathom the positive spiritual potentials of God.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Marylynn Stults"

"lzvenhaus","9","6","12","19 November 2007"," Lyrical, magical, emotional - a winning fable
","A very special film with unique qualities, ""August Rush"" wins your heart with strong performances from adorable Freddie Highmore as the orphan with the puppy-dog eyes and massive talent, charismatic Jonathan Rhys Meyers and gorgeous Keri Russell as the lovers torn apart by circumstances. An utterly original modern-day fable with elements of ""Oliver Twist,"" the plot normally would be considered totally implausible, but director Kirsten Sheridan makes it work -- because you root for these characters. And who doesn't want to believe in happily ever after, especially when you become so emotionally invested? With its emphasis on music as both a life-changing element and a lifeline, the film uses its excellent soundtrack as dialogue. The rhythms of everyday life become part of the score, and the eclectic mix of songs works well. Mark Mancina provided original music. The performers are perfect for their roles. Russell, so good as TV's ""Felicity,"" brings a classiness and intelligence to every part she plays. Dublin-born Meyers, who channeled the young vibrant Elvis in a CBS mini-series a few years ago, winning a Golden Globe, is always interesting on screen. And Highmore, who first came to prominence in ""Finding Neverland"" and then starred as the lead in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" is one of the most gifted child actors around. The cast also includes Terrence Howard as a sympathetic child services worker, pint-sized Jamia Simone Nash as a powerhouse vocalist, Mykelti Williams as a kind minister, and Alex O'Loughlin of TV's ""Moonlight"" as Lewis' brother Marshall. An interesting note, Meyers' real brother, Jamie O'Keefe, plays drums in the Connellys band. (Meyers used his mother's maiden name when he became an actor instead of O'Keefe). Kirsten Sheridan, daughter of the famed director Jim Sheridan, knows how to build suspense but the payoff might not fit everyone's idea of a good movie. She also co-wrote the outstanding ""In America,"" and has a knack for working with kids and finding the lyricism in storytelling. Music can change your life. And because it's the driving force of the film, the sound is exceptional, as is the film's lush look. ""August Rush"" is very uplifting, and rich with metaphors about the simplicity and beauty of music. If you believe, just go with the flow, and you'll be smiling while your eyes mist up, for it's a hopeful and heartwarming story that you don't find too often in our jaded, cynical world."

I went to see it again, and found once I no longer was distracted my the many over-the-top silliness, the story / movie was actually really good. I have seen a few times more, as the movie is easy to watch (or should I say, listen to).<br/><br/>I would categorize the overall feel of this movie with The Last Mimzy, Millions, Princes Bride, perhaps even Whale Rider, and of course any Oliver rendition. The movie is as ""sweet"" as Searching for Bobby Fisher. <br/><br/>Unlike some recent ""kid has/discovers/gets supernatural powers and learns to use them"" movies which IMHO are far more ""over-the-top"" than this movie, this movie attempts to elicit real emotion from the story instead of simply inspiring what-if dreams. <br/><br/>So, with high expectations, I picked up the soundtrack. It contained about half of what I wanted. It does contain the Main Theam, August's Rhapsody, Keri King (August's Guitar Solo) songs, and some stuff never heard in the move. It does not contain:<br/><br/>* Leon Thomas's (Arthur) solo's in the park <br/><br/>* The Music heard when Evan hears when first arriving in New York <br/><br/>* The Organ Music (which IMHO is very simple but really hits the core of the music themes in the movie.

"Robert_duder","Null","4","7","27 November 2007"," Really beautiful and the first of the truly moving Holiday films
","August Rush will bring some to tears. It'll be the people that have big hearts and love to open them and imagine and believe in destiny and magic. Then you'll have the realism driven, hard core, non-believers (Muggles if you will) who will likely be driven to vomit by the entirely sweet and moving August Rush. I figure critics will likely fall under the latter category but this might be the first film to really touch movie goers for the Holiday Season because although it's not Christmas focused at all it has this magic and destiny feel to it that is just downright sweet. On top of that there is some really great performances and while the film is not a musical, music plays a bigger role in this film than in some musicals. Aside from the completely non-descriptive one night stand on the roof top (it barely shows them kiss) and some scary moments involving the kids and their street caretaker the film is squeaky clean. A perfect family movie that everyone can love. Although never compared to or sold as a retelling the comparisons to Oliver Twist, to me, were glaring and that's not a bad thing. There just was a lot of comparisons and yet a completely different story.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore might be one of the greatest young actors of recent years. I really hope he finds his niche in adult acting but for the time being he really is amazing as the charismatic naive and perhaps slightly autistic...August Rush. I say slightly autistic not because it's ever mentioned but perhaps the way the character is portrayed. He has this unbelievable talent for music (coming from the fact both his parents are talented musicians) but he also has these moments where he loses himself in the music and hears beats in absolutely everything. His performance is magical, almost as magical as his unbelievable performance in Finding Neverland (see my review.) He easily carries this film on his own. Keri Russell is lovely and enchanting as Lyla Novacek, the boy's mother who has thought for the past 11 years that her son had died. Russell is very emotional and just a spectacle to watch and really draws you into the various emotions that she feels. She definitely captures the loving mother and the determined woman. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is charismatic and charming as the rocker Louis Connelly and the boy's father. Meyers and Russell really do have spectacular chemistry in their very brief romance and you want them to come back together because they both play such incredibly emotional characters. You become enthralled with the parents and the boy and the family they could be. Robin Williams turns in one of his greatest performances in ages and I absolutely adore Williams especially in serious roles. He plays slightly mislead homeless leader Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace. He has taken it upon himself to take in homeless kids and use their musical talents to collect funds out on the street. He takes a special interest in the incredibly talent August Rush and even gives him the name. He's not a bad guy per se, he does take care of the kids but he is overbearing and self involved and really goes off the deep end over August. Terrence Howard turns in a small and a little toned down performance as the determined and caring Social Worker who wants to reunite Russell with her son. Howard is a fine actor as shown earlier this year in The Brave One (see my review) but he's not given one of the bigger and more important roles and not a lot to work with so he kind of gets out shined.<br/><br/>I am not a musical expert nor a musician of any kind, much to my disappointment so they could have played those instruments in the film with their feet and it couldn't have mattered to me. But apparently it is really a HUGE deal that some or all of the actors weren't actually play their instruments in particular Russell's ""Horrid"" Cello performance. I'm quoting a reviewer on IMDb that said it ruined the whole film for her and that is really very sad because her acting was spot on and whether or not she held the cello right had nothing to do with magic and emotion of this film. It was really about destiny and of course you have to suspend belief a little to truly appreciate it because ultimately it's a modern day fairy tale and it's beautiful and sweet and I think people should stop over analyzing and enjoy it for what it is because it is so very entertaining and will bring tears to your eyes and a tap to your shoe. It's an adventure about an Orphan boy who just wants to have his music heard because he knows it will bring his parents back to him. Take the kids, take the family...it's just simply beautiful. 9/10"
"plesowiczmagda","10","4","7","24 November 2007"," I feel good inside!
","this movie leaves you feeling good, and having faith in general, about everything in life. You appreciate music and art just that much more. ""Music is the harmonic connection between living beings"". So true! By the way, Keri Russel learned the cello 4 hours a day from December to April! She did NOT fake it!! She did a fantastic job. You can tell, she's graceful and poise. John Myers does a good job too, true rock star! You don't appreciate music and art in everyday life, well then you won't like it. It's all around us, can't deny it! I'm an art student, and music is my life, my escape, so i was so happy to watch this movie. Music is not learned from books... it comes from within. What a beautiful film."
"lane-PennyLane","9","4","7","23 November 2007"," Not for your average....
","Forget believability--people don't go to the movies to see something they already know about. Sure, realism is great if you're down and looking for something familier. But if you're looking for something a little bit different, and entertaining--then just take a couple hours, and open your mind up.<br/><br/>I think music is one of the best subject matters for music. Combine that with a really cute kid, a heart-wrenching storyline, and a halfway decent background... and what do you know... here's a really good movie. The music isn't only entertaining, but the music itself isn't half bad.<br/><br/>This movie really isn't for everyone. But if you're creative or just open-minded, you might find that you'll really enjoy it."

","You will either buy into this contrived tale of orphan who hears music then runs off New York to find his parents or you won't.I didn't.<br/><br/>Cloyingly cute I had no patience for it and squirmed from the opening bits of the kid conducting the wind, through the flash back meeting of young rock star dad and rich girl cellist torn apart by her disapproving dad, on to the really annoying Robin ""Please put my head in a duck press to make me stop screaming"" Williams and then to the oh gee ending. I hated almost every moment other than the music. Whats worse was I didn't bail when I had the chance (what would it take stand up and walk out) and stayed to the hand holding ending in the hope that it would all turn around and I'd get weepy. No such luck.

"Farrell_at_IMDB","10","5","10","25 November 2007"," Excellent! A love story for lovers of life.
","August Rush is a modern-themed story about the power of a life force flowing through all of us and how synchronicity, faith and self-assuredness guarantee that each of us can personally fulfill our destiny. Although this film plays well to a broad audience, it is very mystical and based on simple, yet emotional themes that will play flat to some movie-goers.<br/><br/>If you have strong parental feelings or enjoy movies centered on the power of human love and attraction, this story will move you like few films ever have. Great for families- it's completely devoid of explicit scenes that make parents squirm and carries a positive message. Similarly, if you prefer uplifting stories championing the resilience of the human spirit, you'll love it. I gave the film a 10 for that reason- it will remain a personal favorite for years to come. However, if you are easily bored with themes that are lacking in danger and suspense or prefer gritty true-to-life movies, this one may come off as a disappointment.<br/><br/>The screenplay seems written as a spiritual message intimating that there is an energy field that connects all of life, and music is one of the domains available to any who care to experience it.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but deep in implication- an orphaned boy wants to reunite with his parents and feels that his inherited musical genius can somehow guarantee their return. Meanwhile, both parents languish in separation, fate having split them as quickly as it united them in parenthood. Neither know they are parents (see movie for explanation). The film itself was accomplished with imaginative directing and is studded with vivid imagery that punctuates the emotional ebb and flow of the story. <br/><br/>I liked the music, which was richly textured in genre, ranging from classical elements to a folksy modern collection of songs that were tastefully presented by some of the leading cast members. Music is the center-piece of this film, and it works.<br/><br/>I thought the casting was excellent, although none of characters really stood out from the others. Robin Williams plays an antagonistic role, delivering a smashing performance as an orphaned street-wise survivor of enormous depth and understanding, but tragically maligned by a life of rejection. This is a midrange performance by Williams, not the quiet and subdued moodiness of Good Will Hunting, nor the over-animated Morky style. He gives interesting color and charm to a darker figure synchronistically woven into the lives of his fellow cast members. Bravo! Young Freddie Highmore is sharp and charming, though narrow in expression. Just as expected, his natural charisma shines through in a most refreshing manner. Parents Keri Russell and Johnathan Rhys Meyers each lend flawless performances in captivating resonance with the other actors and the film itself. They are interesting and believable. Terrence Howard plays a small but significant part and underacts as well as Kingsly or Gielgud. Excellent! Leon G. Thomas III and Jamia Simone Nash (children) both earn honorable mention. This movie treads on every heartstring. I loved its invitation to believe in the extraordinary miracles of everyday life. Take your kids, your significant other, your parents, or any friend. It is August and will give you a very pleasant Rush. Sit back, breath deep, and get riveted!"
"tkelly-20","10","5","10","24 November 2007"," Happiest Ending Ever?
","August Rush may have the happiest ending in movie history. See it and judge for yourself.<br/><br/>While far from a perfect movie, it is perfectly entertaining for folks like me who don't mind getting lost in the film's world.<br/><br/>The script goes beyond belief at almost every turn but when we're talking about the world's greatest young orphan musician being reunited with his parents- who cares? The only distress I felt was the dreadful appearance of Robin Williams, I think it has gotten to the point where the only character he can plausibly play is himself.<br/><br/>I almost never see films twice but will definitely see this one again (maybe even again today) as it is about the music and the spirit, not the plot or the performances."
"kacedcpp","10","5","10","22 November 2007"," movie was phenomenal
","I saw this movie last night when it opened. I am a musician with 18 years of training and currently still finishing my training on the collegiate level. I thought this movie brought across some of the most wonderful aspects of music. Including the ability to produce music without knowledge of the standard conventions typically used. This is how I broke into music just by improvisation without any knowledge or technical skills yet making what I felt into music. The soundtrack is phenomenal as well and mixes new music with the standards of the classical and romantic music eras. I absolutely agree with Robin William's quote "" Music is the harmonic connection between all living beings"""
"rheymoon","1","14","38","17 November 2007"," Trite and disappointing.
","I anticipated a moving, uplifting feature. I was not impressed.<br/><br/>The acting was unconvincing, the character development nonexistent: Russell, who spends most of the film gazing wistfully at various points on the horizon, evokes virtually no sympathy as a woman who loses her son and lapses into a decade-long depression; Rhys-Meyers is flat and uninspiring as August's tortured rock-musician-turned-bond-trader father (""I'm sad...I'm Irish...I'm sad""); and Williams is only mildly creepy as Wizard, the Fagin-like ringmaster of a coterie of musical ragamuffins who live in (of course!) an abandoned theater. Highmore is sweetly clueless and has a few memorable lines, but his enormous talent is put to waste as he drifts through a fallible plot that speeds by him.<br/><br/>The music: Russell, who spent six months ""learning"" the cello, is an atrocious faker; she would make those with even a minimal amount of musical training cringe. Rhys-Meyers's performance scenes are slightly better, but we all know that Hollywood makes a great music video. The final concert is decent but unmoving, requiring an almost superhuman suspension of disbelief. Jamia Simone Nash, however, was excellent.<br/><br/>I had such high hopes for this movie, but it turned out to be a hokey bit of film-making that tried way too hard.<br/><br/>Honestly? Go see ""P2"" instead."
"imdb-5596","2","3","5","17 October 2010"," Silly cliché, flawed on every level save for Robin Williams
","First to the good points of this film. I will never really understand why Robin Williams continues to make films like this because he's superb. Particularly as a troubled villain, which I guess is what he's supposed to be here. Williams was the only high point for me and he earns my two stars on his own.<br/><br/>The bad points however go on and on. Where can I start? Characters. None of the characters are convincing, or have a plausible background to make them what they are. None of them develop in any credible way. Most if not all are clichés, parodies of something better. None has any depth or subtlety.<br/><br/>Premise. The premise is just too silly. I understand that we need to suspend disbelief to get the most out of fiction. This is too contrived, though. No serious effort is made to win us over to believe even enough to engage with the film.<br/><br/>Plot. The plot is irritatingly predictable and has more holes than anything I've seen or read in years. It's feels gratuitous, too - why make us wonder about these petty things when we already have to swallow the implausible premise? <br/><br/>Visuals. Nothing of note, nothing to see here. As dull as ditch water. Perhaps more importantly, the soundtrack is terrible. To engage with the premise I think the viewer needs to be inspired by the music, but we were all cringing. It was so very cheesy, and had no edge or charisma. The painful attack on Van Morrison - why was this necessary? So many have succeeded here but for some reason the studio indulged Rhys Meyers' own hash at it. Worst of all though is what I can only describe as a naff fusion of orchestra and American-Irish rock. Surely this silly notion has been done to death, but we are asked to buy it as an expression of how together and how brilliant the characters are.<br/><br/>But it goes on. Hollywood often relishes Irish stereotypes but we all but see Rhys Meyers in a Leprechaun outfit Riverdancing around an enormous pint of Guinness chirping ""to be sure to be sure"". If any other aspect of the film had worked this kind of stuff would have broken the spell. The nonsense of slapping the guitar, always conveniently in open tuning. Why? That cheesy ""pick of destiny"" moment. The saccharine rainbow of musical urchins. And tarnishing the glorious memory of Don't Look Now. Like most films this was too long, but the last 40 minutes felt literally like hours.<br/><br/>Under the skin of all of this seem to be frothing hormones boiling over, a coo-cooing around a romantic notion of the child and above all a total absence of editorial control over whoever's idea this was. <br/><br/>Film fans will find nothing to see here. Don't waste your time, there's paint drying somewhere which you could be watching instead,"
"cjhinx","10","3","5","23 May 2010"," A Great Piece of Work
","What a refreshing change from the normal movie scene. This movie is one of the best written movies I have seen. Each scene in the movie ties into the main story line without being predictable. The music is the thread that helps tie everything together. It was a story rich in character and plot. I would agree it is a modern day Oliver Twist. Definitely a classic. I would love to see Freddie Highmore in another movie. He is a very talented young actor. He deserved his award for Best Performance by a Young Actor. This movie was entertaining and thought provoking with its message to listen to the music all around you. I hope more directors and producers will make films like this one."
"jeffreyjets","10","3","5","4 April 2010"," Sweetest Movie I have seen in years
","August Rush is quite simply one of the best movies I have seen in years. I loved that it dealt with tough subjects of life along with an endearing faith in hope and they do it without all the harsh language and cheap thrills of sex. The acting, storyline, direction and cinematography are very good with special mention for Robin Williams, Terence Howard and Keri Russell. The music, of course, is the highlight. The score is always interesting and integrating the stories of the main characters together. They did use the technique of time line jumping for a period of time, jumping back and forth in time, which does annoy some people. Young and old really enjoy this movie and the music. I have no idea how it didn't win an award for best score."
"tony_hawk2","10","3","5","9 July 2009"," I literally though I had missed out on this film
","I'm 17 years old and when I watched this movie earlier tonight I had no idea of the background, or when it was made. And honestly, the atmosphere of this movie made it seem like it was made in the early 90's and was a well renowned kids film. When I heard it was only made two years ago I was shocked, I was unfamiliar with all the lead roles except for Terrence Howard and Robin Williams, and they looked youthful as if this movie could have been made many years ago. It so well captured all the good aspects of the touching, tumultuous search of an orphan in search of something better. The whole way through I thought it was just some movie I had missed out on as a younger kid and I was thrilled to see they still make movies like this today."
"dougstone1965","10","3","5","2 July 2009"," This movie was touching on so many levels.
","So many people miss the the most important meaning of this story. It is the immutable bond of parent and child. Until you have had children and lost them for whatever reason, this story will be a complete mystery to you. For those of you who have had children and lost them, I don't need to explain. Our children will always garner the best of their parents and with the right guidance, will always be greater than the sum of their parts. It is an unavoidable fact of life.<br/><br/>Parents and children lost to each other at birth or even later almost always seek each other out. Some are successful, some are not. What almost always comes to light is an almost eerie parallel to each other's life uninfluenced by any other factors than the natural progression of maturation and heredity. This movie is one of my all time favorites, it cannot fail to touch even the most hardened heart. Great story and film."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","3","5","5 April 2009"," Music Is In Everything
","Kirsten Sheridan and the writers seem to have made something from the heart. 'August Rush' is a modern fairy tale story but there is something so beautiful and enchanting about the way it has been brought to screen. The first thing that struck me was the music. Not only are the tracks so mesmerizing and foot-tapping but the way music is used to play a character, to have a life of it's own, is incredible. Moreover the fusion of different music is stunningly done. The portrayal of the cities, through the lively cinematography, with music acting as a guide, make them look like a magical place to be. Sound effect has been used to its best.<br/><br/>Next to being great actors, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a pretty good singer and the luminous Keri Russell is a talented musician. They also have an electric chemistry which makes the love story very convincing. Freddy Highmore is impressive yet again. Robin Williams and Terence Howard lend excellent support.<br/><br/>Jim Sheridan happens to be one of my favourite directors but it seems that his daughter, Kirsten Sheridan, isn't far behind. She's poured her heart into making this an enchanting experience that will appeal to children and captivate and move adults. 'August Rush' is breathtaking."
"mollidew","10","3","5","5 February 2009"," Great Fantasy Movie
","This movie was excellent; the acting, choice of actors and music. It is an adventure in music. Yes it is unbelievable as a real world story and almost metaphorical with shades of Oliver Twist. This is something you watch and ride on the emotions it brings out. It is not suppose to be taken as truth. Many movies of this type have been made over the years. The only difference with August Rush is that it is set in modern times. The movie whets your imagination and carries you into a realm of if you believe hard enough everything you wish will come true. In the case of this story, he communicated through music.<br/><br/>It is somewhat old-fashioned good watching which wouldn't appeal to modern day watchers who prefer blood, guts and horror. It mixed real world happenings where children were used to make money but not in the usual way shown in movies but through their musical talents. It was a musical fantasy that had a happy ending...what more can anyone say. One cannot pick something apart that isn't suppose to be believed to have happened. August Rush is a modern day fairytale."

Watching this movie prompted me to look up the writer, request Freddie Highmore as a myspace friend, and register for an IMDb account just to post this comment! It is full of modern greatness and the story supported the whole movie without any need for stunts, sex, or violence to entertain the audience. I wish there were more movies like this!!! I can't believe how much I loved this movie. It speaks to me of the simple elegance that Hollywood used to be. I watched it twice back to back and just listening to the movie is as nice as watching it. I knew I loved the movie after 10 minutes of watching it and I was chewing my nails right up to the end. This movie was absolutely wonderful and I will keep it as an inspirational example of poetic genius. Well done!!!!!! Refreshing."

Everything is about that immortal hope and the simple music life offers you daily, the kind of music you just have to stop in the middle of the park and listen to , listen like you will never hear anything again.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful love story, between two lovers from different social worlds, but perfect for one another, they fell in love the minute they've first seen each other and then they are separated by faith. From their consumed love, a son is born, of whom the mother believes to be dead and the father knows nothing of.<br/><br/>More then 10 years later, the family is brought together by their unique love for music, by faith and by love.

I thought the premise of the story was a good one; A boy given up for adoption attempts to find his birth parents, because his love for music gives him the sense that his parents are still alive. <br/><br/>The problem is the execution lacked believability, his miraculous ability to write sheet music despite having never seen it before for example. On the other hand his unusual method of playing guitar was more believable of someone who had natural musical talent but did not understand fully how the instrument was played. The whole movie was like this, it did manage to make me shed a tear or 2 at the end however."

","OK. I'm a guy. But I've got to tell you that I've watched this movie three times and, every time, I cried at the ending. It's nice watching something that has a happy ending because, in life, there are too many unhappy ones. What I really think we're talking about, here, is hope. And there seems to be little enough of that today in the world. The faith and hope this young boy has in the story that some day he will find his parents no matter what others say. I'm sure that running into your father (or son) by accident without knowing it, especially in New York City, is a statistical impossibility, but they do. And they both feel something special about that meeting although they don't know what. And August's mother has this feeling that he's alive, that he's out there somewhere. Twins separated at birth have the feeling that their other twin exists. Sometimes you just need to enjoy a really wonderful movie and not pick it to pieces. This is one of them. Bravo!!!"

","I came about this film on a rack at Target for $4.99, and, not knowing what it was about, bought it. Later in the day I sat down with my family and watched it... and found out that, surprisingly, it turned out to be one of the best movies I have ever been in. The reason I said 'been in' is because, unlike just about every single other movie, with 'August Rush' you are actually involved in the movie, both with your emotions and your senses. Watching the movie brought me to a completely different place than I had been before, and unlike most modern day afternoons, I did not once check my cell phone or facebook, instead I had my eyes glued to the TV watching what would happen next in this suspenseful yet accessible story. I think, probably, this is THE BEST movie I have ever seen, and I hope that many people are just as touched by it as I was. Some of the themes shown to me through this story taught me lessons I will be sure not to forget."

","When I first went to watch ""August Rush"", I thought I had to check thiz out just because it's one of the musical movies (Recently, I have seen many and I'm kind of enamored of those musical movies). In the end of the movie, I realize thiz movie is so full-hearted. The story is very simple but strong, I always appreciate simple movie that can express a lot. It's a story about a boy who's eager to find his origin and meaning of his presence. Thiz boy is natural born talent in music, just like his father and mother who are talented musicians. It's all about music. It's told beautifully, the plot has some flashback moments. But don't worry you will not be confused by its method of story-telling. It's directed by woman Director, Kirsten Sheridan. The wonder boy Freddie Highmore performs impressively with his innocent charisma. I think Highmore is definitely lucky to always get involved in some memorable movies. Another Actor who performs a significant role in thiz movie is Jonathan Rhys Myers. He is very lovable, his role as a rock star makes him looks cool. About the ending (Spoiler Alert!), the movie ends with the scene when his father and mother has finally met after many years. And not long after that, they find their boy in a concert stage as well, performs as conductor in an orchestra. The boy doesn't even know his parents have been watching him. And the movie just ends that way. I very much understand that is the perfect ending, that scene describes with beautiful and elegant way. It shows the meaning of hope could be better from now on.

","I really wasn't ready for the emotional impact of this magical story.<br/><br/>It happened to combine loss, yearning, romance and music into a touching bittersweet fairytale. But a fairytale that you so want to believe in. <br/><br/>Freddie Highmore drew you into the sensual world of a lonely neglected child desperate to create beautiful things. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell were well suited as sincerely in love lovers and Robin Williams was a surprise portraying the obligatory 'bad guy' alternatively lashing out with cynicism then touching vulnerability.<br/><br/>The fateful coincidences are the kind you dream of when you think your loss is to be born forever.<br/><br/>And as if that wasn't enough, the aural feast was a soundtrack worthy of an Oscar. <br/><br/>This film made me want to try."

","The movie is about a guy and a girl and their lost child, in the end the three find each other in a beautiful way, happy ending. I was expecting a romantic movie. But, this movie was much more..<br/><br/>The beauty of the movie lies in the mysterious way it is presented, with music. How all the three main characters of the movie(child, mother and father) connect with each other and feel the presence of each other through their music.. <br/><br/>The visuals of the movie were stunning like the wind blowing in the grass shown from top angle. The soundtracks were perfectly captivating the situations, portrayed in the movie. Freddie Highmore as August Rush(the child), Keri Russell as the mother and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the father fit perfectly in their roles, making the movie more believable and beautiful.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie and a must see for anybody who can feel the music. Because even if everything around you falls apart, you can escape and let go in music.."
"jcook56050","9","2","3","5 August 2009"," It's the Music
","August Rush is not one of those films you can watch from the middle. In order to comprehend and enjoy the artful filming, seamlessly integrated music track, and a subtle story line that works on so many different levels, one must see the film from beginning to end several times. If there is one particular aspect of the film that sets it apart from so many others of its genre, a tip of the hat must be given to how hard the producers worked to join the actions on screen with the carefully chosen and performed music. Too many films of this type attempt to convince the audience that the main characters are musicians of extraordinary caliber, and end up convincing us there is no relationship between what we are seeing and what we are hearing. August Rush shows us moments of music creation that do not necessarily need to be perfectly synced to convince us that extraordinary talent is being given a chance to rise above the mundane and ignorant realities of everyday life. Here we have a music genus seeking expression with an innocence of youth that transcends the frustration and violence of his temporary keeper, a sadly flawed man who is doomed to roam the halls of mediocrity and short sightedness. Rarely do we savor Robin Williams with no sense of humor, but ""Wizard"" Wallace manages to make us feel uncomfortable every moment he appears on screen. Most people of extraordinary ability tend to understand their art to a depth and breadth that extends far beyond the comprehension of their audience. The film makers have certainly given us a small glimpse into the world of such genus. The teachers of Julliard School immediately see Rush's talent, and are ready to help him, though so many such talents simply go unseen and unfulfilled in the world. August Rush hears music all around him, and is forced by an inner drive to compose. He also subliminally understands that his music message will bring him the one thing he wants most of all, to be reunited with his real parents. What wonderful music that moment becomes."

","This is one of those rare movies that is not only a fantasy, because the likelihood of this ever happening is next to none, but a fantasy that will have you believing every second of every scene in this movie. You can easily get carried away in the superb music of this film and not realize it until it's over. I guarantee that if you have any sort of imagination, you will not be able to watch this movie only once.<br/><br/>I've already mentioned the superb music, but the acting is also something to mention. Freddie Highmore has you believing in his quest to find his family and his natural understanding of music. Meyers and Russell are excellently cast too, and his own music performances are deserving of awards.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie, then you are missing something that shouldn't be missed. The story and music will both give you chills throughout the movie as you experience the magic of the music."

Laila became very sorrowful. The name of their son is August Rush. August grows up to be a very talented musician and entered Juliard Music school at a very young age.

","I'm not a fan of musical movies; however, I thought I would give this film a try. I can say I'm so glad I did, and I will for sure be watching more musical films. It is one of those rare occasions where I never felt bored not even for half a minute through the entire movie. That day I did not find something exciting to watch, and given that I'm not a fan of musical movies (or so I thought), It was not really an easy call to decide to spend two hours watching this movie, but I thought I would give it a try. Once I watched the kid Freddie Highmore tearing for the loss of his parents I was starting to get attached to the movie, and once I started tasting the music this film contains and with all beautiful emotions flying around I was amazed and could not take my eyes off the screen till the finish."

","In recent times i watched over 1000 movies that included crappy ones like The objective, Wisegal etc. and now i saw August Rush. It was like a rainfall in desert. A movie which is a complete mixture of love, emotions, romance, frustration, giving-up, passion, determination, determination and yes of course desire. A fantabolous casting with awesome performances made this movies a movie of life-time. I watched this keeping certain things in my mind like it will of those musical crabs which doesn't even reflect the purity of music. Thought it will be just a past-killer cracker but for the first time in my life i loved to be disappointed. As the time was passing i was worried that it is going to end soon which i never wanted and when it ended i was left with a smile of satisfaction. A movie which can be seen by any age group but gives only one lesson to everyone of them that is ""never give up"". This movies just gives u an inspiration. The character August Rush/Evan Taylor was perfectly casted so do the others but to the hats off."

","I don't understand how anyone can say this movie is bad. This post was originally in response to a previous post and I felt it necessary to post again. First your comment about getting into Julliard with out any money. If you knew anything about non-profit orgs you would know they are all willing to shell out for someone they think can bring back more than they invest ( I work with NP's) . Second, if you have ever known someone who has true musical talent you know that they can learn to read and write sheet music in seconds. I'm sorry you haven't experienced that but I have. Third, you have to believe in the true spirit of movies. They can't show you 18 weeks of practice in one movie because you'd walk out saying worse things than you are saying now. Do you think that the Godfather really happened in 3 hours ( well the first one, almost)? Finally, back to your first point that this movie doesn't have a convincing storyline. I think you know my opinion on that at this point. I'm sorry this made your list of ""most hated movies"" but it is on my list of ""most loved movies""."
"snarlah-1","8","2","3","1 November 2008"," Mozart and Oliver Twist
","Many people understood the urban fairy tale that is ""August Rush,"" and some may have noticed the relation between Mozart, child musical prodigy, and Oliver Twist, stolen by Fagin (as played here by Robin Williams,) but I don't think that anyone else here has noticed all connections or the third connection--the theft of brilliant musicians by the owners of music studios and those who have paid virtually nothing to great musicians for the rights to their music. <br/><br/>What a lovely score with 3 marvelous actors who look like a family.<br/><br/>Then there is Fagin, who stole children and had them steal money and pick pockets in lower-class England. Obviously, Mozart was not related to that aspect of the story, because the child prodigy who died too young was an amazing musician, but lived among the upper classes and was a wild child. Still, to miss two major connections--Oliver Twist and Mozart--is to miss very most important aspects of the movie."
"UnoriginalJess","5","2","3","27 September 2008"," A stunning soundtrack can't save the drivel that is 'August Rush'
","Part romance, and mostly sentimental mush, August Rush is the perfect example of a film that had the potential to be good, but failed miserably. Keri Russell, who plays Lyla, is clearly attempting the dreamy musician look, but succeeds only in looking dazed and confused, and Rhys Meyers (Louis) looks as though he is nursing a perpetual hangover. Together, they make the perfect intoxicated couple, so the audience is not at all surprised when we are introduced to Evan (the talented Freddie Highmore) and he wears a constant faraway expression and whispers in a hoarse voice.<br/><br/>The film is promoted as 'gentle fantasy' and 'a modern fairytale', and tells the story of supposed music prodigy Evan's attempts to find his estranged parents through the supernatural musical connection they share. Evan's musical gift is obvious from the start; in the opening scene, he is sitting in a field with an ecstatic look as he listens to the grass sing and whispers distantly about the omnipresence of music. This connection with music eventually drives him to escape the orphanage and walk unsteadily through strange roads until he ends up in modern-day New York. Once there, he is adopted and renamed 'August Rush' by Wizard (Robin Williams) the erratic street musician, who houses homeless children, buys them instruments, and exploits their musical talent.<br/><br/>The odd mix of beautiful music and talented actors with a terrible script and contrived plot is the rhythm and pulse for the next hour and fifty-three minutes. It must admitted that the music sequences- such as Highmore's first introduction to a guitar and to a local Gospel choir- have flavour and flair, and the music soundtrack is probably one of the best in recent films. Composer Mark Mancina evokes an otherworldly feel in his thrilling score, but director Kristen Sheridan fails to capitalise on this, and what could have been a truly inspirational and heart warming story is ruined by the clunky, cliché-filled script Nick Castle and James Hart seem intent on shoving down their audience's throats.<br/><br/>The film over-exaggerates August's musical genius, and the scene where he sees a pipe organ and, within the space of one day, teaches himself to play it- replete with pedalling and a thorough understanding of stop registration- is an insult to any musician. Whilst it is perfectly acceptable to ask an audience for suspension of disbelief, August Rush requires one to throw one's disbelief out the back door before muzzling it and putting it in cold storage. The sheer absurdity of many of the plot holes- most of which can be seen a mile off- is too much to handle, even from a film that peddles itself on its 'gentle fantasy'.<br/><br/>Whilst the final scene features a soul-stirring symphony, the ending is more than a little abrupt. Despite its near-redeeming soundtrack, August Rush is an ambitious failure as a film, and not even a solid effort from Freddie Highmore can divert the audience from its insulting, insipid script and cliché-ridden plot."
"SFTVLGUY2","3","2","3","15 August 2008"," You Needn't Rush to See This Film
","I'm usually a sucker for films about lost love, joyful reunions, and impossible dreams fulfilled, with everyone living happily ever after as the final credits roll. But the premise here is so preposterous I actually laughed at the sappy ending, a culmination of so many unlikely coincidences it was totally unbelievable. Freddie Highmore is charmingly earnest as the titular character, a young boy who feels mystically drawn to the parents he never knew, from whom he supposedly inherited a musical genius that allows him to play instruments flawlessly the first time he touches them and write a majestic classical symphony after taking a few classes at Julliard. Robin Williams, in a typically manic performance, is the Fagin-like character who welcomes August into the lair of lost boys he sends out to perform as street musicians and whose contributions he collects at the end of the day. If you're willing to believe a twelve-year-old would be called upon to conduct the New York Philharmonic in Central Park, and his long-lost parents magically would find each other in an audience of thousands sprawled across the vast Sheep Meadow, then this malarkey should delight you to no end."
"chuckej","10","2","3","14 August 2008"," August Rush captures the current state of music making...and still makes you smile...
","Here's a beautiful fairy tale of a movie that conveys in the realest sense imaginable the power of music albeit in a fanciful manner. And yet, it also encompasses a large swath of the musical world's present reality in 2 hours of pure joy. What does it say about the state of music making? You've got Lyla, the ""establishment classical"" figure  obviously loves music, loves playing  but is hyper controlled by a father who ego-maniacally conspires to plot her present and future. They did a great job of establishing his character without dwelling on it. For Lyla, you get that sense that she really didn't choose her life  although she has flourished in the path taken. Within Lyla, and within real-world classical prodigies everywhere  you get a glimpse of the sheltering, the dedication, the talent and the roads foregone  the approach to life that seems to accompany a certain kind of greatness. When does the point between a parent's desire to foster, nurture and focus a child's ability (and the parent's selfish desire) and the child's right to self determination happen. Does it happen? Lyla seems to put this question up for grabs.<br/><br/>Then there's Louis. The kind of rocker you probably signed up for. Raw talent, brute independence, Irish immigrant/U2 vibe  all the vitality and intensity that accompanies twenty somethings with angst and potential. You get that sense (I'm sure intentionally) that he crawled out of Angela's ashes so he could share his story via his music. The linchpin of the band  he's the talent and alas (for the band), the glue. Having been around musicians a good chunk of my life, we see in Louis the reason so many smart, independent kids are drawn to a life of song. They live close to the soul, they seek meaning and share their emotions in a charismatic way that makes a romantic view of the world seem permanent, desirable, possible and rewarding.<br/><br/>So Evan/August is our last piece of this triangle. How can you not love him? You must, if you have an ounce of belief left in your musical heart of hearts. So many metaphors are easy to reach from his character that its practically cliché to describe them. Yet, there's this subtlety in the creation of Evan  and the presentation is good here  the joining of Lyla and Louis is not some kind of ""I saw you on stage"" followed by, ""No, I saw YOU on stage"" follow by ""oh my god aren't we these great musicians and wouldn't we be great together"" kind of tripe. No, it was just chance, mood, independence, timing and a soul's longing that brought them together. Thank god this was a movie since in movies it's easy to eliminate the interim patter and make the big point without having to delve into the little moments of banal chat that comprise our early social interactions. The subtlety here is that music was truly what defined these two, and yet, the movie leaves unspoken how it defined their brief relationship. So, a love child here is destined to use music as a vehicle and a sort of spiritual GPS unit to unite the parents and give everyone a second chance at a meaningful life.<br/><br/>The even-handedness of the Juilliard scene is great too. So often the hip side of music tends to cast these institutions into the lump that ""The Wizard"" tries to cast them. It's the ""you can't teach music, it's too ethereal"" view. Yet, the integrity of the instructor in the wizard confrontation can't be denied, and you can't help but see how the allusions to the evolution of music and composition in general might come from such a place. Love of music is not the sole province of the starving artist street musician. The music school, for all its potential false promises  still can enthrall and deliver. Meanwhile, August Rush delivers a fantastic movie experience that touches the core of our collective musical souls."

My brother was quite a famous actor in Hollywood who worked with John Travolta, John Goodman, David Boreanas and many more, but very sadly passed away five years ago. I will never meet him but my Mother and Sisters tell me how great he was as a brother and son.

","I spent the entire length of this movie overjoyed, but on the edge of my seat. The amazing complexity in which August hears the world is breathtaking. He finds music in the most unexpected places - subway trains running along their tracks, basketballs bouncing on the playground, wheat blowing in the field. Everything he hears is inspiration for a grand symphony in his head, one he doesn't know how to play. Once he touches a guitar for the first time, and then a piano, and after that an organ, his musical thoughts are brought to life. The symphony he composes is an intricate masterpiece that left me with a fantastic sense of euphoria at the end. Never have I felt so exhausted, yet rejuvenated, at the conclusion of a movie."
"gradyharp","8","2","3","19 March 2008"," Music and the Harmony of the Universe: A Film for Dreamers
","AUGUST RUSH will not go down in history as a profound film: many will even go so far as to dismiss it as kitsch, maudlin, and a simpleton take off on 'Oliver Twist', and other pejoratives. For this viewer the little film is tender and frequently requires suspension of belief, but in the end the idea of the story does indeed bring a tear to the eye.<br/><br/>Based on a story by Paul Castro and Nick Castle and transformed for the screen by Castle and James V. Hart, the premise is that of a fairytale, but an unusual fairytale built around the impact of music. On one magic night in New York City classical cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and popular Irish guitarist/singer Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meet on a rooftop, languishing in their own disappointments with life and finding solace in each other's arms, and that night Lyla becomes pregnant, never to see Louis again, and struggling to keep her baby despite her father's demands to abort. Lyla delivers her baby boy, but the child is immediately taken away (Lyla is told the child was stillborn). 'Evan Taylor' AKA August Rush (Freddie Highmore) is placed in an orphanage, longing for parents he believes he can 'hear' in the music of the spheres. Compelled to find his parents he escapes the orphanage after eleven years and is taken in by Faginesque Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace (Robin Williams) who teaches his street urchins the fine art of pick pocketing and playing music on the streets as buskers. Renamed August Rush, Evan has uncommon musical talents and rapidly becomes a big money maker for Wizard while at the same time being discovered as a potential pupil for Juilliard by Reverend James (Mykelti Williamson) and his girl singer Hope (Jamia Simone Nash) with assistance from kindly social worker Richard Jefferies (Terrence Howard). August Rush composes a rhapsody that is to be played in Central Park, a chance to place his music before the world and attract his parents, both of whom have returned to music careers after eleven years absence and learn of the existence of August Rush, their 'unknown son'. And yes, the ending is a happily ever after one...<br/><br/>Kirsten Sheridan directs with a sure hand and a keen eye toward make believe. The cast is strong, especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and the musical score, a very mixed bag, provides a suitable background for the story. This is one of those movies that asks us to go along with a lot of improbable events, but the pleasure of the experience is worth the journey. Grady Harp"
"Argemaluco","6","2","3","18 March 2008"," It's not bad but it did not convince me too much
","August Rush is not a bad movie but it has various failed points.Let's see them.First of all,the magic realism this movie uses is a cheap trick for telling a story without too much logic and which also is badly raised.Robin Williams brings a horribly irritating performance.Do not misunderstand me.I think Williams is a brilliant actor but his performance in here is inappropriate for the movie.Still,it's not a bad movie.Freddie Highmore brings a good performance and he shows charisma for his role and the movie brings a good and valid message.August Rush has a lot of fails but,still with that,it's not a bad film.I think I can recommend it if you are looking for something entertaining and nothing else."

Unfortunately after a promising start showing the interaction and tensions of orphanage life for the strangely talented youngster the whole plot descends into insulting implausibility and effusive schmaltz - even my wife couldn't bear it.<br/><br/>The youngster while on his mission to find his parents pulls off ever more unbelievable musical feats and of course we discover his parents are either already those affluent nice people, or the sort that can mutate from rough musicians to chauffeur driven businessmen at whim. A great idea, reasonable cast, terrible plot development, cloying schmaltz and very predictable ending."

Assuredly, there are beautiful scenes in this, but for me, the film just plain doesn't connect. I actually had trouble getting through it.<br/><br/>I find myself comparing this with ONCE, another movie which while not actually a musical relied on the music to help it along. In that case, the music helped create a flow that kept me interested and ultimately caused me to fall in love with the film. However, that didn't happen for me in this. The predictability and sugar sweetness bothered me much more in this than such things usually do, and I just found myself waiting for the film to end.<br/><br/>Reading other reviews, I don't want to discourage people from seeing this because many, especially those who love music, may feel differently than I do about it. It's clear that those behind this were well-intentioned and I'm sure that those who like me are disappointed by it still are glad that we gave it a chance."
"jrprossdog","3","1","1","18 April 2020"," Really wanted to like it
","I really did. And I really just didn't like it. At all. I appreciated the acting performances but that was about it. The premise sounded promising; brings musician myself, I thought I would love a movie about a child musical prodigy.<br/><br/>But here's the problem. As a musician, what was in the movie simply doesn't happen. Someone can't beat the strings of a guitar one time, re-tune the guitar, and then start playing beautiful music in a way nobody ever had before. It left the stratosphere of believability. It was to the point that I was irritated watching it unfold.<br/><br/>Ok, as some say, ""but it's meant to be kind of a fairy tale!""<br/><br/>I like a good fairy tale. I do. I liked the Wizard of Oz. One of my all time favorites is a modern fairy tale, Tim Burton's Big Fish. But August Rush was not presented as such. It was presented as though we are expected to believe it. The presentation of such a story in that way just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>And sorry to blow the ending (hence the spoiler alert) but a boy playing music does not magically somehow call his estranged parents to be with him. It is such a bizarre concept, in a realistically presented movie that it really left me shaking my head and wishing I had just watched something else.<br/><br/>So if you're a musician, please skip it. You'll undoubtedly hate it. If you require any semblance of believability whatsoever in a plot if a movie, skip it. You won't like it either. But it's rating us in the mid 7's right now. So apparently a lot of people do.<br/><br/>I really don't know who those people are."

While being swept up by a street musician pimp, his real parents, who have been apart since his conception, begin to get drawn back to him by the spirit of music. Will his true parents and the boy ever meet up together and will he be able to reach his true musical potential as a conductor? If you go along for the ride, this is totally watchable yet too often it was overly far-fetched and it telegraphed plot points yet the core idea was intriguing.

His mother played by Keri Russell, was told by her father that the little baby boy was killed but in fact he was put up for adoption by him. When she learns that he is still alive she goes to find him. Keri Russell played the part of his mother really well. I'm not a big fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers but he was OK in this film. The ending was so touching and it will definitely pull on your heart strings. A lovely film and definitely worth watching!"

","This movie revolves around an orphan named Evan Taylor played by Freddie Highmore. Evan is searching for his parents and driven by the music in his head. This theme propels the ""quest"". Both mother and father are musicians and their son turns out to be a prodigy Amadeus style. There are Oliver Twist overtones which provides the conflict.<br/><br/>Wizard, played by Robin Williams, takes the role of Fagin. New York city urchins give Wizard money they receive busking on the streets. Wizard plans to capitalize on Evan's talent and act as his promoter. August Rush is a name Wizard provides because it has more pop and marketability. <br/><br/>The highs and lows through the movie are mild and I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop Hollywood style. It was actually nice that a chainsaw wielding maniac did not show up and ruin everybody's day. <br/><br/>There is plenty of acoustic guitar music peppered through the movie, which adds to the experience. Mark Mancina's compositions are exceptional, which makes the soundtrack a compelling purchase.<br/><br/>Reviewers claim that the parents hookup is unrealistic or being drawn back together by the boys musical talent is highly unlikely. Every theater goer in world knows you have to check your skepticism in the lobby. To enjoy any film one must suspend their disbelief or not go in the first place. For those who did not like the movie my suggestion is to drive to the sketchy part of town wearing a sandwich board with ethnic slurs written in bold letters. Your day will get real and real quick."
"swallacegrey","8","1","1","2 October 2015"," A truly rare kind of film, over-the-top and a little storybook-like, but very truthful.
","The thing that strikes me about this film is that it definitely has a fantastical sort of story-telling, full of odd coincidences and some less-than-plausible aspects, but the film makes no effort to be anything other than what it is. The film doesn't try that hard to be documentary, because that's not what it set out to do. The film is meant to inspire and, IMO, it does a superb job. On paper this film sounds very clichÃ©d and cookie-cutter. It is definitely a hard film to describe properly but here's my take:<br/><br/>While the film is technically about Evan ""August Rush"", it is equally focused on the parallel-story of his biological parents; Lyla, a world-class Cellist who has her whole life plotted out by her controlling father; and Louis, a decent rock-musician who is constantly berated and held back by his less-than-supportive brothers/band.<br/><br/>The real plot of the movie is about escaping inner loneliness to reach your true self. Evan deals with bullying at his orphanage for being ""a freak"". Lyla is controlled and suffocated by her father and peers, forbidden from doing anything ""improper"". Louis is deep and seeks a true partner but is teased by his shallow brothers for being too emotionally sensitive.<br/><br/>All 3 characters are motivated by music and love, all 3 are surrounded by idiots. As the movie progresses each character suffers consequences of other people's selfishness, meets obstacles, in the case of Evan's parents: bad timing and ""real life"", in the case of Evan: homelessness. <br/><br/>The woman who plays Lyla, Evan's mom, for me, is the strongest character, superbly acted and scripted, and perfectly cast. She and Robin Williams are the adult stars of the film - and in my opinion, this is one of Freddie Highmore's best childhood roles (IDK, apparently he's Norman bates now, IDK, I have no interest in that show). This film is not exactly for everyone though, as the camera work is a little ""rough around the edges"" and the story's a little in-your-face, subtlety-wise; but if you have parenthood issues, or a natural gift that others don't appreciate, or basically any emotional problems, boy is this the film for you!<br/><br/>The thing that, for me, sets this film apart is how 3D the characters are. I first noticed like in the scene where Louis's brother 1# teases Louis after not seeing each other for years after their falling out, 2# punches Louis at Louis' request, and #3 ""cheers"" Louis ""up"" after Louis' girl-friend angrily drives away by saying ""aren't you supposed to be IN the car driving off to the sunset?"". And it occurred to me, the brother, Louis' antagonist in the film, is actually TRYING to bond with his brother, but on a selfish ""let's party"" level, and it's not that his brother is actively trying to pour lemon juice on Louis' heartbreak, he's trying to help Louis feel better - though in all the WRONG ways. Basically every ""villain"" in this movie actually has a viable motivation for making the 3 protagonists' lives a living hell.<br/><br/>So the film's not about fighting villains or adversity, it's about fighting fundamental conflicts of principle. Louis' brothers seriously think they're doing the right thing, casting off his heartbreak over Lyla as ""she's just a girl, you'll get over her"" Lyla's dad seriously believes he's helping her by ruining every part of her non-Cello-playing life. This is what intrigues me above all else because this is how I think evil actually works.<br/><br/>Also fascinating is how it deals with the adult world, depicting a world where sex, drugs, and alcoholism clearly exists, but tastefully not focusing on it. In a way, Lyla's disinterest in the not-safe-for-kids surroundings of a party accentuates her inner predicament and censors the film at the same time. <br/><br/>So don't let this film's child star or rating fool you - this is a film with two, fully fleshed out, adult, and highly mature, intelligent main characters, and one child main character, each leading 3 separate stories that properly capture how that character sees and hears the world. Evans' scenes are filled with childlike curiosity of the outside world, Lyla and Louis' scenes are remarkably non-watered-down AND interesting depictions of the jaded problems adults face. I watched this film as an adolescent and appreciated Evan's character while being moderately not-bored with the adults' characters, I watched it again as an almost-adult and connected with the parents' characters while being okay with Evan's character. It defies the face of audience-aging conventions.<br/><br/>This film is a comprehensive guide on abusive relationships, true love for something greater, confronting the powerlessness of your situation, and inner healing, all wrapped up in a PG/G rated film. No small feat, in my opinion. <br/><br/>And the music is truly beautiful. The entire film integrates phrases and aspects of the final rhapsody throughout Evan's journey as he's inspired by his surroundings, so at the end, the preceding film is brought together and retold in his song. There are a few films that make me fight back tears. Toy Story 3, and this.<br/><br/>A somewhat amateurish film that achieves what it sets out to do: A musical journey of fighting against the apathy of others to reach your dream. What it lacks in objective quality, it more than makes up for in emotion - if the message speaks to you, but if you don't get it, you'll probably think ""meh"". But for ME, it's poetry, so for what it's worth, I HIGHLY recommend seeing this film."
"amlanasaa","8","1","1","23 August 2015"," August Rush reminds us that the yearning of the heart is the best music of all for that is how we reach out to each other and discover the love that binds us together.
","August Rush (Evan Taylor) is a musically gifted orphan whose parents' love had blossomed from their appreciation of music and its majestic beauty. Evan's mother, Lyla Novacek is a gifted Cellist who hails from a family of wealth and power while his father, Louis Connelly is a multi-talented musician making his name in the lower levels of the music industry with energetic performances along with his band. They meet during one of his shows where their love buds out of their appreciation of the music in everything. They spend the night together after which Lyla's father, Thomas, who orchestrates Lyla's life to lead her to fame and recognition, forces Lyla away from Louis. But Lyla is left with Evan, whom she swears to protect with her life. Evan is born just after Lyla meets with an accident. Seizing the opportunity, Thomas sends Evan away to an orphanage before Lyla regains consciousness. The movie then follows Evan's adventure as he tries to reunite with his mother and father through his music.<br/><br/>Kirsten Sheridan directs this wonderful movie, and the viewer comes away from it with a new found multidimensional appreciation for the mystic enchantments of music. Since seeing the movie, I have become an avid listener of the rhythms of the everyday hustle-bustle, the streets and the sounds made by animals, horns, drills, bells and the trample of feet on the sidewalks. The movie exhibits impeccable music direction by Marc Mancina combined with fluidic direction and flawless execution.<br/><br/>I am especially fond of the many scenes in the film where August gets in the groove and loses himself in the music. He reveals the deep pleasure of letting go and following the creative flow. August Rush makes it clear that people like Lyla and Louis can make beautiful music together for one night that can play in their hearts for years. The movie also teaches us that we all need mentors to cheer us on so that the magic of the music can lead us where it wants us to go. And, most importantly, August Rush reminds us that the yearning of the heart is the best music of all for that is how we reach out to each other and discover the love that binds us together."

","A beautiful story, almost a fairytale. I love music and I love how they played with it in this movie. The way you hear how the music is born is a special experience. The story is very beautiful. It's a little bit predictable, but aren't all fairy tales a bit predictable? The innocence of the boy is played very well by Freddie Highmore. I think he's an excellent actor. He plays really good and believable, even at such a young age. Sometimes I don't really like drama's, because they try to let you cry or they have really long, cheesy dialogs that aren't necessary. This movie succeeds to tell a beautiful story without those long dialogs. I really recommend to watch it."

"KineticSeoul","7","1","1","10 April 2013"," Oliver Twist like story with music that touches the heart
","Watching this movie is like watching a ""Oliver Twist"" story with some great, emotional and even inspirational music. Except the parents of the little boy Oliver Twist well actually Evan or August Rush has parents that are both musicians that are looking for August. And the plot is basically about a boy named Evan/August Rush that feels music and is a musical prodigy. And through music he is trying to find his loved ones, which is his parents. Now this would have been a amazing movie if the heartfelt and emotional aspects had a bit more substance to it. And didn't so artificial or forced at times. It basically feels like a fairy tale where certain parts just seemed a bit too coincidental. But it's to bring out that bonding moments between certain characters and if it did try to go in a fairytale-esque direction. Or tries to go with that ""Oliver Twist"" vibe it's understandable I guess. But it just seemed a bit too cheesy and just not a very believable dialogues between characters and just seemed forced at times. Despite that the music really does bring about quite a bit of emotions. And so props go to the composers for this movie. It's worth a rental and a watch but it's not a movie I would want to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

","AUGUST RUSH ( 2007 )<br/><br/>Have been trying to watch it fully once more since the time saw it first. Now only it became possible. The movie is fully about MUSIC but , didn't feel so convincing and real at some points in the movie. Apart from that felt it's good altogether. So lets keep that aside.<br/><br/>It's the story of a boy named EVAN TAYLOR, orphaned ( by circumstances when he was born ) and whose parents who were also separated because of the same circumstances as his, finds each other and unites with the gift they all have got equally and immensely : MUSIC.<br/><br/>Clever casting and very fine performances by the actors, EVAN was too good so was LYLA. The main part of this, of course the MUSIC is very beautiful and very well matching the mood of the movie.

"ggizem-10","Null","1","1","25 December 2012"," Fantastic movie
","Every description of this movie is correct. I can't possibly add to the descriptions without giving the story away. But I can add that the acting of Freddie Highmore is among the best. This whole movie is filled with emotion and actors that really fill the bill. I will put this movie on my set and listen to it 24/7. The music is outstanding, best piece of guitar work I've seen in a long time. ""The Bari Improv"" which I believe is Kaki King's crowning achievement, is not to be missed. And watching Freddie Highmore's face while performing it so to speak, is a pleasure unto it's own. I get such a kick out of watching that scene, because I love music, and know what his character is feeling at that point. A friend recommended this movie to me because she knows my love of music, not to mention my love of movies. I'm glad she did. And I hope to pass this on to anyone who has not seen this yet. Before you watch any other movie, if you see no other movie for the rest of your life, take the time to watch this extremely impressive movie that will surely bring tears to your eyes. This is a pure delight of a movie. And watching the faces of the five main characters is worth every minute of your time."
"llekaetyeldud","10","1","1","1 December 2012"," A short review of this movie.
","The one and only reason I rated this so high was of it's high emotional value. In an intimate or family setting I'm sure there would not be a dry eye in the house. <br/><br/>((SPOILER)) (MAYBE: Kind of , more of a character breakdown. Just making sure.)<br/><br/>All of the main characters evoked a bit of emotion. A cold overbearing father. A mother that lost her child. A man that lost his love. A child without his family. A ruthless/shiesty bad guy as well as many supporting characters. In my honest opinion I'll say this. If Keri Russell was searching for perfection and decided to quit when and if she found it, she should have stopped here. That is all."
"roedyg","Null","1","1","27 September 2012"," corny as Kansas in August
","August Rush is as corny as Kansas, but it still works. The plot is completely predictable though preposterously improbable. The suspense is in just how long they are going to delay the climax. It is magic realism about a boy Freddie Highmore playing Evan Taylor aka August Rush who has a supernatural talent to pick up any instrument and instantly start improvising in a creditable way. He even magically learns musical notation without any instruction or ever seeing written music.<br/><br/>A young Jonathan Rhys Meyers (King Henry VIII in the Tutors), as the father, has a face like a piece of art. It is hypnotic, menacing and sexy. The camera gives you plenty of time to contemplate it.<br/><br/>Must of the movie is watching people pretend to sing or pretend to play musical instruments. To a lay eye, it is all quite convincing. I think Jonathan Rhys Meyers actually sang his parts. He made a quite credible rock musician.<br/><br/>The boy is inspired by the incidental sounds around him to create music with matching rhythms and textures. The way the movie flows from one to the other is brilliant and a treat for the ear.<br/><br/>Robin Williams plays a Fagin-like character forces child street musicians to hand over their take. He is quite creepy. You don't think of him as Robin Williams. He IS a crazy, greedy, unscrupulous old coot.<br/><br/>Leon Thomas III as a fellow street urchin/musician stole every scene he appeared in.<br/><br/>The weakest actor is Highmore, who is too bland and generic a little boy.<br/><br/>Jamia Simone Nash, a little black girl, knocked my socks off with her performance in a church choir. I hope we see her again in some other movie. Her part was way too short. I got the feeling I was getting to see Whitney Houston at age 9.<br/><br/>The thing that bugged me most was August's supposedly original composition selected by the Juliard school of music was a complete rip-off of Bach, an interesting arrangement, but not an original composition.<br/><br/>It leaves you feeling good with its impossibly happy ending."
"richards-mitchell","7","1","1","13 March 2012"," August Rush Review
","August Rush is definitely better the second time around. This is a sad, exciting and inspiring movie, for music lovers and for anyone out there who loves a very heart full movie. Kirsten Sheridan did a wonderful job in directing this movie, the music and the way the story line was put together was very intense and always had you wondering what was going to happen next. August Rush has a great storyline, a young orphaned boy named Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) has been in foster care for 11 years and counting. He feels the need to search for his parents Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who are both musicians, who met at by ""following the music"". In events, Lyla becomes pregnant, but tragically gets into an accident where she then finds herself in the hospital with no baby, and she is devastated. Their baby, Evan Taylor is just a boy in an orphanage who won't be anything in life. Wrong. He finds his way to New York City, where dreams are made of in this exciting search for his parents he learns many things and meets lots of people, such as Maxwell ""Wizard"" Wallace (Robin Williams) who is a ""Father"" to many homeless kids, Wizard takes Evan in and tries to make him a star! This is where Evan gets the nickname ""August Rush"" because Evan Taylor is not a ""Stars name"", this definitely makes it harder for Lyla, who has been searching for him. But when Wizard tries to take advantage of Evan, just for his prodigy like musical skills, Evan has to break free and go find his real family. I love music, and this movie made me accept and love music with even more of a passion than I already do. This movie is definitely one of the best I have ever seen. If only real life was like the movies! Evan Taylor is a music prodigy, from his mother, Lyla, being a Cellist from Julliard and his father, Louis, being an aspiring singer and guitar player; he has a great musical background. Evan learns to play the guitar, but not in a way that you would expect, he beats the strings like a drum, and a beautiful sound comes out. Evan keeps saying that he wants to find his parents and the only way to do this is to play the music, so they will come and find him. I suggest this movie to anyone who adores music like I do, or to anyone who loves an exciting and heart filled movie. This will leave you with a warm feeling inside, and leave you to adore music even more than you already do, and Kirsten Sheridan did this very well."

","A great movie in combination with the magic of a modern mixed music makes watching it unforgettable and heart touching emotional experience. All three main characters Freddie Highmore (August Rush) , Kris Russel (Lyla), Jonhatan Rhys Meyer distribute power energy, romantic and intriguing element of the movie. Separated by accident and away from each other, they feel the healing power of the Universe to find themselves because they have the fate to be together. Mystery, beauty and inspiration of the Universe power appears by the music as if music frequency transfers package of data signals which are invisible for the human eye but they impact on the human heart, no matter how far apart they are. Indeed fascinating movie without many words but infused music which the movie has, it gets emotions beyond the surface and gives the opportunity to the audience to draw their own inferences. ""August Rush"" is definitely worth seeing more than once!"
"Rodrigo_Amaro","8","1","1","28 July 2011"," Pretty decent despite the corny theme
","Only the magic of movies could make a very unrealistic, unbelievable and improbable story become something joyfully good and very nice to watch. In ""August Rush"", Freddie Highmore is an orphan boy who escaped the place he was living and goes to New York City where he'll try to find his parents, of whom he never met but he firmly believes they're alive. His search for them is based on following the music, as he says something he really loves, and he'll connect his mom and dad (who are apart of each other) through the music he plays. The movie gives us the vantage of knowing that the boy's parents were two musicians, a rock star played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, and a concertist played by Keri Russell, and both parted different ways after one night stand without knowing what happened to each other, and not even knowing they have a son. In the city, the boy will meet Wizard (Robin Williams), a drifter who uses street kids as street musicians and he'll be surprised with the boy's talent for music, ""contracting"" his services and giving to the boy the artistic name of August Rush. <br/><br/>As I said, an unrealistic story. But, at times we seem to forget that movies are only mirrors for life, showing a image of life but not really the real image, it's always a slightly distortion, which is why movies are movies and life is life. When people complain that a movie wasn't realistic pointing things here and there it's so annoying that one must ask to himself: What do you really want of a film life or entertainment? Because if we had to look at ""August Rush"" as the real thing we would be disappointed but seeing as a beautiful voyage of the imagination, this movie works perfectly. It goes for obvious ways, avoids some clichés here and there but it gets trapped with some happy clichés (the climatic ending, though very exciting), it's kind of corny like some nostalgic films of the 1940's but it's always well intentioned. Shows us the beauty, the magic of hearing and perceiving music (to me, the most sublime of arts, if not, the most perfect. A quite harsh opinion coming from someone who really, really loves movies but that's what I believe) and the importance it have in people's lives. Not only August is touched by music but the other characters as well, even Wizard who teaches to August great things about how one must feel the music in order to play it. Music is out there and we need to listen!<br/><br/>The thing I really like about this picture was the choice of actors in their roles, they're all perfectly fit. It's almost impossible to not like them. Highmore is one of the best young actors to ever appear on the screen and his presence makes the whole film; Rhys-Meyers is very charming and nice playing a man who turned his back to the music after not finding inspiration for composing when the love of his life vanished of his life; Keri is effective as her companion; Robin Williams goes okay in playing not much of a positive character, barely resembling the hobo he played in ""The Fisher King""; and we have the talents of Terrence Howard, Marian Seldes, Ronald Guttman, Alex O'Loughlin and Mykelti Williamson in secondary characters. And there's the good songs played throughout the film, one of them Oscar nominated for best song in 2008. Pretty decent movie with good qualities and that's a huge deal in times where films seem to have almost none. 8/10"

","I love this movie. This movie is titled ""奇跡のシンフォニー"" in Japanese, and it means ""The Miracle Symphony"". I think that it is agreeable to this movie. The each of three was living with playing music and they were attracted as symphony is played. Of course, the music played in this movie is very good, especially by Evan. And, the acting by Freddie Highmore was so good! He has many variations of expressions. For example, the cute face when Evan enjoys or glad, and the firm face when he decided were so nice that I could catch how Evan feels at that time clearly. This film tells us how important to trust love and the possibility you have, I think."

I can completely get into it with no worries bothering me at least when I am listening to it. <br/><br/>3) I am always thinking that I lack talent and the only way I can be qualified, not successful, in the competitions with others is to work harder than them so that my diligence makes up for my genetic weaknesses. I admire the talented so much. <br/><br/>4) Based on my current psychological conditions, my perspectives on music and the talent, I should say that this film succeeds in catching my eyes and heart. It enhances the idea that I am supposed to trust myself, stick to my belief and go for it. <br/><br/>5) Anyway, I kinda assume that the plot is a little bit unrealistic, I mean, there are too many coincidences that might occur to nobody.

","August Rush was utter garbage disguised as a heartwarming musical fairytale. I've generally liked Freddie Highmore in previous films, however he was completely unconvincing here as a musical prodigy (did anyone else wonder how he could play guitar just by beating the strings and neck?)and did nothing except flash cheesy smiles throughout the film. Everything else from the stupid and predictable plot, to the acting, to the nauseating script, to Robin Williams impersonating Bono was awful.

"robert-temple-1","10","3","6","15 May 2008"," Fairytale done as realism, classical music portrayed as wonderful
","This film was obviously directed by a woman (Kirsten Sheridan) because it is too sensitive to human situations for most men to have been capable of it (men being, as is well known, generally emotional illiterates). So Kirsten Sheridan has done a splendid job. The film is seriously 'politically incorrect' because it is entirely based upon the premise of inherited ability, in this case musical genius. The score here is Nature: 100, Nurture: 0. So the film is thus a welcome balance to the crazed theories of countless social engineers protecting their jobs by maintaining that inheritance ('nature') means nothing and political and social programmes carried out by themselves ('nurture') are all-important. Those of us who are not social workers or political hacks know that perfectly well, and always have done. There is a genre problem about the film which needs to be pointed out. When you make a film like this which is a pure fairytale, you should not really make it in a normal realistic style like this, because realism raises false expectations such as: plausibility, maybe it could really happen, and don't try to convince me of the utterly impossible, but keep it within the bounds of what might happen to real people. These expectations are all dashed, because there is no possibility whatsoever that this story could really happen, as there are too many impossibilities at once, leading to a total collapse of believability. Yes, the film ends on a super-high, but no, the film is also a downer because that super-high is simply impossible. All those strands just can't come together like that at the same moment. It would have been far more subtle and effective to limit the story resolutions, or leave at least one open-ended possibility among many hanging! Freddie Highmore as the young boy delivers a marvellous performance, which is really convincing, and considering how unrealistic the story becomes, that is quite an achievement! Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the two lovers torn apart by a cruel fate are excellent. Marian Seldes is as usual remarkably good, and so solid that she provides part of the architecture. Robin Williams does 'one of his wild things' and does it very well, since when has he ever been normal? The story's main theme of music is a wonderful thing to hear and behold, and the attention given to classical music in a mainstream film like this is so rare that one wonders how they got away with it. In these days of cultural decadence, classical music has become condemned to ghetto status, something only listened to by 'freaky people', i.e., those not obsessed by greed and commerce, and hence abnormal and a danger to the New Society of Mammon, who are soon to be incarcerated and punished by having rap music blared at them 24 hours a day as part of their coming political reeducation process. Dare we hope or think that we might ever get another mainstream film glorifying classical music again? Or is this the end?"

"Robosuv","9","3","6","23 November 2007"," ""If you could be anything in the whole world, what would you want to be?"" -- ""Found.""
","August Rush (Freddie Highmore) is an eleven-year-old orphan boy who believes he hears his parents through music in nature, and perhaps, if they hear his music, he'll be found.<br/><br/>""Sometimes the world tries to knock it out of you, but I believe in music the way that some people believe in fairy tales,"" says the budding musical prodigy. Opening with a well-produced scene of the boy joyfully directing a concert of wind in elbow-high grass, the movie immediately contrasts his daydreams with the perpetual attempts at crushing his spirit. He runs away from the boys' home, following the music. But his is not a journey to find. His is a search to be found. ""Maybe the notes I hear are the same ones they heard the night they met. Maybe that's how they found each other. Maybe that's how they'll find me."" <br/><br/>Though not a musical, music is a central theme. It is beautiful. Some classical, some rock, some earthy, organic. ""The music is all around us. All you have to do is listen."" Along his journey, August touches a guitar for the first time and it comes alive--he comes alive--as he is finally able to express the music that has always been within him. He wanders into a church and listens as a rehearsing Gospel group sings, ""Sometimes it takes a different kind of love to raise a child. So don't give up."" <br/><br/>And interwoven is the story behind his parents, his abandonment, and a yearning, a drawing back to the music they once loved, contrasting and merging her concert cello performances with his Irish bar band. ""I believe that once upon a time, long ago, they heard the music and followed it."" But can they hear his? <br/><br/>Sometimes I look for a smash-em-up movie, an opportunity to escape through a high-adrenaline unreality. This time I wanted one that made me feel. August Rush did that. Intensely. Having been a foster dad to six boys, knowing the intense yearning ""to be""--to be family, to be wanted, to be loved, to be ""found""--, I sat in the back row, ashamed of my tears yet drawn in for more. Tears for the boy's plight, the purity of a simple dream, the joy and passion expressed through his slap technique of guitar playing.<br/><br/>Perhaps the boy's struggle will not rip at your heart as it did mine, but it's a great movie with beautiful music. I've already seen this movie twice--something I rarely do. And I bought the sound track--something I've never done. I'm certain I'll see it again. Of course, I'll buy the DVD.<br/><br/>August Rush is a great family movie, probably for kids eleven and over. There are scenes of street kids living in an abandoned theater. Some adult intimidation of the kids. There is one rooftop scene with an unmarried couple waking up together, but they get up fully dressed."
"bulm-1","2","6","16","24 November 2007"," Not for a kid
","This movie can't decide if it wants to be whimsical for the kids or moving/romantic for adults. I took a 9 year. First, it needs a good editor. Then edit out most of Robin Williams who is pedophile-creepy. Show more of the Irish brothers, Keri Russel's love for music, and the little black girl in the choir. Then advertise it as PG. Disappointed with the WEALTH of talent squandered in this movie. Everyone of the actors put so much into trying to make this a quality film, and the children's performances were so touching.

","Tonight there was a free preview screening at the Jerusalem Cinematheque, as a part of a children's foundation benefit. I think I'm the first to vote and comment on it, and I honestly wish I could give this film any more but six.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, and despite the big production, the film is full of clichés and stereotypes, I was wondering how actors could get through this dialog with a straight face. True, a few cross-cultural references, such as ""Run, August, run"" make you laugh, but mostly I found myself laughing at how predictable - and unrealistic! - some scenes were.<br/><br/>Knowing a thing or two about music myself, I can say that if this is what they want you to believe about what a musical prodigy, who never read notes or picked an instrument, can achieve in one day, then the authors' notions about love and relationships are as believable, or worse.<br/><br/>Not recommended to any Robin Williams fans out there either. He plays a mean Fagin-like bastard of a character, which is probably a stretch any actor would love, but not such a great pleasure to watch, especially given his earlier filmography. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is b-e-a-utiful though, a cross between young Malcolm McDowell and, say, Johnny Depp. His upper lip alone is worth enduring most of the movie's clichéd messages :) Yes, and I loved the gospel band (do Harlem churches have real organs though?

"Davalon-Davalon","1","2","4","13 September 2014"," Ghastly
","After what looked like a promising opening, this movie plummeted into a never-ending spiral of absolute predictability. There wasn't one authentic moment in the entire film.This loose take on ""Oliver Twist"" was an interesting concept, but, on film, as other reviewers have pointed out, there isn't anything believable about any of it. For example: Why does Evan, aka August Rush (give me a break -- Robin Williams (!) steals the name off the side of a truck going by at the very moment he wants to give Evan a new name!), suddenly escape from the school for troubled boys? He had plenty of other opportunities... why now? When Evan is ""trapped"" in the subway station with Robin Williams and Arthur, why is it only after Arthur smashes Robin Williams over the head with a guitar that Evan suddenly sees an alternative exit? <br/><br/>The list of ""Whys?"" and ""Huhs?"" go on ad infinitum. After Lyla and Louis's big love-fest on the rooftop, how is it that they remain ageless for the next 11 years? <br/><br/>And the predictability! I could smell it miles before it wafted into view. When Lyla's father is dying, of course he's going to make a deathbed confession about the child that she gave birth to (prematurely after being hit by a car, and yet apparently delivering the child without complications, and said child being signed away by her father, who didn't want the child to interrupt her career as a cellist... and yet, what hospital would have given him the papers that SHE needed to sign... and yet, how would Terrence Howard know that it wasn't her signature --yes, I'm sure she told him off screen, but still... it looks so odd when he says it out of the blue--)... and even though Daddy didn't tell her the baby was a ""he"" -- she immediately starts babbling on about ""he"" and ""him"". And why is it that all the black people in the film are basically support people? What about Arthur (Leon Thomas III), who seems to actually have real guitar-playing and vocal talent? It's so convenient that the white people are rich and pretty. I am white, and I found the whole movie blatantly racist. <br/><br/>I essentially watched the entire film in shock. I love dear darling departed Robin Williams, and for the life of me could not understand why he made this film. Everything was forced and fake. <br/><br/>And then bizarre odd moments: When Lyla decides to resume her brilliant career as a cellist (her face is oddly lifeless while she ""plays"" the cello), she has a rehearsal session with, apparently, her BFF who is also a pianist (?). At the rehearsal session, we hear the BFF egging her on, and yet we don't see the BFF. We just hear her disembodied voice. It was either a mistake, an oversight or a true Twilight Zone moment. <br/><br/>We also have Evan sitting at a piano, after a 20-second ""lesson"" by a darling little black girl whose teeth haven't all quite come in, playing notes in the opposite direction of what we actually hear on the soundtrack. For a movie about music, this is an inexcusable oversight. <br/><br/>Last, and most irritating was the use of ""Moondance"" as a connecting song, one that Louis sings to Lyla, and one that ends up in Evan's big ""symphony"" at the end... in what way was that original? Are we supposed to believe that the child, who apparently had never been exposed to a single note of music before escaping from the boys' home, knew the melody to ""Moondance"" and therefore brilliantly wove in ""thematic elements"" from it into his debut symphonic masterpiece? What a joke. <br/><br/>Overall, all of the actors seemed like puppets or robots and every ""twist"" and ""turn"" could be predicted. If you want to be amused by questionable choices on the part of every single person involved in this travesty and enjoy laughing out loud at pathetically obvious ""telegraphed"" ""moments,"" this is your Saturday-night popcorn movie. If not, run for the hills."

The music is outstanding, best piece of guitar work I've seen in a long time. ""The Bari Improv"" which I believe is Kaki King's crowning achievement, is not to be missed.

I get such a kick out of watching that scene, because I love music, and know what his character is feeling at that point.

","Director Kirsten Sheriden and screenplay writers Paul Castro, Nick Castle and James.V.Hart have succeeded with flying colours in delivering a poignant and captivating real life tale that possesses a beautiful feeling of magic without  most astonishingly  the aid of a novel.<br/><br/>The awe-inspiring Freddie Highmore (from stunning successes such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Arthur and the Invisibles and this year's The Golden Compass) brings his charming essence to the film as he devotedly plays the title character  an audiophile with whom we can all relate. Eleven-year-old August can realise beauty in every sound he hears and believes that: ""Music is all around us. All you have to do is listen."" With this unique philosophy and strong passion he could well become the greatest musician in the world. But sadly our delightful young hero has spent all his life in a strict, ramshackle orphanage that maliciously tries to prevent a single spark of hope or desire from flourishing.<br/><br/>Then one fateful day he is gently talked into escaping the harsh and horridly restraining prison and follows the path of sound. Along the way he is helped by the faithful church community and steered of course by a cold greedy villain who calls himself 'Wizard' (the wonderful Robin Williams) into a gang of unruly, street type buskers but even so he moves on in the hope of at last finding his long lost mother (Kerri Russell) and father (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who aren't doing too well either.<br/><br/>With its entrancing all-star cast and a firm command over its audience's heart and mind it's no surprise that this majestic masterpiece is an academy award nominee.

","First off, I loved the acting. Freddie Highmore has a wonderful presence in any film I've seen him in. I also love Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. They encapsulated what I would imagine to be true romance and beauty through the essence of sound and music. Williams also does his job excellently. I had this constant high and low emotional state with him making it a very love-hate type of sensation. William's character and his connection to August made Highmore's eventual action that much more satisfying in the end.<br/><br/>In a film like this, one hopes to be swept away in the passion that it claims to offer. You hope to dive into a sea of elegance and imagination, and this did that for me. The music brought them together and it brought me joy. This film is about connection and what better way to achieve that then through the wonders of music and sound. <br/><br/>I compliment the director for his ability to have each actor/actress sustain a constant state of great and expected emotion. Moreover, I give praise to the screenwriters and cinematographer for capturing New York as not only a beautiful but a unique city. The shots told a story and one which I would follow forever. This was truly a great film, from beginning to end. Simple and soundly sweet."
"jpschapira","7","2","4","2 February 2008"," Movie rush...
","I can't get enough of saying that there are formulaic movies that just work. Today I was watching a film with some friends about a girl who does ice skating and plays ice hockey at the same time. She has to choose between both, but the movie is arranged so that she can do both...How great! Of course; extraordinary events take place so this can happen, but as they say: ""The end justifies the mediums"". <br/><br/>Kirsten Sheridan's ""August Rush"" is, surprisingly, not about sport. There's no team or single player who wants to win a championship; there's just a boy who wants to find his parents and believes music can help him, guide him. ""All you have to do is listen"", the little boy played joyfully by Freddie Highmore whispers. He's so charming that a Child Protecting Services worker (Terrence Howard) gives his number to him. Soon, the boy finds himself in New York: ""How did you get here?"", a truck driver who leaves him on the street asks him. ""I followed the music"".<br/><br/>There's another story being told apart from the boy's, and it's the one of his parents (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and a lovable Keri Rusell). It tells how they met in New York and it's all really nice and perfect at night and they spend together the most beautiful night of their lives, with more music and contemplation than words. This is during the whole film. The contemplation is not part of the filming style and it's not there to serve the story; it's that the script is too short and the filmmakers waste time with musical numbers and visual passages. <br/><br/>From time to time, like during some of the magical numbers, ""August Rush"" makes us believe that music can connect people in the way the movie wants it to. It would be easier to believe if the boy's parents weren't so related to music (the father is a rock musician and the mother is a cellist) and if the film's circumstances weren't so predictable. But then, if everything was different, we wouldn't be charmed by the movie and it wouldn't be the same. <br/><br/>In these types of things, it has to be all or nothing, so it seems fair to say that Sheridan made all the right decisions. For example, there are like two moments where the film could skip a predictable moment (some formulaic pieces do); but it doesn't. ""August Rush"" gladly admits its 'clichés', so we also have an evil character played by Robin Williams as a man with good intentions but who ultimately cares about himself and no one else.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you find Terrence Howard's comprehensive face, or that one of a priest in a church where the boy spends one night. When he wakes up he learns two things in the piano from a little girl and when the girl comes back from school she tells the priest: ""Remember when you said that Mozart was a prodigy? Well, I have one and he's living under my bed"". That scene brought a smile to my face.<br/><br/>Because this is the best these films can do; they can make us escape from reality for a while and hope for a better world. I'm not making any statements or trying to say the world is a bad place, but the world is nothing like ""August Rush"" and it will never be...That's for sure. I want to add that I haven't explained most of the plot and I've skipped many important details you'll find in any review and even a simple plot description of the film, but it's on purpose: I honestly think you can enjoy this one. You should give it a try."

Terrence Howard and Keri Russell bring so much compassion to their roles. And Freddie Highmore. Precious without being precocious. But here's the biggest reason to see this movie: If someone is trying to take away your dreams, see this film. You'll tighten your grip."

","I'm not sure what the creators of this were thinking, I suppose they were relying on the general public's ignorance, and based on the average User Rating, it worked.<br/><br/>Every scene involving classical music in the movie was a joke, and was deeply insulting to me. The Juilliard school would never accept the character of Evan because his music is crap, especially his orchestra piece. The New York Philharmonic wouldn't have a guest artist play such an easy cello piece, and certainly wouldn't have a guest artist who couldn't play perfectly in tune. Evan messed up conducting multiple times. The list goes on.
For someone who heard music all around him in New York, Evan's orchestra piece sounds like it came out of the CPE. Listen to composer Eliot Carter, who actually did use New York as inspiration, and compare the music.
Very annoying to watch, but perhaps even more annoying was reading the high ratings reviews given by the public."

And it is hopefully through mystery and magic of music that love will somehow find its way among all three of these characters. This amazing and in some ways wishful, fanciful, but entirely romantic and artful movie brings together in one chord various themes from Charles Dicken's Oliver Twist, the music drama of Mr. Holland's Opus (1995), and later the more recent and youthful drama of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011). Robin Williams having attained an established stardom and likely ability of selecting his own roles, boldly offers up a devilish and not so nice character reminiscent of Dicken's Fagin's persona. For those romantics and idealists, this movie is a specular representation of the power of music, imagination, perseverance, and love above all. This is an immensely moving film for those that allow music and family to be those elements that bind humanity together in happiness."

","""August Rush"" is a wonderful story about life and love. The reuniting of parents with a child they didn't know they had, and with each other, happens through unknown feelings or senses of the missing person or persons. The vehicle that connects the three main characters here is natural talent for music. In the case of the boy, August, it's an innate musical genius. <br/><br/>Something like this may not be as far-fetched as one may think. The medical and other sciences are researching in many fields of human life from conception, to genetics and heredity. New discoveries are pointing to biological connectedness only imagined in the past. This is between parents and children, siblings, and even relatives removed from a direct bloodline. <br/><br/>Some studies have found twins separated at birth and adopted out, knowing some way that they have a twin brother or sister. Other studies are looking at siblings who have a sense of a brother or sister who is not alive. As research continues and we learn more about the complex make up of human life, we may one day come to realize that we all are brothers and sisters in the human race. <br/><br/>This is a superb story about the beauty and sacredness of all life - not just that of the specially gifted. August shows us that by his observation of others, and amazement for what they do. This is a fine film for the whole family. And, it could be a good learning vehicle if shown in the schools.<br/><br/>The film has touches of humor in places. Here's a favorite line. Louis's fiancé is turned off at his family reunion and leaves in a huff. As she drives off, Marshall says, ""Louis, aren't you supposed to be in the car with the girl as she drives off into the sunset?"""

","August Rush (2007) is like a modern day fairytale. The movie is one to be enjoyed and it's meant to enchant it's audience. The plot centers around a young orphan boy who is a musical prodigy. He is on a mission to find his parents, with whom he has never meet. His mother (Keri Russell) is a musician who went to Juliard, she went to a party one night with a girlfriend of hers and ended up having sex with a male band member. She got pregnant as a result of that tryst. She was hit by a car and rushed to the hospital, her very controlling father forged her signature and put the baby up for adoption and told her when she awoke that she'd lost the baby. She doesn't contact the father or anything and they all go their separate ways. About 11 years later, the son is on a search for his parents, claiming he can sense them and he follows the music. The movie really takes off when he is searching for his parents and they are searching for each other too. That's where the fairytale part of the film kicks in. The acting is good for the most part. I really loved Jonathan Rhys Meyers in his role, very good casting decision. Russell was good as Lyla, the mother. And I loved Freddie Highmore as August Rush. He is such a great actor, especially for him to be that young. Robin Williams is good here too, he plays the antagonist, a kind of role he didn't usually play. This movie is just enchanting and I loved it! The writing isn't like Oscar worthy or anything but it's a very well made movie that'll keep your undivided attention the entire way through and will leave you feeling great. 10/10!"

","Now, okay. I understand that this is a film that loves music (and I can see that), but, one problem I have with some films is the crime they commit of taking a plot that has been used over and over again and just rehashes it without adding anything new. Sadly, for August Rush, this is the truth. The acting in this film is, actually wonderful. Freddie Highmore (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") is wonderful as ever, but even his acting can not really save this film. The same goes to Keri Russell. The script is basically a modern telling of Oliver Twist, just added a love of music. Now, if the script only worked on the love of music and cut the rest of it out, then this film would have been better. But, it had to have a sappy love story thrown in. Now, the main reason, if any, to see this film would have to be the film's score. I mean, it is just wonderful to hear all the music in the film and it would have worked well if the film only dealt with Evan (Freddie Highmore) being a music prodigy. Now, the direction of this film (by the Irishwoman Kirsten Sheridan) is rather slow. I mean, it could have been much faster paced and it does drag for a while. Overall, I only recommend this film if you are into cliché films or just really good film scores."

Yes, Robin Williams character is dark. I took the character as mentally impaired, which has made him homeless. The basic story line is what you need to focus on. The other magic,...and fate just are fillers which make it a fun movie to watch. It's a feel good movie which does highlight what happens to some of the homeless children living on the streets in big cities. The idea that you ""can't quit on your music"" is the theme..

"BeneCumb","7","0","0","7 February 2014"," Poetic urban fairytale intertwined with flowing music
","For centuries, tales about people having nothing and obtaining a lot due to their skills and/or good nature have been popular, particularly if children are involved - Oliver Twist is probably the best known. Evan Taylor aka August Rush (heartily and distinctively played by Freddie Highmore) is a boy living in an orphanage possessing a savant-like ability to hear music everywhere. Through ups and downs, meeting different people while living on the streets, he succeeds in both his goals at the same time. His nature and environment is melancholic but beautiful, sometimes within protracted scenes, however. Ugly, bad scenes in connection with him have been avoided.<br/><br/>The other dimension, between past and present, are Lyla Novacek and Louis Connelly (performed by Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers - amiably, but trivially), musicians of different kind - whose link to Taylor/Rush is not disclosed until the second half of the movie - and sometimes it is difficult to follow which part of their life is depicted. The ending of the movie with their imminent presence is breathtaking and sweet, rounding up all previous actions.<br/><br/>As for the other major cast, Robin Williams as Maxwell ""Wizard"" Wallace is convincing, Terrence Howard as Counselor Richard Jeffries is too plain (due to his character apparently). Music dominates everywhere, focusing mostly on classical pieces, diminishing audience rather than widening. Still, August Rush can be considered as a pleasant family entertainment, particularly if music has a distinct role there."

","This was a good movie. I saw it at a special premiere screening for academy members only, in Burbank. The cast did a good job and so did the director. My favourite part of the movie was the soundtrack which is really, really good! I always enjoy movies where the actors actually sing the songs themselves (not just in musicals but actors in films such as Walk the Line, which is an amazing film). Music is obviously a very big part of this movie and carries it for the most part but when you consider the movie as a whole it feels a bit lacking in the story department. All of the performances are good and like I said they sing their own songs themselves and do it well. A solid effort."

","Well I really liked this movie a lot. It was generally very well done and I even was able to get over the fact that they cast Robin Williams (why? why?) in it. I generally love stories where a kid gets lost and is somehow saved by someone who loves/finds/runs into them.<br/><br/>And how can you not love Keri Russel. She's awesome.<br/><br/>I would give this movie a 10 but there are two somewhat serious drawbacks.<br/><br/>Well my first issue is not that major but, really, it is a problem that I think everyone seeing this movie would notice. When the boy is ""discovered"" by the reverend and is taken to Juliard, we are expected to believe that Juliard, a top of world music/arts school for gifted children, would just take in a kid without any documentation of who he is? That simply is not believable. They require parental permission and signatures, etc. Sure they'd want him but they would so incredibly liable if they did what they did in the movie. I know it would sort of destroy the ENTIRE plot if that didn't happen like that and that's sort of my complaint. As a writer, you shouldn't have to box yourself into such a bad plot miss in order to make your story work. Shakespeare always made every thing work, brilliantly. With a little more effort, you could have too!<br/><br/>Second, the ending was a real letdown. I don't think the writer fully understood his movie to be honest. I know things get complex in movie making with writers, producers, directors and editors all having a say in what ends up being the movie but for me they really, really blew this one.<br/><br/>OK, what I'm about to write is a major, end of the movie spoiler. I've already marked this review as a spoiler but if you really don't want to know the end, don't continue reading! :)<br/><br/>The movie ends with the boy on stage looking at his parents and then in his mind narrating some trite comment about the grandness of music, vision etc. This is what I mean about the writer not understanding this movie. Repeatedly throughout the movie, he tries to interject a narrative of spiritual feeling ideas about music being almost godlike. Yet the movie as you see it on screen takes on a totally different life. The music really becomes - and I might add the word 'merely' to qualify becomes - the vehicle to achieve the overarching theme of the movie - the love of a boy for his parents and the love of a mother for her son being so strong that they persevere 12 years to find each other at last.<br/><br/>Music really was incidental to that real goal, as the boy repeatedly states in the movie that his ONLY concern is to be reunited with his mother/parents. The music to him was merely the vehicle to see that happen.<br/><br/>So we get to the finale, and everyone watching the movie wants there to be a huge reunion with hugs and many tears - which if it was me separated from my son for 12 years, I would have leaped onto the stage!<br/><br/>But no. We get no completion and are only left with empty, trite words about some new-age idea about music.<br/><br/>No hugs, no tears, no explanations back and forth between the 3 miraculously reunited, no resolution."

How a street""Urchin"" could posses a Gibson acoustic guitar. I realised that without Mr Williams in it I would not have been prejudiced.....Ignoring him.. I enjoyed the film ..He ..again for a pay day..spoilt by his presence a perfectly good film which could have been done by another more convincing Fagin type..A stronger Director could have sorted him out....The more sensitive amongst us shed a tear...<br/><br/>PS.I d,ont see dead people...."

","This is an amazing movie with great acting by everyone! The music is superb as is the plot. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex's around when you start watching this film. I had a good friend who never listened to music and had no favourite songs. That was as foreign to me as someone saying they didn't need to breath oxygen. I can remember as early as 5 years old hearing the song ""The battle of New Orleans"" and thinking ""that sounds good"". This movie is all about music and how important it is to humanity. We are a musical species! If Aliens are travelling light years to get here it's probably for the music, as music is the universal language that requires no translation."

","SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>The movie is wonderful. I get the sense the Evan might have a touch of S y n e s t h e s i a - also correctly spelled in the English speaking world as s y n a e s t h e s i a...neither of these is in the IMDb spelling dictionary...IMDb needs to fix its dictionary.<br/><br/>There is a moment in which we see letters dancing about even OFF of a sign he is looking at (or this might be dyslexia).<br/><br/>He seems to sense music in everything. People with that capacity might just have it cross over into s y n e s t h e s i a.<br/><br/>I love this movie. It touched me deeply as a musician. I did not find the story too contrived as there really are people who were taken away from a parent by way of a mother being told that her child died. It was common for a long time. It happened often in Australia even in the 1970s. There are also many known cases where a parent and child (separated) or of siblings (etc) - found one another years later...by accident.<br/><br/>I also did not find the child's musical abilities to be impossible. My wife went to University at 9 in a program developed for her (IQ > 200) and I am a IT specialists and musician (I play many instruments and compose and have played instruments better after one afternoon than other did after years of effort). He had an entire school days long to play with and learn the BASIC staff.<br/><br/>I found Robin Williams very believable as a person guilty of Faginy...but instead of a band of young thieves he trained musicians...with JUST ENOUGH knowledge to keep them dependent on him. He kept basic IMPORTANT pieces of music theory unknown to them - the musical staff, t a b l a t u r e (IMDB...FIX YOUR DICTIONARY) , etc - all of which really helps musicians in learning and communicating with one another. WIZARD did all this to keep his money. He used FEAR to keep Evan in his hands...all for the money.<br/><br/>I also found the scenes with the son and father playing music together to be very reminiscent of my own experiences in the way that musicians really do act, in pure joy of musical expression...playing together and bouncing ideas off each other.<br/><br/>So yes, as a musician who is/was a lower level prodigy with a wife who was off the charts in all mental abilities, I know a bit about being unusual. As such, I did not find this at all unbelievable. <br/><br/>ALSO - in reply to ""headly66""<br/><br/>Evan did not INVENT a new way to play the guitar.<br/><br/>I have seen people play this way, It is not new. I have used variations on it myself. There are a huge number of different ways to play the guitar and may different ways to tune it. I have used that method of playing (both hands on the neck, striking the strings with the flat of the hand and using ""hammerons""). It is now new. You know very little about the guitar, music or real highly unusual 'prodigies'.<br/><br/>I happen play many instruments, some of which I could play after one day (without instructions) better than other people who I knew, who had several years of lessons. Is it an average experience? No. It does still happen. Unfortunately in the real world, life gives and takes. You will not be seeing me at a concert ever again, after years of performing.I am disabled and have M.C.S. now.<br/><br/>Some of the people who saw this don't seem to understand what it means to be a prodigy. I like this story for the very reason that it is a tale in which one person out of so many other like them...just ONE of the very rare, the very talented, the highly intelligent...got a real CHANCE in the world instead of having their life destroyed by a predator, Monsanto, a war, crazy parents...and even did so in the only first world nation to *NOT* have any real affordable education or health care. Just once...in fiction...an amazingly talented kid did not have their life and talent destroyed by the greedy...nothing went wrong that was not corrected in time.<br/><br/>* CYNIC ALERT *<br/><br/>Of course the cynic in me says that ""WIZARD"" stalked Evan...and later on (exactly one year to the date after the concert, in a fit of rage) came after Evan and kidnapped him after killing his parents (Telling Evan he had them prisoner and would kill them if he did not cooperate). Later, after years of playing on the street as a modern slave...his healths fails him. Breathing in all those exhaust fumes and eating cheep GM and additive filled food, eventually leaves our genius child as a young adult...fat and pale, no longer producing testosterone, sterile from GM soy in fast foods, losing his memory from early onset Alzheimers from pesticides, and then eventually dead from cancer by 25...in the gutter...as an unknown John Doe...but then that's just me <(evil grin) ...ha ha ha... (maybe in a version as if done by Ingmar Bergman)."

","Like eating at a really good chain restaurant: Everything is brought to a state of formulaic perfection, yet after completion one continues to feel a hunger one realizes is a desire for a degree of genuineness in the experience. That, or the diabetic coma one receives from the sugary conclusion.<br/><br/>While recognizing that it is a fairy tale of sorts, it is still disconcerting to have some elements seem so implausible as to screw up even a fantasy of a wildly talented child music prodigy. E.g. His prodigious gift seems real when he first encounters a guitar and slaps music from within it, and builds his skills by what seems like the likely study of those around him playing as well. Much less believable, even to this non-musician is that August understands the concept and begins to produce written music after a very very brief introduction to the act by a little girl, yet he suddenly has a mastery of Western music notation unencumbered by what I would expect to be his own untutored embellishments a prodigy might produce in the act of self-exploration of such a skill. Similarly, he discovers and without any instruction begins playing a pipe organ with orthodox technique , yet demonstrates no innovative deviations one might expect from someone who had no preconceived notion regarding the ""right"" way to play the instrument. <br/><br/>These might seem like modest quibbles to lob at a fantasy, yet since it IS a fantasy, don't drag it down with unrealistic reality checks.<br/><br/>Worth watching, especially for some of the music, as long as the idea of being buried under cotton candy and baby bunnies doesn't disturb you. Rent it when you are depressed and need a massive injection of Feelgoodagain."
"A-movie-lover-H","7","3","9","21 November 2007"," Good Production, Bad Script
","August Rush is about the unrequited love between an American cellist and an Irish guitar player which results in a baby boy, who is given up for adoption, and the role music plays in their lives, which eventually brings them all together. Robin Williams plays a Fagin type, who Evan, the baby boy grown up, encounters after being brought to the rundown theater where he and his gang of runaway child street musicians live. After Williams discovers Evan's intrinsic musical gift, he gives him the name August Rush to be a street performer, and the story unfolds as his talent is discovered. His plot is weaved in with the stories of his parents, both left feeling unfulfilled after their romantic encounter.<br/><br/>This movie was really cute, and I thought all of the acting except Johnathan Rhys Meyers', was pretty good, especially Highmore and Williams. The concept is sweet, despite being too complicated and therefore unbelievable, but you get into and have to let the details go. However, there were two things that really distracted me throughout the whole movie; Johnathan Rhys Meyers, who is English, tries too hard to put on an Irish accent, and instead it ends up sounding jumbled and all over the place. Secondly, the screenplay was severely lacking--the romantic scene between Meyers and Russel was terribly crafty, not to mention extremely corny, and it seemed as though they were already acquainted, and I didn't see them fall in love. This was a problem as Rhys Meyers spent the length of the film yearning for his long lost love. All in all, it's worth seeing, and the soundtrack is what made this film enjoyable."
"funkydoodycool","2","2","5","19 October 2008"," Drivel
","I felt a strong urge to review this film having been intrigued by the trailer, and severely let down by the actual event.<br/><br/>The story itself is kind of cute - a young boy grows up in an orphanage, but knows his parents are still alive, and heads out ""following the music"" to find them. He decides that if he can just write a piece of music and get it played out, his parents will know how to find him.<br/><br/>Its the following of the music that really lets the film down. For many films you need to suspend your belief, but this one really takes the biscuit. That a young child who's been told all through his life to forget music can see a guitar for the first time and play it is difficult enough to swallow, but even worse are the constantly corny lines.<br/><br/>Its almost as if the scriptwriters have filled a hat with corny phrases, pulled them out in random order, and made a script from it. Even repeating some of their favourites."

","I just caught a viewing of this one at the local dollar theater with my family. I usually can't stand sappy, family stories but this one had an effect on me. Maybe it's because I'm a big music fan, or maybe it's because this one was much more well done than the others. Either way, it was definitely worth the $1.50 ticket.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore is definitely a fantastic, up and coming young actor who we will definitely be seeing more of in the years to come. All of the other performances were nearly spot on, except Robin Williams, not that he's bad, I'm just tired of him. The only things that keep me from giving this film a 10 are the lack of dialog, long and drawn out scenes, and as I said, Robin Williams.<br/><br/>August Rush is a great movie to see with the family and I recommend it to anyone who's looking to kill a couple hours."

","What I really wanted to do was let the authors, directors and musicians (etc) know how much I enjoyed what this movie 'did' for me. Of course, the story itself was magical and near the end I was tensely awaiting the culmination of the characters' hopes. It was driving me crazy. But the very, very best part for me was when the boy was first playing the guitar with SO MUCH JOY! It was palpable. It touched me. When he was in the church, what he did then reminded me of the symphonies I used to hear in my own head, but shut down because I couldn't get them out. I woke to a drum beat this morning and the music has begun again. I feel the joy and wanted to thank all concerned for giving that back to me. Besides the musical part, that kind of love is SO romantic. I guess you could say the magic of the music leapt (this IS a real word--leaped sounds too much like a child saying 'keeped' in this instance) from the screen into reality and my hope is it does such for anyone who is open to the possibility. May music unite our spirits and draw us closer."
"levesque2177","9","2","5","30 December 2007"," stop complaining and enjoy the cliché
","I thought that it was a good touching movie overall. Yeah yeah all you critical people say it lacks character development and that the storyline is sooo obvious and that many events that happened were impossible BLAH BLAH BLAH WAH WAH WAH... cry on. but this movie is more about the music found in everyday life and the personal journeys of the three main characters rather than thematic brilliance and trying to impress the audience with smart dialogue and astonishing character development etc etc. In fact, I think the cliché storyline actually gives the movie a more fairy tale-like enchanting quality. And who cares if some things are unrealistic? It's not a documentary. It's a fictional movie. As long as the storyline is able to move you inside, then that's all that matters. Yes there are many movies that have done cliché and contrite stories and some of them do suck a lot, but this one does it well and that's what sets it apart. That's why this movie got a 7.3/10 from viewers and not a 3 as one of the other reviewers oh so generously claims to have given. For one thing, they're all brilliant actors, especially Freddie. So if you really don't have enough heart to be touched by the story, then just sit back, shut up, and enjoy the acting (and the music of course)."

BUT... unfortunately, the writers left us hanging. It was just them meeting up, but they didn't even say anything to each other? And Jonathan probably didn't even know he had a child! When the screen darkened I was like ""please please please, don't let this be the end of the movie."" And when the credits started rolling out, I was like ""oh, are you kidding me???"" The whole movie, I was anticipating an AWESOME reunion, but it never happened, which is a big disappointment, I must say because the entire movie was awesome. But, I still think everyone should go watch it, it was definitely worth seeing but just a heads up, you might be disappointed at the ending.

"eastbergholt2002","9","2","5","24 November 2007"," Uplifting
","August Rush is the most enjoyable film I've seen in months. It combines an updated version of Oliver Twist with the charm and whimsy of an old studio picture from the 1940s. The film is at times sad and moving, but like the Dickens novel it has a happy ending. The film is helped by its music, which is powerful and uplifting. The actors are attractive and likable, particularly the radiant Keri Russell and Freddie Highmore, gives a stunning performance in the title role. <br/><br/>The story starts with Lyla Novacek (Russell) a brilliant young cellist who has a one night stand with Louis Connelly, an Irish rock singer. Up to this point Lyla's life is manipulated by her ambitious father and the relationship with Connelly(Rhys Meyers)is broken up before it gets started. Lyla becomes pregnant but believes she has lost her unborn child in a car accident. She gives up performing. Years later Lyla's father makes a deathbed confession that he gave her son up for adoption. Her son Evan spends the first eleven years of his life in an orphanage. Lyla discovers the boy is alive and tries to find him.<br/><br/>Evan is sweet, vulnerable, trusting and optimistic. He runs away to New York and joins a gang of young musical street urchins. He's someone that belongs in a loving family. He is introduced to Wizard (Williams)who plays the film's Fagin. Evan turns out to be a musical genius and is renamed ""August Rush"" by Wizard who wants to exploit his talent. Meanwhile, Connelly who hasn't been able to recover from his rejection by Novavek, somehow ends up in New York at the same time. August runs away again and is discovered by the Julliard music department and composes a piece of music for a concert in Central Park. By coincidence, his mother is making a comeback. She performs Elgar's cello concerto with the New York Philharmonic at the same concert. The film follows a Dickensian formula with our hero having an incredibly tough time, but it all ends happily."

","I have to admit I was skeptical at first as to how good this film was going to be but seeing as though other friends were going I thought i'll give it a go. I wasn't disappointed. It turned out to be much better than I expected. This is a film that would appeal to those who have a good imagination to really appreciate the plot. I thought the music was excellent and best heard in the cinema to really get the effect and thought provoking (after you tend to listen to random sounds!). As for the storyline, Robin Williams did come across as a Fagin character and you somehow still feel a sorrow for him at the end. The acting from Freddie Highmore was excellent and I liked the emotions that he managed to portray throughout the movie. I would definitely recommend the movie just for the music - very relaxing!"

The accent, the look, everything about his performance was perfect.<br/><br/>Keri Russell was beautiful and a great contrast to Jonathan Rhys Meyers, she was elegant, he was a rocker, it worked brilliantly.<br/><br/>This movie is probably not for everyone, music lovers, specifically guitar/orchestra music fans will enjoy this.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a feel good movie, as it will leave you with a smile on your face."

He can instantaneously play a guitar, a pipe organ; write a symphony. It's obvious that adult hands are playing instruments when close up is shown of Evan playing an instrument. <br/><br/>Plot moves along so fast, skipping details which is why it is perfect for a child. <br/><br/>Actor who portrays Evan basically smiles and says ""no""; that's pretty much the extent of his dialogue through the entire film. <br/><br/>The very end, when his parents come together and see Evan on stage, the film ends.

It's obvious the people behind this movie tried to portray an urban fairy-tale about the power of music and love, but what they ended up doing was unintentionally insulting all the musicians and composers around the world--all due to the complete disregard and respect for how much work goes into becoming proficient as musicians and composers. <br/><br/>It's as if the people behind the movie have never met a single real child prodigy, musician, or composer in their lives, and then didn't have the respect or courtesy to research on how musicians and composers really learn and grow. they also never bothered to consider just how far they should veer from reality in order to to depict a ""child prodigy""-- even one that lives in a urban fairy-tale.<br/><br/>This child prodigy is so completely ridiculous that he might as well be called God. They made him so unrealistic that he makes all the famous child prodigies in the history of mankind look like untalented morons.

","August Rush...""The music is all around us. All you have to do is; listen!""<br/><br/>Wishing for a perfect mood-fix that will revive your senses and leave you with a smile? There you have it. This film will top everything your cinematic desires will wish for in a light, romantic, musically influenced picture. August Rush cannot be categorized as just a story, it is a fairytale, though without unicorns and butterflies, still very inspirational and uplifting in an indescribable way. It's a story about Evan ""Freddie Highmore"", a young music prodigy separated at birth from his parents, who uses his magically inherited musical talents in his quest to reunite his family.<br/><br/>What's unique about this movie is though it is set in the real world, it is nonetheless filled with endless fairytale elements that give it its special identity. From love at first sight on a roof of an NYC building, to the derelict, Oliver Twist like, children and their Wizard of a leader, to the magical musical and spiritual bond between three family members yet to be united. All these elements contribute in making August Rush an epic on its own terms.<br/><br/>Music is the fundamental rudiment of this picture, and it is undoubtedly a strong base for a stronger structure. With the assistance of the sound mixing and editing, almost every sound in the movie is transformed into rhythm. You can hear melodies through the blowing wind and beats through the sound of a dribbling basketball. The original soundtrack of August Rush is very powerful and it only adds the right flavor to the very simple, yet very touching story. The song ""Raise it up"" is arguably the only thing that is not left underrated in this film and that is due to its Oscar nomination in 2008 for best original song.<br/><br/>I can go on and on about how August Rush is satisfying on all levels, but there's one undeniable fact; that acting, especially that of Freddie Highmore is the corner stone of the whole thing. This is the same kid that fascinated Johnny Depp when they worked together in ""Finding Neverland"" and made him request him one more time to be the Charlie in ""Charlie & The Chocolate factory"". His smiles, his gestures, his calmness and his ability of transforming his character's inner thoughts and feelings to the audience, these all are factors in leaving the viewers no choice but to enjoy what they're seeing.<br/><br/>On top of that and besides the satisfying performances of Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell (the parents), you get the perfect portrayal of the caring Child Services officer by Terrance Howard and the leader of a gang of street performers by Academy Award winner Robin Williams. Their characters, though secondary, they serve tighten the story and give it more meaning and morality.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, August Rush is a fairytale of music, magic and love. It is like that song you'd play on regardless of your mood. It starts with a thought and ends with a rhapsody. It definitely leaves its audience with the perfect rush. So, let the music fill you up and make the most of it. It is a very pleasant experience!"

","What can I say  This movie moved me to tears and I hardly ever cry in movies. My mother and best friend also did not have dry eyes by the end. I can see it had mixed reviews. It seems the people who hated the movie really must hate miracles or anything that is remotely beautiful or magical. They obviously have never heard of or even understand there is such a thing as Universal serendipity. They have obviously never heard of 'Music Ophelia,' a term for those who have a very special, even sacred connection with music and it takes us to other worlds... lifts us to new heights of awareness... August had this, (I have this) -they *obviously* do not. One reviewer went who hated it went on to say he saw a lot of people outside the US loved it and that Americans obviously were more discerning - what an insult to non Americans, of which I am one (and to intelligent Americans as well). Perhaps viewers liked him (US or not) hated August Rush as there were no explosions, special effects, CGI beasties and the like. Perhaps brainless crap like Gi Joe: Rise of the Cobra will be more his scene. Discerning indeed. Perhaps people like him discern anything that makes them think, (ie their brain hurt). Sad that most moviegoers these days have their imagination beaten out of them by movies that leave NOTHING to the imagination. Movies like 'Bridge to Terabithia' hurt their brains if you read the reviews. Interesting that movies like this get bad reviews from the same kinds of people who would not be able to imagine their way out of a paper bag. <br/><br/>Very sad and damaging to humanity as a whole. Or perhaps people like them are like Robin Williams' character in the movie, they had this beautiful music in them and it was beaten out of them, and they're bitter & twisted or have become flat and lifeless. Very sad indeed. I'd rather be dead than lose that music deep within. So those people have a choice, find your inner music, reclaim it or for all intents and purposes you ARE dead. And the only one who can revive you is YOU. The more people who awaken and re-awaken in this world, the more alive, awake and aware and full of joy this world will be. So open your eyes, your mind, heart and soul - or shut your hole. What right have you to stomp on someone else's dreams because you let your own slip away, or you never had any? Get off your arse and make a difference like those who make movies like this one. If not you are part of the problem, not the solution to making this world a better one. The time is NOW.<br/><br/>August Rush was magical, beautiful and spiritual on many levels. The music melded together with such chemistry it was really beautiful. Augusts Rhapsody raised me to new levels of awareness He literally heard the music of the Universe and brought t for us to hear, the music of the earth, the country, the city and the people. How could people NOT see or hear this So sad that movies like this are wasted on those like the reviewer above, people like him really make me sad. This world is hard enough without cynical like him making it harder for those who really WANT to make a difference.<br/><br/>However it is heartening that there are those, like myself with the courage, imagination, strong will, stamina, belief and determination to transform this world into a better place in whatsoever makes their hearts and souls sing.<br/><br/>The music is all around us.

After being bullied by older boys, he runs away in an effort to follow the music he hears, and encounters, apparently for the first time in his life, actual musical instruments and live performers. <br/><br/>It turns out he is a musical prodigy that can play any instrument without instruction and can read and write music after only a minute or two of instruction. In New York City's Washington Square he meets a boy about his own age playing the guitar for tips, who introduces him to an Oliver Twist collection of musical beggars working for a Fagin-like character called the Wizard (Robin Williams). When the Wizard realizes how valuable an addition to his group Evan will be, he gets him to adopt a stage name, ""August Rush,"" in an effort to prevent people from identifying him as the boy whose picture the orphanage is circulating as a run-away.<br/><br/>Inter-cut with the boy's story is the story of his parents. Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell), Evan's birth mother, is a virtuoso classical musician. Evan is the result of a single passionate night with Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish rock singer-guitarist. Although they believe the other to be their soul mates, Lyla's father prevents them from seeing each other the next night and they lose all contact with each other. Lyla is pregnant from the encounter, and as a result of an accident has an emergency delivery. When she regains consciousness her father tells Lyla that the baby died in childbirth. It is not until years later when he is on his deathbed does he confesses to Lyla that he lied and that the child lived.<br/><br/>As the movie is a fantasy, it works out that the mother, father and son are all in New York again, with both Lyla and Evan participating in a philharmonic orchestra concert in the park.<br/><br/>The film is fairly fast paced; I was never bored. <br/><br/>In addition to the music, Keri Russell was perfect as Lyla. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was also very good. <br/><br/>It was not Robin Williams' best performance. In one sense Wizard is a sympathetic character whom we are led to believe also was an unappreciated musical talent with a sad childhood and who is aiding the talented kids he collects escape from bad family situations. On the other hand, he is a despicable monster exploiting the children for his own advantage. Balancing these two conflicting traits requires a sensitive performance that I don't think Mr. Williams demonstrated."

","I have seen many bad movies and this is not one of them. If you simply want to be entertained w/out being overly critical and understand that this movie is a considered a modern fairytale, then you will love it. If you are looking for the '100 % - no loop-hole story movie' then you'll be disappointed. I recommend this movie when your mood needs to be picked up, when you want to believe anything is possible and when you're in the mood for happy ending and a chain of ""coincidences"" that are simply outrageous but still feel so good in the end when it comes together. Enjoy Robin Williams' acting, the looks of Jonathan Rhys Meyers (who impresses as Henry VIII in Tutors/Showtime) and fall in love w/ Freddy Highmore's dimples. And if none of that works out for you, Jamia Simone Nash's singing voice and incredible cute face most definitely has to convince you that you invested your time wisely when picking this movie to watch. Simply... enjoy!"

","I was initially very skeptical about this movie, but I actually liked it a lot more than I expected. The music alone makes it worth the price of admission, and I'll be honest and say that after I saw it I went out and bought the soundtrack. The three leads were great too, Freddy Highmore I found to be particularly wonderful. I think that the biggest problem was it was a movie that didn't really seem to make up its mind. It feels like a fairy tale, and that is the way I took it, but I got the feeling that it was trying so hard to fit into too many genres at once. There are also some really great characters that I would have loved to see developed more, and it feels a little truncated towards the end, but it is a really good film, definitely worth your while."

Mozart who at the age of four years old went to his fathers harpsichord and started playing, he was composing by the age of seven, he like our hero here was a child prodigy, in the film they make this statement, so why is it hard to believe, there is a 7 year Japanese boy that plays guitar better than most bar band guitar players, he play a normal size guitar which is bigger than him he is on youtube, he is not alone. this film was beautifully acted brilliantly shot and with more heartfelt moments than i have experienced in many a long time. to those who hate a film like this, i say pity on you for a severe lack of imagination and emotion in your lives, to those of us that get it, august rush will always be a special film"

Great music is much like ink on tissue. A droplet is enough to spread a good coverage; a splash furthers the depth of the effect and a downpour showers every heart with brimming emotions. Piercing memories arouse at the sound of the sad cello; even more so by the hooking harmonica. Bliss is felt through chimes of wind and intensified by the vibrancy of the guitar. Intoxication develops as the symphony spreads the harmonic atmosphere, and gravitates the family to reunion. Music truly works magic. My heart is full, the upper part awed and spiced, the bottom indulged in retrospect. Those fortunate born to a loving family might not feels as much, but I admire the parents' unchanged love for each other and between parent and children, the undeterred faith of finding one another.

The only truly well explored characters are minor ie Wizard and Arthur. At least you understand and appreciate their motivation. Also the movie leaves you weepy but empty. Music should move your soul and it doesn't. The music is melodic but weak; I can't remember a single song. Also music should be transforming to the people that it touches and the movie doesn't show this transformation for Wizard and it is a missed opportunity.

","I'm hard to impress, but this one is worth full marks. Obviously, its a fairy story set in modern times, so a lot of things in it are coincidental, illogical, and even magical. Actually, this adds to the charm of the story. It isn't meant to be analysed critically. It's meant to be enjoyed, and in this it succeeds. I was impressed by the way the ambient sounds were incorporated into the music. The actors were first class, and I even liked Robin Williams playing the Fagin part. Freddie Highmore is highly polished as August. The orphanage looked a bit Dickensian, and not like a modern children's home. (Wouldn't be permitted to operate here.) The kid buskers in Wizard's theatre looked like a pinch from ""The Thief Lord"". It was heavily dependent on ""Oliver Twist"". But we must remember there are only seven stories, and this one removed itself from the originals. So I didn't give it a ten, but a nine is very good. As far as ratings are concerned, the film is quite suitable for kids. It has no real violence or profanity. I wouldn't mind letting anyone over 9 watch it. The social issues are worth discussing, and the music is a pleasant blend of new and old, put together in a way that doesn't jar the senses. Well done, everyone involved."
"howard.schumann","8","1","2","23 March 2008"," Reflects a world of creativity and spiritual connection
","Bullied by older boys in an orphanage, Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is an eleven-year old who believes that his parents are still alive and that he can reach out to them through the power of music. Kirsten Sheridan's August Rush is an example of the genre known as magical realism and is best viewed as an inspired fable. Though there is precious little realism, the combination of exuberant music, the outstanding performance of Freddie Highmore plus solid supporting stints by Keri Russell, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Terence Howard make August Rush a very enjoyable and often moving experience in spite of its logical disconnects. <br/><br/>In flashback we find out that Evan's parents, cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Irish rock singer Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) met in Greenwich Village and had a meeting of the minds and bodies together on a rooftop while trying to escape from a boring party. Their relationship is thwarted, however, by Lyla's stern father (William Sadler) who, after the pregnant Lyla is hit by a car and gives birth prematurely, tells her that her baby has died. Unaware that the boy is still alive and has been sent to an orphanage by her father, Lyla and Louis abandon their careers. Lyla moves to Chicago to become a music teacher and Louis becomes a businessman in San Francisco. We pick up on their lives eleven years later (neither seems to have aged in the process).<br/><br/>Unwilling to be placed with a foster family, Evan runs away from the orphanage and becomes involved with a group of street musicians in Washington Square Park. In the scenes in Greenwich Village, director Kristen Sheridan has given us a lovely vision of New York reminiscent of her father's ""In America"", and also of Steven Zaillian's ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"". It is here that Evan discovers that he has natural musical ability as he picks up a guitar and entertains the gathering crowd for a sizable payday. Asking another young busker for a place to stay, he is routed to an abandoned theater where, in the tradition of Oliver Twist, he meets other musicians who are sent out on the street to play for money by an overbearing Fagin-like Robin Williams whom they call the Wizard. <br/><br/>When you think the string of unlikely events has reached its limits, Evan, now called August Rush, finds a church choir of angelic magnitude where a pastor with connections sends him to the Julliard School of Music and a concert in Central Park playing music that he has composed. While events stretch our credulity, August Rush at its core is not about the story but about possibility. With its theme of tuning in to the world around us and opening ourselves to its music, it may just be the first film that anticipates a world reflecting a consciousness that is not governed by logic but by creativity and spiritual connection. If this strikes you as so much nonsense, you may want to avoid this film."

Yes, it is a little cheesy, but if you have any sort of imagination, you'll definitely see its genius. I went into the theater to see this film with my mom, round' about midnight. I was expecting something stupid, I'd only seen the commercial where the kid is dancing in the grass or something, but wow! This soundtrack is a must have item, and the plot is extremely moving.

I didn't give the movie my highest rating because I feel that it could have done a little more to improve the credibility of certain characters and events. The motivations behind Lyla's father to fraudulently give her baby up for adoption, why Louis didn't/couldn't seek out Lyla earlier, the ability of the Wizard to maintain his extensive ""family"" business, August's induction into Julliard, the lack of references for jumps in the time line etc., are just a little thin but fortunately are not so bad that they cannot be overlooked in the sweep and scope of the movie and its focus on the mysticism and spirituality of music.

","The trailer of this movie was very promising. It looked like a nice film about music with a good story where you can feel with the characters. It turned out to be a movie with disappointing depth and a very predictable story. However, Robin Williams was really great!! The character development was extremely unbelievable. It started with the beginning of the movie. The two parents meet each other, and in 20 seconds they fall in love and the next you know she is pregnant. Well, I am sorry, but how the .... are you going to believe that?? That part really disappointed me. It is so unlikely and the rest of the movie was with so little depth that I hardly felt any connection with the two parents. It had lots and lots of clichés and cheap ideas, making it very predictable and boring.<br/><br/>I understand that the story needs unbelievable things to happen, because it's a sort of fairytale, but that doesn't mean that you can throw all depth out of it..<br/><br/>What about the main character? Someone please tell that guy to stop smiling every single time he touches a instrument. I can understand that music is his gift etc. but he was so overacting. Completely unbelievable and therefore making it again harder to feel with the little guy. He turned out to be frustrating me instead of making me feel other emotions.<br/><br/>I give the movie a rating above 5 because Robin Williams is playing such a great role in the movie! In all the movies I have seen, he plays friendly, caring persons, and here he is doing a alter ego of that. Very cool to see!! Definitely worth it if you are a fan of him.<br/><br/>I do have to say I did had some emotional moments while watching the movie, especially the end, but the movie felt most like watching I am Legend: awful shallow, and leaving me wondering why they didn't made a good movie out of a fine concept.

"jaredmobarak","8","1","2","17 March 2008"," The music is all around us; all you have to do is listenAugust Rush
","This is a fairytale above anything else and one should overlook any eccentricities or impossibilities of real life, this is not meant to show truth. Instead we are shown a romantic tale of conquering all odds in order to reunite lost souls, whether that be a child and his parents, a man and a woman who shared a night long ago, a social worker and his belief in the power of love, or a homeless musical talent with the knowledge that there are still people out there listening, not just learning from books and how to imitate, but truly listening to the sounds around them and creating art for the love of music itself. Because as we all know, you must ""love music more than food, more than even yourself."" This film had great potential when I saw the trailer, but I never really thought it could ever live up to it. I saw it falling into the Hollywood pitfalls of convenience and laziness, making everything overly sentimental and dripping with saccharine. Now, there's a fair share of those moments, yet I never minded one bit because the heart was always at the forefront. Being so instilled with an otherworldly quality and fairytale mystic, nothing seems out of place. One needs those moments of coincidence and chance bringing paths together along the way. Sure it happens in real life, but in the stories told to us as children it occurs all the time. We as kids need those common tomes and roads intertwining in order to wrap our minds around the cause of all the inevitable happiness. Fate brings good things together in these types of tales and for that reason each moment rings absolutely truethat is if you let the story take you over and buy into its magic.<br/><br/>Sheridan orchestrates the visual music to perfection. When our star, Evan Taylor/August Rush, played by Freddie Highmore, hears the world around him making their songs, it is stunning to behold. The quick cuts from shoes on the street, basketballs on the chain netting, steam emitted from smokestacks, etc, bring each symphony into reality. Even those moments when he sets his eyes on an instrument for the first time, intuitively knowing how to play it, make you believe his pure joy in the act and his genius in order to play what he does. Highmore is quite the talent and I'm not sure how to take what I have heard recently about him saying he will quit acting once he grows up. For one I have all the respect in the world for that decision, stop with the success now and make a life for yourself instead of fighting through the pressure and criticisms of never being as good older as you were in the past. However, I can't help but think he may have some greatness left in him that we may never be able to experience.<br/><br/>As for the tale itself, we are treated with the union of two musicians lost on their way to adulthood. A rockstar unsure of the life he is being asked to live and a Julliard trained cellist attempting to reconcile her love for the craft with the hatred of her father forcing her into it. Their love brings forth a child that they will never know, yet who will never give up in the search to find them. With music as the canvas connecting them all together, they journey out of the safe lives they have lived, following the music eleven years later in order to see if the happiness they once knew could still be out there for the taking. It really is a gorgeous tale of love and hope, sprinkled with some visual panache and the unabashed confidence to let songs, both lyrical and instrumental, bolster the proceedings into a concert of vibrancy.<br/><br/>Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers both are wonderful as the torn lovers finding themselves and eventually the desire to find each other again. I was very surprised to see that Rhys Meyers actually sang his own songs being that the lip-synching was so horrible, but I don't want that to hamper my viewing of the use of music here. Every performance is believable and well done. Even the guitar slapping, something I have never seen before, is quite mesmerizing to behold. Terrence Howard brings a nice role to the story as well, playing the social worker trying to work as a liaison between all parties, always with the best interests of the child in mind. And of course there is Robin Williams. His role is a far cry from the one that is fleshed out in the trailer. While he does what he can to help the boy, his motives are not as wholesome as you may expect in the beginning. Attempting to live out the fantasy of success he must have always had in life, he begins to put the boy's best interests into the backseat. It leads to some powerful moments and he does a great job with the tough role.<br/><br/>Through it all, though, everything that happens leads into the climax of the film. What a scene that is too. Starting with the concerts of both Russell and Rhys Meyers, on different sides of NYC, and Highmore underground awaiting his next move while his debut begins above him, we are led full circle through all the relationships that have been brought forth. Every character finally becomes that which they have been workings towardsmention should be made for Leon G. Thomas III as Arthur with some fantastic work. Yes, the conclusion is obvious, but it is also the perfect ending to the story. There are no epilogues or embraces of happiness, instead we get what we deserve, a final instance of music bringing the world together and helping lovers find their way."

","I must do here a little confession - when I went to see this movie I was really sceptically minded about all this. See, I am not a lover of musicals and definitely not a one to appreciate musical with so much classic music rolled in.<br/><br/>But now, having watched it for two times already, and surely going to see it later even more times, I must say that I have changed my mind completely. I just LOVED it. Loved it all - the performance of young Freddie Highmore aka August Rush/ Evan Taylor which was so sincere and convincing that few minutes into the movie my whole soul and mind was deep in it. So was performances of Keri Russel and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. This was a small wonder performed in such a beautiful and captivating manner that even me, who long forgot the charms of kindergarten, was so tuned in to the story that I could hardly sit still. I wanted cry, shout at every misfortune, and sing aloud with all my heart with fortune of our little character.<br/><br/>What is this all about? August Rush is a beautiful and captivating urban fairy tale, where a little music genius growing-up in an orphanage sets to find his parents. And the music which surrounds him just everywhere is his alpha and omega in the search. A little bit of Oliwer Twist, tons of heartbreaking music, and great performances as of leading as of supporting characters, and here I have got my trick - for the moment I am fallen in love this this movie.<br/><br/>10 of 10, though would like to add also '+'"

","If someone who is colorblind tells me that he finds Van Gogh's Starry Night to have nice brush strokes, excellent composition, but overall finds it to be dull chromatically, I can only sigh and realize that, sadly, he will never get it.<br/><br/>One of the big negatives I read here in the, happily, few negative reviews, is the that the scenes are too drawn out and that there is too little dialog. I fear this can only be tone deafness. The realization I fail to see on these pages, is that there is one lead character and three main supporting characters (and Robin Williams isn't any of them). The three main supporting characters are Freddie Highmore, Keri Russell and Jonathon Rhys-Meyers. The Lead Character is the Music. Those ""long drawn out scenes"" with ""too little dialog,"" are exactly the right length with the Music giving full and beautiful voice to its monologue.<br/><br/>Some have complained of the ""lack of character arc."" Tonedeaf, again, the Music begins lightly, almost chaotically, builds to a minor crescendo explores a few minor variations, but returns to its original theme in a major way incorporating the variations and build to a dramatic and major crescendo finishing with joyous, but subdued coda.<br/><br/>The arcs of the next level of characters are simple but strong. Freddie's character is Picaresque, he is a boy with a mission, his dramatic arc is very simple he has the goal, he needs to find the means and then achieve it. Jonathon and Keri's arcs are clearly drawn: dissatisfaction, love found, love lost, realization, resolution, love found.<br/><br/>All brilliantly done.<br/><br/>If it wouldn't scare away 80% of the film's audience, I would call it opera.

Halfway through the movie I felt like going to sleep. I fail to see any excitement in the movie. I was also bewildered by the poor INTRO.

","This is a family film that looked like it might be different. It could've been an excellent movie, because the premise was actually quite good, but instead we end up with nonstop events leading to a ridiculous ending to an average film.<br/><br/>All his life, Taylor (Freddie Highmore) knew his parents were listening for him, and music is what would bring them together. Taylor can find music in anything, and because of this he's picked on at the orphanage. He decides to run away and the plot goes from there. This movie almost felt like an anthology at times, because it would quickly switch plots from Taylor (later known as August Rush) to his mom to his dad, to the Wizard (Robin Williams looking a lot like Bono). It is a very sweet movie, and it has good music in it, but in all other categories it's lacking. The acting is pretty good, but the writing and direction ruins the acting. Keri Russell plays Taylor's mother, and the entire movie walks around with her mouth wide open, which gets very annoying. Clichés of all types are constantly being used, including the cliché bullies. There are also a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies, it just get's annoying. The last 20 minutes of the movie was the most ridiculous part and was hard to watch. But, if you don't care what the movies you see consist of, then this would be fine to see.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a pretty serious family film with good music, and some occasional fun moments, but overall it's a very clichéd, flawed film.<br/><br/>My rating: ** out of ****. 106 mins.

","After watching the preview (and finding out that Alex O'Loughlin has a role in it), I just had to see this movie. So about an hour before I wanted to go to sleep, I put the movie in, and I watched it all the way through, exceeding said bedtime by an hour, but it was more than worth it.<br/><br/>It started out with a voice-over from Evan, and this is when (if you're a music lover, whether classical or in general) you get hooked. YOu just feel that certain something pulling you into the movie, you feel how you're connected to the music and his story, and I am no orphan or grew up in an orphanage.<br/><br/>Highmore plays his character very well, he comes across as a damaged young boy, who wants one thing in the world desperately: to find his parents and be with them. His gift for music (undoubtedly inherited from both his parents) helps him tremendously and is a treat to watch develop. Some reviews stated his performance to be weak, because he isn't all happy and giddy all the time, but I find this a perfect depiction of the boy he's supposed to play. 10/10<br/><br/>Rhys Meyers also proves his money's worth: In love or heartbroken, as a businessman or a rock band member, he can play it all. He played out his character exactly as you would imagine a person like that to be. I cannot say any more about him.<br/><br/>Russel hasn't done anything deserving less than a praise: She looks so avidly for her son, it's heartbreaking to see how much she cares. You can just feel and see so much going on in between the lines with all three actors, it's ridiculous to try and explain it with words. <br/><br/>Yes, the ending may have left me wanting a bit. But the truth is, if you can't see what's going to happen after the final scene, you wouldn't get it if it was played out for you in all its details.<br/><br/>YOu should definitely watch the movie.

","Okay, somebody please tell me why so many people raved about ""August Rush""?????<br/><br/>I watched it last night with great expectations and simply wanted it to end.<br/><br/>When it started I loved the approach, the way it was layered and shot and delivered and I settled in thoroughly anticipating a wonderfully crafted movie, ESPECIALLY since I'm a guitarist.<br/><br/>And I DID enjoy it up to the point where Evan/August enters the abandoned theatre with the black kid and - oh my goodness!- not only does the condemned building have fully functioning electricity and lights - but just happens to be infested with nothing but musical prodigies and the mandatory taskmaster, Robin Williams. Okay, I thought, I'll accept this absurdity and suspend my grasp on reality for a moment. But from that point on the movie decided to enter into fantasyland. No one... I mean NO ONE - EVER - has picked up a guitar or piano with zero instruction and zero experience and started playing the way he did MUCH LESS write a freakin' symphony. Okay, I know it's a movie, but I can only suspend belief so far. Then began the ridiculous way every single event just happened to come together: - His mom just happening into the one single right child services office where the one single social worker just happened to be that knew Evan/August (oh, and do we even need to mention the supposedly 'dying' father - who didn't look too sick to me - telling her about the baby, which I kind of doubt any dad who was as controlling as hers was would ever do?) - the ex-boyfriend deciding to get on a plane to New York and, by golly, gee whiz, ending up at the right concert at the right time just a few feet away from the woman he met 10 years ago, spent ONE FRIGGIN' NIGHT WITH, and never forgot. - And oh yeah, BTW, they recognized each other immediately because, of course, they didn't happen to AGE any in 10 years! - And the mandatory angst moment when Robin Williams happens to find August at the exact right time to coerce him away from the symphony and back into the streets.<br/><br/>Give me a break. I mean, really. This movie could have been magnificent. Instead, it took a wonderful idea and moved from a solid beginning premise into an absurd manufacturing of events in order to complete an unlikely and mostly unbelievable story.<br/><br/>Good soundtrack though."

","A few years ago I saw The Legend of 1900 and it was really a collection film for me. After that, I said to myself that I would never watch a movie like that, ever.. but today I was wrong. Movies about music really fascinate me, 'cause I'm a music lover and everything and this film really done it for me. The story, the characters, the actors playing them were perfect, in my opinion. Rhys Meyers played the young man who flirted with rock 'n' roll and who had a one night stand, so to speak, which created a fascinating turn of events.. the child musical prodigy that came to the world and was given to an orphanage as a result of a father who thought it was the right thing to do.. Was it or was it not? I don't know. But anyway, he played his role very well, very natural, it was like.. made for him. As for Highmore.. well, the modesty, the sensitivity brought me thinking back to Artificial Intelligence when he played the role of that robot boy who longed to find his mother. How great of an actor he is! Robin Williams? My favourite. Well, he played his role like I'd never expected it, knowing that he is especially a comedy actor. He was so into it, very natural, he lived his role to the fullest. Overall I give a ten, although it deserves much more than that."

","As I said once in ""Silence Becomes You"" I liked very much the whole artistic touch in August Rush. Music can be seen from any perspective you like, and one of them is the perspective of feelings. One kid, hearing any kind of sound and melting it down into music, only because he misses his parents; that is a really good plot for developing a feeling's art movie.<br/><br/>We are talking about a prodigy of music, a new Mozart or Bach. Why could not be August a new Bach? We do not really know what Bach thought while he was composing or playing, so it could perfectly be his mother or father. That is why I liked the movie, it makes me think about how different can music represent for any of us.<br/><br/>Also, August Rush gave us a nice soundtrack, ending with the most important track of the movie: The August's Rhapsody, and a great and simple message: Music it's everywhere, we only have to listen. All of that mixed up with beautiful camera takes and pictures.<br/><br/>I really recommend this movie if you are a musician, specially a musician who is wondering what music really is (maybe you found something personal in the movie)."

","Schmaltzy and predictable, AUGUST RUSH will still manage to please most movie-goers. The basic ingredients make this so: a healthy helping of a cute young kid (Freddie Highmore, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY), a dose of a busted-up, romantic, musical couple (Keri Russell, SCRUBS, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, MATCH POINT), and the sprinkling of a slimy vagabond (Robin Williams, HAPPY FEET).<br/><br/>Highmore has come a long way in his short life. Having immensely enjoyed his portrayal as Peter in FINDING NEVERLAND, I have followed the career path of this super-young-star with interest. Most recently he's starred in THE GOLDEN COMPASS and THE SPIDERWICK CHRONCLES, two blockbuster films. Whoever his agent is, they've done a fantastic job.<br/><br/>But Highmore has never taken on a role quite as focused as August Rush before. He tended to be overshadowed by the larger than life actors that played beside him (Johnny Depp, Anjelica Huston, etc.). But this time, the focus is all on his character, Evan/August Rush. His name change from Evan to August is affected by the wayward homeless musician ""The Wizard"" played by Robin Williams. The slime-factor is high for Williams here, higher than I've ever seen from him. This also made the story much more interesting and made you dislike Williams' Wizard character in the extreme.<br/><br/>The love story between Lyla (Keri Russell) and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is executed well if a bit distant and unrealistic. Their one night stand that results in a pregnancy becomes the culminating factor that binds all of the characters together. Well ...that ...and music, of course.<br/><br/>Evan (Highmore) is lost amidst the U.S. orphanage industry until he eventually makes good his escape. He carries with him only his belief that music will somehow connect him with his unknown parents. He's lived music his entire, short life, so whenever he comes into contact with an instrument (be it a guitar or a piano) he quickly grasps its workings and can play it within moments. A prodigy, he's soon called by those that know him. Pulling him away from his dreams, however, is The Wizard, a man who wants to personally capitalize on Evan's astounding abilities by prostituting him to the highest bidder ...the highest bidder willing to pay his manager (i.e., The Wizard).<br/><br/>Juilliard is offered up to Evan, and he quickly surpasses all those before him. But he still hasn't found his parents (who are also musicians), and a concert in New York's Central Park soon beckons them together. It's so sweet it'll make your eye-teeth ache.<br/><br/>Even with its overly-sweet beginning, middle, and end, August Rush is something of a must for those who enjoy unique musical playing and the process of melodious discovery.<br/><br/>Just don't eat any chocolate while watching it."

"DICK STEEL","10","1","3","1 March 2008"," A Nutshell Review: August Rush
","Freddie Highmore could be the current hot property as far as male child actors go, and Singapore has lined up two of his movies this week, with The Spiderwick Chronicles for the kiddie audience, and the more mature drama August Rush, which I thought was almost an Oliver Twist with music inclinations.<br/><br/>Highmore plays titular character August Rush, a stage name he and rogue guardian Wizard (a menacing Robin Williams) conjured when the latter realizes the music genius in the young boy who could be his ticket to instant riches. However, for August, his escape from the orphanage is to seek out his true biological parents, whom he believes earnestly is alive, and had to abandon him because of circumstances. Keri Russell plays cellist Lyla Novacek and Jonathan Rhys Meyers an indie rock star Louis Connelly, which more or less explains their offspring as a musical prodigy, able to pick up the essence of various sounds to distill the music in them, and could learn to play instruments by observation and by ear.<br/><br/>The story is told in two tracks, both of which will probably wring at your heart for the many missed chances and opportunities that would have made this a short film. But of course sentimental cruelty rules the day and everyone's kept apart for the most parts, while allowing you to jump with joy each time you are presented moments where the key leads get to interact with one another. The first track which is August Rush centric, as mentioned, is Oliver Twist, plain simple and obvious. Freddie Highmore alone is charismatic enough to hook, line and sinker your attention as he goes about his heartwarming quest to locate his folks, while at the same time his vulnerability allows him to be exploited since he's quite condescending.<br/><br/>The second part of the story I thought was the more touching part, with two lovers not being granted the opportunity to spend more than 1 night together, and must separate because of parental insistence that ""it's for your own good"", though probably the cynic in us could have said, it's the age of technology, and obviously Louis could have every chance to track her down, but just didn't. Well, that leaves room for the story to be told the way it is, doesn't it, and it's quite the standard romantic affair of having love lost, and love found. That one bit with Louis hesitating, I can jolly well identify with, as with the channelling of his energies to his more creative pursuits although still leaving room for some lamenting.<br/><br/>August Rush boasts and excellent soundtrack, some of which merged classical and rock ballads in an almost seemingly perfect fusion, which I can't help but to admire and were a real treat to sit through. Given a choice between the two Freddie Highmore movies, this one gets my vote of recommendation, hands down!"
"chrystalkay","10","1","3","10 February 2008"," One of the best movies of it's type!
","This is a fantastic movie! The acting is superb for all the characters.<br/><br/>You have to take it on it's own terms. It skips from 'present' to 'past' back and forth but it is very important to the movie to see how it plays. Pay special attention to the 'connections' that play between the characters. It is very well expressed. The boy says he can 'hear' his parents. Well it is apparent that the parents and the child ARE connected on a level that only the child seems to be aware of. But his awareness and the genius he expresses in musical form clearly shows that he is set apart from the rest of us.<br/><br/>Note with small spoiler: When the parents meet, there is a musician playing in the square below them... I believe that this is 'Wizard' that finds the boy 11 years later. At least the time line and the figure with the same hat he wears seems to be him.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes music: much like Bethovian, Mozart, MOVING, exciting, emotional, and character all sum up the music you will experience upon viewing this movie.

","Fine, this movie is sappy, predictable too, but it's good none the less. There are contrivances and coincidences but then it is at heart a fairy tale. So accept it as one, dear critics, and don't rant.<br/><br/>If you're going to see it, make sure the cinema has a good sound system because an alternative title could have been ""The glory of music"". You get: cello concerto, pulse-rousing rock, a cappella gospel spiritual, strumming guitar, lofty organ, full orchestra symphonic sound and more.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Two musicians, he a rock vocal-and-guitarist and she a classic cellist, fell in love at first sight (very fairy tale, yes) and got pregnant (one of them, anyway) at their first night of romance. Taken away by her typical upper-class father and later giving premature birth, the girl was led to believe that it was a stillbirth. The story is about how the boy, after 11 years in an orphanage, runs away and eventually finds the parents through their magical link  music.<br/><br/>There is no point going through the rest of the story, which has been torn to shreds by many critics who, unfortunately, are barking up the wrong tree. The plot is but a convenient vehicle to expound the main theme: the glory of music. One thing however that should be mentioned is a Fagin character (Dicken's ""Oliver Twist"") played by Robin Williams, as I have more to say about him. The movie is as predictable as one can make, but that is not a problem.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore (Charlie in the recent remake of Willy Wonker's Chocolate Factory) appears to be on his way to becoming the next Haley Joel Osment. Some critics complain that there is not enough ""expression"" from him, whatever that means. But he is playing a very exceptional human being, maybe the only musical prodigy with such talents since Mozart. A large part of his world is immersed in sounds, both natural and unnatural, in a way no other human being can fully comprehend. Highmore's interpretation of the character is just fine. <br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers' rock musician father reminds me of Joaquin Phoenix in ""Walk the line"", and I can't help but think that maybe Meyers will make a good Johnny Cash too had he been given the role. In this movie, there is one scene, the first encounter of father and son (unknown to each other) that might have been a re-run of the legendary banjo-guitar duet in ""Deliverance"", with good effects. Keri Russell, who was the oldest of the four sisters in ""The upside of anger"", does a good job with the sympathy winning mother. Terrence Howard who did so well playing against Jodi Foster in ""The brave one"" is, unfortunately, completely underutilized here.<br/><br/>I do have one complaint, and this has to do with Robin Williams' character. It is as if the movie makers have gone into split personality that they project into the character. It is almost a disgrace at the end to turn him back into a greedy Fagin just to feed the cheap, common run-and-chase scene. The ""Wizard"" (William's character), Fagin notwithstanding, is after all the boy's first music teacher. His detestation for the classical mode does not take anything away from his passion for music. It would elevate the movie to another level if at the eleventh hour, he changes his mind and let the boy go freely to follow his dreams, classical music or not. That would ring true with the central theme of ""the glory of music"". Wonder if Williams had ever complained about this."

The music is a joy, the acting is simply superb. I came across this accidentally whilst looking for another movie and a happy accident it turned out to be.<br/><br/>Its very rare I actually purchase soundtrack CD's but this one is a must have. Jonathan Rhys Meyers has a surprisingly good voice and the instrumental tracks are bliss.<br/><br/>You could almost compare the plot to Oliver and that wouldn't be a bad thing either."

","Beautiful is the only word I feel does justice in describing this film. If it does not sweep the Oscars, something is just plain wrong. The acting, music, and photography were incredible. Did I mention the music? The music was a character in it's own right. I have never seen a more beautifully orchestrated movie. It flowed, it flowed off the screen and out of the speakers through the air and through the soul. I was so caught up that I forgot that this was just a movie. But what a movie. This one will definitely be added to the collection. I haven't seen a good tear-jerker in a long time and this one rates right up there."

","I am an avid movie watcher. I went to this movie knowing little about it and found myself utterly engrossed in the plot, the music, the filmography, and the great acting. It begins with the usual boy-meets-girl-and-has-sex-before-learning-anything-about-the-other plot line. Yet, this ""hooking-up"" is not done with the glamorous hedonistic James Bond style, but rather is formulated as sincere love and chemistry; and it is a very necessary part of the plot. There is no nudity or sex shown, everything is implied. So, to really enjoy the show, those with conventional morality should bear with it, enjoy the music and wait for the wonderful culmination."

How boring the world would be if each individual didn't have their own opinions or the opportunity to think or feel for themselves.<br/><br/>I don't even know why I bother reading reviews. I don't like people telling me what I should think or feel ... Then why am I writing a review you ask.

Then you can decide for yourself how you feel about it.<br/><br/>For me personally, this is the best movie I have seen in a long time. My only complaint was that it wasn't long enough. (I sure hope the DVD has deleted scenes! ... and a director's commentary because I would love to hear the creative process.)

"ozzie227","9","1","3","16 December 2007"," Enjoyable
","I usually like any movie with Felicity(Keri Russell) in it. I think I will always think of her as an NYU student. She has really grown as an actress with this role that includes playing the cello, suggested sex, dealing with the red tape child welfare system and realizing that she is acting in a fantasy movie. Jonathan Ryce-Davies was excellent as the torn singer from Europe, As in Match Point he plays an emotional wreck very well. Even Robin (NaNu) Williams was digestible. It was nice to see him playing a Fagan like character instead of a psycho killer as in past movies. I wonder though, how did August play the guitar so well by playing upside down and swatting at the strings? Truly a fantasy. The scenes in Harlem were exciting and the little girl in the church was super in her small part. So if you can view this movie as a fantasy and not a true story I highly recommend it."

","I don't have a lot to say except to repeat the summary.. See this movie. Everything caught me up in it, the acting..the story and the sweet, sweet soundtrack. I came right home, logged into iTunes and bought the whole album. Seriously. The character of August Rush was so endearing he just made me want to snatch him up and take him home myself. Some say it might be a little 'too sweet' but you know what? With the real world bogging me down with depressing headlines all the time, who doesn't need something a little too sweet sometimes? I highly suggest you run right out right now! Right now!! And see it. Don't wait for rental...see it now!"

","The only reason I did not give August Rush tens stars was because I felt like I needed about five more minutes of this movie where this poor determined boy finally got a hug from his parents who did love him, did hear his music, and did want him!! I loved watching this child (Freddie Highmore) play the guitar, he is truly talented. I will be watching this movie again. I wasn't really fond of Robin Williams's character,but I am pretty sure that was the point. He was just disgusting to me. What an unbelievable voice that Jonathan Rhys Meyers has on him. Keri Russell did well and Terrance Howard was a definite plus. Jamia Simone Nash (Hope) had an absolutely beautiful voice."

","I absolutely loved this movie. Each actor's performance and actresses' performance was incredible. the style of the shooting of the camera, the angle it was shot, the music, all of it truly wonderful. it was a decent length too. a lot of children's lives can be compared to this movie, a lot of orphan's lives i mean. Freddy highmore is doing so many movies and is doing them so well, before working with Johnny Depp, and now with Joanathan Rhys-Meyes, Kerri Russel, Terence Howard and last but not least, one of the greatest and more widely known actor's of our time, Mr. robin Williams. robin's performance was intense and great and dramatic. i could tell he really took on his character's role very well. Kerri Russell is beautiful and performs wonderful. Terrence does a stellar job. everyone does an absolute stellar job. now the one thing that didn't make this movie a 10, and I'm starting to see this a lot in other movies that are coming out now too, is the ending. they should've and could've done the ending different. some may agree, some may disagree. but overall, it was the bomb of all children substantial quality movies."

Kid's acting was so amazing; I give my salute to writer and director for making such a beautiful movie. Movie have all the elements romance, love, thrill, suspense and that made t a Master piece of musical movie, The way they showed about music is absolutely right, music is everything that gives us rhythm which gives us passion which takes us to that peak from where that touches our emotions and souls. I am quiet happy tonight that finally I've seen a best musical movie of my life, and I will suggest this movie to all these guys who loves music, it doesn't matter what type of music."

","This movie is simply the greatest movie ever made(according to it's combination of genres). I've never seen something like this before. If you make, listen, love music and you do it with passion then this is a must see. It has everything but the main theme is the music. The music that is all around us, you just have to listen. Freddie Highmore always had good roles but this is his best. He's such a smart kid(according to the big screen). The cast was excellent everything was wonderful. You may find glitches if you're looking for them but this movie is so breathtaking that you'll barely remember who you are. I'm speechless...go and see it as soon as you can. If you are only looking for a bloody horror action film then don't bother, but if you are sensitive to ""beautiful"" and love music you'll get out of the cinema going to the nearest music store buying every instrument that gets in your hand."
"HazieG","6","1","3","11 December 2007"," Cliché goodness, down to the last drop
","I'm not entirely sure what to write about this movie. Except to say that as I left the theater, I couldn't help thinking, ""How predictable was this movie?"" The answer was, extremely. Now, don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't bad. The music was beautiful, and the filming lovely, but the plot lacked depth. I felt nothing for the little boy, except a mild case of annoyance. Both of the parents just seemed whiny (and this is coming from a girl who is extremely devoted to Jonathan Rhys Meyers) I just couldn't help it; as each step of the plot progressed, I found myself thinking, ""this is silly, and cheesy, and just like every children's movie I've ever seen!"" So my advice is, don't make a trip to the movie theaters, unless you have children who are interested in music. Otherwise, rent it, watch it when you want to avoid anything and everything thought provoking. And enjoy 2 hours of mild amusement and easily predicted outcomes."

Robin Williams was a breath of fresh air, playing a character outside his comfort zone, and I think he also did a good job.

"polinka","9","1","3","9 December 2007"," loved the movie despite the flows
","First of all, it is a fairytale, not a real dramatic story; something for Christmas, that adults -romantic ans sensitive ones, who enjoy music,- will have a good time with. the cast is beautiful, the music is a joy and there is the nice story about a boy looking for his parents through music. Even though the story is supposed to be sad and heart wrenching - it is not. Robin Williams is not ""Feygin"",and the young protégé is not ""Oliver Twist"". that's one of the reasons that you feel a bit remote and not involved in the story.(actually I felt bad for the boy who played Arthur, and was the favoured before ""August Rush""). The part with the forged signature was completely unbelievable (we are talking 1995 here!), but - as I said, it is a fairytale about people in love, loving music, bringing to the world a wonderful child who makes them proud the moment they lay their eyes on him...are they not a bit like you and me, or who we would love to be?..."

","Bring along a box of Kleenex people because this wonderful plus film will rip the guts out of you. As of this date, 12/8/07, it's the best film I've seen in '07 and I'll go out on a limb by saying that 15 year old Freddie Highmore, who is 11.5 in the movie, will be nominated for the Best Actor Oscar.<br/><br/>This is one brilliant film filled with a roller-coaster of emotions,thrilling music and didacticism for all of us.Whoever thinks that music doesn't connect us is in for a surprise and it makes no difference whether those notes emanate from Juliard, a street corner singer, a subway artist, the New York Philharmonic or a church organ--they all make a difference in our lives and how magnificently ""August Rush"" displays it.<br/><br/>I'm sure all of you have seen films about child prodigies, be they musical or otherwise inclined. But you have never seen a film that so cleverly combines Freddie's God-given skills in juxtaposition with those of his parents played by Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers resulting in a finale that breaks you into little pieces.<br/><br/>And for a family to be reunited under the circumstances shown in the film is absolutely mind-blowing.I can say this without reservation: the writer of this story, Richard Barton Lewis, is a flaming genius.You will never see a film with a powerfully emotional ending.

Robin Williams also does a great job and leaves you in suspense during most of the movie as to whether he's actually a good guy or protagonist. In fact I'm still thinking about that one. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was just marvelous as well, I'm still getting chills recalling the interplay between the scenes of the mother and father (and later August) playing as their individual music slowly blends into one score, it was just amazing how well it worked. <br/><br/>This is one DVD I'm definitely buying for the collection and I can't say that about too many these days."

"zoerobe","4","1","3","4 December 2007"," I'm in the minority
","Before I start this review, I want to mention that I was one of the few who hated ""Forrest Gump."" So perhaps I should have known better than to go see another movie about a wide-eyed innocent. But I did. In it, Freddie Highmore plays the titular character. While Gump was guided by a magical feather and the love of a woman, August is guided by music. Music, he explains in several voiceovers is everywhere! We just have to open our ears.<br/><br/>The product of a one night stand between two talented musicians (Keri Russell as a classically-trained cellist) and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as am alternative-rock star, August lives in an orphanage and maintains, in the tradition of all plucky movie orphans, that his parents are still alive, even though everyone tries to tell him otherwise. Eventually, he runs away to New York City, where he has a series of adventures that the scriptwriters don't even try to pretend aren't cribbed from ""Oliver Twist."" He meets an African-American urchin who takes him to his mentor's hideout and tells him to consider himself part of the family. The mentor is called Wizard, played by Robin Williams, who exploits a crew of homeless young musicians. Wizard is bad, but fortunately for August, the city is also populated by saintly minorities who teach him to write music and help him get accepted to Juilliard. No, the movie doesn't explain how. This is fantasy, you see. You must suspend disbelief and open your heart. Especially, at the end, when August is finally successful in reuniting his folks. No, it doesn't involve anything as mundane as a Google search. That wouldn't be magical.<br/><br/>This movie was like being strapped in a chair and having a box of sugar forcibly poured down my throat. I did think Highmore did a good job, particularly since the movie required him to cry a lot on cue, which not many adult actors can do convincingly. This is the kind of movie that is tailor-made for the holiday season, when people are looking for a little uplift. If you're a Grinch like me, though, do stay far, far away."

You wont want to get out of your seat because you will always want to see what happens next. It goes back and forth between times in the beginning which lets you know how everything happened, while it still keeps you entertained and not bored.<br/><br/>I recommend you go and see this film."

The music in motion was incredible but sometimes hard to follow but the editing was so good- who cares. You see into each character more and more through the movie and keep hoping for the best.

"aharmas","10","1","3","29 November 2007"," You Will Love This One!
","There is a bright future for the main star of this movie, a young man with enormous potential as an actor, because of his ability to embody warmth and pure love. His face conveys innocence, deep feelings, connects with whoever the audience might be in rare and intense ways.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore is a very special child, one human being with the ability to hear the beauty and the music that connects us all of us. He just hears sounds, and the symphony created by the beings and objects that surround him. There is so much bliss on his face that we can't help but liking him. His life is far from perfect because his talents attract harassment from those who can't understand his world. In addition to that, he is a ward of the state and misses the parents he has never met.<br/><br/>One day, he decides to find them, and we join him in his odyssey, a wondrous journey where he meets other children in the care of the Wizard, a mysterious man who might even be another link to August's own conception. As we follow, the boy on his quest, we are treated to the back story of his parents, and their own ordeals. Both are at first unaware this special young man exists, and though we can see the ending a mile away, it is still exciting to see what obstacles lie along the way to happiness.<br/><br/>The film is tremendously enjoyable because of the terrific music that is part of the film's score, and with the spark in the eyes of the three main performers, we truly understand and believe that some people are just able to capture the joy in the musical arts, and it is the beauty of this film that somehow we are able to partake of that very amazing feeling.<br/><br/>You will be moved to tears more than once, and that climatic scene tops almost anything done in the last few years. It is a film that hints at the criminal demise of films like these, films that embrace what is positive in humanity and in this world, films that are able to portray a variety of emotions, ranging from sweet innocence, to the very special act of love between two young people, without getting graphic, vulgar, or too creative.<br/><br/>Go see it!"
"craymond","8","1","3","29 November 2007"," Music to my ears...and eyes
","Okay, I'll grant that August Rush is derivative--the plot resembles Oliver Twist (the Dickens characters Fagin and the Artful Dodger are easy to pick out), and its tear-jerking finish is entirely predictable. Perhaps because it wasn't marketed as fantasy, some critics went in expecting to see a drama about an orphan genius in search of his parents. What they got was a long chain of fairy tale coincidences that makes Enchanted seem logical. No, it's not perfect. Keri Russel--the wonderful star of 'Waitress'--is beautiful as the boy's mother, but a little too compliant to her domineering father. Freddie Highmore is almost too cute (but still you have to love him). Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a good singer, but not great. But who cares? The whole point of August Rush is to celebrate imagination and communicate to the audience a passionate love of music. I can only pity those who don't love this movie. Sadly, they just can't hear the music."

"simonparker1990","8","1","3","28 November 2007"," Rush to go and see it!
","I don't know how many people saw the trailer of Augustu Rush before seeing the actual movie, I unfortunately was one of the people who did so. The trailer I saw before Elizabeth: The Golden Age looked absolute garbage, in actual fact it made the movie out to be dull, with a plodding storyline, cheesy lines such as ""I can hear the music"" kept being thrown out, and all in all the movie looked more nauseating than entertaining. I had no intentions of seeing it and actually smirked when my friend suggested we see it. However, as I am writing a review for it you can no doubt guess I saw the movie. You will also have already noticed the extremely high rating I have given it. I only saw August Rush today because I had a choice of seeing this or Shrooms, and I will be damned if I see a horror film about mushrooms! Anyway I walked into August Rush practically groaning, I left smiling from ear to ear and feeling happier about life in general. It is surprising just how good a film August Rush is, sure its a bit slushy on occasion and its not realistic, but if you don't' feel moved by this movie then you are made of stone! The movie is full of incredible performances, the storyline is pitch perfect and never dull, and the direction perfectly done. In fact I believe the critics have been way too cruel with this movie as this is an extremely well done movie. The score of the movie definitely hit me most, I shall definitely be purchasing the soundtrack when I get the opportunity, and the music scenes especially directed well.<br/><br/>As I've said the performances in this movie are extremely good. Freddie Highmore, of Finding Neverland and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, is the main character. Highmore has always surprised me as a child actor, he is one of the very few that actually rivals and outshines the adult actors he is on screen with. He stole Finding Neverland with a blink of an eye, and he almost steals the movie here. He delivers such a brilliant performance and even makes the clunkier dialogue sound so natural. I am unsure whether he actually played the instruments in this film or not, but he still acted perfectly in the scenes involving music. Also you can't help but root for him throughout the movie, he's such a likable person and is such a likable character, you know his quest is ridiculous but you really hope he succeeds. Playing Highmore's long lost parents are Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell. Rhys-Meyers is one of my favourite up and coming actors at the moment, and he proves his strong acting ability in this movie. He also proves he's a damn good singer as well, something that shocked me. Keri Russell however is by far superior, her scenes where she hunts for her son are heart wrenching and you really care for her. She also has incredible chemistry with Meyers making their relationship believable in their brief screen time together. So who is the real star of the movie? Oh it has to be Robin Williams, who runs over the hills with the movie! Williams plays a Fagin-esquire character, who while funny at times also comes across as a nasty bit of work at others. Anyway Williams is in his element here and delivers one of his best recent performances. Terrence Howard also delivers an excellent performance, however his character is so pointless that you wonder why such a big name is associated with that character.<br/><br/>The trailer of the movie promised sappy, sentimental gunk, so is this really what the movie is like? Actually no, at least for the majority of it anyway. The movie of course is sentimental, but its never intolerable, its the touching kind of sentimentality, the kind where at the end of it all you have to remind yourself to remain strong and not cry at the happiness of it all. The movie also maintains a nice sense of humour throughout, its never the centrepiece, but Williams definitely has some more comedic moments. The movie is very well written, the clunkers I mentioned about only come about in the early scenes, and the ending so heart wrenching that you can't help but smile as you leave the cinema. The movies score is also pitch perfect, a mixture of rock and classical music, and they blend surprisingly well. Also whoever thought of blending the scenes where Meyers and Russel play together is a genius, the song that it makes is amazingly brilliant! The final big music sequence also is brilliant as well! The movie isn't perfect, the clunkier dialogue is irritating earlier and Robin William's character change is so sudden that it feel very forced. However these are mere quibbles as this movie actually comes out being one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>August Rush is a very good movie and I suggest you ignore those horrific trailers and just go and see it! Its one of the most touching movie of the year and is a good movie to make you feel happier as it comes closer to Christmas!"
"Badger1492","4","1","3","26 November 2007"," Very, very fairytale-ish
","Like a classic fairytale there are so many improbable circumstances and coincidences that it really isn't anything like a believable story. If you suspend this non-reality for a few hours and just sit back and enjoy your emotional buttons being pushed and the music, then you'll have an enjoyable time. Oh, and Keri Russell is a babe! <br/><br/>OK, the rules say I have to write more so here it is. One commenter said it was amazing that the actors learned to play some of their songs themselves. Well, I don't know if Keri Russell played the cello before she started working on this movie, but I would imagine it would be difficult to learn how to play that well from scratch in a short amount of time. The boy was very obviously NOT playing the guitar. What he was doing was not even close to what was being played. Most of the solo guitar parts he did were played by a guitarist named Kaki King. I recognized her style right away. <br/><br/>Badger(returning to his cave underground)"

","At first I just wanted to see this film because Robin Williams was in it. But Freddie Highmore, who I first saw in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was very good. I also saw him in Finding Neverland he was great in that also. In August Rush he didn't really have as much negative emotion as he did in Finding Neverland. Keri Russell was surprisingly good as her character , Lyla Novacek. I've only seen her in one movie Mission Impossible 3 and she really did have a big enough part in that movie for me to judge her on her acting. But now that I really saw what she could do, she at least deserves a Golden Globe. Same with Freddie, Golden Globe. Mybe even an Oscar. He's so young but it's like his roles come naturally to him. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who I've seen in several movies and a little bit in the Showtime series The Tutors. He did another great job. Better than all of the films I've seen him in. Robin Williams was awesome, (he's not the character you would think him to be). As an acting veteran he was mainly the big guy on campus in this film. Go see this movie, It's a tear jerker. 9/10."

","Picture Oliver Twist, an orphan in a big city, who runs away from his parentless life to fall in with ""Wizard"" Wallace (Fagin) and Arthur (The Artful Dodger). But, instead of the typical musical that comes from such a setting, we get Mozart thrown in and are treated to some of the best music imaginable! August, like Mozart, hears his music before he commits it to paper and this improvisational spirit comes out in this movie. The writers of this screenplay must be familiar with Dickens to so faithfully modernize such a wonderful book without doing the poor job that many others have created in other attempts.<br/><br/>The positive spirit of August (Evan) propels the movie forward at every turn. Not subject to the ""realities"" others are mired with, August pushes on to obtain that which he most wants, to find his parents through his music. Even Mr. Brownlow has a type of himself in this movie with the social worker, Richard Jeffries, who helps both August's mother, Lyla, as well as August.<br/><br/>The facade that is Fagin is also seen in Wizard Wallace's character, with money being the underlying motive for both men. Even Arthur betrays August when jealousy sullies their friendship as August begins to ride the upswing his talent generates.<br/><br/>Yet, unbridled hope exudes from August and even the darkest turn comes out well for him in the end, with even the self-centered motivations of Wizard Wallace not hindering August from attaining his destiny.<br/><br/>The cast carry off their parts very well, and there is no lag in the story even as time is manipulated to complete the character's background and let the audience in on motivations, desires, and disappointments. The end result is a splendid movie with an excellent musical score accompanying."

I would go to this movie several more times if we didn't live out in the sticks and it is a long drive to see it. It is a great movie and I would encourage everyone to see it. The little boy is such a good actor. He was so expressive and seemed really into the music. Jonathon Rhys Meyer was especially touching as the Irish rocker who is searching for happiness.

","Nailing a fable/fantasy for being unrealistic is like fishing with a stick of dynamite. Sooooo easy but why bother when one need only read IMDb reviews BEFORE buying a ticket. August Rush is above all else an urban fairy tale where the audience is expected to believe that dreams do come true. The film was neither made to please professional musicians nor match the literal progress of Mozart's youthful genius. The term 'suspend one's belief' system is meant to apply to a fable/fantasy such as August. It allows viewers to enter an alternate universe where all can believe in miracles. A magical, musical universe where our usual rules do not apply. A place where music literally fills the air at all times in all ways. The film is refreshingly original in that regard. The film also tosses us excellent performances by all three leading actors and a very well paced three track story meshing rock and classical music with the magic of a quest ridden prodigy. Robin Williams 'mean streets' Wizard fits perfectly into this parallel system of good and evil.<br/><br/>Bottom line: August Rush was three hanky ENTERTAINING on multiple levels. It does well to appreciate that such well crafted, heart warming, escapist entertainment is a major part of what good movie making is all about.<br/><br/>Reviewer Angie Errigo (Rotten Tomatoes) said it best noting that August Rush is ""Unapologetically preposterous, but it is a (very sweet) fairy tale..."" Well said Angie!"

Keri Russell, Johnathan Rhys Meyers, Robin Williams and Terrance Howard provide an ensemble cast in the most moving experience I've had at the movies in a very long time.<br/><br/>In a box office year of threequels, CGI and pure garbage, August Rush is an amazing fresh breath of air."

","The message of this movie is simple and direct. It is okay to have irresponsible sex with a complete stranger that you have just met. Everything will turn out okay. The kid will overcome all the emotional trauma of being raised in a succession of foster homes, and will turn out to be a musical genius. Everyone will live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, reality is very different. The unfortunate reality is that this sort of irresponsible behavior usually only occurs under the influence of alcohol, among people who have no sense of moral, social obligation at all. The unfortunate reality is that the couple wouldn't be separated by either parent, and that the father of the kid would skip town the instant that he learns that he is about to be a father. The mother would raise the child alone, almost certainly having to struggle with poverty, and, more often than not, alcohol addiction. Whether the child does or doesn't end up in foster care, the child's prospects in life will suffer a serious handicap. The realistic outcome is a life where there is little in the way of education but a lot in the way of crime, alcoholism and addiction.<br/><br/>This particular fairy tale is so unrealistic and so annoying that I just couldn't stomach it. I watched it on Lifetime Movie Network, and it is very much the caliber of movie that routinely is shown on LMN. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie whatsoever. Nada. Zilch.

","There are three kinds of film that I value and treat differently: those who truly leverage dance, space or sound. I have not yet found one that exploits mathematical space, and would add that when it appears, probably from Ruiz and Greenaway who come close.<br/><br/>Of those three, we have some interesting and a few lifealtering dance movies. We have some successful experiments with space. But its music that seems the most challenging, and I think the reason is obvious: if you want a great film it has to be cinematic  you have to get the world visually first. Everything else is annotation.<br/><br/>But what is cinematic sound? Does the fact that we are trained to not acknowledge a film score work against us? Is it possible to host such a bold experiment in a sappy, mainstream wrapper, with holy cow Robin Williams?<br/><br/>It seems so. Yes, I will advise that you have to actively ignore the pull, the drive of this thing and all the plot, characters and acting associated with it, and simply revel in the notion that the urges in this film are all sonic. Yes, I found some of the visual expressions of inner music silly, just as I do with mathematical urge. But they tried; they built an entire project uncompromisingly around the idea of music as an urge....<br/><br/>And not just an urge, but one integrated into the wheels of fate and justice that control the noir dynamics of modern film. Yes, we know the family will be reunited. Yes, we know all urges will find the path to the happy ending. But this is such a unique effect that it makes all the deficiencies worthwhile.

It goes downhill from here.<br/><br/>The scene in which New York becomes basically one big Stomp performance went on too long. (I got it, already!). The mid-section is an over-stylized ripoff of Oliver Twist and Robin Williams should be ashamed (if he has any sense of shame left after all the stinkers he's been in!) for taking money for this project.<br/><br/>The musical genius of the boy is a slap in the face to any human being who ever tried to learn music or an instrument. (I can ALMOST go along with the guitar playing -- although slapping a guitar with open tunings and harmonics doesn't really count as guitar playing.) The hoary old cliché of the misplaced vital document shows up here, but one of the most egregious (I almost said the most, but there are so many candidates for that title in this film) devices in the entire film revolves around the likelihood that A: someone could actually get to the front of the stage in Central Park from the back in the same night, B: that 'mom' and 'dad' would recognize each other simply because they are within 20 people of each other, and C: that the kid would just instinctively KNOW that his parents happened to show up right then and there without even looking behind him.<br/><br/>Sorry.

"guadalugarro","8","0","1","4 October 2019"," August Rush is a 2007 drama film directed by Kirsten Sheridan and written by Paul Castro, Nick Castle, and James V. Hart, and produced by Richard Barton Lewis.
","It involves an 11-year-old prodigy orphan, Evan (Freddie Highmore), who breaks out of the orphanage to New York City, looking for his birth parents. Throughout the film, Evan falls into the clutches of a homeless man who asks others to call him the Wizard (Robin Williams) and who wants to profit from Evan's talent by naming him ""August Rush"". Little did he know that his mother, Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell), is looking for him too. At the same time, his father Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is looking for her to meet once again.
In my opinion, August Rush is a great movie because not only is it about the magic of love, but also about the power of music, that is, art that is part of our everyday. On one hand, August Rush catches us from the very beginning with the start of a love story, love at first sight between a young guitarist and a young cellist who have the chance meeting above New York's Washington Square, but who are separated by circumstances and thus leaving their child orphaned. On the other hand, August Rush manages to represent the power of music that, during the whole movie, plays a very important role in helping the musicians meeting again.
That's why I love this movie and I recommend it, especially to all music lovers that exist in the world from whom I expect to feel the same that I felt. There is hope of reencounter that someone we loved very much again and this is thanks to the power of music. ""The music is all around us, all you have to do is listen."""

Not a single character was memorable enough for me to even remember their name about a week after I watched this.

","This movie is really awesome. I think it sends a good moral message about the beauty of life and the gift that children are. I really liked this film even though some parts of it I don't agree with (premarital sex for example), but what is interesting is that even though Lyla got pregnant, she decided to keep her child. Many people today would have told her to have an abortion or something but she kept it even though she did not have a father to raise her child with. This movie wonderfully shows the value and worth of the human person and that every child should have a chance to live. Later when Evan is grown up we as the audience are presented with a lovable character who is so gifted and talented with music, that we can't help but fall in love with his character. It is kind of sad however that such a talented and lovable kid is being raised in an orphanage when he deserves two parents who are committed in marriage.But this is seriously one of my favorite movies, it's a feel good movie but at the same time it presents an accurate and realistic depiction of what happens in our society today, people don't want to have kids, people don't respect other human beings, etc, etc. This movie puts a personal character in our faces and helps us to see humanity and life for what it really is and how valuable and awesome it is to be human, and what a gift our lives are."

Yet, I've heard from people who love music that they were touched by this film. Arggghhh! Using a cello in the music (young mother) when the young father was playing his sensitive rock tunes was clever and brought them together, but was she shocked when the father of the child she believes she just found is standing right next to her at that exact moment after 12 years?

Eleven years later, Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is absolutely certain that he will find his parents and he'll bring the star crossed lovers back together.<br/><br/>So far so good, the movie moves along. It's a modern fairy tale that needs desperately some visual magic. Freddie Highmore is good child actor. However he needs to do more with his baby face. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is good as a man who's lost hope and the music. Keri Russell is an amazing actress who's capable of inner sadness and powerful outer pain.<br/><br/>And then Evan runs away from group home to NY. He hooks up with a creepy monger Wizard (Robin Williams) who uses Evan and the other kids to make money. It's like Pinocchio when he's forced to join the circus. It's an uncomfortable storyline.

","This ain't no perfect movie, but it has some original elements.

And besides, the similarities with ""Oliver Twist"" are only in certain and very specific details.<br/><br/>Even thought the scenario is decent, it's just another typical movie set in New York city. There ain't no lack of American cinema and I am developing an increasing interest in foreign cinema. Am I getting tired of American cinema? Perhaps...<br/><br/>The movie tells the tale of Evan Taylor / August Rush, a child with a passion and gift for music. He can conduct an orchestra not unlike Tom Cat in ""Tom and Jerry in the Hollywood Bowl"". He can conduct an orchestra just as well as he can play guitar and organ. Besides, there's poetry in his words, his music and his soul. The character is very well portrayed by Freddie Highmore.<br/><br/>The soundtrack divides me. Whatever August Rush plays (guitar, organ and classical music) is lovely and Lyla Novacek plays violin beautifully but anything that Louis Connelly plays is sonorous pollution.<br/><br/>Keri Russell plays music better than she acts. Robin Williams plays a dubious character, not unlike Fagin from the Oliver Twist tale. Not the most peculiar role I've ever seen him playing, but positively one of his most peculiar.

Even if the viewer must suspend their disbelief (which I find acceptable), the concept of the music bringing the boy and his parents together was never properly structured or resolved. I wish there had been some little gem of recognition that would have brought the three characters together in a plausible way. The kid conducting a symphony orchestra after a couple of months of music school training was NOT plausible. I gave it four stars because the child actors were really good and sang wonderfully.

","Now don't look at my like I'm someone who doesn't enjoy a heart-warming fairy tale! I thought AUGUST RUSH had the potential to be really good. The story was interesting, the movie looked decent, and the soundtrack was good. But wow! So much potential was lost in translation. <br/><br/>The story follows the Dickensean adventures of a young boy named Evan (Freddie Highmore). He's an orphan, but like most orphans in movies he knows that his parents are still alive. He's also born with an exceptional, yet to everyone else (of course) unusual, talent in music. Feeling lonesome and neglected, Evan goes searching for his parents in New York, where their fates meet many years ago. Turns out his parents are alive, but are also separated from each other and doesn't even know he's alive. Along the way, Evan stumbles upon a streetwise monger named Wizard (Robin Williams) who takes him in but sees his exceptional talents as profitable (he also changes his name to August Rush at this point). He also stumbles upon a church where the people there are also at awe with his talents. The film builds up about as fast as that summary I just wrote. Too fast! And that's the problem. How can we invest our emotions on an admittedly decent story if we can't even spend enough time to. One moment Dylan/August is an ambitious little performer, then he's suddenly a little celebrity in the hands of Wizard. One moment he just stumbles into a church, then faster than you can say ""this phrase is so totally cliché"" he's studying in Juilliard! Slow down movie! Granted there are a lot of plot points this movie has to go through (another problem), but moving at an all too rapid pace doesn't help. It never does! Then the story of Dylan/August also intercuts with the story of his parents, Lyla (Keri Russell) and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), from that fateful night they met to a couple of years later until they realize that they actually have a son. And it does so pretty... badly. In fact, it actually becomes rather confusing in a while. <br/><br/>So with so much happening in the movie but very little time to care about them, AUGUST RUSH feels like a Hallmark TV movie rather than a really good fairy tale which it could have been. I'm all for a movie that doesn't try to be realistic and just goes for an artistic sensibility, but it's hard to care about it here. Granted, the performances are good, the camera work is decent, the soundtrack rather good actually, and like I said, I kinda liked the story. If the movie actually spent much of its time developing the story rather than getting them over with and move on to the next, it might have been great. This is one of those movies where I actually don't mind if it ran for an hour or so more, as long as the story is engaging and well-developed. There's just so much potential in it that I started picturing a different movie in my head while watching it. OK, I'm not boasting that I can do a better job, but if the movie can make me think I could then it's loosing my attention. <br/><br/>So AUGUST RUSH is not a bad movie, but it's a very maudlin, disappointing one. So much potential lost in execution."

One of them is a boy named Evan Taylor(played by Freddie Highmore), an Orphan who has a fantastic musical talent. Evan is an orphan. All his life he's been searching for his long lost parents. <br/><br/>His parents(played by the lovable Keri Russell and Johnathon Rhyes-Meyers)don't even know he exists.

Evan soon comes up with a stage name and becomes a prodigy.<br/><br/>I liked the mood of the movie. The way it shows Evan listening to the sounds and how music is everywhere. It was unique. But, there was a flaw. How would Evan escape from the orphanage like he did? It's kind of impossible. How would both parents know to go to New York city? It's also kind of cheesy. But you know what, it's not like many films out there. It's a shame it didn't make much money. Because I thought it was a good film.<br/><br/>August Rush:***/****"
"liljd11","8","0","2","7 October 2009"," Story of a orphaned prodigy set out to find his parents.
","August Rush encompasses the story of a charismatic young bass player and a sheltered classical cellist, both of which are musically gifted. After a concert played in New York, the two share a night atop New York's Washington Square. Soon after the two are torn apart, leaving Keri Russell, the cellist, pregnant and without Jonathan Rhys Meyers, the bassist. Lyla undergoes emergency operation after having an accident and the child's grandfather chooses to place the baby for adoption while Lyla is unconscious. Evan Taylor was orphaned by circumstance. Born with an incredible gift, Evan seeks out his parents at the age eleven in New York. He then performs on street corners, with the money hungry ""Wizard"" as his guide. Evan then uses his talent to seek out his parents through writing his own rhapsody, after doing so he is granted the opportunity to conduct it in Central Park. Both Lyla and Louis then follow the music to their son.<br/><br/>August Rush uses a reoccurring theme song throughout the movie, which at the end is revealed to be August's Rhapsody. Director, Kirsten Sheridan also uses a particular scene Evan first picks up a guitar and immediately shows his musical gift by finger tapping a song. The lighting is very bright and shows sunlight as if it is coming through a roof.<br/><br/>One particular thing I did not like about the film is that the story seemed to move extremely fast, almost giving the sense of fast forwarding throughout the film. At times the viewer may wonder how in the world the story got that point or who the characters are. August Rush all in all is an extremely inspiring movie for musicians. Personally, I went straight to my rehearsal space and found myself very engrossed in the music. So if you are looking for an upbeat happy ending movie, August Rush is the way to go."

","I think if people are simply out to see a movie that makes them say ""Aww..."" and have some harmless escapism from the drudgery of life, this will probably do the trick. However, it should be said that if you expect even a modicum of realism, you should seriously look elsewhere. I laughed out loud a number of times at the sheer absurdity of it all, and I don't think that was what the director had in mind with this sappy feel-good bit of make-believe.<br/><br/>There are the situational improbabilities (Hey! I've got a ticket for that flight to San Francisco, but surely the airline won't mind if I ""follow my heart"" and jump on the New York flight instead!); there's the intrusion of Robin Williams (himself a veteran of quite a few cloying films) who apparently raided Bono's wardrobe closet; there's the sheer improbability (impossibility?) of a child with no musical experience doing some complex hammering and picking on a guitar the first time he ever touches one (and let's not even touch on the ""writing a thousand pages of sheet music the first day he touches a piano"" bit, or his writing of a symphony)... in the end, the whole film is summed up by the scene where the boy has a chance encounter / jam session with his then-unidentified-father on the streets of New York. When they went to leave each other, I was half-expecting the guy to tell the boy ""I'm in a band. We're called Pop and the Fatherdaddies, why don't you come and check us out... son?"" <br/><br/>If you're undemanding you may appreciate this, and for those sick of the violence and misanthropy in films out there, this may be a safe haven.

","August Rush was a great movie. The acting was above par, the direction was inspiring and the music... well, the music was amazing, especially the guitar parts... I'm a guitarist so I appreciated this. Although a little too ""chick flick"" in parts, it's also part modern day fairy tale and part drama. Not wanting to spoil this movie for anyone; it's a little slow to get going but worth the effort in the end, and it's a great family movies to boot. <br/><br/>The only thing I found a little off was the fact that the story was directly taken from the Charles Dickens ""Oliver Twist"" and yet nothing was attributed to Mr. Dickens. And for those of you who would argue the fact, there's even a character names Arthur (Artful Dodger), a Fagin type character played creepily but wonderfully by Robin Williams, a workhouse environment at the beginning... in short this movie was a modern reworking of ""Twist.""

Supposedly because I don't think he put much effort in it at all. Although it is very simple, I have a lot of problems with the plot. It is way unbelievable and plays a lot on coincidences. It is just too forced that it is already laughable. The script is very weak and you can literally guess the next lines after hearing just a few. This movie is all about music and appreciating the harmony around you, nothing more. But don't get me wrong. The music is good. It's just not the type that you'll remember say in a month or two.

Now performing on the streets of New York and cared for by a mysterious stranger, August uses his remarkable musical talent to seek the parents from whom he was separated at birth.<br/><br/>The trailer for the film is one of the most inspirational trailers I've ever seen.

There were some great things and some very stupid things. The ending also felt rushed.

"TxMike","Null","0","1","17 March 2008"," Superb modern fairy tale, one of the better movies I have seen in a while.
","A couple of young musicians meet quite accidentally in New York, hit it off immediately, and have a one-night affair. He knew her name, but the next morning her dad whisked her off to the next concert. She was a cellist. Her lover never knew she became pregnant, and at birth her dad simply said ""I'm sorry, he is gone."" She thought he died, but he was simply ""gone"" so that she could continue her classical music career unimpeded.<br/><br/>Switch to 12 years later and we see Brit Freddie Highmore as Evan Taylor in a home for orphaned boys in rural New York. Evan is not your usual kid, he seems to be drawn to the sounds outside, the source of all ""music."" He firmly believes some day his mother and dad will find him and ""music"" will be the way it happens. <br/><br/>Keri Russell is cellist Lyla Novacek, who has turned to teaching. She lives in Chicago. Irish Jonathan Rhys Meyers is rocker and singer Louis Connelly, living in San Francisco and working, but no longer singing.<br/><br/>On his deathbed, Lyla's dad confesses what actually happened and told her she has a son somewhere, so the rest of the movie has her looking for him. One person who helps is Terrence Howard as social worker Richard Jeffries, able to help track down her son from records and provide a photo of him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Evan has discovered New York, and befriends a young street musician. He finds shelter in an old abandoned theater, along with dozens of other children. They are all working for their ""music pimp"" Robin Williams as Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace. He has sort of a protector role, but expects each one to go to different parts of NY to entertain and bring back ""family money."" Meanwhile young Evan discovers he has an innate ability to understand music, and to play such instruments as the guitar and the old pipe organ in the church. Wizard has him change his name, and as they see a rolling advertisement pass by ""August Rush for the Beach"" young Evan is given the stage name ""August Rush"", thus the movie's title.<br/><br/>Then young Evan/August is further recognized for his ability, and is taken in at Julliard. Much like Mozart did, young Evan hears complete compositions in his head then writes them down. He writes ""August Rhapsody"" and it is chosen to be performed by the Philharmonic in concert in Central Park. All the while being searched for as a missing person.<br/><br/>Logic tells us that all of this is pretty much improbable, better yet pretty much impossible. But taken as a modern day fable, it works very well. Young Highmore is just perfect in his role. Russell and Meyers are equally effective as the young musicians who later search for each other and for their son.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: At the concert, Lyla plays as guest cellist, then is walking away as she hears the playing of 'August Rhapsody', and is somehow drawn to the sounds. She goes back and recognizes that it is her son. Meanwhile Louis is in a car and sees the banner for Lyla and gets out of the car to follow the music. The movie ends with Lyla and Louis holding hands while watching their son conduct the orchestra, smiling because he knew he had found his family."

","What we are really doing here is adding ""comments"", as the box is titled. We're not qualified critics. We all love to think of ourselves as arm-chair critics and consider the critique we leave as Gospel. Well it ain't.<br/><br/>When I sit down to a movie, it's not with a note book. We watch movies and read books, and listen to music to entertain ourselves. We pick the genre or style of what we experience on the premise that we like those forms, and there's a good chance of a couple of hours escape from the norm, from our own set of reality and our problems. That's a whole lot of weight to put on any form of entertainment. And all the wrong criteria for a bonified critic to work from. When we hate or love a movie we're expressing an emotion, not a critique. We're really 'commenting' on the fact that considering our mood, whatever distractions there were while watching, how far and how much help did this piece we're watching offer us in escaping our own set of problems, for a while, which let's face it exist in a world gone mad.<br/><br/>So I watched this on my computer. My pets were fed and settled down for the night. They were either cuddled in, or asleep in their favorite places. No-one rang. (Hey - I heard someone say 'No wonder!)I watched this movie, and let it take me away. I was looking for a story, and I found one. And since all fiction is based on the premise of how far you're willing to let yourself suspend reality in order to enjoy it, my mood, or emotional criteria, I brought to watching this film was just right for there and then.<br/><br/>So I'll comment that I loved it. The story, the people, the music, the ending, the whole fairy tale. It gave me something I needed and filled the void I'd slotted it into with a light-hearted tale of music magic and happy endings.<br/><br/>Next time maybe I'll be criticizing this or that. But I'll try to remember what reading all these comments has reminded me of this time. That a lot of it is responding to things I disagree with that other commender's have written. This time, I'll leave it.<br/><br/>Thanks to all involved in this picture. I truly enjoyed it and you all did a wonderful job."

I do wish the ending had been a little longer in order to do a bit more development of the story's end.

"pitchperfect","9","0","2","15 March 2008"," A Beautiful Movie, Overcomes its Underlying Flaws
","First of all I want to make it clear that I absolutely loved this movie. The story is very beautiful and moving. But the key to enjoying this movie is to realize that it is a fairy tale and not a typical drama or thriller. Anyone familiar with musical theater or opera are used to suspending their normal skepticism to unlikely or even impossible plot situations and instead enjoying the heightened emotional reality that is portrayed. This movie is not about clever plot twists or dialogue. It is about the power of music and of love. Those ideas are more important than even the characters in this movie. For those of you who can not stomach the idea of that, then this movie is not for you. But for those of you who enjoyed ""Across the Universe,"" ""Big Fish,"" ""Moulin Rouge,"" hey, even ""Il Postino"" then you will probably have the artistic maturity to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Being a professional musician and music teacher gave me in an interesting perspective on this film. On the one hand, I can fully appreciate what the character Evan is implying with his line ""The music is all around you, all you have to do is listen."" Music is simply sound, repeating vibrations in the air that are caused by all things that move. Our music was at some point in the beginning derived from the sounds of nature, and I could tell that the composer tried to make the soundtrack sound initially more ""natural"" by using a lot of open octaves and fifths, the kind of harmony that is by far most prevalent in nature. I was also deeply touched by the idea that the music ""of one's soul"" could attract another person. The ancient Greeks believed in ""the music of the planets"" and the music of one's soul, in addition to our ""audible"" music. The philosophers Plato, Boethius, Aristotle and others came up with the ""doctrine of ethos"" which lies at the heart of this movie: that the harmonies of nature and the mind are inter-related with and affect the harmonies we create and enjoy in music. The fact that music alone can elicit emotions in us proves that at least some of this ancient philosophy is true.<br/><br/>On the other hand, listening in closer to the soundtrack leaves me a little disappointed. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is just barely good enough of a singer to get by as a professional musician--even for a rock singer--and his versions of ""Moondance"" and ""Something Inside"" start to sound like open mic at a karaoke night. And I was sad to listen later to ""August's Rhapsody"" and find it is full of cinematic music cliché's and uninspired harmonic movement. But I did not notice any of these things when I watched the movie (which is amazing for me) because of the effectiveness of the gestalt of the movie. With a little effort to curb a desire to nit-pick, I enjoyed this movie so much that I would say it is one of the best I have ever seen."

This movie may have logical flaws, but it is really about the magic of music being able to bring a family together. First of all, the little boy did an amazing job of acting out an unwanted orphan that needed a friend. The parents both did a great job of acting out two regular people who still deep inside had a great love of music that connects them to their son. This movie deals with sadness, love, faith, and above all magic. If you still have that little kid inside of you that believes, this movie will touch you like it did with me.

A hopeless and happy romantic and a sap for movies like this? You Bet! The music was great and while you may have to suspend belief a bit here and there, it's OK. Miracle on 34th Street doesn't hold any less importance to me knowing Santa does not exist as I have matured, but the spirit of the idea does in my heart.

"nuhc","6","0","1","14 March 2008"," Interesting film
","This is an interesting film because it doesn't seem to follow the normal movie pattern. It is best if you take it as one long artsy music video or rock opera such as the Who's ""Tommy,"" since literalists will hate it. You have to suspend A LOT of disbelief to make this work. The plot wasn't really special, but you could see how it intertwined among the three main characters. The ending is no real surprise and is highly predictable as this is obviously supposed to be a feel-good movie.<br/><br/>Now I said you have to suspend belief a lot, and it shows: A kid who never touched a guitar before starts pounding on it & makes music. Later he sees musical notes for the first time, and instantly starts writing a symphony. Now I know he's supposed to be a musical genius, but c'mon. Not to mention that he was put up for adoption without his mother's knowledge in the first place, and rather than being adopted right away (there's a long waiting list for adoptive parents), he's carted off to an orphanage where he spends the first 11 years of his life. Juliard music school in New York takes in a homeless child and teaches him music because some preacher tells them he's a musical genius. This is why this movie would work as a rock opera, but not as a serious movie. Luckily the music in just about every scene helps. <br/><br/>Robin Williams' character as a sleazy exploiter of young children is creepy, and he does the best he can with the character he's given. If this movie were not a sunny emotional gush-fest, some hints of pedophilia would probably have put an edge on his character which would have illustrated why the main character really needed to get away from him. I think the movie could have been a little darker like that and still could have gotten away with the story. It couldn't have been worse than seeing so many scenes of an Irish musician brooding about losing the girl he had a one-night stand with & fell in love with 11 years earlier. As it was, the Wizard's main fault was wanting to exploit the child's musical ability for his own financial gain. <br/><br/>In spite of the plot holes, anemic plot, and predictable ending, I actually did enjoy the movie. It's not something I care to see again, but it was worthy of passing a couple hours. It didn't hurt that they cast some eye candy in the form of Keri Russell. If she weren't in this movie I'd probably had hated it."

","I loved this movie: it has great music, special effects, great characters Oh and to those who complain that the plot line is not realistic etc: this movie is a FANTASY, and to me 'fantasy' is NOT realistic, fantasy is a fairytale; if the plot line would be always realistic i.e. always obeying rules of life etc, then it would be 'reality' instead of 'fantasy'. Fantasy is someone's imaginative/creative attempt to deal with certain emotions etc caused by painful realities of life (e.g. described in 'Raise it up') through parable, art, music etc. Just because fantasies are not always realistic in the way their storyline progresses to me that does not mean they are not beautiful, captivating, moving etc. Yes I saw that some plot moments seemed unrealistic etc, but it did not take away from my enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>I just want to say I love 'August Rush'. To me the positive aspects of the movie (the music, the acting, the idea behind the plot of music symbolizing love and bringing people together, the visual symbolism: of the moon and of musical instruments, like wind chimes etc) i.e. the good things in the movie outweigh the negative aspects (some unbelievable plot turns, but hey it's a fairytale, so I'm not complaining). I also loved how in the soundtrack there is an interesting fusion of various styles of music: classical and modern music, the soul music etc. I have recently watched my DVD of this film with my mother and she loved it too<br/><br/>Do not watch this movie if you hate musical fantasies, only watch it if you love them."

","I definitely would have picked August Rush to be the year's best. In fact, it ranks up there with one of my all time favorites and one of the best movies ever made. I must include this disclaimer, however. This is a FAMILY film. If you cannot sit through a movie that isn't filled with violence, car crashes, sex, crude humor and swearing then you probably won't like this film.<br/><br/>If you like to pick films apart pointing out all of the mistakes and weaknesses, I'm sure that you could do that with August Rush. I just don't know why you would want to, however. It's a lovely story about love and patience and perseverance and has a feel-good ending. It's one of those movies where you know how it will end almost from the beginning but it doesn't matter and it doesn't spoil it for you (I'm talking about the basic plot of Evan's quest). The journey getting there provides the tension.<br/><br/>Outstanding performances by all, especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Freddie Highmore and, of course, Robin Williams gives his usual solid performance. I'll be looking in the future for movies directed by Kirsten Sheridan."

Just felt amazing and still listening the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Fairytale, but it wasn't only that. This movie has such a positive message, something that makes you believe that everything would be alright no matter what.<br/><br/>Beaing really skeptical when I saw that Meyers is playing one of the main characters (I didn't quite like the way he played in the Allen's Match Point) and then Keri Russell (she only reminds me of Felicity) I was really surprised than I can truly say that I liked it, I liked the way they were able to built a bond between Lyla and Louis, even though they have waited so long to be together.

","This is probably one of the best musical film I have seen next to the Sound of Music. I loved it. I don't care what others think. This movie is definitely up to my satisfaction. It gave a new perspective towards music. The music really out the feelings from inside of. The plot is very simple. It's about a kid trying to find his parents through music.<br/><br/>There are some plot holes, but the music pushed them aside. It was magical, beautiful, powerful and an emotional movie. You could feel the tears in your eyes. Robin Williams was awesome, though others performed well too.<br/><br/>If you like musicals, I definitely recommend this. A movie worth watching.

"radurazvanstanciu","8","0","1","1 February 2008"," Respectable for its ambition
","This film deserves more respect than it seems to get. Yes, it looks a lot like soap opera for the big screen. But soap opera is closely related with the most beautiful of stories, it just lacks a certain touch. Yes, the holes in the plot are huge. But you can simply jump across any hole in any plot if there's something on the other side of that hole. This is what you do in this film: the music, the extraordinary cast, Freddie Highmore's invincible charm ( I honestly think he's the most engaging child-actor ever ), they all get you through. That certain touch - it's got it. Mind you, it's not easy. If it had been longer ( it's only 105 minutes ) it would have become impossible to watch. For people who like the kind of films that are usually nominated to the Oscars ( politics, criminality, all kinds of very important, contemporary issues ) it might even be unbearable anyway. But if you're of the 'romantic' kind you won't regret seeing this film. It lets you expect great things, it builds up something nothing short of majestic and no, it doesn't succeed, no question about it. But at least it helps your imagination fly and gives you a strong suggestion of what could have been. And that's not bad at all."

","I'm a big music lover. I have music in my head all the time. So when this movie came out I couldn't wait to see it. And though it wasn't all I thought it would be I still enjoyed it. I thought that it was an interesting movie. It ran a little long and sometimes I thought it could have done without this or that. I'm also a huge fan of Robin Williams. And he did of making his character likable at first and then not like him at all. Just goes to show how great an actor Robin is. I thought all the acting was good. The story was a little undeveloped but other than that a very good film. I think that people of any age would like the movie. It is differently a movie of those who love music.

","This is another one of those movies where you either get it or you don't. It is not an epic. It is a fable. And what a fable it is! This is a story about the rhythms of life, about the crossings and re-crossings our paths have with one another, and how the ordinary hustle and bustle of everyday life can have its own orchestral quality and sound. Finally, it is a story about faith. If you believe and love something strongly enough it will become the reality. Here, that ""karma"" (for the lack of a better word) was out in spades.<br/><br/>August Rush (Evan Taylor in the first part of the movie) is the abandoned child of a chance meeting and momentary love affair between two accomplished musicians. He is convinced that his parents are out there looking for him and will eventually find him. He hears their music in the grass, the rain and the high-tension wires. Consequently, he is the subject of ridicule by the other children at the orphanage.<br/><br/>Finally he runs away knowing he must, and will, find his parents. In an obvious nod to Oliver Twist, he has various adventures of a musical nature, wherein the Fagin and Artful Dodger characters are also musicians, that eventually lead him to Julliard School of Music--it turns out he is, after all, a musical prodigy--and a major concert in New York's Central Park. <br/><br/>In a subtle hint at the interconnectedness of it all, we learn later that the Fagin character (played by Robin Williams) was the harmonica playing musician in New York's Washington Square playing Van Morrison's ""Moondance"" on the night that August's parents met. Meanwhile, his musician parents, whose lives have become dull and meaningless (and without music) since they were rudely separated by her father, ""pick up the vibes"" of their son's quest and slowly return to their musical roots. And here, in another obvious nod to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, all three are mysteriously drawn to that concert in Central Park.<br/><br/>Something must also be said about the soundtrack to this movie. It is very innovative and impressive. Jonathan Rhys Meyers has a surprisingly good voice. Leon Thomas and Jamia Simone Nash turn in amazing performances. The final concert piece played at Central Park is near overwhelming. This is one of the few times where I would actually recommend purchasing the CD.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have complained that the characters lack depth or that the plot is scattered. But that is often the way with fables. We are never told, for example, the name of the mouse who takes the thorn out of the lion's paw, or the name of the fox who can never reach those allegedly sour grapes. We are to learn the lesson within the fable.<br/><br/>And here the lesson is both simple and profound. As August says at the beginning and the end of the movie, ""The music is all around you, all you have to do is listen."" Some may think the idea too schmaltzy or New Agey. But for me it is simply a way of telling us that God really does exist and that he really does love us all."

","Amazing! Personally, I am not a very huge fan of fairy tales, but this film changed my perception of fantasy films a great deal. Music as a form of communication is a predominant theme throughout the film and is one that I particularly enjoyed. For the first time ever, it was sensed by the audience that they wanted the police to catch the good guy! The parallel editing between all three character's lives was well done and gave the audience the opportunity to see into the emotional stresses of each character. Brilliant! The love story aspect throughout was another theme that I quite enjoyed, however the ""chick flick"" element of it was disregarded."

","I was expecting quite a bit out of this movie. I'm not sure why, exactly, but after watching the previews, the story itself really seemed intriguing. <br/><br/>There's a good movie inside August Rush, it just didn't seem to make it's way out. They crammed a lot of content into a small amount of time, and the bulk of that content is so far- fetched, that without any sort of preface or explanation, is very hard to believe. Towards the end, people begin showing up in all these places that would seem to be otherwise off-limits to average citizens. <br/><br/>I understand the concept of a movie. That without said events, there is no story, but there's also an obligation to the film maker to supply the audience with enough filler, that the story isn't questioned, or misconstrued.<br/><br/>Again, there were particular scenes and points in the movie that I really enjoyed, but overall, I left the theater feeling as if I'd been slapped with another sappy ending. I'm personally not fond of any ending i feel like i could have written myself, that's kind of insulting. <br/><br/>the soundtrack is definitely worth your time though, except for some of the Jonathan Myers songs..."

""August Rush"" is a definitely a fantasy, a mood piece, as insubstantial as tissue paper and definitely one to avoid if you are of a cynical bent.<br/><br/>As enjoyable as it is, I am not at all sure if ""August Rush"" will find an audience (although it did run for two weeks at that bastion of the blockbuster, the Cineworld multiplex on Broad Street in Birmingham), being too sentimental and dippy for an adult audience and too self consciously poetic and slow for a young audience.<br/><br/>Who cares?

","I wasn't holding out much hope for this movie because i knew it would bring out my sensitive side and i don't like that. Although that ended up being the best part about it. The movie is the story of a supposedly orphaned boy that has the almost uncanny ability to find music in everything. Through the course of the film he encounters several different influences on his music until ultimately he finds himself in a position of respectable musical prowess. The only thing negative is the ending, it just kind of....stopped. However, if you want to see a movie that will leave you wanting to see it again...go see August Rush. Very entertaining whether you like music or not."
"john-4455","10","0","1","7 December 2007"," Best Ever Sleeper
","The way movies become sleepers that have mass advertising is the ad campaign portrays the film as something much less than it actually is. Such is the case with this pic. The film has several powerful themes, well said, but they are packed into such compelling stories, one can hardly keep up with every powerhouse aspect of the entertainment. Its stories move fast and whole, the acting is impeccable, the music carries anyone away who feels music, and the direction is stunning - a clear sign when there is limited dialog and the story is largely told by actor expressions and actions. Even the art direction is rich. I was concerned about Robin Williams getting hacked into another stereotyped role, but this is far from his usual fare - an intriguing character rock solid performed. This is a film I will screen several times for enjoyment and inspiration."

The script could have done a bit better but then hey, it's a fantasy - so one has to remember that it's for entertainment.

","This movie provides a simple reminder to the moviegoers, ""beauty and music can be found everywhere - pay attention to the little details."" Score for the movie fantastically interwoven into the plot. While a couple of parts of the movie are predictable, they are not not blatantly so. One must remember that this is a movie - not 'a true story,' so please do not judge as such.<br/><br/>The music is a combination of every genre, from classical to rock, with everything else in between. The combination is well constructed. Even if you are not a professional musician, you will appreciate this fact.<br/><br/>Robin Williams does a fantastic job in this role. As usual, he shows his flexibility of parts. Freddie Highmore - two thumbs up. A versatile actor, with a long future ahead if he so chooses. Kerri Russell and Jonthan Rhys Myers did a good job as well. I had not realized that each actor played the instruments. That is not an easy task and should be highly commended. And we must not forget the bit part by Jamia Simone Nash - a girl who I believe was simply being herself in the movie, and who did a great job! Overall, I'd recommend this movie for anyone who wants to watch something out of the ordinary and well written. With a bit of a mystical twist. If you're one of those looking for a film based solely on reality, I don't recommend it, but for those willing to think outside the box, I believe you will enjoy."
"vila784","8","0","1","1 December 2007"," Sweet movie made to display
","Let me preface by indicating that I gave the movie a good rating because I DID enjoy it. As all the other comments say, its a fantastical movie, that can come across as too sappy, but overall is very endearing. For me though, while I loved the story, the music, and the characters, the lack of some finishing details diminished the movie's perfect charm.<br/><br/>While some seem to disagree, Robin Williams performance was sub-par. The best elements of the character are strictly from the script, and not his acting. While most of the actors made a lot from a little, he made a little from a lot. It was a very shallow portrayal of a fantastic character. I think he could have really been brilliant, and instead he was merely passable.<br/><br/>Other than Robin Williams the acting quite good. Which probably makes his performance seem worse than maybe it is. Still, the script really didn't go into much character development AT ALL, and yet, you still connected with the characters because of the fantastic performances. Unfortunately, the ending had no script, and I think that even the best acting couldn't really portray all that needed to be done...<br/><br/>I was especially impressed with Terrance Howard, who played the social worker. He really wasn't given much of a character, and yet he made it work. The character connected with the audience and was very well acted. (Though how he knew August, who he realized is Evan, was performing at the concert isn't explained, maybe he'd seen the posters too? Thats a 2 second clip that could've been added.) I also wish there was more development for the boy, Arthur. It was definitely compelling to see him struggle between jealousy and friendship, but it wasn't really played out well. Just suddenly he has a final change of heart, saves August, then shows up at the concert to listen. The actor did a good job with the few scenes and fewer lines. There just could've been a bit more.<br/><br/>Oh, does Louis even realize that August is his son? If so, that's an awful lot for him to piece together. If not, that's a rather disappointing ending. If he did piece it together, there was certainly no ""OH MY GOD, THAT'S MY SON!"" moment. While I can take it for granted that neither Lyla or August seemed surprised at the appearance of each other, Louis had no way of expecting it. And like I said, at least for him there really should have been a ""whoah"" moment. Anyway, doesn't he still think that Lyla is married? Its a real simple thing that could've been wrapped up neatly with a short dialogue or even a few gestures and facial expressions. But all the acting at the very end is just doe-eyed wonder and happiness.<br/><br/>But anyway, it really was a very cute movie. I think maybe 5-10 minutes more of character development and a pinch of wrap up at the ending would have really sealed the movie and made it that much better. I totally recommend seeing it, even if the ""sweet"" factor is over the top and yet not completely satisfying. Expect the warm fuzzies when you leave the theater and a sudden desire to play guitar. <br/><br/>(Who else suspects percussion guitar to suddenly become incredibly popular???)"

","After months of hype for this movie I was very much looking forward to finally seeing it. When we arrived for the second showing on the first evening at our local theater, and were the ONLY two people there, it was an omen. The story had a lot of potential. But the August Rush movie was just too thin, not fleshed out. This is one of those mystery movies that has a great cast with nowhere to go. What we were left with were a lot of longing looks and cliché'd remarks. The one person who really did come alive was Robin Williams as a Fagin-like, Dickens character. In the past I have not always enjoyed his acting, but he showed his real ability with this role. There was a lot of camera work, setting landscapes. The setting(s) were real city scenes. New York got the lion's share of exposure. At times the flashbacks and forwards made the story disjointed and confused. My description of this movie would be as a quick sketch is to a painting. There are a lot of fill-ins that were left undone. But I believe some new stars to emerge from this. One is the very young girl who played Hope and sang in the choir scene. She's darling and has a huge talent. Another is the young street performer who befriends August. In the end, this show fell far, far, short of the preview's promise."

Both feel burned out and hate their lives, feeling that something wonderful is missing, but what? <br/><br/>From here we are swept into a marvelous story of love, family, and, of course, music.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was amazing. I actually wanted to cry several times, and was on the edge of my seat for about the last 30 minutes, despite the fact that this is not an action flick, like, say, Kerri Russell's previous movie, MI3. However, I did feel that there were parts in the beginning that were a bit slow, and some scenes were shot so that I felt like I was on acid. Kerri Russell had a few cheesy moments at the beginning as well, which I thought were poorly acted. I must say, though, that all of these things were forgotten as the story progressed. When it ended, I felt like running or crying, or picking up a guitar and strumming away. I truly felt inspired which reminded me why I liked movies so much, after all."

So firstly, the performances, Rhys Meyers is excellent, he showed real star quality, he holds the screen very well through out, and the song he sings is actually very good, and he could release it and it would do well. Robin Williams plays his Fagan-esquire role very well too. But the star, obviously is Freddy Highmore, he is fantastic in his role, and he is my fourth actor I think should be nominated for an Oscar, along with Russel Crowe- 3:10 to Yuma, Denzel Washington- American Gangster, Viggo Mortensen(likely winner)- Eastern Promises and now Freddy Highmore- August Rush.
