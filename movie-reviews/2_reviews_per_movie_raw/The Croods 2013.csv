","I was talked into seeing this, and I have to shout it out, because it is a RIOT! I don't write many reviews, but when I love a film, I have to. If I have any complaint on this one, it's the title. I expected gross-out humor (""crude""). There isn't any, really. It's actually extremely unpredictable, subtle and extremely smart humor.<br/><br/>It has a story arc that you begin to somewhat anticipate, but you don't feel you're being patronized. Instead, you're left feeling that very intelligent people put this thing together in hopes that everyone would find something to love about it.<br/><br/>The cast is great, the animation is fun, and it's non-dizzying 3-D.<br/><br/>When I saw it, the entire audience clapped at the end, because we were entertained throughout, and found the ending really satisfying.<br/><br/>What else? Sweet emotions crop up because we can all relate to the family dynamics. Every family has the screw-up, the salt of the earth, the rebel, and the stubborn one. And it has one of the funniest babies ever put on film. A baby unlike any baby you'll ever see anywhere.<br/><br/>Very, very funny. Definitely recommend."

","In my life as a parent of a 10 and 12 year old, I have been to see a lot of animated kids movies, some of them quite painful to sit through. This one ranks at the top. The action, the humor, the characters, the plot, all rolled up in to a big ball of fun. I was belly laughing with my kids the whole way through it. And the message is lovely to boot. Excellent casting...the chemistry between the characters stood out in a way I never thought a cartoon could, no doubt due to the talent of the actors and standout animation (not something that I'm usually all that dazzled by.) It was the interaction, along with thoughtful humor of what is important in life, that really put this over the top for me. The complete implausibility of the plot didn't even mildly annoy me, the way stories of this genre sometimes do. <br/><br/>I could actually stand to watch this a second time. Well done Hollywood, please put this level of thought in to more children's movies."
"freemantle_uk","7","60","74","21 March 2013"," Slapstick Heavy Family Fun
","From DreamWorks studios comes its latest animated adventure, the prehistoric family comedy The Croods. It is a slapstick-heavy family movie that should delight young children and keep parents entertained.<br/><br/>The Croods are the last remaining family in an arid desert landscape. They have survived by following family patriarch Grug's (Nicolas Cage) rules to the letter, including staying in the cave after dark and fearing anything that seems new (new is BAAAD). Despite this, teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants to break free and rebels against her father, which results in a chance meeting with the highly inventive Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the end of the world is nigh. When the Croods' cave is destroyed, the family is forced on a journey into a strange new world where Grug's rules clash with Guy's techniques for survival.<br/><br/>The Croods is a formulaic movie that sticks to a traditional hero's journey and relies on typical archetypes, but it's elevated by the writing and direction of Kirk DeMicco and How to Train Your Dragon's Chris Sanders. Like Sanders' previous work, The Croods focuses on a family's dynamic and relationships. This time, the focus is on a protective father who wants to protect his family physically and protect his daughter from a member of the opposite sex who suddenly challenges his position as the alpha male. While the trailers and first half of the movie made is seem Eep was the main character, it's actually Grug who goes through the greatest change and learns the biggest lessons.<br/><br/>The story is one about learning, exploring, and using one's intelligence. It also touches on the idea that it's unhealthy to live a sheltered life. But at times, the movie lays it on a bit too much with Guy and his ""solutions"" leaving Grug on the losing end.<br/><br/>Most of the humour used in The Croods is very physical and slapstick oriented. Characters have Loony Toons levels of invincibility as they endure intense physical pain. This type of humour obviously appeals to fairly young children, but I would be lying if I said I did not laugh at the film at all. The Croods avoids using crude toilet humour to generate cheap laughs. There is not much in the way of verbal humour, but there are some running gags, and modernisms are kept to a minimum. They are still there but they are more putting modern products in a Stone Age setting, a little like The Flintstones, so they serve more as pop-cultural winks to adults.<br/><br/>As expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.<br/><br/>Like other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.<br/><br/>The Croods is not going to match the heights of DreamsWorks major hits of Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. But it certainly does not belong with the dregs the studio has to offer. It does what it sets out to do: make a movie that will please children while attempting to give a positive message and some heart. It has an old-fashioned sense of humour that leads to a surprisingly enjoyable animated movie.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"
"marshaandjon","10","109","141","17 March 2013"," Excellent movie for the whole family to enjoy!
","I saw this movie at a sneak preview this afternoon. This was a very enjoyable movie for our whole family. Me and my husband sat there and laughed frequently, being completely enthralled with the story and graphics. Meanwhile, my daughter and my 7 year-old grandson sat with us, and they also were laughing throughout most of the movie. It has something for people of all ages to enjoy. It was heartwarming, and at times, it totally pulls on your heartstrings, too. The characters were appealing, and the type you find yourself rooting for as time goes by, and the animals that interact with the humans frequently stole the show! I know that some critics will have issues with some of the fantastic creatures that are seen, and they may take issue with the extraordinary things that The Croods are able to do physically. I knew going into this movie that this movie was a work of fiction, though, and therefore I was able to suspend my expectations of reality, and go on the ride that Dreamworks wanted to take me on. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and took this movie for what it was - a lighthearted comedy about a family going through changes, and how they deal with those changes. I would definitely recommend this as a great movie to see!!"
"azureblueflame","9","60","77","22 March 2013"," Behold... A Prehistoric Age Where Humans Still Live... Apparently For Now!
","The Croods, a name most bizarre to be given as a title of a movie, but the content, just fantastic! I may even add to say that Dreamworks has lived up to its expectations in delivering exceptionally amazing animated movies and their latest release, The Croods is no exception. The story begins by introducing us to a rather diverse family of a couple, their three children and an old grandmother(who just wouldn't die) and setting is a prehistoric age where they are supposedly the only living humans. The movie then goes on to bring an extra character just named ""Guy"" and his sidekick Belt(an animal) who goes on to proclaim that the end of the world is near and their only hope for survival was to aim for the mountains far ahead. A simple plot it seems no doubt, but the way the movie was crafted was just fantastic and if that wasn't enough, you might actually find yourself laughing a couple of times no matter what age you might be of. There might be many movies out there to be watched but ""The Croods"" is a film which is guaranteed to be enjoyed. It might not be the best film out there, but it certainly is a great one which has its own comedic and adventurous moments, a movie for the whole family out there and to all those who prefer watching it in 3-D, the effects are seriously good in this film and your choice would be a valid one. All in all, no matter what age you may be, ""The Croods"" might just bring back a smile or a few memories of those old childhood fantasies where anything was possible."
"ishouldsay","10","75","100","22 March 2013"," Beautiful on so many levels
","Take a child to see this beautifully made, thoughtful, animated feature. I went by myself, but the theater was full of children, and their laughter at the myriad slapstick humor added so much to the experience. Which is better;staying safe or taking risks? This is the premise of ""The Croods"" as the Crood family and Guy, a newcomer, experience tectonic plate shifts and other violent geologic events together. Interspersed with these big changes, though, are Eden-like ecosystems where the colors are vibrant and inviting. Emma Stone, Nicholas Cage, and Ryan Reynolds are perfectly cast. I will be buying this movie when it comes to DVD."
"bbizzle","10","52","68","23 March 2013"," Saw it, loved it, nuff said.
","I was of course hoping that Dreamworks would have a hit here after the unfortunate demise of Rise of the Guardians (I actually enjoyed the first ROTG book but couldn't get through the second book) which killed that franchise. I saw The Croods on opening day at a matinée and I loved it. I laughed, I cried (yes, just a bit) and I had so much fun that I didn't want it to end (Dun Dun Daaaaa). I've been reading the early message boards and prior mixed buzz so I was a little worried here and it's unfortunate that folks are so quick to try and tear something down based on a trailer or someone else's opinion. Go see it for yourself and have fun! I give this 10 big stars and can't wait to add it to my collection. My only regret is that I went to the first showing rather than wait for the 3D screening. I'm a little jealous by some of the great 3D comments. Even in 2D, the animators create a wonderful world, make us feel good and really get us excited to get out and have an adventure."

","I took my 3 yr old Grandson and he sat on the edge of his seat the whole movie. We tried catching fire and flowers and once got hit in the face by a bird. The 3d seems to be on a new level of excellence. I'm a teacher and I totally now understand what scientists mean from cavemen to hunterers/gatherers and I think it will help children see it too and introduce them to tar pits, saber tooth tigers, earthquakes, and a lot of science stuff. The story was great, the characters were realistic to a family, and although sometimes the dad didn't get any respect, in the end it was apparent his love for his family and theirs for him. I highly recommend this to adults and children."
"somlaign1","9","62","84","24 March 2013"," Loved it!!!
","I have never written a review on a movie before no matter how good or bad. But this movie really deserves high praise! I had brought the kids to see a few other animated movies before this like Wreck-it Ralph and Rise of the Guardian, but they turned out to be somewhat boring and unengaged. So I went into this not expecting much, it was more for the kids. To my surprise, I LOVED IT! It's different, funny, smart, and adventurous. I found myself giggling through most of the movies and at other times astounded by the visual effects. I also see my kids and other kids sitting at the edge of their seats at times. It is great for all ages. The picture was stunning and saturated with imagination. Dreamworks has outdone themselves with this one. I highly recommend taking your family to see this!"

"billygoat1071","7","41","60","25 March 2013"," Zany Ideas
","The Croods seems like it's gonna be just another Dreamworks Animated film that has crazy little characters messing around with their antics on a preposterous world. Well, these kinds of films are remarkably fun and has impressive technical achievements but there's nothing else to merit in the end. The Crood is almost one of those simple crazy films if not because of the philosophy that was displayed on the premise. Basically, it's about a zany version of the prehistoric times and a survival on the continental drift. The conflict of this plot is the titular family's choices if they would choose to follow their overprotective father or a stranger who makes daring ideas to survive from the natural condition. Disappointingly, the conclusion goes to the easy way. It doesn't go beyond the comfort zone, but the visuals transcend. The animation is getting better and better. It's totally fun but there are things that could have been more complex.<br/><br/>Everything is ought to be silly and hilarious. The beginning gives a set of ridiculous sequences to easily get to know about these characters. When it finally proceeds to the actual plot, it tells something sophisticated. It's an opposition between safety and getting away from your comfort zone. It ends up being obvious when it is suppose to be complex. But that is what the film wants, be simple and delightful all the way. The film doesn't necessarily need to be deep or emotional, but there is something clever to its concept that could have been smarter.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film is the characters. The performances simply brought them to life. Emma Stone perfectly gives her role a fitting personality. It sounds perfect for Nicolas Cage to play a caveman. He yells at a monkey in one scene which is a usual pleasure from him, but there is more to the Grug character than just yelling. While Cage is having fun, he brings a strong emotional depth to the rest of his scenes. The characters of Clark Duke and Cloris Leachman provide most of the laughs and they effectively show off its joy.<br/><br/>The visual effects are even more spectacular than the rest of the studio's films. Just like their recent films, it's snappy and energetic. The film's world looks amazingly eye candy and imaginative. The prehistoric characters and animals are wonderfully designed. The animal designs are meant to be ironic, like some of them got their food chain reversed eventually or their hybrid will some day become their fear. It's a slick joke. And for the 3D, you know it's great as long as it's from Dreamworks Animation.<br/><br/>It leaves a great amount of heart and fun, but its enlightenment theme results as being underwhelming and somewhat contrived. It would have made this more than just a typical Dreamworks film, but it doesn't matter because the movie is definitely suppose to be delightful for the entire family. It still takes some clever points. It's also great to see a load of spectacular animation. It is indeed truly enjoyable and full of life. The Croods is far from classic but this is kind of film that would enjoy anytime."

","'The Croods' is an enticing tale about an emotionally bonded family living in the cave of a mountain. Grug,the head of the family is a loving but overprotective father with one fierce motto-Survival and that anything new is dangerous.At night he narrates stories to his children that teach them not to indulge in their curiosities.His daughter Eep however is a naturally inquisitive being who likes to discover things for herself,a trait that her father doesn't appreciate.Their cave gets destroyed and soon after they meet Guy,a young laid back fellow who is a somewhat opposite of Grug .Guy is fun and adventurous and has an uncanny ability to pop ideas out of nowhere and do miraculous things like light a fire.The movie is all about how the family along with or in many ways led by Guy embark on a journey to find a better home,a better tomorrow.<br/><br/>There are many likable things about 'The Croods'.For one the plot is atypical and fresh.There are no villains here,just characters playing their roles.You can feel a separate connection with each of these characters.Even though for most he is against the idea,you know all Grug is trying to do is keep his family safe.Nor can u fault Eep for her natural curiosity or Guy for his inventive fun approach-There are no bad guys here.The pace of the movie is fine.The animation and effects aptly done and commendable.Nothing over the top or in your face.The voice actors are an all star cast comprising of Nicolas Cage(Grug),Emma Stone(Eep),Ryan Reynods(Guy) and others.They do a good job.The characters are unique,intriguing and lovable at the same time.What else? The animals.You will love them.The movie is also packed with genuine humor that makes you laugh a lot.The animation captures the emotions of the characters well.The background score is cool too.<br/><br/>In all 'The Croods' is a happy feel good movie with plenty of boisterous moments.An enjoyable watch.Go for it!"

","this movie is a good example of how an animated movie could do what Live action couldn't.<br/><br/>lately i think animated movie are trying so hard to look real, visually its okay to be real, but stories and effects should reach far more and that is why they made it animated instead right?<br/><br/>try comparing Brave and Wreck it Ralph, one story is simple and realistic while the later is completely a fantasy.<br/><br/>and The Croods follow the fantasy, the real story is about a family and how it survive through changes in their world.<br/><br/>i read some other people's review here in IMDb and it shocked me, there's one woman who said the movie is unreal because it shows a baby that could run like a wolf! well lady if you go into an animated movie about cavemen who could speak English and expect logic, maybe you haven't heard about a company named Disney that made duck and mouse talk like human.<br/><br/>its not that all animated are unreal, but thats the essence of animated, it could reach beyond live action, where else director can put in all their fantasy and made magical movie.<br/><br/>if you watch this with family, i bet all your little ones will enjoy it through out the film."

","""Personally I'm not a fan of the Ice Age movies and Dreamworks trying their version of prehistoric times with the Crood family that are both funny as well as creating some sweet family moments between all the characters"" <br/><br/>Prehistoric history has never really been told well for me (I do not care for the Ice Age movies no matter how many of them there are). The Croods is about the cavemen family of the same name which include Grug (Nicholas Cage), Eep (Emma Stone), Ugga (Catherine Keener), Gran (Cloris Leachman) and Thunk (Clark Duke). The family meet Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a modern man who try's to help them get through life as they make their way to safety. The family and Guy must change and adapt throughout.<br/><br/>The best part of the film was the animation of areas the family visited from the beginning desert seeming area to the bright and colourful new world that seemed like an animated version of Pandora from the flying animals to the big ones with teeth but most of the animals in this film where more cute and adorable versions. The family dynamic was nice because most of the characters were different from Eep the dreamer to the old funny grandmother which made for a relateable family even if they were in times before modern humans. The film never felt too long but some weaknesses to the film where repetitiveness of scenes even though some great one liners went well. The character relationship between Eep and Grug was very developed but characters such as Ugga and Thunk felt undeveloped and somehow wasted.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage has become an non present actor for me and it was fun to hear him play Grug because he was playing the character of himself but not to the big extent which was enjoyable to watch. Emma Stone played the disobeying daughter Eep and she was also enjoyable in the film and I did like how the two actors handled the father/daughter relationship making it a part of the film to care about. Ryan Reynolds is also an actor I do not care for but like Cage in the film he was also nice making some good funny moments which mostly seemed to come from the animation. Other actors who where funny in the film include Leachman and Duke.<br/><br/>An enjoyable film that was funny as well as memorable for it's sweet relationship moments. With good voice-over work and a nice script the film was more then a film for young children.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: B- (MVP: Emma Stone)"

","I usually don't write reviews here, but this movie brought me back a feeling that I didn't think I would have it again. It was a great experience that made me decide to write a review about this movie.<br/><br/>Like any other child I used to watch animation. It comes to this part of your life when either you ignore animation and watch it only because you're with a child, or you keep watching it and ignore what some other people say that it's ""cartoons"". I used to laugh, smile, dream and even cry watching animation. I got busy in the last couple of years with school and work that I didn't watch animation for a couple of years. The couple of times I watched animation after that, it was not comparable of course to the moments I had when I was a child. You would think these feelings and moments are gone forever.<br/><br/>I came across ""The Croods"" trailer online and just by watching the trailer I had the thought that this might be a good movie. I went with a friend to watch it and that was a big surprise, beyond my imagination.<br/><br/>I laughed almost half of the movie. I had these great moments that I thought I'll not get it ever again. I just melted inside that movie. I should not call it a movie anymore, its a great experience. The effort of designing each character is right there clear in every frame. The dialogue is awesome, so natural and funny. The main concept is great and made me think about a lot of ideas I had and still having in my mind on a daily basis. I just had a wonderful experience that I thought for some reason I will never get again. This is my first time to write a review at least about an animation, but this movie brought back a lot of moments I had and that is what moved to write this. To all the team and people behind this masterpiece, thank you."
"FairlyAnonymous","8","6","8","1 February 2014"," It's hard to describe... really, I don't know if I liked it or not.
","The Croods... there is a lot to say about this movie. The movie is unlike any animated movie I have seen, which is weird because one wouldn't suspect that BECAUSE it is like so many other animated movies but ISN'T! The Croods steps into a weird territory where it does a lot of things familiar but then does all of the familiar things in a nearly unrecognizable manner. This is why I consider this movie a good movie because it is one of the ONLY animated movies that really confuses me... and I'm not easily confused.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with explaining that The Croods are the last of what was once a neighborhood of cavemen. Sadly, all died, so now the Croods stick by the rules and live in fear. What makes this movie ingenious is that it doesn't know who the main character is. Eep seems like the main character, but Grug gets a lot of screen-time as well. Also, the movie was very smart. Grug could've been the bad guy. He could've had no redeeming features. HOWEVER, it is established early on that the only reason any of them are alive is because of his strength and endurance to keep everyone alive. Grug isn't smart, but he will risk his life and do anything to keep his family safe. Heck, he even doesn't eat food for over a week just so that his family can eat. That is a loving father. This is one of the reasons I like this film. A lot of movies have trouble making a good father character, but this one gets it... at times.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailers, you know that a newcomer comes along named Guy who is an inventor. The nice thing this movie did is that showed right off the bat how physically epic the Croods are in strength and just how weak Guy is compared to them. Eep lifts Guy up with her wrist and nearly kills him within the first couple seconds of meeting him. Speaking of strength, this movie has its momentum done right. Whenever the Croods are moving, they move with A LOT of speed and are incredibly strong (punting rocks hundreds of feet away).<br/><br/>I'm getting distracted. The real thing I find interesting about this movie is that it is one of the only animated movies I have seen that has blended incredible realism with Looney-Tunes slapstick. The movie is gorgeous. It really is. The water made me pause for a second and realize that it wasn't real water... but I thought it was for a moment. Most movies either use CGI for the beautiful shading but still have cartoony visuals (Madagascar, Tangled, Frozen) or either they use incredible realism (Beowolf, Rise of the Guardians, Brave) but this movie combines both. The humor and the movement is directly taken from several Pink Panther skits and Merry Melodies, but the animation rarely stretches of squashes. They still move like they are real. It confuses me because naturally that sounds like a horrible idea... but... this movie pulls it off. I can't say that I have ever seen a movie that has done animation this way.<br/><br/>The story itself if pretty good as well, but is fairly kid-oriented. There are some laughs for adults, but some jokes seem a little too... kiddish at times. Which is another weird thing: this is an animated movie that isn't trying to be dark and serious! Really, this movie is perfectly content with being light-hearted, funny, and really laid-back. It has its dark moments and its sad moments, but overall it is upbeat and happy. It is refreshing to see this kind of movie get released.<br/><br/>Also, the soundtrack is really good along with the character interaction. None of the characters are obnoxious and they all interact with each other in a very realistic manner. I think half of this movie's humor comes from the ""subtle"" jokes or the little gags that fly by in a second. There is a lot going on in this movie, but it may be hard to pick up on the first time.<br/><br/>All in all, The Croods DOES have some hiccups and you will notice them when watching it. However, when I look back on it I realize that this is a special movie. It is unique in almost every way and ISN'T really unique at all. I wouldn't mind being stuck in the world that was created... for just a couple minutes more. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the creatures were cool. Not basing it off of real animals is clever."

","The Croods opens with voice-over narration that introduces the Crood family. The animated sequence is minimalist and emulates cave drawings (a theme running through the film) while it also felt like an homage to Dusan Vukotic, The Zagreb School and other 'reduction' animators of the 1950s and 60s. The story has a monomyth structure that integrates family roles in at the critical spots (future husband as herald, villain as co-paternal figure, etc.). The first scenes have a specular quality and with a minimalist mise-en-scene it might have been regarded that these directorial choices were purely exploitative to the 3-D gimmick. Good fun action establishes the quirks of a 'pre-nuclear' family experiencing 'cave-in fever'. Father Crood (voiced by Cage) has all the qualities and clichés of a responsible father. In fact, the characters and the story are quite cliché - but it isn't exploitative. Freshness is retained through moments of self-reflexivity (the popcorn pile, Guignol shows) and clever situational puns. The minimalist elements of the staging and mise-en-scene are banished like darkness in light once the family are forced to venture out into the more majestic parts of a fantasy world. It is a fantasy world - with dozens of original creatures and hybrids that make one think of Disney's Alice in Wonderland. Some of these creatures provide strong character 'support' such as 'Belt' and 'Duggie'. Even 'villains' are appropriated as pets in this dangerous and threatening but awe-inspiring and enlightening world. The threats are ominous but not frightening. The Croods are cute animated characters and the animation itself is of top quality and exemplar of technical sheen (the luscious fur was the most enticing and tantalizingly tactile lure in the 3-D quality of the film). The cave-family is physically atavistic in appearance, but jovial and comically gentle in demeanor. The diastema creates warm smiles and helps forge loving moments. The ending is a happy one and there is no Bambi trauma moment in the entire film. One of the advantages of digital rendering is the open possibilities that lie outside the more rigid film medium (the 180 flip dive into the water is mesmerizing). There are great moral lessons about growth and acceptance that are convivial and not preachy. My favorite part of the film is a sequence where Father Crood makes his first effort at personal growth by adorning himself in 'modern' innovations like the 'Pre-Funk' George Clinton coif. His ideas backfire into a laugh-out-loud homage to Looney Tunes mayhem. One other homage stood out in the genial portrayal of a quest for paradise - that is Wil Vinton's Adventures of Mark Twain and the Adam and Eve story that Vinton retells within that film. You can't tell me there aren't Biblical allusions either - with the Noah's Ark moments at the end, paradise lost theme and Adam-Eve procreation imperative underlying a more overt father-daughter relationship of trust, growth and acceptance. The relationship of minimalism and magnitude play well for a sophisticated viewer while the genial takes on humanism and family entertain universally."

","A prehistoric adventure full of beautiful animated landscapes and constant laugh that makes it perfect for the whole family.<br/><br/>The publicity of this movie makes you think that the main character is Eep (Emma Stone), but actually her father Grug (Nicolas Cage), is also a main character. The plot of the story go around this two, everything one of them do affects the other to the point that at a time Grug is more a protagonist than Eep. The fact that this is so makes a different approach on certain themes, like that the message is more for adult parents than for the young audience, which is odd on animated movies.<br/><br/>Of course, the story is not complicated and either deep, but Dreamworks is not known for making that kind of movies. It doesn't have anything special either, except for the final approach to adults than to kids. But it is fun, full of physic and verbal jokes, which keep the audience laughing all the time. Regularly I wouldn't say that physical jokes (like punching), are well used and effective, but in this case we are talking about cavemen, brutal force is suppose to be the principal characteristic. So in this movie all the ""punch to laugh"" is justified and proper to the setting.<br/><br/>The dynamic between the members of the family is very close to a reality. None of us need to go out hunting to survive, but we often fight with our relative. Imagine that you are in a trip with your whole family. Well, all the talking, arguing and everything that drive you crazy about the guy next to you is in this movie. So there are plenty of elements that make this family of the Stone Age similar to modern families. Like the fact that you can fight all you want with your mom, dad, brother or grandma, but in the end you will protect them and give everything for them.<br/><br/>The world where this movie takes place is beautiful and unique. All the things that you encounter aren't real, the animals, the plants, everything has been invented by the creators with references of real creatures. That puts you in the same spot that the Croods. As they will discover new creatures and explore new worlds, the audience will know the world too. So the audience can't muck of the fact that the Croods don't know what kind of animals live on the earth, because they don't know either what are the species living on that world.<br/><br/>This is a good movie to go and enjoy with the whole family. Kids will love the graphics, the colors, some of them the 3D, and the jokes. Adults will laugh too with the jokes and will have a nice time with the ones they love."
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","5","24 May 2013"," Move on over Flintstones, there is a new caveman cartoon family in town call the Croods. A modern stone-age family!!
","After their cave is destroyed, a Neanderthal caveman family call the Croods must trek through an unfamiliar fantastical world with the help of an inventive Cro-Magnon guy surprising name Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and his pet Sloth name Belt. I do like the idea of having people think the end of the world is coming in the beginning of time. Its makes me laugh, when I think about how silly dogma thinking is. The Croods are made out of Eep (Emma Stone) a girl looking out for adventure with a touch of Daddy's issues and rebellious. It looks like DreamWorks Animation took the Disney Princess concept to heart in this film. She comes off being bratty or cruel at times. The movie nearly mirrors Ariel from 1989's Little Mermaid and 2012's Brave Merida way too much in how much the character looks and acts upon dealing with fathers figures. Grug (Nicolas Cage) is her overprotective father who surprising is the character, I can sympathize most. He's not a bad guy, he just a man who lives in fear, who wants to protect his family at all cost. What I didn't like the movie is how the other characters were treating him when Guy came around. They act like he rarely did any good for his family. I would deeply hate being over look and can understand being threat by Guy. I think Nicolas Cage did a pretty good job in the role. The rest of the family are made out his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), his daughter Sandy (Randy Thom), and his son Thunk (Clark Duke) and mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman). Ugga doesn't really state out in her role, besides playing the mother figure. Thunk, Sandy and Gran were funny in the roles they were given. Still there were moments of the film, I just wish they would shut up. The movie doesn't take itself so serious, as it's more cartoony than historical accuracy or realism. The cavemen take a good number of falls, and hits that would clearly kill you in real life, but in this film, it's like watching a bit of Captain Caveman mixed with Roadrunner cartoon. I didn't know Neanderthal could lift heavy boulders, get crash by it, and still live. The wild creatures are made all cute like, rather than menacing at all. For goodness sakes, the Sabre Tooth tiger look like a stuff toy animal chasing them around. The action scenes were pretty cool to watch, but not once did I think that they were in any strong danger in how cartoony they made the film look. I would say it pretty safe movie for the kids to see. The movie does have good teachings for children, if you do take them like the ability to learn, invent, and adapt. Second is the importance of cooperation and family. I wouldn't say it was a great 3D movie. I watch it in 2D and honestly, couldn't really tell where the things popping out for 3D was. The plot reminds of a bit of The Gogs, Welsh cartoon TV Series that has a family's cave destroy by a volcano forcing them to go find a new home. Aardman Animations and Dreamworks took the idea, and remade it into the Croods. Overall very nice movie, made me laugh quite a few times, very entertaining and sweet all around. So tadtaddaaa everybody."
"TheConnoisseurReviews","8","9","15","24 March 2013"," ""The Croods"" Review
","""The Croods"" has a simple story about old vs. new and family. The family must move when disaster strikes and learn to adapt to new ways of doing things. Resistant at first, they meet a boy named Guy, who helps them rediscover the ever changing world. The film tells us to embrace new things with open arms and enjoy all the wonders life has to offer. Not everything new is evil or makes you any less of a person than your ancestors. Family is a pretty central part of the film as we can see them bonding and doing a lot of things together.<br/><br/>The film is a little light on heart and emotions, but more than makes up for it with its unique sense of humor. The punches keep rolling with slap stick, sight gags and jokes about cavemen and their primitive ways. I was literally laughing from beginning to end. The sheer amount of creativity in the film is commendable and I was constantly thinking where do they come up with some of these ideas.<br/><br/>Chris Sanders and Kirk De Micco do a pretty good job of directing the film. They give a good amount of attention to the family and each individual character. I really like how certain things introduced earlier in the film serve a purpose later on. If any animated movie ever deserved to get nominated at The Oscars for Cinematography, it would be this one. The shots and angles are so unique and filled with so much energy. The sweeping shots of the landscape and the skies are beautiful to the eyes. The hunting scene early in the film is really where most of this is apparent.<br/><br/>The characters are good, especially Grug. He's funny and a really devoted father, but incredibly stubborn. Nicolas Cage brings the right amount of crazy caveman and caring father to his character. Emma Stone as Eep is also a solid character. She's curious and her design is way better than what the trailers make it out to be. I like how she isn't the typical perfect figured woman. She has messed up teeth, she has a full figure, and overall is not bounded by gender roles. The rest of the cast is okay as they don't do much. The mom is kinda bland, Thunk and Gran provide some of the comic relief, and Guy is just the cool kid that has the crazy new ideas that shake up the family.<br/><br/>The animation is quite gorgeous especially the hand-drawn opening sequence. The desert scenes are desolate and feel very isolated. A great juxtapose to it are the lush and vibrant forest locations. The directors do a lot visually with the film and make everything the characters see feel new to us as well. When they see stars for the first time, it really feels like you're really seeing stars for the first time. The character designs are unique and highly creative. Every creature is completely new and never before seen. Score for this film is actually quite good. It feels very prehistoric, but with a modern flare. It gets really exciting and emotional when the film takes a slight dramatic turn.<br/><br/>Overall ""The Croods"" is a pretty good film. It has probably the best cinematography I've ever seen in an animated feature. It's highly creative, and the animation is quite beautiful. The main characters are well rounded and the side characters serve their purpose. The story is a little simple and lacks an emotional punch, well at least until the end, but it is effective. Humor is top notch and will keep you laughing all the way through. I give it 4/5, creative, hilarious, and a fun time for families of all ages."
"ijameson","7","2","2","5 October 2018"," Fun to watch
","No doubt aimed at the younger audience, it's still a good movie for adults.<br/><br/>It has good animation, and good humour."
"Rectangular_businessman","8","4","6","20 July 2013"," Surprisingly enjoyable
","To my surprise, I ended liking this movie much more than I was expecting. I have to say that I'm not exactly the biggest Dreamworks fan (While I liked the two ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies and I enjoyed ""Rise of the Guardians"", I found most of the movies produced by that animation company to be mediocre and forgettable at best.) However, this movie was actually pretty good. It had an excellent animation and imaginative designs and art (While I didn't like very the design of the human characters, I liked a lot eh visual aspect from the animal characters and the sceneries, which were quite beautiful)<br/><br/>What makes ""The Croods"" work so well are the characters, which were likable and interesting: Instead of being just bland archetypes, each one of them had their own virtues and flaws: That makes their interaction in the story to be funny and slightly more complex than in other Dreamworks movies, which rely too much in scatological humor and tired cultural references. Fortunately, ""The Croods"" avoids those kind of content, including instead of that some little black comedy elements which adults viewers would appreciate.<br/><br/>Even if ""The Croods"" isn't the best animated movie ever made, it is certainly much better than most of the animated films which I have seen in this year (""Monsters University"" is the only exception so far) Movies likes this are a good example of how to make a neat films, appropriate for all ages, which can be enjoyed by many different kind of audiences instead of being something exclusively for kids."
"laurasinclair91","2","18","41","5 May 2013"," Not very good.
","I was highly disappointed by this movie. Although the Animation itself was flawless. The storyline lacked punch and edge. Litrally all the good parts of the film was in the trailer. The storyline was completely predictable, with the whole, boy meets girl, line flowing through. Even my partner who isn't even trained in Media found it dull. The trailer makes the film out to be an Epic Rom-com. Although there is a theme of romance running through out the script, it was not as funny as the traliers had made it out to be.<br/><br/>On a positive note, there was some good use of causality and a couple of heart warming scenes between Eep and her Father. Emma Stone and Ryan Renolds played excellent role's and sounded completely natural.<br/><br/>The Animation itself was flawless, I just felt that there were too many trailers, which ruined a lot of scene's and made the film very predictable."
"tavives","2","28","69","25 March 2013"," I'm not that jaded but...
","The Croods is a new Dreamworks animated film that takes its cues from the Flintstones, Ice Age, and The Gogs, and tries to be oh so hip and with-it and falls flat at nearly every attempt.<br/><br/>OK. I get that it's just an animated film and is not trying to really emulate the lives of early humans, but I found the modern societal references (and the sheer volume of them) to be extremely distracting, annoying, and just frankly misplaced. A few modern references, maybe, but the amount in The Croods was overkill and didn't work.<br/><br/>Secondly, I didn't know that cavemen had what seem to be superhuman powers. I'm not talking about running from predators at ridiculous speeds (that happens in all animated films) There is a certain amount of suspension of disbelief that is expected.<br/><br/>No, I'm talking about climbing sheer cliffs and and upside down cliffs, and falling (not just once but many, many times) from tremendous heights without getting hurt or injured or showing any sign of doing so. Yet needing ""shoes"" to walk over a bed of sharp seashell-like thorn.<br/><br/>You expect things like this in a Road-Runner/Coyote type slapstick movie. Here, again, it is out of place and doesn't work.<br/><br/>While the 10 and under set may not be bothered by all this, it made for an extremely unpleasant movie for me."
"Kreme","2","21","51","12 December 2013"," This was a awful movie
","Predictable, unimaginative, boring, and just dumb. It was very difficult to sit through this film, and even the kids hated it. High production values and good 3D animation don't count for anything with a story as dull as this one.<br/><br/>There are a lot of 'jokes' in the movie that feel like they came out of one of those 1970s Hannah-Babara cartoons.<br/><br/>The ""action"" sequences—and there are many of them—are long, loud, and still very dull because they are entirely predictable, even down to the final, predictable and forced 'joke' at the end. One follows upon the other with a very thin sheen of story to connect them."
"xobrittanyrose","1","21","52","8 April 2013"," Dull, horribly boring film.
","I was really disappointed by this film. After viewing the trailer (which looked great) and reading other user reviews, I was really excited about this film. I'd read one review that had called it 'The new Shrek', so I had very high hopes for this film. I'd honestly give it 0/10 if I could, I was bored throughout, barely laughed and felt like leaving halfway through. I went with a 4 and a 9 year old, they fairly enjoyed it but weren't blown away, and by the lack of laughs in the almost full cinema, I'd say that most (if not all) of the parents and kids there were bored and disappointed too. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, there are far better animated movies out there! An incredibly disappointing and forgettable film."

"michaelhirakida","3","14","34","21 July 2013"," Nothing But Stupid, Overblown Slapstick.
","Dreamworks is a company that has had its ups and downs. Their recent movies have been very uneven in story and originality. The Croods is their next film and without a doubt is Dreamworks worst film. It has basically little to no story and... well you will see.<br/><br/>Basically its about a cavemen family who have been living in a cave and never get out unless they need food. Our first joke in the movie is a fast forward gag. I didn't think about it at first but I wish they could had done that the whole way through. Nicholas Cage plays the farther of the cavemen children. Basically they get trapped outside of their cave and have to survive in the wild and on their way we meet a character called Guy played by Ryan Reynolds who is the inventive person. The farther tries to compete with him for attention.<br/><br/>This movie has one big problem. THERE IS TO MUCH SLAPSTICK! It might entertain your 3 year old but you will be stuck in a painfully redundant rinse and repeat slapstick movie. I don't mind slapstick, its good for parody films and old cartoons but this went to far with it. There is also a disturbing joke where the dad wants the grandma to die. ................ Yeah... I would stay away from him for as long as you can. There is also a joke about starvation. HAHAHAHHA STARVING TO DEATH IS FUNNY! Oh and there is this stupid running gag where this monkey says DUN DUN DUN! For like 5 times in the movie. It gets very annoying very fast.<br/><br/>Oh and this movie is so original! It is Ice Age and The First Toy Story all in one! WOW! SO ORIGINAL! NOT! This 'Story' If you can call it that is so unoriginal I think the bad story was a excuse to have more slapstick in.<br/><br/>Now the animation is great. Its eye candy. Everything looks good. Even the colorful giant tiger. But that is just covering the horrid story and slapstick! The Croods is something I wish never existed. We never needed this. But its here... Anyways! Might be OK for 5 year old kids but anyone over the age of 10 will find this movie stupid."

"amit_imt2002","5","17","46","19 March 2013"," Missing story alert!
","The Croods is a big budget animated film with an interesting premise in search of a story.It gives us a sequence after sequence of a cave-dweller family coming to terms with a a very fast changing world that challenges any notions of mortality that we may have about our homo- sapien forefathers.But then its an animated film and death proofness shall not be held against them. Heck! its not the case for any Die Hard film, so a bunch of animated characters have all the right to survive rough landings from zillion foot high cliffs.And since the primary audience for this latest Dreamwork's "" product"" is likely to be children accompanied by guilt ridden parents it can be safely assumed that all the cute slapstick action will hit home with its core tiny- tot audience.<br/><br/>As the cave painting inspired credits roll we are introduced via voice-over to the The Crood family led by a brawny father named Grug, who guards his flock with a fierce adherence to the laws of survival he has learned the hard way.It involves as less interaction with the outside world as possible, which means spending much time in a claustrophobic cave and killing all notions of curiosity, which killed not just the cat but most of his brethren. This goes against the nature of his vivacious daughter Eep who craves to see what lies outside the cave.The premise is as old as the hills and the Neanderthal man.Soon enough her wishes are answered and they find themselves catapulted into a world very different from the one they knew and they must survive and make up new rules along the way.As it turns out the only new rule they need, is that there are no rules, and they must use a part of the body they haven't paid much attention to thus far – namely the brain.Grug says he doesn't need brains and flexes his muscles to illustrate his hair brained point.<br/><br/>His foil in the new psychedelic, dangerous and seductively beautiful world is Guy, who is a young chap with the gumption of Tom Sawyyer and Huck Finn rolled into one, the type that young girls that cant help but fall in love with.Guy and his success in saving their fur covered behinds on countless occasions makes Grug jealous and insecure as the gang stumbles from one deadly animal attack to another.They will discover fire, grey matter and importantly shoes in the process.The cry of ecstasy that Eep lets out when she first wears a pair of boots tells us that in the very distant future a certain Mr Jimmy Choo will become a billionaire and male-kind's nemesis.The Croods examines its characters with the same nonchalance that Grug makes drawings on caves to illustrate his ""put you head in a hole in the ground theories"" and undoubtedly his doodles will not make art loves swoon like they do over the Bulls in the Altamira caves in Spain.The film limits itself to following the escapades of grumpy father, cutie pie daughter and cocky wise Guy at the expanse of the rest of the family and creates only unpredictable nature as the adversary.<br/><br/>The Croods is full of slapstick comedy and has none of the dialogues and word play that will amuse the accompanying adults.It has no story and little character development, not to speak of a background score that could have lifted the film up, when it threatens to sag under the weight of its animation showiness.Small children will love its a gag a minute format but older children, I suspect, will see through its severe limitations.The film has a star cast of big names doing voiceovers but I found none of the distinctiveness of Nicholas Cage in the voice of Grug. The animators do a competent job and the 3D effects are half decent in some sequences which makes the film intermittently bearable.<br/><br/>Built into this film is the somewhat tenuous message that not listening to parents can be rewarding and that parents tend to be somewhat behind the curve.While a sense of adventure and inventiveness is a invaluable lesson children need to learn, this film delivers it in a way that very young children can easily misconstrue.Ultimately from the perspective of a 5 year olds father, kids can watch Tom and Jerry at home on Cartoon Network and the economics of visiting the multiplex for The Croods just does not work out, if you build in the cost of the popcorn and soda and over three hours of time. I walked out feeling suckered by the marketing wizards behind The Croods. The characters here are sometimes cute but the film itself is mostly crude. Be selfish, let your kids sit this one out.<br/><br/>Published on my blog mostlycinema.com"

","THE CROODS (2013) **** (Voices of: Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, Cloris Leachman, Clark Duke, Chris Sanders, Randy Thom) Wonderfully inventive animated fare about a family of prehistoric cave dwellers forced out of the safety of their home to the outer world while nature decides to make things problematic (i.e. earthquakes and lava). Wildly entertaining, some incredible animation (like the aforementioned natural disasters) and a stand out A-list vocal talents of Cage as the terribly overprotective paterfamilias; Reynolds as the Cro-Mag bo-hunk whose resourcefulness aids the clan of necessity; and in particular a very vivacious and fun-loving turn by Stone who steals the movie as the teenager who desperately wants to see more of the world at large. Appealing to children of all ages with comedic brilliance and artistic integrity. Directed with panache by Sanders and Kirk De Micco (who co- scripted the clever script too boot)."

","Grug is a caveman who really lives up to his name. He successfully protects his family in a cave providing, when the sun goes down, shelter and bonafide safety from the dangerous elements outside. But he's got a huge problem, and it's not just the hungry wildcat lurking in the moonlit exterior. His curious teenage daughter wants to explore beyond the boundaries of ""normal life.""<br/><br/>Thus begins our tale centering on a quirky clan of Neanderthals. The action begins as they strategically hunt for food, not an easy task. You'd think there would be a better (more natural) selection than a giant egg. That's because the Croods exist in a barren landscape where opportunities haven't opened up but they're about to. Boy are they ever.<br/><br/>After the teenage daughter Eep sees a strange glow outside the closed cave, she ventures into the night and meets an explorer dude named Guy, who's discovered a thing called Fire. He also has a premonition, and anyone who saw ICE AGE 4: CONTINENTAL DRIFT will get major déjà vu: The land as they know it is about to break apart.<br/><br/>So when the initial destruction occurs, the Croods discover an inner-world so colorful and vibrant, Sam Raimi's OZ seems like a plain paper sack in comparison. Within this creature- saturated jungle are even more dangerous elements, including a hovering flock of ravenous birds, man-eating plants, and a bigger, hungrier wildcat. But for Eep at least there's cool stuff to discover. And we now have a destination: giant mountains in the distance where possible safety awaits. <br/><br/>Grug and family ""capture"" the progressively minded Guy, who knows how to hunt bigger game, make shoes and, unlike the cranky patriarch, always looks forward to something called Tomorrow. And eventually, as the gang treks toward their goal, encountering various bizarre hybrids that screech out of the woodwork, an impatient Guy asks The Croods if they know of any pace faster than ""wander."" But for a movie that takes its time, allowing each obstacle to move the story along, ""wandering"" does this entertaining journey just fine.<br/><br/>The voices of Nicholas Cage and Ryan Reynolds, as Grug and Guy, eventually sound less like themselves; Cage even breaks from his breezy, shuffling tone to bring the Early Man grump- turned-hero to life. But it's Emma Stone's Eep that really shines through, providing a flawed character with an important (and evolving) arc that will glue everything, and everyone, together."

The first 20 minutes were the worse animated 20 minutes I have seen in a theater rated animated movie.

","So in my last review, Oliver and Company, I defended a movie I felt was underrated. So today, I'm gonna do the opposite: bash something that I feel is overrated. Yep, you heard right, I don't like this movie. One of my big problems with this movie is the story. After their cave is destroyed, the rest of the movie is NOTHING but a roadtrip with occasional stops and the story doing random things with itself. Now, there are movies where I can excuse this kind of story including The Land Before Time and Finding Nemo which are both in my top 30 animated movies. However, the reasons those movies succeeded were because the stories were executed in a heartfelt way and had great characters. Not to mention, incredible animation. However, this movie is the complete opposite of those 2 movies. There is nothing heartfelt about this movie because I don't like any of the characters or care about any of their problems. Eeb isn't given enough time to be a character and all we know is that she wants more like every other 90's Disney princess ever! However, it worked in those movies because they let us know who these characters are, making us feel for them. Eeb has no personality other than being a rebellious, annoying teenager. Also, Eeb is introduced as the main character in the first act but then it suddenly switches to the father, Grug's, story. You know what? I actually hate him. He is annoying and ridiculously stupid. He's also the most overprotective and close-minded piece of crap I've ever had the misfortune of knowing. As for the other characters, I don't remember their names and I don't care. This is definitely Dreamworks second worst movie beaten out only by Shark Tale."

The problem isn't that this film has no plot at all, nor even a bad plot. The problem is that it has the same plot as every other animated kids movie that's been made in the last 10 years. If you've already seen Brave, Tangled, or Frozen, then you've already seen this one, too. Same old story, different theme. Perhaps a better title would have been ""Not Another Animated Movie"". I gave it a ""2"" instead of a ""1"" based on the merits of its only redeeming quality - If you're having trouble sleeping, this movie can help."

","When I first saw this movie in trailers and pictures I was certainly not a fan of the premise. I am not a huge fan of movies that are set in this era like Ice Age and several others, but yesterday I wanted to give the movie a chance and I was pleasantly surprised!<br/><br/>The animation is wonderful, and the character and monster design are very different and surprising. The world they live in is very creative.<br/><br/>The movie has a great pacing and knows where and how to let the viewer feel different emotions. The movie can be funny the movie can be sad, and it works wonderfully.<br/><br/>If you were not convinced by the marketing or trailers do give it a shot. It is very much worth your time."

","This movie was a movie made for the entire family to see, young and old. There weren't any scenes that I wasn't familiar with. Overall, the movie deserves great praise and stands out, compared to other animated movies that I have seen throughout my life. The graphics are eye popping, and the acting is great! I don't see how anyone could go wrong with this movie as a whole. The Croods do a magnificent job at trying to survive on their own, in places they never imagined were possible! And they pulled through in the way end, no matter how many problems they faced, and to me that is a great moral for families to learn! The movie is well worth the money and is worth the see. I highly recommend you buy this movie on DVD or Blue- ray, because it is truly a great family movie that you can't go wrong with."

At the beginning of the movie Eep wanders out of her cave to run into a guy named guy. Guy tells Eep how the world is going to end.

"Angels_Review","8","2","3","11 March 2014"," Family trips haven't changed ever since the dawn of time.
","At first, you would think that this would be a story about our past. You know; cavemen, dinosaurs, animals that were back during the time that cavemen would actually exist. Strangely, that is not the case. There are some animals that look like they could be similar to animals that really did leave back in the stone age but then we get flying turtles, whales that live on land, and a whole manner of creative animals that seem to help keep the feeling of adventure. I was actually surprised with each new animal that came out giving the sense of wonder that the family was experiencing. It brought me into the video without having to change too much. We still had a normal family that felt as though it could have been my own with the same interactions that I would have between my mother and father but then there was always a feeling of just how new the world around them was.<br/><br/>There are so many things about the family that we followed that made me have a feeling of familiarity. We have a girl who thinks outside the 'cave' just as myself but she is held back by an over protective father and a family who will follow the father just because he had kept them alive the whole time. I can understand the rest of the family's ideas but yet it just feels that Eep is just singled out because she has a more adventurous personality. The father even uses a character in his stories that is based on her to keep the family scared and warn them not to be curious. Then there is the fighting between the father and the rather interesting mother-in-law. Anyone who has a family who the mother-in-law as a live in family member, the stereotype is that the father and her would not get along in a almost funny way.<br/><br/>The ending was actually not what I would of thought would happen so it caught me off guard. I would not have thought it would pan out exactly how it did but that's why it was actually a lot of fun to watch. Let's just say the comedy aspect to the show really mixed it up nicely.<br/><br/>The CG is actually really nice with a lot of bright colors contrasted to the sort of dry area the family lived in before. Although the colors and textures are a bit unrealistic, they add to the wonder of the movie. The designs of the characters are easy to pick out what character is what and even change every once in a while, especially the mother who surprisingly seems to becomes bit more 'beautiful' and 'free spirited.' It was like she was able to get the life back into her when she was able to relax and have some adventure.<br/><br/>The voices were awesome! I couldn't pick one out that did not fit the voice that did not fit the characters. There were so many large named voice actors and even some that didn't normally just do voice acting like Nicolas Cage and Emma Stone. All the voice actors worked so well together that they felt like a family even better then I would of thought. You know there are times when the actors or the voices were more like they were trying to force a family relationship; well here it wasn't like that. The characters had great chemistry as though they were family themselves.<br/><br/>I think this is a great movie for the family that would make anyone laugh. I felt as though this was my own family every once in a while just because of the way the family interacted."
"siderite","9","2","3","3 March 2014"," Actually, pretty amazing!
","You have to take into account the expectations as well, I mean I was going to watch the film, probably on fast forward, because it is a silly animation movie. I was going to enjoy it for the few scenes that are probably in the trailer as well and call it ""seen it"". Can you, then, believe I never touched the keys from my laptop and watched it all start to end?<br/><br/>The film had great animation, even if 3D, an interesting world, with all kind of weird animals that are not real, yet tons of fun, but most of all, a really nice script. It had the usual tricks to make most audience like the movie, in this case the cosy feeling of family love and support and the expected caveman clichés, but also subtlety and expression of a whole range of emotions. In a sentence, it made me feel good watching it.<br/><br/>The Croods had only eight people in the cast, including for the roles of one small animal and one inarticulate child, and not the most famous ones either, but they did a great job.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I may be a sucker for transformative journeys with your entire family movies, but I really enjoyed it. For a Hollywood animation film, it is even more amazing. Or maybe I was just in the right mood. No dirty jokes, no references to other films, emotions that can be enjoyed and understood by small children, but with added subtlety that will entertain adults as well. Watch it."
"havefunrespawninghd","10","2","3","1 March 2014"," Everything about this movie is amazing
","First off let me say the colors in this movie are so vibrant and bring so much life in the scenes. All the plants and trees are all different types of colors with different shades. The story in this was amazing in this also. I won't spoil anything, but the story is about how a caveman's daughter is tired of the old routine day to day life so she explores and sooner or later the family joins in and goes in on a big adventure. It is my favorite animation at the moment, and as a animator i think Dreamworks made a high quality movie. I hope it wins a Ocsar tomorrow, but this movie is underrated compared to Frozen which probably will take the Oscar. You should definitely see this movie if you or your kids love animated films."
"leonblackwood","8","2","3","9 February 2014"," Brilliant Fun! 8/10
","Review: This movie is brilliant fun for the whole family. The characters are great and each one has there own weird and wonderful personality which was written extremely well. The storyline was well put together and it doesn't getting boring from beginning to end. The animation looks brilliant and the attention to detail is definitely noticed. There isn't really a fault with the movie. It reminded a lot like the Incredibles which also was a great movie. It's not very often that I can't find a fault with a movie, so this is definitely recommend for the whole family. <br/><br/>Round-Up: The directors chose the right voices for each character. You can easily tell who Nicolas Cage is because his voice isn't much different from his every day voice. Every element was covered with the storyline. There's funny moments, along with touching moments like the relationship between Daddy Crood and his daughter. This must look amazing in 3D or in the cinema and it should give Pixar a kick up the bottom. I hope they don't wait ages for a sequel.<br/><br/>Budget: $135million Worldwide Gross: $587million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there animation movies which are fun for the whole family. 8/10"
"CMTiago","8","2","3","3 February 2014"," Visually stunning and very nice story
","The Croods is one of those movies that has you wonder at the marvelous setting that is provided by the filmmakers, while also managing to keep you attracted to the plot and its characters. Basically Eep is your typical teenager that in this case lives in a world in which her family are the only cavemen left alive and under the protection of her father, Grug, live a safe but uneventful life. Wanting to explore and find out more about her world, she escapes one evening and meets Guy, a human boy about her age that appears to be more knowledgeable about the world than her father. Eep learns that change is coming and that time is running out. Soon The Croods will be taken on an adventure in which they will bond as a family, while experiencing change in a world that is now showing its marvels. The Croods is a light animation feature that will surely entertain the little ones with some funny jokes and characters. As for the grown ups, the story is strong enough to hold the audience in and at some moments may have you doubting the outcome of this family that one can relate to. DreamWorks Animation is back in full force and I for one am pleased with this family film.<br/><br/>Rating 8/10"
"shauni15","7","2","3","13 September 2013"," a stunningly beautiful adventure for the whole family.
","The Croods is Dreamworks's latest animated project. It's about a family of cavemen who are suddenly blasted out of their comfort zones into a whole new world. when the separation of Pangea begins.<br/><br/>And let me tell you, it's done beautifully. The visuals alone are spectacular, the animation is jaw dropping, the cinematography is astounding, the creature and world design is extraordinarily creative, the designers didn't hold back anything. They made their own entire world and let their imagination soar freely. I don't think I've seen one unoriginal creature design in the entire movie. It kinda reminds me of Avatar: The Last Airbender's creativity, and thats one of the highest compliments i can give to an animated feature. Even if everything else was crappy about this film(and it wasn't) it'd still be worth to watch for the visuals alone.<br/><br/>The voice-acting is good, Nicolas Cage does a surprsingly good job as the caveman father. Emma Stone is great and the rest of the cast as well.<br/><br/>The story itself is nothing new really. You can almost always guess what's gonna happen, but i didn't really expect an Oscar winning script from a family movie. The characters are still nicely developed, the jokes almost always land (even if most of it is cheap/slapstick humor, but hey they're cavemen afterall), and overall it's done well, even if its nothing special.<br/><br/>All in all, it's one of the better animated features I've seen in a while(certainly one of the most creative), and it's very well worth the watch for anyone, you wont regret it."

The connection between father and daughter was the thing that reminded me of the movie Brave, than the colorful nature and animals which reminded me of the movie The Life Of PI. It was indeed a colorful motivational inspirational movie. Like most of these animation movies you walk out from the movie theater with hope and encouragements of not giving up. This movie gives the message of regardless of how scary things in life seems don't be afraid, GO FOR IT.

"michele-hollman","10","2","3","13 April 2013"," Fun characters EXCELLENT message
","The animation, beautiful colors, fantastical creatures, humor, etc are all cool, but the message was simply amazing. How many people live in the ""dark ages"" so fearful of everything that (quote from movie) ""we aren't living, we're really just NOT dying"". There were a lot of biblical references about the world coming to an end, and really only needing love and the strength and courage to ""go toward the light"" in order to ""find Tomorrow"". <br/><br/>Another metaphor, is that the SPEED with which these cave people must conduct all their daily activities just to survive replicates the fast-paced rat race which is now so ""normal"" we don't even realize how much we're missing. We rush rush rush all day long, just in order to...do it all over again the very next day. When they slow down and enjoy the beauty of everything around them is when these characters finally start to ""get it"". <br/><br/>It's also a wonderful story about the importance of family and the dynamic between parents/teens. If we try to protect them too much our kids may be safe, but they can't grow, become independent, and really live; but, if we give them just the right amount of freedom and boundaries instead of rigid rules, they figure out what we most want them to learn anyway--on their own--which is REALLY what we parents wanted anyway. So ironically simple and commonsense, yet still so hard to get it right. I literally had tears streaming down my face in several parts. Great movie! Check it out!"
"JoeStok13","6","2","3","29 March 2013"," Great Movie For The Whole Family
","The Croods is a wonderful movie with a great story and amusing characters. The graphics were fantastic as well. Dreamworks has been in fine form recently, delivering great movies (like Rise of the Guardians and Puss in Boots) that will live long the memory.<br/><br/>What I really found surprising, was the fact that the movie was heartwarming and quite emotional. The movie also had various majestic animals on screen, which really enhanced the feeling of being in the prehistoric time. You almost forget you are in the prehistoric time due to the behavior of the family members, which of course is very much like modern day family behavior. The story is constantly effected by the choices each of the family members take, which makes for an interesting plot.<br/><br/>I believe that everyone will enjoy the Croods, no matter what age you are. It's fun, heartwarming and a great experience. A-List actors Nicolas Cage, Ryan Reynolds and Emma Stone provide the voices, which are instantly recognizable, and they really suit their characters. The director also did a magnificent job, especially with the cameras. The camera follows the action excellently and doesn't disorient you. So overall an amazing movie and one that is fun to watch with family or even girlfriends. It's the feel-good movie of 2013 so far."

","This is the story of a family of Neanderthals that live every day in fear. Everyone they knew had met an untimely end and Grug, the family's father is determined to keep them all alive. There are some problems in the form of teenage angst with Eep. Craving freedom she sneaks out one day and meets what I assume was Homoerectus, a guy named Guy. He tells her the end is coming and she tries to convince the family to follow Guy. The family is forced to go on an unwanted adventure, trying to concur their fears in order to survive and, pardon the pun, evolve to a new life. This movie features some great actors providing the voices of the characters, but Nick Cage shines as this seems like a role he was meant to voice.<br/><br/>I read a review on here that said this film was ""insensitive, rude and mis-educational"". Not everything that our children watch needs to be educational. What is wrong with having fun? I suppose The Incredibles depicting super heroes living normal lives among us is educational? Or finding Nemo with talking fish and sharks that try not to eat fish, their sole source of nutrition? Stop taking life so serious. I feel sorry for the kids being raised like that. As for insensitive and rude, I do not get that either. Who would this movie insult? As far as I know Neanderthals are extinct. This family friendly movie showcases exactly how far a dad will go to protect his kids, and to me there is nothing more touching."

There's so much imaginative design in here, with the different kinds of creatures and places they go. It's also really funny!

The voice cast is solid as usual and the animation is colourful and filled with a wide range of characters equally so.<br/><br/>The pacing is a little uneven and the movie begins rather slowly.

While at most points it's trys to be too modern and a bit cliche manly at the first half and takes away form the story and focuses on just pop cultural references and modern jokes. Which makes the film fall flat on. But of coruse this film isn't all that bad. Nicolas Cage voice work was one thing that worked in this. But even with that, it's because he's a over the top actor so it's not that hard to laugh at. As for the other voice work like Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds, they didn't do half bad.

"dfa120374","7","1","1","16 January 2015"," An Enjoyable Prehistoric Animation Romp
","The Croods are the last cave family in their ""neighbourhood"" with the other families having been killed by one thing or another. This leads Grug Crood (Nicolas Cage) to be a bit over-protective with his family meaning that they hardly ever leave their cave and that anything new is bad. Eep Crood (Emma Stone) is more adventurous, though, and is constantly frustrated by her dad's over-bearing manner, so one night she leaves the safety of their cave to investigate a strange light. It's here that she meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds)...an incentive young boy who predicts ""the end of the world"". After an earthquake destroys their cave, the Croods - along with Guy - leave to find pastures new, bringing about different dangers & adventures.<br/><br/>The Croods is an enjoyable roller coaster animation ride, but unfortunately I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Don't get me wrong...it's still a very good movie, but it was just missing a certain something to make it better. DreamWorks have done better animated movies with Shrek and Turbo to name some, but that doesn't mean The Croods is bad.<br/><br/>As we have come to see from a lot of DreamWorks movies, the animation is superb and is crystal clear, especially in Blu-ray. The humour is constant throughout the movie as well which is good because that's much better than an animated movies that only have two or three funny moments and then nothing else. The humour isn't ""roll about laughing"" kind of humour, but it is enough to definitely make you laugh.<br/><br/>One wee minor downside was that a couple of scenes did tend to drag on a bit with the ""chasing for food"" opening scene being one of them. The casting was spot on as well and they all done a great job. None of the characters were annoying, and I actually think that Belt - Guy's pet sloth - is one of the best characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The Croods isn't just a kids movie but is a family movie, and it doesn't matter if you're 6 or 60...this is a movie that everyone can like.<br/><br/>Watch it and enjoy."
"bannerninja","8","1","1","9 February 2014"," Good fun, great voice-cast - highly recommended
","I had seen nothing of the advertising for this movie and I didn't really know what to expect - perhaps more ice age stuff? But no - this has animation with focus on the fantastical, a great voice cast and a story line that is simple yet works surprisingly well and just invites you along for the ride.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage as Cave-dad is fantastic - Cage should definitely do more voice-acting as it seems to set him free from his usual manic style and just deliver a very different thing. But everyone works - I don't know if the cast recorded their dialog together, but there just seems to be great chemistry between the characters.<br/><br/>And it's FUN! Great comedy - some of it slapstick, some of it from the character interaction and good dialog - and it doesn't take itself overly serious. <br/><br/>A warning to those demanding high doses of reality - this is NOT it. The Croods deliver a prehistoric setting in the best tradition of what-if - strange animals and creatures you could almost believe had existed once upon a time.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","There just isn't much that stands out about this movie. Some puns doesn't seem to make much sense when it comes to the scenarios and characters. Despite the setting taking place in a pre-historic time period, there isn't really anything new. There is a lot of obnoxious wackiness, which is understandable since it's dealing with cavemen. What I did like is how it sticks to the cavemen nature of the characters, while also blending in modern interaction. And I am not just talking about how the characters speak English. It shows the vicious and animal like nature of the characters back then, while also keeping it family friendly. All the voice actors and actresses is alright, again nothing that stands out but for the most part it seems to fit the characters. Nicholas Cage basically 100% sounds like Nicholas Cage. I give credit for the parts near the end, how it connects certain things together. While also bringing out the emotions, although the emotional elements maybe a bit cliché.

"rachelandfilms","7","1","1","12 July 2013"," Fun family adventure...
","When I heard about this film I won't lie, I wasn't that enthusiastic. My reasoning for this is mainly that I thought it would be a rehash of other pre-historic animations we've been barraged with in recent years. Now I'm not pointing any fingers *cough* Ice Age *cough* too-many- sequels *cough*okay, so I am. But anyway I just figured that there was only so many ways you can tell that ""its-the-end-of-the-world"" story without killing (pardon the pun) the subject. After watching The Croods however, I quickly changed my mind, because the film doesn't just tackle this subject but a whole lot more. <br/><br/>The film tells the story of The Crood family who are living a simple and desperately frustrating life in a cave where there day-to-day routine consists of hunting and sitting in the dark listening to the same stories from family patriarch and all-round fuss-pot father Grub (Nicholas Cage). All of this changes however when an earthquake destroys there cave and they must travel across the new and fantastic planes of a land they have never explored. Along the way the Crood family pick up Ryan Reynolds' character Guy who shows them that there is more to their caveman lifestyle than simply surviving and forms a romance with the adventurer of the family Eep (voiced by Emma Stone). <br/><br/>The characters that make up this family are surreal in their realismif that makes sense?! We've got the pre-requisite rebellious teen Eep, the understanding Mother (Catherine Keener) trying to keep the family together, the loud and opinionated mother-in-law that you love to hate (Cloris Leachman), the oft-humiliated middle child (ain't that always the way?), the kid sister and the over-protective father. The actors portraying this everyday family bring an hilarity and sincerity to their roles and really play up to the stereotypes attached to each archetype, to the point where you're watching and thinking ""oh-my-god. It's like my family. In fact it's so much like my family that it's kinda scary"". The fact that these animated characters seem like real people is important in emphasising that heart-warming message of love and family that we are left with at the end, and also makes those funny family frustrations that much more hilarious. <br/><br/>Fancy reading the rest of my unedited thoughts on The Croods?

","... i have to admit that THE CROODS really did nothing for me during it's primary theatrical run. I had no desire to see it, and honestly it didn't appear to hold any appeal for my 6 year old and 4 year old children.<br/><br/>However, it was playing at a second run theatre in Michigan, and it's the summer time, so I bit the bullet, paid 4.50 and took my 2 kids to see it and man am i ever glad i did.<br/><br/>Surprisingly touching film about a family with some great messages for EVERY member that is told in an entertaining manner that managed to hold the attentions of BOTH of my kids (not always an easy task!)<br/><br/>The message and humour works on all levels, and i have to say that even i had a bit of a tear in my eye during the finale.<br/><br/>A surprisingly cute film that wound up being a great way to spend a summer afternoon with the kids."
"davedroid07","7","1","1","9 July 2013"," All around great family movie
","I have to say this movie is worth a watch for whatever age you are. It will be fun for the younger ones and even older adults. Basically this movie revolves around the age old debate of how to live your life, in fear cautiously(in the dark ie:the cave) or freely with courage (towards the light)?. Basically it may seem the girl EEP is the main character who basically wants to 'leave the cave' and become independent. But it shifts towards the end focusing on Grug who learns to break out his shell and fulfill his desired role better ,as the masculine protector of his family.<br/><br/>As it can be seen there are some interesting character development and relatable issues at hand. Nonetheless the Croods manage to blend this perfectly with a humorous and compelling adventure.I had quite a few laughs, it is a special movie and one I would recommended movie enthusiasts to purchase."

","The Croods is a 3D computer-animated adventure comedy that features the voices of Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, Clark Duke, and Cloris Leachman. The film is set in a prehistoric era known as The Croodaceous, a period which contains fantastical creatures, when a man's position as a ""Leader of the Hunt"" is threatened by the arrival of a prehistoric genius who comes up with revolutionary new inventions, like fire, as they trek through a dangerous but exotic land in search of a new home. When their cave is destroyed, the Crood family must embark on a comedy adventure into strange and spectacular territory in search of a new home. As if patriarch Grug didn't already have enough to handle, it goes from bad to worse when they encounter an imaginative nomad named Guy. With Guy's help the Croods conquer their fear of the outside world and discover that they have exactly what it takes to survive each other.The film was written and directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders.<br/><br/>The animation is first-rate, with moments of genuine visual imagination, and the story, while unremarkable, is entirely adequate as captures the wonder and more gently, the anxiety of discovery time and time again.Added to that,it is simple enough in its story and structure that its emotional honesty and touching message will catch you quite off- guard.As family viewing, it's pleasant enough.Obviously,it is primitive but in a digitally sophisticated way that's boisterous,humorous and fun to watch.Truly an enjoyable family film with excellent visuals and interesting characters."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","1","1","31 March 2013"," Great colourful fun from Dreamworks
","Dreamworks have been hit and miss for me(mostly hits), while I love The Prince of Egypt and How to Train Your Dragon, Shark Tale and Bee Movie left me underwhelmed. Watching the trailer for The Croods, admittedly I wasn't entirely impressed. But as I love animation so much and because I believe in giving any film a chance, I went ahead and watched The Croods anyway. And it was much better than anticipated and what the trailer made it out to be, in fact I found myself liking The Croods very much. I did think that the ending was a cop-out, it seemed to me that the film didn't know how or when it was going to end and it seemed too convenient also. And I also thought that the film was a little too long, some of the story structure towards the end seemed on the verge of petering out. The animation however is really wonderful, it is detailed and very colourful with the character designs well modelled and convincing in movement. If you see The Croods, try and see it in 3D if you can, I am usually not a fan of the 3D gimmick but this is one of those instances where the action is enhanced instead of the 3D detracting from it. At the top of my head, only the Vincent Price film House of Wax(also given the 3D treatment) has had that effect on me. The soundtrack is rousing and lively, though appropriately subdued in the more touching moments. The dialogue is very funny and extremely smart, with much to entertain children and adults. It is quite sophisticated in tone, although it thankfully doesn't feel too much. Amongst the humour, there's also room for some morals and family issues, and they are nicely done without being too heavy-handed. The story doesn't exactly break new ground and will seem formulaic to some. On the other hand, it is briskly paced, consistently engaging and is heart-warming in more ways than one. The prehystorical slapstick is frantic, but hilarious and never too childish. The characters are also a large part of the fun, they are very likable and amusing characters and you can relate to them. Grug and Guy's relationship was especially convincing. The voice work is great. A more restrained than usual Nicholas Cage is a big surprise and he is an ideal fit for his character. Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds are equally appealing, and Cloris Leachman relishes some of The Croods' most amusing moments. In conclusion, great colourful fun without being among the very finest from Dreamworks. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","This was a treat, a feast for the eyes, plenty of belly laughs in fact the laughs just kept coming. The characters were well developed and cleverly observed. The kids (6 & 7) loved it, they got a little scared at certain points and a little upset at the sad moments, but all within reason. There was a little plagiarizing of other movies most notably Avatar, Pitch Black, but wow what a great job the animators did. <br/><br/>What a Tour-de-force it didn't slow down or take a breather, relentless fun, jokes and action. I would say its the equal of Toy Story 3 and that's saying something - definite franchise opportunities and many sequels no doubt, expect a TV show.<br/><br/>Go see it and take the family"
"rebecca-ry","7","1","1","29 March 2013"," Funniest Kid's film so far this year
","'The Croods' is DreamWorks' latest animated production. It involves a family of cavemen as they are forced to venture out into the open after their cave is destroyed. <br/><br/>The story is quite well written; it starts with you thinking it is going to revolve around teenage girl Eep (Emma Stone), with her journey, falling in love blah blah blah. However, the story develops into one about how sometimes fathers have to learn lessons and acknowledge that they can be wrong about things. Although it is only a voice performance, Nicholas Cage is brilliant and provides 90% of the comedy here. You can tell he had a great time working on this film. As children's films go, this is probably the funniest one in a while, the story is not insultingly basic and it teaches some decent life lessons along the way. The only thing that really bugged me was the Belt character – I didn't get what was so funny about a small creature shouting 'dundunduuuuun!' at various moments throughout the film in scenes where it didn't really fit. It seems to be a necessity in children's films now to have a little sidekick randomly make a funny noise of come out with some naff pop culture reference these days.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is probably the best kid's film out so far this year. There are a lot of really funny scenes and a couple of tear-jerking moments too."

","The technical attributes of The Croods are many; I saw the movie in 3D with my wife and two children (11 and 8). The adults and the kids will marvel at the 3D, like the little glowing red cinders that would come floating out of the screen toward the audience, byproducts of a fire on screen. Technically, The Croods is solid.<br/><br/>The problem is that the kids, who grew up with this stuff, have seen the 3D magic done many times before, and that alone will not win their enthusiasm. The movie must do more than dazzle; it must also entertain, and to do that it must make some sense. Sadly, The Croods comes up a little short in both respects.<br/><br/>First, The Croods, as far as I could tell, are human beings. That means they can't run like gazelles, or hurl rocks five hundred yards, or survive getting thrown off a cliff etc. These Croods bear little resemblance to human beings. The baby scuttles across the ground like a wild animal; the daughter clambers up vertical cliffs like no animal I've ever seen, human or not. With the disconnect, I never knew what species I was watching, and it put the premise of the plot on shaky footing going in.<br/><br/>I know, it's only a movie. I get that. If it was a Superman movie, maybe then it would make sense, but there's no part of the plot that gives the family super powers, and yet they appear to have them. And yet despite these powers, the father keeps telling them how dangerous the world is.<br/><br/>The Incredibles was a movie featuring a family of ""supers."" That movie, with a premise as equally impossible as the premise The Croods, was at least internally consistent. For instance, Flash could run fast, and that's what he did. Elasti-Girl could stretch herself, and she did that. It was part of the plot, and it was explained as such. In this movie, there are too many things that seem to make no sense, and are not explained. Like, how the baby can outrun a wild animal.<br/><br/>Setting all of that aside, I asked my eight year old how she liked it, and she told me it was ""weird"" (see above), and that ""the same things kept happening."" That was the other problem – as dazzling as the technical side of it is, the action had a certain sameness to it after a while.<br/><br/>Should you go? Sure, why not. Bring the kids. They'll get a couple of chortles; they'll enjoy the 3D stuff, all of that. Pixar, it's not, but it's good enough to get you through the night."
"Hellmant","5","2","4","9 August 2013"," Really reminded me of 'THE FLINTSTONES'.
","'THE CROODS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Blockbuster DreamWorks Animation film about a family of cavemen venturing outside their cave for the first time. It stars the voices of Nicolas Cage, Ryan Reynolds, Emma Stone, Catherine Keener, Clark Duke and Cloris Leachman. It was directed and co-written (with actor John Cleese) by Chris Sanders (who also does a voice in the film) and Kirk De Micco. Sanders is also famous for co-directing such animated blockbusters as 'HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON' and 'LILO & STITCH' (which he also voiced the title character Stitch in). He also co-wrote those films as well as 'THE LION KING', 'ALADDIN', 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST', 'MULAN' and others. This film doesn't quite live up to most others on Sanders' resume but it is a decent animated kids' film.<br/><br/>The movie follows a family (the 'Croods') living in the fictional prehistoric time known as the 'Croodaceous' period. The time was populated by a lot of fantastical creatures and a very small amount of humans. The Croods were lead by the father, Grug (Cage), who was obsessed with never letting his family do anything dangerous or try anything new (and kept them mostly hidden in a cave). This drove his teenage daughter Eep (Stone) crazy, who constantly dreamt of adventures. One day Eep does venture outside the cave and meets a very intelligent young man named Guy (Reynolds). The rest of the family goes out looking for her when their cave is destroyed. The Croods then must travel across the land, with Guy as a guide, in search of a new home and safety.<br/><br/>The film is colorful and visually pleasant. It's also funny and adventurous at times. All of the cast is more than adequate in the film (especially Cage in the lead). What it really reminded me of was 'THE FLINTSTONES', with Cage playing a character very similar to 'Fred Flintstone'. I grew up on that show so the movie is mildly entertaining to me. If you enjoyed that cartoon you'll probably enjoy this movie as well (and kids will probably love it). It's nothing spectacular but it is decent family entertainment.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0"

","This film goes all-out with its imaginative setting and shows lots of fantastical creatures.

"mvpdom","6","0","0","26 May 2020"," ""I have an idea""
","Nicolas Cage and Ryan Reynolds, two actors that just the fact they are in it gives the the movie points in my book.
Even if I did not know it was them starting in the movie the characters a great forces, butting heads both too show the short comings of the father Grug, his failure to face fear and try new things, and the comedy of Guy who is not a cave man coming up with many ideas of things just obvious to use, but in the world of the movie they are Brand New! With that Grig persist to come with his own ideas that are failed versions of things we have to day like a mobile home, rocks that he stacks together for someone to presumably carry.
The movie's message seems to be to ""not be afraid of new things"" and to ""follow the light to tomorrow"".
The movie portrays that Grug is putting his foot down on anything new, until Guy comes along to show everyone that new can be good and useful and teaches Grug that lesson.
By the end of the movie after Grug puts everyone else first be throwing them into the unknown, where minutes earlier he accepted the Guy was not wrong and new was not bad and you should not be afraid. After being stranded an idea goes off in Grugs head and he builds a contraption to return to his family.
By the end Eb, the older daughter, summarizes that's the family learned to follow the light. I think that is life we should pursue light as I. Truth and goodness, but in the context of the movie that does not make too much sense since the only development is is that they learned the previous lesson and have now become nomadic as opposed to cave people.
Eb, I think that is her name, which I think sounds too much like Eve. She starts of rebellious and shaky relationship with her father, which translates to today's society very well. Her desire for something more leads them to Guy, who she ends up falling for and as a averagely constructed romance, that is endearing and comedic, but not one of the better elements. By the end both Eb and Grug overcome their problems and Grug fixes it with a Hug his new invention. Which is very endearing, probably the best part of the film.
All the other family members have there good comedic moments, serve as comic relief.
This movie is funny. The story is ok, it did not hit me very hard, so the movie would land for me close for Ok than Good. The story is weak in the sense that it is very vague where they are going and in the end it still seems very vague. What is tomorrow obviously it means the next day, but I feel like they try to make it out to be something more as a vague place that is were they are going which is nowhere. We learn late in the movie that Guy's family died in tar which is tragic and funny at the same time. We learn his motivation is just to keep on going, but there is no clear end goal.
There is a sequel that is coming out this year that could make a clear objective of where they are going, but you can never expect too much from a sequel.
Overall this movie is funny has the threads of good story, but when watching it did not hit as hard as it might have. The movie is ok a strong 6/10, I don't plan on watching it anytime soon and probably will not stick in my memory."

","This is an animated tale of a teen girl and her natural desire to explore the world and the angst that it causes the father who wants to keep the family safe in a cave...in this case it is not a metaphor. Emma Stone was perfect for our on screen teen girl Eep, complete with her signature crackling voice. The world around them is falling apart and their only chance for survival is to follow the new Guy (Ryan Reynolds) to the objection of Grug (Nicolas Cage).<br/><br/>In spite of what sounds like an adult theme, it is aimed at the kids. The comedy is slapstick and simple jokes. The animals are wildly colorful so as to not be frightening as they chase humans. As an adult I didn't find the film boring, yet its lack of depth allowed me to have frequent breaks and not miss any plot points. Eep provides girls with a positive role model, something that is finally becoming the norm in these animated sagas.<br/><br/>Cloris Leachman played the voice of Gran, most likely because Betty White was too busy playing football. Great film for the kids, so-so for adults."

","One more masterwork by DreamWorks! I don't know why, but I did not expect too much of this piece. Though, it showed itself a huge good surprise! As I told in the title above, they had many nice ideas about how to use stone age traits to make a great animation movie. The characters are very well developed and I loved their stone-age mannerisms: amazing animation job! Besides that, it has a quite smart screenplay. The general idea may be perceived as a self-help advise not to be afraid and to risk. Though, it it is more than that, or at least it shows a brilliant metaphor for that: humanity only has evolved because human beings overcame their afraid of nature and tried. Screenplay also explores the alpha male struggles, domestication of wildlife, dangers and scarcity faced by the first days of our species. Following the light is also a nice metaphor for knowledge, like the fire of Prometheus. The Noah's moment in the end was also great. The film is intelligent and touching in the right amount."

","The Croods (2013): Dir: Kirk DeMicco, Chris Sanders / Voices: Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, Cloris Leachman: Prehistoric animation about one of the original families. The head of the cave is Grug and he is strong and constantly concerned about the safety of his family. His daughter Eep is adventurous and disregards her father's paranoia. Others include the wife, son, baby, and granny. Eventually Guy enters the picture when Eep sneaks out of the cave and marvels at his creation of fire. Guy warns them about the end of the earth and when an earthquake destroys their cave they are off to find new refuge. Not much of a plot and the structure is one simplistic encounter after another. The saving grace is a climax that presents Grug in a position where he must think on the spot and delivers on a brilliant plot solution. Directors Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders are backed with a lot of corny story elements but ultimately it is the animated presentation that scores the highest marks. Many of the characters are flat but Nicolas Cage is amusing voicing Grug who competes with Guy for his family's affection and trust. Emma Stone voices the ambitious and curios Eep who has her father's strength. Ryan Reynolds voices Guy whose resourceful keen senses solve much yet create tension with Grug. Other roles are not as well developed including a granny who has more energy than she should have at her prehistoric age. The animation is the highlight and the theme is family and the willingness to cut ties and trust those we care for to make beneficial choices. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

After all, we all have our conflicts and struggle, and seek a new tomorrow, even better. <br/><br/>In some scenes I cried. So beautiful!!! <br/><br/>I'm looking forward to watch the sequel."

","I was talked into watching this; and glad I did. This Dreamworks animated feature is co-directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders. Both also lay claim to the screenplay. Fantastic cinematography and interesting story. Plus likable characters. Eep(Emma Stone)is an energetic girl, who likes to stray a bit from the cave. She meets a strange boy named Guy(Ryan Reynolds)and his pet sloth called Belt(Sanders). Guy is imaginative and has what it takes to be a future inventor, or even discoverer. Eep's father is Grug(Nicolas Cage), and as any well respected caveman, he worries when his daughter getting too far from the cave. He finds Eep and on the way home an earthquake makes shambles of their cave.<br/><br/>Grug gathers the family, wife Ugga(Catherine Keener), son Thunk(Clark Duke), baby daughter Sandy(Randy Thom) and then there is ferocious Gran(Cloris Leachman)...and the journey begins to search for a new cave. Guy and his pet join the family in the trek across what actually is a brand new world to all. This fantastic new world is full of strange creatures, dangers and wonders. There is a brand new life on the horizon.<br/><br/>This is a family friendly movie, but be cautioned that there is some situations that may prove to be too scary for the youngest of viewers. You can count on 98 minutes of adventure, escape and enjoyment."

Was dubious about watching this to start with but loved it so much have now watched it five times!<br/><br/>It held my attention throughout with great animation, amusing characters and originality.<br/><br/>I like the way the family are portrayed- in many ways just like a modern family with the youngsters leading the parents.<br/><br/>I cannot fault this film it is so amusing and original-it even rewrites evolution-with fish and sea creatures starting out on land! I recommend it to all age groups."

","'The Croods' features some truly dazzling animation that really pops out when watched in high definition. It's just a shame that it's wasted on such a lackluster script. Hackneyed, unfocused, and utterly devoid of laughs, the film shambles from one loud bit of nonsense to the next, hoping it seems to club us into submission like the cavemen who inspired it.<br/><br/>With so few characters a lot of pressure falls on the shoulders of the small voice cast, who unfortunately prove unable to do anything with the weak material they're given. There isn't a single standout performance or one moderately likable character here.<br/><br/>I would hardly call this the golden age of animation, but there are certainly better options out there than this tepid effort."

","As a lover for animated films like The Lion King,Tangled,How To Train Your Dragon,Frozen and so many more good animated films out there,I decided to buy The Croods on DVD yesterday for a bargain as I never seen it before and I decided to check it out. So here is my review on the film The Croods(2013)<br/><br/>The Croods is an animated 2013 DreamWorks Animation/20th Century Fox film and tells the tale of a cave girl called Eep(voiced by The Amazing Spiderman star Emma Stone) who is sick and tired of being cooped up in a cave alongside her overprotective father called Grug(voiced by Face/Off's Nicolas Cage) and the rest of her family as her father thinks that they could die if they ever left their cave. So Eep one day escapes only to find a handsome boy called Guy(voiced by The Proposal's Ryan Reynolds making his first animated debut here,as his second animated film he did with DreamWorks was Turbo) making fire as Eep saw a light and decided to follow it which landed her to him in the first place and the two set it off. So when Eep's habitant is in danger herself and her overprotective father along with the rest of her family decide to venture out to a whole new other world. With teamwork involved will Eep and her father ever get along and will her father stop being so overprotective over his daughter?<br/><br/>So what is good about this film well for starters the animation is brilliant,in fact the animation isn't like the likes of Frozen or Tangled as they used Photo-Realistic imagery with 2D and CGI combined together,whereas in this the backgrounds look as if its done in live action. Also the charcther design is nice too and its nice to have Alan Silvestri(who teams up with Chris Sanders who worked with him in Lilo & Stich,while Sanders directed the brilliant How To Train Your Dragon films) as the composer of this movie. <br/><br/>Now for the bad, the story has been done to death before. The whole overprotective parent,the child or teenager who is always moaning about wanting to be free,falling in love for the first time basically teenage stuff has been done like I said SO MANY TIMES and its a bit of a cliché if you ask me,but still I enjoyed the story too. The ending was a bit of a downer as it ended kinda funny but having said that if you love Ice Age than you will love this film. <br/><br/>For an Oscar Nominated film I give The Croods a 6/10. And out of 5 stars I give it 3 and a half out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>Verdict: Good"
"g-bodyl","9","0","0","29 July 2014"," A Delightful Family-Oriented Movie!
","The Croods is actually a very good, family-pleasing DreamWorks animated film that is better than expected because of a well-written story and some excellent voice acting. Who knew that an animated movie about a bunch of prehistoric people would receive an Oscar nomination. Speaking of the animation, the film is also visually impressive as this should be eye candy for everyone. As for the jokes, some are actually quite funny and most of them do not fall flat.<br/><br/>Kirk De Macco and Chris Sander's film is about a bunch of prehistoric people named the Croods whom do not like to try new things and they spend the majority of their days holed up in a cave. However the daughter, Eep wants to do things and she runs away from home much to her father's, Grug displeasure and she learns about what will happen. But due to a changing world, the family must leave their cave and venture out in the wilderness to begin a new life.<br/><br/>This film has an impressive voice cast. Nicolas Cage finally chooses a good role as of late and does a neat job voicing the concerned, stubborn Grug. Emma Stone shows she can do well in animation as the voice of Eep. Then we have some good voicework from the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, and Cloris Leachman.<br/><br/>Overall, The Croods is much better than anyone could hope for and it's pleasing animated fare for the entire family. The kids will love this, and I think the adults would be pleasantly surprised. Somehow, this film reminds me of Ice Age and I think that is a favorable comparison because I enjoy those films. But thanks to beautiful animation, a good story, excellent voice-acting, and of course from that prehistoric teen angst, we get a very good family film. I rate this film 9/10."

","For some reason i couldn't get into this movie at first, but then I watched it again past the slow beginning, and this movie is really good. <br/><br/>The first love relationship between Guy and Eep is really wonderful. Eep is also a great female character, whoever wrote her deserves an award. She never goes out of her character even though her character is both sweet and courageous at the same time. She is curious, athletic, energetic, amazed by new things, rough around the edges and feisty as well, but never falls into being a cruel jerk a as what is portrayed as being a 'strong woman' is many movies and shows today. Also, this is one of the few beautiful powerfully built female characters I have ever seen in a movie, and Darwyn Cooke's Wonder Woman comes to mind. <br/><br/>Loved the landscapes, flora and fauna as well. Quite well done. <br/><br/>The scene with Douglas learning tricks is so strikingly funny in it's abruptness. Great writing on that. <br/><br/>Additionally the galumphing gait of the cavemen is well done, and the whole of the family dynamic, from the father losing control of his control, and of his daughter to her first love is wonderfully and delicately done. The movie has extremes of subtlety and frenetic action with amazing visuals.<br/><br/>Loved the grandmother, and the fighting between her and Grug, and Nic Cage does a great job with the voice work here. Overall wonderful."

","This film is recommended. <br/><br/>The Croods is the perfect example of what is right and what is wrong with the work coming from today's animation studios: stunning visuals and a so-so story.<br/><br/>The film begins with a wonderful chase sequence that utilizes the best in state-of-the-art computer animation: fluid movement, strong details, and vivid colors. It always entertains in telling its tale of a prehistoric family and their struggles to survive the end of the world. But its predictability and overall cuteness wears thin. Characters are more caricatures and sketchy stereotypes of a typical family: Grug the domineering father,  Ugga the loving mother, Eep the rebellious teenage daughter, Thunk the lunkhead brother, Sandy the pesky youngest sibling, and Gran the dotty grandma.<br/><br/>Once their man-cave is destroyed, they are off on an adventure as they explore the new world disorder. With their journey comes unique surreal creatures and vibrant environments and, of course, a love story as Eep meets that special guy named Guy. But the emphasis is on action, with little time on character development and too much time being spent on each dangerous encounter, followed by another, and then yet another.<br/><br/>Yes, there's lots of running around, avoiding the various exciting obstacles in their way. Interest never lags. Fine voice-over work by Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, and Cloris Leachman add to the fun. The images throughout the film are quite impressive. Were that the thin story would rise to the caliber of visual excellence by its creative team.<br/><br/>Still, any animation fan should see this film for its visual strengths and some sly humor that punctuates this adventure saga. Written and directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders, The Croods is diverting entertainment that the whole family, especially the young pesky ones, will completely enjoy.

"CinemaClown","Null","0","0","25 January 2014"," Incredibly Funny. Immensely Joyful. Deliciously Entertaining.
","An incredibly funny, highly enjoyable, delightfully entertaining & largely satisfying adventure from the talents working at DreamWorks Animation, The Croods is a fun ride for viewers of all ages and while it isn't without its shortcomings, especially in the storytelling department, it's got enough juice in it to be equally hilarious & rewarding for both kids & adults alike.<br/><br/>Set in the prehistoric era, The Croods tells the story of a caveman & his family who have survived the wilderness for years by living together in one place instead of exploring the world around; something which their eldest daughter wants to do. Events are set in motion when their cave is destroyed, following which they embark on a journey to find a new home & are joined by an inventive homo sapien.<br/><br/>Written, produced & directed by Kirk DeMicco & Chris Sanders, The Croods has a splash of everything to succeed as another fine adventure in the famous animation studios' repertoire but when it comes to human drama, it barely scratches the surface of that element. The film does try to take itself a bit seriously near the end but the effect of it isn't much compared to whatever unfolds on the screen before it.<br/><br/>Still, not everything is flawed in this prehistoric setting for those who are looking forward to a fun-filled extravaganza will have a great time with it. Reason for that being the eccentric characters inhabiting the picture, expertly used slapstick humour, a few moments that have a surprising depth to it, its gorgeously rendered animation, fast-paced storyline & the very familial themes which are wonderfully presented.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, while The Croods may not be amongst the best films that DreamWorks Animation has offered us to date, it still makes up for a pretty good light-hearted cinema & is best enjoyed when viewed with whole family. Although the humour does feel a bit forced at times & the characters aren't that well carved out, The Croods still delivers on many scales & is an adventure that wants you to never be afraid of exploring new things. Worth a shot!"

","The characters in The Croods, an animated story of prehistoric humans is a wonderful surprise. The animation is stunning. The human drama is wonderfully comic. The dialog feels true as it covers familiar themes. The voices are performed by A-list actors who do much to make this film a delight. The story line has some unexpected twists, enough to keep you guessing, but the characters keep the movie interesting.<br/><br/>There is an educational aspect to this animated story as is appears to depict life on Earth in prehistory. Some quasi-scientific ideas are illustrated - for example, the idea of adapting to hostile environmental conditions is shown. The main reason to see this movie is its good humor.

","This was a really pleasant surprise! I love computer generated movies in general, but hesitated about a story set in prehistoric times. Why? Not sure really, I guess I just didn't think it could be very interesting. Mind you, I have always had a huge interest in history of any kind. While much of this movie is of course largely pure science fiction, it does get the basics across. In a crude (crood?) way, it paints a picture of how cavemen lived, the dangers they had to endure, and possibly most importantly, that there had to be individuals who were not afraid to try NEW things. Without that adventurous nature by our ancient ancestors, I doubt mankind would exist as we know it now. The graphics are amazing, the storyline is fun and never gets boring. In short, a lot of fun to watch, a kind of a combination between cavemen and modern society. Highly enjoyable for anyone, I would say :)"

","Certainly a feel-good movie, The Croods tells the tale of a Cave Family and their struggle to survive the continental drift. What I found most interesting about this animated film is the fact that, while there was a love interest, that was not the focus of the movie. For me that was a selling point. It is refreshing to see a story in which the main focus is a family connection, more specifically, between a father and daughter. Another great selling point is the animal creations, from meat eating bird flock to a multipurpose sloth, each creature and plant is unique and original. I also have to add how cute I found all of the animals, except maybe the ""Piranhakeets"". Those freaked me out. The relationship between Grug and Eep is one that I think most of us can relate to. A protective father and a rebel teenage daughter is nothing new, but when you add a prehistoric set it definitely seems that way. Furthermore, the ideas of shoes and hugs that Guy and Grug come up with bring a dash of comedy to the movie that I found delightful. The aerial shot of the environment are breath taking, particularly in the way they are so colourful and paradisaic. This movie certainly left me wanting more, and I recommend it to anyone who has not yet watched it. If you like animated movies this is a good one."
"Laakbaar","7","0","0","11 December 2013"," Unpretentious and funny
","The start of the film threw me off. Yes, it is a cartoon for children, but I was initially annoyed by the fact that there was no attempt at verisimilitude at all. The creatures were not realistic. Their world is not realistic. The things these cavemen do is not realistic. I would have preferred a film that at least attempted to show us what the world would have been like for these people.<br/><br/>The movie seems to have been set during the Great Bottleneck that occurred around the Toba disaster. The Crood is a sort of animalistic Neanderthal-like family that learns key lessons from the apparently more evolved Guy.<br/><br/>It bothered me that these cavemen were so....American-sounding, and that they were being used as a vehicle to portray modern American family dynamics.<br/><br/>I suppose this animated movie was meant to be seen on a huge screen in 3D; however, I saw it on a very small screen on an airplane.<br/><br/>Because of these three things I was sorely tempted to switch to a different movie.<br/><br/>However, I stuck it out. Before long I found myself enjoying the comedy, the beauty of some of the animation, and the imaginative portrayal of this ancient world. Cartoons are not supposed to be realistic. Some of the natural scenes depicted reminded me of Avatar. At times the movie is hilarious. This is an unpretentiously fun movie.<br/><br/>It struck me that kids in particular would love this film and its simple message that ""Dad's rules may not always be right but Dad is a good guy who in the end will look out for you"". The other themes are that ""rules are made to be broken"" and ""get out of your cave and explore the world"". Probably a useful message for the internet generation."

","After watching this film with my youngest son, I'd have to say I was happily surprised at how good this DreamWorks picture was. Although the beginning starts out slow without much content except learning that the cave is a protective crutch for the Crood family. Once the story starts to flow with Eep meeting Guy and his companion/clothes accessory, Belt, the action stays at a great pace throughout. It has a lively, humorous rendering of how the words and items we use everyday got their name. The film also gives the viewer feel-good, heart-warming feelings that come standard with any ""family movie"" these days. From seeing a family's struggle for survival, to empathizing with their meager, unhappy existence, to applauding their eventual overcoming of fear, it all makes for an enjoyable film to see."
"redeye90007","6","0","0","5 December 2013"," Loved the animals!
","As expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.<br/><br/>Like other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer."

","The Croods is a great comedy and adventurous family movie. It is a simple story, but is filled with life lessons and values like knowing that family is important and team work is also important to be able to accomplish different tasks. The characters in this movie are enjoyable and relatable to people.<br/><br/>This caveman family was forced to move out of their cave after the world begins to end. Grug is the over protective dad that wants nothing, but to keep his family safe and out of harms way. Eep is his daughter; she is a free spirit, curious, and outgoing. His wife Ugga, son Thunk, other daughter, and mother in law Gran are not very important, but are funny. As they move along on their adventure to find a new cave they come across a nomad named Guy. Guy is imaginative, creative, and full of new ideas. Guy helps the family learn to not be afraid of the world and to not be afraid of trying or learning new things. He has a furry little animal with him named Belt that resembles a sloth.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the family grows closer together. It teaches them to accept new things and also goes through some evolution.<br/><br/>The animation and graphics in this movie were beautifully put together.<br/><br/>Overall this was a fun family movie to watch. I wouldn't mind watching this several times with my son. My son absolutely loved this movie."

","I didn't expect much going into this movie. I feel that it was sort of overshadowed by the large summer blockbuster releases. I vaguely remember the trailer advertising it as a cave man family vacation. It was however more than that. It sort of went under the radar, and I think that works to its advantage. Some of the scenes of the forest were very reminiscent of Avatar, with bright colours and interesting creatures. Although the ending and end credits song were very upbeat and happy. (End credit song is very catchy in the way that Tarzan songs were catchy). There was one dark moment that truly stands out, when Grug is left by himself in the cave and paints his family in a circle of his outstretched arms. If this was a dark and macabre film, they could have ended Grug's story at that point and faced the ire of angry parents and fans. However, I do prefer the happier route that the director chose. As well, the action scenes were actually very exciting and intense. You really can't go wrong with Nicholas Cage as your lead voice actor, and his characteristic talking style adds to the story. Overall, give this movie a shot and sit back and just take it all in."

","The Croods, a name most bizarre to be given as a title of a movie, but the content, just fantastic! I may even add to say that Dreamworks has lived up to its expectations in delivering exceptionally amazing animated movies and their latest release, The Croods is no exception. The story begins by introducing us to a rather diverse family of a couple, their three children and an old grandmother(who just wouldn't die) and setting is a prehistoric age where they are supposedly the only living humans. The movie then goes on to bring an extra character just named ""Guy"" and his sidekick Belt(an animal) who goes on to proclaim that the end of the world is near and their only hope for survival was to aim for the mountains far ahead. A simple plot it seems no doubt, but the way the movie was crafted was just fantastic and if that wasn't enough, you might actually find yourself laughing a couple of times no matter what age you might be of. There might be many movies out there to be watched but ""The Croods"" is a film which is guaranteed to be enjoyed. It might not be the best film out there, but it certainly is a great one which has its own comedic and adventurous moments, a movie for the whole family out there and to all those who prefer watching it in 3-D, the effects are seriously good in this film and your choice would be a valid one"

","When I watch an animated movie like this one I try to identify the voices without knowing the cast. It took me a while, discarding Tom Hanks and Owen Wilson, finally recognizing the distinctive voice of Nicolas Cage. He is arguably the main character, the over-protective dad, Grug, in this animated movie about a prehistoric family. They apparently stay in their cave, with a boulder protecting the entrance. Only Grug is strong enough to move it.<br/><br/>All this doesn't sit well with the strong-willed daughter, Emma Stone as Eep, who often goes off by herself, and sometimes explores high cliffs without dad's permission.<br/><br/>One day she is stumped when she encounters a boy, Ryan Reynolds as Guy. But they eventually manage to become friends but when the rest of the family meets him they go a bit crazy. They are afraid of anything new or different. So much of the story is that theme, learning to accept new things, and to explore a bit instead of being so afraid that you stay in your cave until you are so hungry that you have to get out to find food.<br/><br/>But Guy also brings news that the world they all know is about to be destroyed, and they will have to find a new land. Other interesting characters are Catherine Keener as the mom, Ugga. Cloris Leachman as the old grandmother, Gran.<br/><br/>It is just a cool animated movie. There is a bare thread of a ""message"" about getting out of your cave, your safety zone, to live life instead of just waiting to die.

","I delinquently start my first review of an animated movie meant for kids, feel like criticizing a three year old for writing a poem with spelling mistakes. I wish this critique is particularly read by the children who are under 13.<br/><br/>The Croods by DreamWorks Animation is a 3-D animated disaster movie, co- directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders. Voiced by some of the leading stars like Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, and Ryan Reynolds the movie becomes even more lively. The film raises curiosity as it has been directed by Chris Sanders who made the critically acclaimed animated feature ""How to Train Your Dragon"". Eventually all his directorial ventures has a co-director and he has co-written with each of them.<br/><br/>This movie set in the pre-historic era is about The Croods, the last of cavemen who've survived all the catastrophes just by staying within a cave and how they turn to be the first modern family of a new era. They are a family of six lead by an overprotective dad Grug (Nicholas Cage). We have Eep the daughter who is chunky and one cannot digest the fact that Emma Stone has given the voice for her. One day Eep meets a scrawny boy called Guy (Ryan Renolds) who tells her about the end of the world, which he very fittingly calls ""The End"". The crux of the story happens when the family meets Guy and how he takes them on an exodus to the land of tomorrow.<br/><br/>The landscape which The Croods pass by is like Pandora without the fifty shades of blue. The animals in the movie makes one think which weird cross breeding would have created them. An elephantish rat, a mammoth with the skin texture of a giraffe, a bat with pig's face and I let you to imagine the rest. The most adorable creature will be Belt (Chris Sanders) who is Guy's pet, navigator, and belt (Yeah that's how he got the name), you should listen to him saying ""Dan dan daaaah"" which means ""The End"" in his language.<br/><br/>Grug's a strong man who's in charge of the safety of the family and at the same time he likes to see his mother-in-law dead. He's the last of the surviving cavemen and who lives to save his clan by keeping themselves away from calamities. Eep the daughter is always fascinated by new stuffs while the entire family believes anything new is dangerous. Guy the hippie is actually a brainy boy who along with his sidekick Belt comes with new ideas at the time of danger. The rest of the cast add to the fun here and there, among them the Gran (Mom-in-law) and Sandy (Younger daughter) are to be specifically mentioned.<br/><br/>We all love movies which involves a journey, don't we ? Similarly this is like the coolest disaster movie one would witness with a plethora of scenes to keep you interested. Though the script is sloppy with illogical and clichéd scenes, the comedy saves it from a drag, specially when all the animals close their ears when they couldn't bear the chatter of the cavies passing by the forest, even the subtlest of comedies will leave one chuckling. As an adult if you let your inner child to experience the movie you'll have a fun time lost in the Chug, I name it because it rhymes with Grug (Watch the movie to know about it ;))"

It had a lot of my favorite actors such as Nicolas Cage, Cloris Leechman, and Emma Stone. I think they all did a fabulous job as the characters.

","I went into this one with very little expectations. I thought it would be mildly entertaining but a movie geared less towards the family experience (like a Pixar movie) and more towards the kids. However, it proved to be really fun.<br/><br/>The animation is great and the character designs are fun--although it took a little getting used to as the story takes place in a fictional era of history with creatures that exist only in the minds of animators and artist but, once I accepted this fact, I found myself completely immersed in the film.<br/><br/>The voice acting is great in the film as each actor really brings life to their character and seemed almost perfect for their roles. Special mention must go out to Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds and Nic Cage because each really delivered. Especially Cage. We known that guy for his unique form of overacting but he really brought his A-game to this one as the patriarch to the Crood family.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Croods"" is just a great family movie that adults and kids can enjoy.

I never thought the Nicolas Case suit for an animation character, I am surprised, he was the best and his voice perfectly synced with one.<br/><br/>According to the movie everything were not logic in the movie and one should not be bothered about it. The species that comes in the movie were fused with each other and kinda worked for the story. The movie was simply enjoyable, I had so much fun, the Crood family was awesome. The story was very simple, it was all about adventurous journey of a family to escape the disaster.<br/><br/>You know teenage daughter and her over caring father never compromise for anything in life. In this movie they always fight each others, one of parenting rights and other for the freedom to experience new stuffs. Like most of the story, boy meets girl here too two young people meet but kinda fairly avoided the romance. Of course there will be always one geek brother and a annoying little sister and a disgusting granny and a mother who always listens to her hubby.<br/><br/>In those I have seen 2013s animated movies it was the best pick, many are yet to release.

","The DreamWorks Animation this time seems to want to go beyond itself in order to succeed and has invented prehistoric era full of references to the current one without aping ""The Flintstones"".<br/><br/>The Croods family consists of six members living in the last Stone Age family. They live in a cave and exit only in daylight, because in the darkness, it hides too much risk. The rebellious teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) hates life behind the stones and therefore opposes one night her father Grug's (Nicolas Cage) instructions. She leaves the cave and meets the Guy (Ryan Reynolds), a boy of the same age who can make fire. She learns that the earth will soon be destroyed and you can still find survival only in the direction of the sun from him. Shortly after-wards the Cave of the Croods is destroyed, they have no choice but to find a new home.<br/><br/>Together with Guy they embark on a journey into the unknown and witness for the first time the world outside their stone dwelling. It goes through a colorful landscape, peppered with never seen before fanciful animals and many adventures. Only Papa Grug has a problem with the Guys because he has many ideas and innovation which overshadow Grug, but it eventually, it is replaced by Guy as a leader. However, sometimes we sense the personal feelings queued up in order to survive.<br/><br/>We all know that every woman loves shoes. But it is heavenly to see how the Stone Eep girls can enjoy their first pair of boots and when it is handmade by a smart boy of the same age. What women want? The prehistoric 3D animated film The Croods is made by DreamWorks and directed by Christopher Sanders (How to Train Your Dragon) and Kirk DeMicco (Quest for Camelot). The animated adventure shows, just like the predecessor from the think tank of DreamWorks (Shrek, Madagascar, it again are the big ideas of the makers not only in inventing stories, but also in the creation of fantastic worlds and whimsical characters.<br/><br/>The story is not only about survival, but about life, relationships and the experience of life with all its adventures. In the foreground of course there is a family and their lovable characters that are not always dissimilar to our own, with all their idiosyncrasies and quirks. So in the Stone Age too, one has to deal with adolescent problems, or catty granny. But it's also the way for each other to cohesion, mutual aid and taking responsibility for intelligence and the beginning of civilization. Lots of nice ideas, sloping figures and lovable animals like piranhas or a feathered rainbow colored giants cat à la Alice in Wonderland there is to admire. Many brightly colored scenes reminiscent of the immersion in the alien world of Avatar. With all the vividness of the film we sometimes surprised by the absolute silence, which is rather unusual for an animated film.<br/><br/>It really is great fun to watch the Croods with all its endearing quirks and their whimsical environment in which they are looking for a new home.

","Actually, the eponymous family in Dreamworks' ""The Croods"" doesn't really have all that much in common with the Flintstones. For example, they don't have the Flintstones' primitive technological conveniences like the Flintmobile. The Croods don't even have primitive weapons like spears and clubs, and sometimes they even run on all fours like gorillas or chimpanzees. What's worse, they live in an otherworldly, dangerous prehistoric environment that makes ""Jumanji"" look like a petting zoo. Therefore, in a way, you really can't blame burly Crood father/leader Grug (voice of Nicolas Cage) for being maniacally preoccupied with keeping his family safe.<br/><br/>This bunch of pre-Neanderthals - Grug's wife Ugga (voice of Catherine Keener), slow-witted and klutzy middle son Thunk (Clark Duke), fierce and animalistic toddler daughter Sandy (voice of Randy Thom), caustic Gran (voice of Cloris Leachman), and especially independent-minded elder daughter Eep (voice of Emma Stone) - are all agile, swift and strong fighters. Even so, the Croods are so cautious and fearful that they venture out into the wild only long enough to forage for food (as in the energetic keep-away/football game they play with a wild bird-type to capture its egg toward the film's start). Then, it's off to the safety of the cave, with a boulder door to keep the beasts out. Following Grug's motto of ""Life is fear, all the time"", the family even sleeps curled up in a ball for mutual safety. Except for teenage daughter Eep, who increasingly resents her family's lack of daring, curiosity, and eagerness to explore and learn.<br/><br/>One night, breaking curfew, Eep literally runs into a good-looking Cro-Magnon type named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and his all-purpose miniature sloth Belt (voice of Chris Sanders). Though somewhat inferior to Eep in power and athletic prowess, Guy is inventive, self-reliant, and keen on learning new things. All of Guy's qualities attract Eep to him, although Guy is a bit put-off by Eep's rough and yes, crude, manner. But Guy really doesn't have a choice; Eep brings Guy to meet the fam, who manage to appall Guy even more. Grug is equally unimpressed and a bit wary of Guy in turn, not only because of a budding relationship with Eep, but also because Guy's intelligent and adventuresome boldness reflects badly on Grug's ignorant timidity. Taken aback, Guy at first tries to leave.<br/><br/>But natural, seismic upheavals and the terrain change caused by Pangea's splintering force Guy and the Croods to work together to cross the treacherous landscape to find a new home. Can Guy's ideas and experience coupled with the Croods' brawn and agility get them through? Can Grug surmount his shortcomings to help his family get through? Will Grug realize - as Eep and Guy do - that courage as well as exposure to new ideas will help them not only survive, but also prosper? ""The Croods"" answers these questions with an unexpected blend of knockabout slapstick, sharp but not harsh verbal humor (not even the death fantasies Grug harbors for his mother-in law Gran), and relevant life lessons about survival, facing your inhibitions, maturing, using both strength and intelligence to move ahead and expand your horizons. Therefore, ""The Croods"" will probably enthrall all family members, from fidgety toddlers to thoughtful, sophisticated adults, as they watch the Croods, especially stick-in-the-mud Grug, tackle the challenge of evolution in all senses of the word."

","In an alternative world just like ours where you discover piranha birds, saber rabbits, mouse elephants and bunch of other hybrid animals; we are familiarized to a Stone Age family called the Croods. Clouded in judgment from their ignorance and fear of the unknown outside their cave, the Croods follow one simple rule ""Never not be afraid"". Abruptly one day their life is flung into complete disarray as their safe haven is shattered and everything they know is tossed out of the window as they are forced to venture into stunning unfamiliar land.<br/><br/>Directed, written and screenplay by Kirk De Micco (Space Chimps) and Chris Sanders (How to Train a Dragon, Lion King); 'The Croods' never surpassed my 'This is going to be an average film' expectations when I'd first seen the trailer. Expectations didn't get any better as you are introduced to the characters and a bit of the story via a voice over narration that spelled 'Seen-it-before' in my head. What happened next did come off as a bit of a surprised as the film managed to rise above its cliché story and to certain extend its characters to take you on a joyful ride through a family's journey in peril and happiness.<br/><br/>Grug (voiced by Nicolas Cage) is the overprotective father trying to protect his family from peril. Be it darkness or curiosity; everything leads to immediate death as depicted by him in every story he tells. You feel for him as he falters to lead his family to safety while comes across situations he can't muscle his way out of. The true protagonist of the film, the familiarity of the voice of Nicolas Cage brings further allows you to delve yourself into the character. Eep (voiced by Emma Stone) is the daughter bursting with curiosity about what lies beyond the cave. She shares a fantastic chemistry with her father as she struggles to break free of his rules. It was refreshing to see a clear exit from the usual character design that you expect in animated films when it comes to the leading lady.<br/><br/>Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) who plays Eep's love interest comes across as the more sophisticated human by using (what he calls) the brain. Along with his pet Belt (who also happens to hold his pants up if you were wondering), he wanders the world on his own in search of tomorrow through his resourcefulness and ideas. The charming gooey eyed character is the basis for a lot of laughs. Gran (voice by Cloris Leachman) and Thunk (voice by Clark Duke) are a constant source of laughs while Ugga (voice by Catherine Keener) does her bit as a supporting wife to Grug. All the characters fit in perfectly complementing each other as and when required without creating any unnecessary havoc.<br/><br/>The Animation is brilliant as expected from the DreamsWorks film. With most of the humor of the physical kind the character design has an outwardly bulky and indestructible that works well in the context of the film. The camera work is smooth and does everything right to capture the hits and misses of the families journey.<br/><br/>The Croods is not going to match the heights of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" but it's the kind of film that you would enjoy with the whole family."

","The Croods is a story about one of the last surviving prehistoric families that embark on a road trip looking for a new cave when their old cave is destroyed as the earth is going through many dramatic changes. If that wasn't enough for the Crood family to deal with, there is the father/daughter struggles throughout the storyline that any parent can relate to if they have had teenagers, especially daughters.<br/><br/>When the Croods daughter, Eep, can't understand her Dad's mentality that ""fear is good; change is bad"" and having to live by his number one rule ""never leave the cave"" she starts to rebel and pushes the boundaries set by her Dad, the over-protective, Grug. One of the characters I got a kick out of was Gran who is their wisecracking grandma who Grug is constantly hoping that she won't make it through their daily challenges. The rest of the Crood family includes Mom, younger brother and baby sister which are more or less ""extras"" to round out the family dynamic. On their journey to find a new cave, they meet Guy who has evolved a lot further then the Croods with his ability to make fire and shoes and his pet sloth who doubles as Guy's utility belt. Together they join in their journey in finding a new place to live, which Eep is desperately hoping won't be another cave.<br/><br/>I will admit that there were several moments that the movie was very predictable and the story line could have been a bit better.

",". . . and any of those live action movies with Brendan Frazier and animals (prehistoric or modern). THE CROODS is a quite watchable flick for moms and kids, with enough plot twists and turns thrown in to keep moms guessing and enough cute animals (such as the initially scary and eventually domesticated saber toothed tiger) jumbled on-screen to rivet the attention of the littler offspring. While it is true that Nicolas Cage as dad Grug is pretty much a stereotype as an over-protective, over-traditional father, the sense of imminent danger that a similar dad has in say FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is pretty much absent here, as composer Alan Silvestri's upbeat score sort of lets every movie veteran know that nothing REALLY bad is going to occur. There are a few wrinkles the writers have dreamed up, such as the method Grug and Guy manufacture to escape the clutches of the dread tar pit, which seemingly are beyond the limits of imagination for the out-of-ideas ICE AGE screenwriters.

"kcastro3","9","0","0","5 May 2013"," ""Crood"", But Definitely Not ""Crude""
","""The Croods"" is a Dreamworks animated film about a dysfunctional prehistoric family fighting to live to tomorrow. The all-star cast includes Nicholas Cage as the extremely overprotective father, Emma Stone as the angsty teenage daughter, Ryan Reynolds as the mysterious and handsome dreamer, and Cloris Leachman as the crazy old granny. Combining humor, heart, and wit this epitomizes the picturesque family film. <br/><br/>I'm just going to start off with the comment that'll show my presumptuous liberal arts education to get it out of the way. For a good majority of the film there are two reoccurring pieces: the cave that keeps them safe from the outside world and the newly devised toolfire. The father, Grug, made the family spend day after day in the cave in order to protect them from the creatures and dangers of the outside world. To the family it was totally fine, because that was all they knew. Then this good-looking drifter appears, Guy, with his tangible sun (fire) and explains to them that there is more to the life they are living (the promise of tomorrow). Is this a reference to Plato's Allegory of the Cave? I cannot be the only person to make this connection Alas I have nothing insightful to add here except to say that if the screenwriter and creators of the film had Plato's Allegory in mind when writing this they are going far beyond any children's movie I've seen. Bravo!<br/><br/>The basis of the plot, although not entirely innovative, was rather creative. Whenever writers pen an other worldly story they have the ability to create whatever fantastical and imaginative universe they want. This prehistoric realm was truly impressive. Carnivorous birds. Land whales. Moving greenery. And without a great animation team this world would fall flat. Thankfully the art was majestic, entrancing, and magical. Every piece fell seamlessly into place manifesting this marvelous land of wonder. <br/><br/>The true story has much less to do with the prehistoric backdrop, and more to do with the family that is living in it. It just proves that families were insane and oppositional from the beginning of time. Without exposing too much of the film, there are very profound family centric values that are explored. An overbearing father who will do anything to protect his family. A daughter that is completely embarrassed of her family and still wholly loves them. Many animated films attempt to reach this profundity and fall short. These writers, however, did an inexplicable job at adding such depth to the story that even my salty and bleak heart ached. <br/><br/>I don't know if there will ever be a way to explain how affected I was by this film. Visually it was beautiful. The story went far beyond miniscule themes of ""be kind"" and ""love one another"" to a plane of tenets that are difficult to grapple even as an adult. And on top of all of this it was rather funny. Don't let the title mislead you. This film is far from crude."

I was surprised by how much I cared for all of the people in this film. I wanted this family to come together and overcome their difficulties. I was not let down and honestly, I cried out of happiness at the end. The first time that has happened in a very long time.. <br/><br/>OK, I like sentimental films that work. and this film works. It takes you into a truly make believe world and makes you believe. The father is a warm and truly stubborn fellow who we learn to love as he deals with the rest of the family on its dangerous journey.The mom is strong and loving in her way and, the daughter has her own kind independence as teenage daughters do..So over time, we learn to care about the group in the same way that we cared about the troop of travelers in ""Land Before Time."" But this is much sharper and the characters have more depth and there is more comedy than the ""Land"". Also, because it is a journey with humans and a family we really like, our journey becomes more personal. We meet up with a new person who we also learn to care about and wish him success too. And we like the pets, yes pets.... And I will close by saying this: Croods is a very rare warm, entertaining and loving family film. And watching it is outstanding way to spend time with people you love...<br/><br/>For that is what this film is really about."

"3xHCCH","8","0","0","7 April 2013"," A Touching Ode to Fatherhood
","I honestly did not want to watch ""The Croods."" The ugly title and the crude way the characters were drawn did not really appeal to me. I kept trying to defer it when my kids were asking to watch it. Well, for a lazy Sunday afternoon at the mall like today with nothing specific to do, there was no more excuse or escape for this dad to delay the inevitable.<br/><br/>""The Croods"" was about the last Neanderthal caveman family on Earth who were forced to get out of the cave that had kept them safe all these years when the mountains around them began to crumble down. With the help of a young inventive caveman named Guy, they follow the sun and venture into the big wide unknown, seeking to escape the destruction of the world they knew. On this journey, the Crood patriarch Grug faces his biggest dilemma as a father when his established way of keeping his family together and safe is challenged by the ""modern"" ideas of Guy, as well as the shifting continental land masses.<br/><br/>It took time for me to get into the groove of the story. The superhuman abilities of the Croods as well as the incredibly strange flora and fauna around them were simply too unbelievable and weird. Once I got that initial resistance out of the way, I not only had a very good time laughing at their hilarious antics, I was also very personally touched by the situation experienced by Grug as head of his family, now facing the ultimate threat for their very existence.<br/><br/>The technical excellence of this film is unquestionable. OK, I did not really like how the Croods looked, but hey they ARE cavemen anyhow. However the artwork and cinematography of the world around them was breathtaking. The visual effects, grand or minute, dealing with water, or dust, or tar were so realistic. The voice work by Nicolas Cage for Grug is so good, gruff but sincere. Emma Stone as the rebellious daughter Eep, Ryan Reynolds as Guy and Ms. Cloris Leachman as the grandmother also turn in remarkable work. <br/><br/>Like several Dreamworks animated films before this one, namely ""Shrek"", ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""Megamind"", I was initially turned off by the non-traditional, OK non-Disney, looks of the artwork. But after hearing much positive word of mouth, I gave them a chance and watched them. Of course, I appreciate them as the excellent films that they are. I now add ""The Croods"" to that list. I should really learn my lesson and stop judging them by the way they look in the trailer."
"thiu","8","0","0","5 April 2013"," Good Dreamworks Movie
","This was a fun movie to watch where you will not get bored from beginning until the end. It reminded me a lot of Land Before Time movie but less sophisticated. <br/><br/>The voice actors are perfect especially Nicholas Cage, his talents are really underutilized. He captured the character's internal struggle to evolve and change with the times. It's really great that not only did he in the end embrace change but also experimented with creating new things and not just depend on Guy to do everything. I think it was a great reminder to us that we have forgotten how to be curious and be amazed about how new things come to us. Instead we keep expecting more and get disappointed when Apple does deliver new techs as we expect them to. :) <br/><br/>Finally a great Dreamworks film with the exception of How to Train your Dragon, and no wonder the creators of Croods and How to Train are the same! hahahaa"
"dunga2000","8","0","0","4 April 2013"," Surprisingly close to home...
","I took my 4 year-old for his birthday, hoping it would be the first theatrical experience he would make it all the way through (previous attempts included Megamind, Madagascar 3). It was a success, and all three of our attending generations thought the movie was pretty darn good. Grug the patriarch reminded me of myself, so presumably there are many fathers out there who feel the same. Misery loves company I guess. I thought the casting was spot on, except Nicolas Cage as Grug. The voice just didn't quite fit. My only other issue was with the more fantastical nature of the prehistoric beasts. I imagine the producers wanted to separate this film from any Ice Age comparisons. And the crazy creatures were definitely well done and fun. But I don't agree with the choice to go that route. First off, people are gonna compare the two films regardless. Second, this one seems to be taking more inspiration from Avatar. Are these early humans on an otherwise alien world? I would've preferred they stick to our existing ideas of pre-history. That said, the criticism isn't enough to wreck an otherwise successful family movie. The animation and special fx have reached yet another level of quality beyond recent previous achievements. We watched the first Toy Story later that night, and it seemed amazingly primitive in comparison. And the story hits home for sure... Highly recommended!"

Throughout the film I felt as if I was constantly competing - who would laugh louder, the group of children a couple of rows down, the old-aged couple tucked away in the corner, or my girlfriend and I?<br/><br/>10 out of 10 as an animation; a comedy; a family film."

All I can say is this film is hilarious and charming! I don't think this movie is appropriate for children under 7 because it's a pretty strong story that the kiddies won't understand. I hate it when they make such movies into a children's medium (which I find insulting and annoying). Another thing I like about this movie is that the wonderful Cloris Leachman takes a stand to play the Grandma ""Gran!"" Nicolas Cage+Grug=stupid funny (in a good way)! The only character I find annoying is the baby girl Sandy, she is too hideous! One thing that I disliked about the movie was the story was a bit too long to tell.

"reneemsm","9","0","0","2 April 2013"," MUST see it in 3D!!
","In the last 5 or so years, we've taken our kids to see a lot of 3D animation movies. None of which they really cared for (the 3D part, anyway). So usually when I ask them if they want to see something in 3D or ""regular"" they choose ""regular"". Today happened to be our last day of spring break and they only had one showing of The Croods during the day...which was in 3D. So I figured we'd give it a shot and hope for the best. I am SOOOO glad we did. This is the first time that I honestly feel the 3D really added a LOT to the movie. Generally I just find it to be an annoyance (wearing the glasses and keeping the kids from touching theirs with buttery popcorn fingers) with a few ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" thrown in. But I honestly can't imagine seeing this any way other than in 3D (we'll probably buy it and it just won't be the same at home). There were so many times that my kids and all the ones around us were reaching out to grab things or ducking from things and I'm not gonna lie, I had to stop myself once or twice. I had never seen people react that way before other than Avatar.<br/><br/>As far as the movie itself goes, we really enjoyed it. The plot was easy for the kids to follow and kept everyone interested. We laughed through the whole thing and were utterly mesmerized by the colors and the whole experience of this other world on the screen. The scene with the water honestly made me want to jump in through the screen with them. There were also a few times where my eyes were tearing up and I'd look over and my 8 yr old daughter was too (I like when they throw in a little sensitivity). It's a great movie for dads and daughters and I was really kind of sad that we went when my husband was at work. All 3 of my kids (4, 6 & 8) loved it and kept thanking me for taking them to see it. The only other time they were that in love with a movie was Brave. There were maybe 1 or 2 times in the movie that I felt sort of ""meh"" about, but the rest of the movie more than made up for it. I'm actually kind of hoping they make a second one and that's saying something because I usually HATE sequels. All in all, I would highly recommend this movie to families looking for a fun couple of hours."

","I actually loved the trailers and couldn't wait to see this movie. Though in the past many trailers have been top notch but the movie just didn't match up. Well in the case of the Croods, the trailers were nice but the movie was just a great, brilliant and amazing feat.<br/><br/>The animation quality is brilliant, excellent animation that is enchanting and magical. The story very moving and heartfelt and had some really emotional and moving scenes handled very intelligently. The characters are endearing and you just can't help but love them all, absolutely lovable. This action packed adventure is just an epic and thrilling ride GUARANTEED to keep you (child and adult) at the edge of your seat. Breathtaking visuals and heart racing scenes. An adventure of a lifetime is all i can say. Spectacular and fun. The entire family dynamic of The Croods is so amazingly portrayed and extremely ratable. With educational snippets guaranteed to get kids interested in topics such as plate tectonics and continental shift and drift etc. And many heartwarming and yet smartly handled lessons to be learned along the way. What a great film.<br/><br/>Now for the humor. It is brilliant, smart humor that will have you in stitches. I have not laughed that hard in a long long time. I laughed until i cried and no i am not exaggerating. The entire theater was in stitches booming with laughter. It was just great fun. The child in the row ahead of me commented to his mother how he was loving this amazing movie to which his mother replied that she too thought it was awesome! The college kids who came as a group were in hysterics and seemed to enjoy this movie just as much. Even a grandmother who sat next to me couldn't control herself and was enjoying this great family film with the rest of us. To put it plainly, the whole family will love it. It is the perfect family movie: smart, hilarious, sweet and emotional. And whats great is you will enjoy it even if you go on your own. So many individuals came to watch it on their own and they enjoyed it as much as the families did. Usually many comedy movies will have a chuckle here and there but this one had myself and the rest of the audience in fits of uncontrollable laughter from start till finish. One of those films where time just flies by and since you are thoroughly enjoying yourself, you just don't notice the time pass.<br/><br/>GREAT WORK DREAMWORKS! They really are stepping it up as of late. ROTG was fantastic and now this film is carrying on the trend of brilliant animated films. Looking forward Dreamworks Studios next endeavor and if this film is anything to go by, i see many more great films ahead from this studio.<br/><br/>Though if you are dumbed down and go for films which are historically accurate because you are too lazy to do the research on your own or have no imagination and are incapable of appreciating great fiction, well you can skip it."

","The animation was spectacular and breath taking in some parts but the animals they used didn't make it feel like it was the stone age. There was some funny bits but it felt like they where too far apart to keep it interesting. And some where a little too bit adult for the young audience it was targeting. I took my 2.8 year old and she got bored with it half way through and usually if its a good movie she will be glued to it from start to finish. I did feel like it dragged on for too long. As soon as the credits rolled we rushed out the door but usually we would stay in case there was an extra. That to me says a lot about the movie"
"professor-x","4","5","16","29 March 2013"," Stay in your cave, unless you want to get out!
","The Croods was fun to watch, and teaches kids to take risks while instilling reasonable family values along the way. There are many great laughable family moments; but, if you stop and think about what's actually going on, there is little purpose to the characters journey. I'm not a huge fan of Dreamworks storytelling, but this is definitely their worst story.<br/><br/>As always, the visuals were risky, hit and miss. Initially, I thought that the characters were very ugly, but after five minutes of seeing them on screen, I was able to enjoy their expressiveness. I had a similar experience with PIXAR's UP... the characters were so weird, but when the acting started, things were fine.<br/><br/>All of the animals in the film felt like they were inspired by an acid trip with Dali inside of an 80s airbrush painting. The wild elements were always interesting, but not the best quality.<br/><br/>So again, there are lots of unique interesting scenes and creatures here, but it all seems a little unfocused and half realized. There are TONs of great special effects in this animated feature, so if you like nature on a big scale, this might be something for you to focus on while kids enjoy the goofy antics of cave people.<br/><br/>If you have nothing better to do, get out of your cave and see this one!"

","It's Easter and there's a slew of films to distract your children. If they're very young and you're desperate the current animation, The Croods may get you though 90 minutes of the school break.<br/><br/>To be fair, the old man who sat across the aisle from me with his grandchildren bellowed with laughter for much of it. However, he was in the minority (of one) and I'm sure I saw him dribbling. Conversely, my five-year old nephew sat virtually silently throughout and spent some of it with his head on my shoulder. Trust me, he's a great deal more animated every single time he watches Monsters Inc. and the Toy Story canon. I reckon that just about sums up The Croods.<br/><br/>The Croods is 'nice' but there's nothing magical or even particularly memorable about it other than it's one of the few films involving Nicholas Cage where he doesn't SHOUT AT US THE WHOLE TIME.<br/><br/>After their cave is destroyed, the reluctant Grug (rhymes with slug, hug, bug and any other damn thing the writers can squeeze into the script in their search for a shallow smile) leads his family of cave dwellers out of their dark world into an exciting, colourful land with the object of his daughter's affection, Guy (Ryan Reynolds).<br/><br/>That's not just the introduction; that's pretty much it. Grug doesn't think much of his mother-in-law; his son, Thunk (Clark Duke), is a dunce; his daughter, Eep (Emma Stone), wants adventure; and his wife, Ugga (Katherine Keener) is long-suffering. Oh, he has a baby that's more of an animal that the creatures they encounter.<br/><br/>There are some pretty moments as the world opens up to them (in a diluted Avatar kind of way), some mild humour, courtesy of a Sloth called Belt and his one, repetitive joke, and a few moments of insipid danger.<br/><br/>The emotion is slight, the lessons heavy-handed, obvious and simplistic enough for even the youngest of children to grasp: hiding in darkness bad, walking towards light good, sometimes dad being boring is best. Blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>Don't bother unless you're desperate. But if you are desperate, take a strong coffee and use the time to learn to knit.<br/><br/>Better still, take the children out for a long trudge through the woods or a game of rounders and save the cinema treat for Monsters University.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

"estebangonzalez10","5","2","5","30 October 2013"," Lack of creativity
","""Anything new is bad. Curiosity is bad. Going out at night is bad. Basically, anything fun is bad. Welcome to my world! But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.""<br/><br/>The Croods is one of those animated films that kids will love, but adults will barely find amusing. Kids will pretty much enjoy anything, even co-director Kirk De Micco's previous film Space Chimps. I on the other hand was completely disappointed with this film considering the other co-director involved here was Chris Sanders, who brought us the highly acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon (now that is a sequel I'm really looking forward to). I didn't have a problem with the visuals here, because they were great, but my major issue with this film had to do with the story. The Croods suffers from a completely formulaic narrative where you have the young daughter wanting to go out and experiencing life, while the over protective father doesn't allow it. Last year's Pixar film, Brave, dealt with this very same issue and I personally feel a bit tired of it. These animated films have a history of putting up children against their parents and always giving them the reason. Usually it's the parent that has to change his ways and learn the lesson from their younger child. I understand that this is what is appealing to kids, but pretty much every film targeted towards them is appealing (they won't even hesitate to watch The Smurfs movies again). I am used to these clichéd stories and usually forgive them if the film has clever characters with funny dialogues, but The Croods has neither. I don't remember laughing at any scene, and I don't think any of these characters is really memorable.<br/><br/>The story focuses on a family of cavemen whose patriarch, Grug (Nicolas Cage) has kept everyone safe thanks to his extreme rules. He has shielded them from the outside world and kept them inside the cave for most of their lives, only abandoning the cave to collect some food for a few minutes every three or four days. Grug lives with his partner Ugga (Catherine Keener) and her mother Gran (Cloris Leachman). They have two kids: Eep (Emma Stone) and Thunk (Clark Duke), and a young baby. Everyone seems content with Grug's rules, except for Eep who is desperate to explore the outside world. One night after following a strange light out of her cave she runs into a nomad named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who has discovered how to make fire. Guy is an inventive individual who has managed to survive in the outside world on his own. He warns Eep that the world is coming to an end and that they should head to the high lands. When Grug sees that Eep is missing they immediately go find her and bring her back to the cave, but before they can arrive Guy's predictions come true. Now the entire family will have to embark on a journey with Guy and discover a whole new world while facing the threats in the outdoors.<br/><br/>There are several interesting action scenes in The Croods and some beautiful visuals (although nothing as near as beautiful as Pixar's Brave) as they explore and are in awe of this new world. None of the characters here are developed very well and most of the film centers around Grug and Eep. The story does begin to pick up with the introduction of Guy who reminds us of the power of new ideas and the importance of being creative. Unfortunately the film isn't creative with its narrative and that is what left me disappointed. The vocals here were done pretty well with Nicolas Cage, Ryan Reynolds, and Emma Stone standing out mostly because their characters are basically the only ones who have much screen time. The Croods isn't a film the entire family will enjoy, but I am sure the kids will have a blast because it involves outdoor exploration and has plenty of action. I was expecting this film to be a lot funnier, but nothing really stands out."
"dmurilloroman","7","2","5","22 March 2013"," ""I'm a....... Caveman!""
","The Croods, a film with extreme slapstick humor and a solid idea that wasn't completely executed all that correctly. In the first 15 minutes it started pretty slow yet this film always keeps the kids laughing from start to end. The animation was surprisingly ahead of its time with amazing shots throughout. It picks up pretty soon mostly with Emma Stone's character who I believed I was going to hate but ended up endearing. The characters journey isn't as ""epic"" as I was led to believe but definitely not as dreadful. Each character has some actual range obviously in the humor scale but surprisingly in the dramatic one as well. All of the creatures and setting are beautiful/realistic with extreme creativity but there could have been more creativity in the humor, not just unoriginal physical humor(it still was pretty humorous). The moral/value of the story actually gets across to the audience quite fluently. The emotion felt pretty cliché/slightly forced when it actually counted but in other minor areas it ended up touching you. The Croods is an extremely heavy hearted film with great humorous attributes which needed some more originality, the actors matched pretty well with their characters as well, especially Nicolas Cage(surprisingly), there aren't so many faults but I was still searching for what would make this film stand out its still a solid outing which as you 've probably heard 1000 times, take the kids to see this."
"EmmaDinkins","8","2","5","24 March 2013"," Chix Chat on Film review: Thinking outside the cave.
","I was excited about seeing The Croods, because my grandchildren are visiting and I figured it would be a nice little treat for them. We decided to try it out in 3-D since the colors looked so vivid in the trailer. This turned out to be a very bad idea, as soon as we placed the glasses on the youngest he started screaming and buried his face in his mom's chest, the older one refused to wear the glasses so he watched the entire movie out of phase. The appearance of the landscape and the exotic animals was striking because the colors were so vivid. The 3-D special effects continue to impress me as they evolve and enhance the movie going experience, there were moments when it seemed that you could reach out and touch what was taking place on screen, which is apparently what frightened the little ones. It was an interesting concept to apply current events to a family that starts out in fear and darkness dwelling in a cave for survival and having a rebellious teenaged daughter shed some light on the fact that it is time for change. I was surprised that the story even played out a road trip replete with, 'are we there yet' so as to show a relatable family. I assumed from the name that the Croods was a play on words and that they would be well, crude. Gold star for Emma (me, but Emma Stone (Eep) can have one too), they were very crude but were also quick studies. This was a very smart story in that when they knew better they did better. There was nothing in the story that was especially original, but the handling of the themes was refreshing, like the overprotective father, the dysfunctional relationship with the mother in law and the coming of age story for Eep (Emma Stone) .The alpha male competitiveness was fun to watch between Grug (Nicholas Cage) and Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who was an advanced thinker and master puppeteer. In all this was a very entertaining film with some clever word plays, there were times that it strayed from the prehistoric age and got a bit too modern like with the umbrellas, but the belt was really cute. It's a good film for both children and adults, however I think the best fit for children is sans the 3-D. I give it a green light."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","3","10","25 March 2013"," Featherweight, prehistoric nonsense.
","""The Croods"" is a largely featherweight animated comedy perched somewhere between ""Ice Age"" and ""The Flintstones."" It's not as funny as the former or as endearing the latter. It is the kind of movie that you enjoy it while you're watching it, but after-wards it slips away from your mind. In six months your kids might not even remember it.<br/><br/>The Croods of the title are a prehistoric family. There are six of them: Dad is Grug (Nicholas Cage); Mom is Ugga (Catherine Keener); Gran is the elder (Cloris Leachman); the kids are a teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone); a son named Thunk (Clark Duke); and a feral toddler named Sandy (Randy Thom) who acts more like the family dog. They are fairly afraid of the world around them mostly because the entire landscape seems ready to swallow them up. For this reason, Dad has instituted the family motto: ""Everything new is bad!"" It's true, The Croods don't know much about the world around them (despite a perfect grasp of modern English) and Dad takes measures to keep them safe, like locking them in a cave at night. The family may scoff but his technique seems to have worked where others seem to have failed. No one ever blatantly points it out, but The Croods seem to be the only human beings on Earth. There are indications of another family, but that information is held out for one of the sentimental moments.<br/><br/>The story has an adventure, but it settles more firmly on boring family issues. The oldest child, Eeps yearns to break out of Dad's cautionary measures and explore the world. One night she does, and comes across a handsome young wanderer named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who has information that the world is about to come apart. This – we remember from science class – is the breakup of Pangaea, a single continent that broke up millions of years ago and became the continents that we know today. That sets off an uneasy journey as the family heads . . . someplace safe. With the whole world coming apart it is hard to tell where they think they are going, but there seem to be some peaks that make up the horizon.<br/><br/>The family story involves Dad's attempt to lead his family despite the fact that young Guy has much better survival instincts. He is also angered by the fact that Eep has taken a liking to the new boy and that opens up the old familiar you-gotta-let-her-grow-up plots that have been the bane of the ""Ice Age"" sequels.<br/><br/>The journey itself has its moments. Between dodging fierce creatures and massive land shifts, The Croods discover fire, shoes, sunglasses, umbrellas, belts, the rickshaw, lawn furniture, family portraits, domestic pets, dreadlocks, and a concept called ""hugging"" (awww!) They also discover a strange phenomenon that only takes place at night, little pinholes in the night sky that help them understand where the sun goes all night. That scene is, admittedly, kind of magical.<br/><br/>One could only wish that the rest of the film were as wondrous. This is a fairly mushy movie. Like every other animated comedy these days, it is dulled by a bunch of sweet and sentimental family bonding. The problem is that the characters aren't interesting enough to make us care. The screenplay by Chris Sanders and Kirk Di Micco deals with the domestic issues of the father and his budding daughter, but who cares about that? This is a movie for kids. Why not just give them an honest-to-goodness slapstick comedy that will make them laugh non-stop? Leave the drama for when they grow up.<br/><br/>** (of four)"

","This movie was a lot better than I expected. Granted, it's not the best Dreamworks movie, but it's still pretty decent. While at times it does feel like Ice Age 3 and The Flintstones, it still has enough originality to pass as an original screenplay. While it probably won't be nominated for Best Animated Film at the Oscars, it has enough heart to be one of the best animated films of the year. Unlike some dull animated films that have come out this year, like Epic, this actually has a good script, fun humor, and a great lesson at it's core. Grade: C, 7/10, 3/5 stars."
"fabioff","10","1","2","11 June 2018"," Funny and light way to talk about deep mankind questions
","This movie is more than just entertainment. Don´t be fooled by the worn out caveman theme, or because it´s an animation. This is not The Flintstones or else. It´s a fun and original story that tells more than it appears to tell. 
This movie is about deep questions of mankind, especially how we deal with knowledge, how we learn things, how we resist to change, the role of fear in our survival etc.
There´s a lot of science in it, in a fun and light way. Evolutionary theory, psychology, sociology, even it suggests the origin of football, as they go hunt for an egg. Well, this is an underrated movie, that lost the Oscar award to Frozen."

","This movie would probably work better as a short film. Though there are some semi-interesting things in this movie, there is a lot filler and stupid nonsense.

","The Croods are a family of cavemen who follow strict rules of survival. As a result, they've spent most of their lives inside a dark cave, only coming out to search for food.

","This movie is so enjoyable to watch. First, we have the cavemen - which are I would say enough realistic with their primary behavior. Then we have a whole bunch of fluffy, colorful and pretty peculiar animals (and plants) always seeking to eat our characters. Then this handsome hunter-gatherer arrives and saves the day. The plot is very typical for an animated movie, but it is really enjoyable to watch and the humor is fresh. There are spectacular scenes of deserts, rain forests, flying turtles, coral reefs (no water in them though). Someone had lots of fun creating all those impossible animals.

"jboothmillard","5","1","2","10 March 2016"," The Croods
","I knew this film was about cavemen, that's about it really, I was prepared to give it a try and make myself feel like a kid again, directed by Chris Sanders (Lilo & Stitch, How to Train Your Dragon) and Kirk DeMicco (Space Chimps). Basically in the prehistoric era, The Croods are a Neanderthal family: father and husband Grug (Nicolas Cage), mother and wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone), son Thunk (Clark Duke), ferocious baby daughter Sandy (Randy Thom) and grandmother Gran (Cloris Leachman). The family hardly get out of their cave, having seen many of their friends and neighbours killed by various elements and creatures of the world, Grug is over-protective and stubborn to make any changes, even if it would benefit them for food and survival. Eep is a rebel and questions why they have to live in the dark, one day she sees a light and sneaks out of the cave, she finds inventive modern human boy Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and his pet sloth Belt (Chris Sanders). Guy has discovered how to make fire, he also warns of an oncoming apocalypse, that will destroy the land, he offers to help Eep and her family find safety, but concerned she stays, he gives her a shell horn to blow if she needs help. Soon enough a massive earthquake destroys the land, and the home of the Croods, the family are forced to venture into the tropical forest and escape the carnivores and other new creatures, Eep calls for Guy, but worried for his family, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Escaping the destruction, Guy is let out of the log and creates shoes for the family, to walk across the harsh landscape, Guy explains that he and all humans have a brain and can come up with ideas, Grug becomes jealous of Guy's impression on the family, and realises Eep has fallen in love with him. Attempting to invent things like Guy, Grug only embarrasses himself and drives the family further away from him as they continue to travel to a place called ""Tomorrow"", there is a point when the family are split by tunnels, all but Grug escape, coming up with ideas. Reaching the mountain, Grug wants the family to hide in a cave, they refuse, saying they don't want to ""survive"", but to ""live"", Grug is enraged and attacks Guy, they end up falling into the tar flow, Guy tells that his family perished in one, Grug realises Guy's method of survival is better than his, they work together to get out, they succeed and reunite with the others. Then the land violently rips apart and the family are cut off from their destination, Grug realising the error of his ways throws his family to safety, he shares an invention which he calls a ""hug"" with Eep, it appears that Grug has fallen, but manages to create a makeshift airship and fly across the chasm. In the end the Croods are happily reunited, Grug apologises and promises not to be so overbearing again, and they find a beautiful land to live on a vast beach, where everyday they can follow the light to ""Tomorrow"". The voice cast are all well chosen for their parts, the story is nice and simplistic, the ideas thrown together about what Neanderthals discover is clever, and their many weird and wonderful creatures and landscapes along the way that you will never have seen before, I admit some of it is predictable, the worried father trying to right for his family but being a complete buzzkill I have seen before, but the colourful animation, which can be seen in 3D also, is great, and this is something all the family can enjoy, a fun computer-animated comedy adventure. Worth watching!"

","What a delightful family movie! We chose this not quite knowing what to expect and my goodness we were in for a treat.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty straightforward - a stone age family loses their home and has to search for a new one, and in the process learn about the really important things in life. Nothing too surprising there then.<br/><br/>But it's the way this story is told that makes it fantastic. This is an incredibly fun and spectacularly colourful movie.<br/><br/>The animation is done with blistering speed and real panache. There is a scene near the start showing the family out foraging for an egg - a simple enough idea but the resulting stand-off and chase with other hunting animals is a thrilling tour-de- force of animation.<br/><br/>And my goodness, the colours! Every landscape and virtually every creature is lush with all the colours of the rainbow and (so it feels) more.<br/><br/>This truly fits the definition of a 'magical' family movie.

","This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Frozen. There will be spoilers ahead: <br/><br/>This is a very good film. It says something for the year in animation when a film like The Croods is, for me, the fifth best film in a very good field. The visuals on this are magnificent.<br/><br/>The main problem I have is with the script. After about the fourth or fifth time we have the point that the father is completely and totally afraid of everything that's even remotely unfamiliar, I thought to myself, ""Okay, I get it! He's scared of anything that's unknown! Get on with other things"". This was probably 15 minutes into a film more than n90 minutes long. It detracted from the film for me.<br/><br/>Essentially, this is about the Croods, a prehistoric family. It's narrated by Eep, the daughter of the above-referenced father. She's, if anything, more exasperated by her father's fears, no matter how well-founded they seem to be (her recounting of why they have no neighbors at the start of the film is gruesomely hilarious.<br/><br/>Eep sneaks out one night, in defiance of the rules and meets Guy, a thinking caveman. She proceeds to wipe the ground with Guy, being stronger than he is. He tells her that destruction is headed this way and everyone has to head to safer grounds or be obliterated. When she declines his invitation to come, he gives her a shell to call to him with.<br/><br/>Through various events, the entire family of Croods find themselves caveless and traveling ""with"" Guy (in a running gag involving Guy and a log). Grug, the father, dislikes Guy immediately, for lots of reasons. Guy gets the upper hand and winds up in charge, which irks Grug enormously and it becomes a sort of competition between ideas and muscle.<br/><br/>The family and Guy have lots of brushes with the danger they're running from and lots of funny moments along the way. Their introductions to fire show that father and daughter are a lot alike. The ending of the film is nice and permits a sequel, which is scheduled for released in 2017. I'm looking forward to it as I type.<br/><br/>This film is available on Blu-Ray/DVD and is well worth getting. The Blu-Ray is particularly nice."
"aisuru2001","4","1","2","12 January 2015"," Simplistic action comedy in computer game style
","This movie has a few funny moments but I think it is more geared toward young kids than older viewers. While the lead character is very similar in appearance and style to Shrek, this movie cannot even closely reach the depth and quality of story-telling. <br/><br/>The Croods feels like a jump and run computer game, where you are constantly running from one challenge to the next. The action is exaggerated which appeals to young viewers. It reminds me a little of classic cartoons where the characters suffer great pain but are not really harmed. This, in my opinion, is OK for a short cartoon but gets annoying in a long movie like this.<br/><br/>It is an okay movie but certainly not as great as the present ranking suggests. I would go for 2 out of 4 stars."

","O.K, so I'm past that age where animated movies are supposed to excite you. I still manage to see most of them but just not with the same zeal as a younger person would; the jokes seem a bit juvenile, the comedy more slapstick than stimulating and try as I might, I can't be bothered to care for a cartoon character as I would if it were being played by an actual person. That being said, this one took me completely by surprise. The characters were played by the leads to a tee. Nicholas Cage as the overprotective control freak of a father, Ryan Reynolds as the easily spooked outsider who shows the Croods how to use their brains instead of brawn and Emma Stone as the high-spirited youngster with an inquisitive mind and a fierce determination all played their parts to perfection. The story is engaging, the dialogues will make you laugh out loud more than once and to top it all off, the cinematography and art direction is out of this world. I had to pause the movie mid-scene, and come online to write this review just because of one shot where the light goes out and the sky is shown to be lit up with a thousand stars......it's that breathtaking. The last time I was this charmed by a cartoon movie was back in 2001 when the first Shrek film came out. Thanks Dreamworks for making me feel the magic of animated films again."
"logistikdesign","10","1","2","20 July 2013"," 7.4 ??? This movie deserves a 10 out of 10.
","The Croods has all you could expect from an animation: Lovely characters, an astounding world, powerful emotions and a message to convey (which is split up in easily understandable chunks). The comedy appeals to all ages and is accomplished through a well thought slapstick, farce (which I fancy a lot) and ingenious twists.<br/><br/>I am 19 years old and I was on the edge of the seat for at least 90% of the movie and my favorite movies are the LOTR trilogy, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction and from the animation standpoint The Lion King. The characters which at first seem ugly, brutal, violent and of course silly soon turn into humans with feelings and ideas. <br/><br/>Last but not least, the soundtracks follow the feelings and personalities of each character and I am probably not the only man out there who thinks that Eep becomes voluptuous because of well placed soundtracks and scenery. A pretty hard to create paradox in an animation movie with The Flinstones looks, hence why I give 10 out of 10, The Flinstones were funny and nice but the Croods are much more than them. The names are very easy to remember and even the monsters are lovely and funny so the kids wouldn't have nightmares but can experience some thrills with every chase. The world is highly dynamic and evolves with the characters and their personality. As the Croods family becomes braver so the world around them turns richer and safer. Fire, which can be taken also as a symbol, turns into a magic solution to all problems of human life, even at the end, which is rather cute and hard to forget. There is also an internal and external struggle, which is easy to notice even for children. All in all, if you are looking for an animation movie at least 80 per cent as good as the Lion King look no further."

","The Croods is a movie about the last surviving prehistoric family consisting of patriarch Grug(Nicolas Cage), Ugga(Catherine Keener) his wife, Eep(Emma Stone) his daughter, Thunk(Clark Duke) his son, Sandy(Randy Thom) his infant daughter & Gran(Cloris Leachman) his mother-in-law & the grand mom of the kids. Eep is filled with curiosity but, her father Grug, forbids her & the rest of the Croods from doing anything even the slightest bit risky, adventurous & fun, in order for the last early human family to survive. So, the Croods hide in their cave for a week, completely in darkness & go out of the cave, just to hunt for food. Then, the whole process starts all over again! One day, after Eep has a fight with her dad, she escapes from the cave at midnight after she sees a mysterious light coming from outside the cave. She follows it & meets the only surviving human outside the cave, Guy(Ryan Reynolds) & his pet, Belt(Chris Sanders). He tells her that the world as they know it is going to end & that they must leave immediately. However, Eep decides to bring the whole family along after they all witness various mountains getting destroyed, their cave along with it. She calls for Guy's help & an extremely reluctant & suspicious Grug decides to bring along Guy, albeit as prisoner, to help them get to the mountains before it's too late! From here on, the whole family, along with Guy, go on an adventure where they discover many beautiful & dangerous things, both plants & animals.<br/><br/>This movie is a treat for the eyes, especially in 3D(no surprise nowadays). Though it was entertaining as most animated movies are, the story was the same overprotective father & curious daughter shtick, which came on screen very recently in Hotel Transylvania. Half of the jokes in the movie were slapstick jokes which got a bit tedious & childish after a certain point. The way Eep gets over excited after Guy gives her shoes is my favorite scene in the movie. It's not as hilarious as other recent DreamWorks Animation movie, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. The voice acting is spot on. Nicloas Cage is outstanding as Grug. Emma Stone is hilarious & mind blowing as Eep. Ryan Reynolds is charming & impressive as Guy. Catherine Keener is brilliant as Ugga. Clark Duke is hysterical as Thunk. Cloris Leachman is hilariously brilliant as Gran. Chris Sanders is awesome as Belt, especially his Dan-Tan-Taan bit! Randy Thom is spectacular as baby girl, Sandy. So, The Croods is not a must watch film. However, do watch it if you love animated films or, have a daughter who doesn't get along very well with you!"
"jacky0731","10","1","2","13 April 2013"," Emotional, fun and engaging!
","""WOW! I'm lucky i decided to go see this!"" That was my thought when i finished the film, totally opposite to my initial expectations.<br/><br/>I have watched tons of pixar films but this one is one of the most enjoyable, heart-warming and memorable. Its different. Its simple but strikes ur mind and emotions. Its cunning and imaginative. The characters stand out and make u wonder why the film is only 90 mins when all of them deserve more time to be stars of the film! OK, i might sound a little too enthusiastic but u'll never understand me until u see it for urself! :P Its one of those films where u should totally ignore all the bad reviews.<br/><br/>{{Minor Spoiler Alert}} The film was especially memorable to me because it touched on the simplicity of life and dictates it through different ways. From the discovery of the fire to the shoes, the first ever gaze of the starry night to the longing of the shining sun, it was touching to see the changes they must go through in order to strive forward. The adventure is humorous throughout but always leaves a little message behind. The way in which Grug (Dad) changes from a stubborn, never NOT afraid (haha!), yet loving father to an open-minded, idea-making (hahaha!) and STILL loving father was very touching. U'd really feel empathy towards his character, cry at his sacrifices and then cheer for his imagination at the end! His resolve changes his whole family and their life, bringing joy and fun to everyone including their new pets! (awwwwww~)<br/><br/>This film really is a must see and i'll recommend and rewatch it anyday!"
"BharatSamra","8","1","2","14 April 2013"," Beautiful Animation!
","Experiencing DreamWorks' The Croods leaps beyond giving you the feeling of a cinematic spectator, but instead the film actually accepts you as a member of the Crood family. This delightful animation follows a family of cave people as they are forced to depart from their comfort zone and embark on an adventure that will not only determine their physical and evolutionary survival, but also allow them to recognise that life can be worth living even when risks are taken.<br/><br/>Out of respect for The Croods (the film and the family), it would only be fair to divulge the negative aspects of the animated film first before pouring out the praise. This is because the 98 minute feature itself thankfully reserves its lesser qualities for the first half of the film, before unveiling a sensationally satisfactory conclusion, as well as everything leading up to it. The Croods does suffer at times from some annoyingly loud and unfunny slapstick comedy that becomes borderline awkward in the confines of a theatre when not even the young children (the target demographic) are laughing. The humour most definitely is not intended to accommodate to all ages, though there are still plenty of laughs to be had, but you feel you are searching for them, rather than they are finding you. Furthermore, the 3D contributes nothing; as opposed to enhancing the experience, it actually (albeit only slightly) diminishes it. It should perhaps be known I am not a fan of 3D cinema anyway, but the visual novelty in The Croods really is questionable as not only is there no aesthetic augmentation, but the 3D in fact causes blurred vision when wanting you to focus on unimportant objects. The answer surely lies in the studio's economic, rather than artistic, justification. <br/><br/>The animation itself is absolutely consistently energetic. It is both figuratively and literally full of life throughout, and the animators intentionally paint a bleakly coloured landscape for the initial setting of a repeated and oppressive lifestyle, before they allow a pallet of luminosity to blossom as the adventure commences and we and the characters are exposed to a greater sense of diversity. This parallels with the narrative of The Croods. The film essentially is a tug of war that sees the character Eep (voiced by Emma Stone) as the rope being pulled towards a life of safety and overprotectiveness by her father Grug (Nicholas Cage) while also allowing herself to be drawn to the exciting stranger guy named err... Guy (Ryan Reynolds). It is a battle between fear and hope and while Grug and Guy stand at the opposing ends of spectrum, the remaining characters are left to contemplate on which side they wish to be tempted towards.<br/><br/>The comedy that is greatly genius in The Croods is that type of humour that humanises and personifies elements of primitive civilisation in a way that is updated so that modern beings can appreciate its cultural value. There are a number of really terrific comedic instances in the film that are aided by the perfect voice casting of the ensemble, but unfortunately these are often overshadowed by the abundance in dull physical humour. The characters that the actors voice are all likable in their own unique way, and cohesively lovable as a family. Like a family, you may find traits that you dislike, but in the end, you know that you love them.<br/><br/>The Croods is certainly one of the superior animations that DreamWorks has to offer, though I would not necessarily guarantee that everyone will enjoy it as it becomes evident from the first second of the film that it has been made for a very young audience and is missing that adult appeal. The Croods is just a lot of fun with a predictable plot, but why regard that as negative criticism when in reality you desire for your predictions to come to fruition as you become so attached to this fictional family, especially at the surprisingly emotionally investing conclusion. No other two polysemic words could probably encapsulate the film more appropriately than: beautiful animation."
"Kane20","9","1","2","13 April 2013"," A pleasant surprise
","I found The Croods to be a pleasant surprise. It exceeded any expectations I had prior to seeing it. Twentieth Century Fox has teamed up with the studio behind How to Train Your Dragon and Shrek, put How to Train Your Dragon director Chris Sanders on the helm along with Kirk De Micco, and come out with this lively, rousing, and highly entertaining work. It doesn't quite rise up the level of Shrek or How to Train Your Dragon (the latter of which is my favorite DreamWorks animated film), but it's definitely one of DreamWorks's better films. It certainly contains the studio's style, and some elements from (and a few references to) a few of its previous films, including the aforementioned Shrek and HTTYD.<br/><br/>The Croods tells the story of a caveman family, (yes, you've guessed it) the Croods, the last surviving family in the region in which they live. They live by hiding in their cave most of the time, only going out to hunt. They always play it safe and live in fear, especially of anything new; as the father, Gurg (Nicolas Cage) says, ""Never not be afraid.""<br/><br/>The exception to this is Grug's teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone), who, instead of wanting to play it safe all the time, is willing to take risks and learn new things. Because of this, she is a bit distant from her family. One night she ventures out of the cave and meets a young man named Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the world is about to end. Sure enough, an earthquake occurs soon afterward, destroying the Croods' cave (but this is just the beginning). This sends the family on a journey with Guy across an incredible land that they have never experienced, full of fantastic creatures and more, while heading to a mountain where they will supposedly be safe.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot think of much to criticize about the film, except maybe a little bit of the plotting, but that's about it. Again, it doesn't live up to How to Train Your Dragon, but it's still good (and it is admittedly a bit better in terms of character development). It is full of clever humor, wit, and energy. The humor is neither too childish nor too adult. The film also contains true emotion and good, valuable morals. And it is absolutely full of heart. The animation is excellent; colorful, lively, and dazzling. And I want to give a major thumbs-up to Alan Silvestri for the score, which is lively and rousing, just like everything else about the film.<br/><br/>Another especially noteworthy aspect of the film is Eep. Strong female protagonists seem to be fairly popular these days, and Eep is no exception. All of the characters shine, not completely dominating any of the others, but she does shine a bit more than the others. Her appearance brought to mind Fiona from Shrek (which is not surprising, as the same studio is behind them both). She is strong, bold, daring, and rebellious, and her personality recalls that of the aforementioned Fiona, Astrid from HTTYD, and even a bit of Merida from Brave. And yes, there is definitely a bit of Astrid in her; just look at the way she treats Guy when she first meets him. However, they do eventually develop some feelings for each other (which Grug is not too happy about). Eep and all of the other character of the film are lovable, as are the interactions and family values, dynamics, and bonding. The voice performances are good too.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, there was not a single moment anywhere in the entire film where I was bored. Again, it's not great, but it is good. It is a clever, witty, humorous, energetic, rousing, heartwarming delight, and I hope it gets nominated for the Best Animated Film Oscar. I will not be surprised if it becomes a childhood classic for future generations. I even stayed for the credits. And its primary moral message is one that anybody can relate to: don't let your life get stale – go out and learn and experience new things, live up to your potential, and really live your life and dreams."

","I usually write reviews when I fell a movie is just awful or brilliant and I don't have to tell you that this piece of work is just beautiful Art. At first I thought this would be just another flimsy animation with just a few laughs here and there and a predictable ending, but ""boy was I wrong""!<br/><br/>The first clash of the word ""WOW"" and my had started with the setting that is very elaborated and the fact that a lot of heart and soul has been imprinted in the characters and their quest for survival. This is actually as good as ""Wrack it Ralph"" (that did an equal amount of positive impression for an animation).<br/><br/>If more animations will have the strong initiative and bold perspective of the sense of unpredictable as this movie has, I will be pleased as a crazy bear for honey.

The one thing that this movie is is UNGODLY FORGETTABLE!!! I can't remember ONE LINE OF DIALOGUE and the comedy is too much slapstick and not a lot of anything else, that the jokes are just as forgettable as the dialogue. Quite literally, this movie is THE AVATAR OF ANIMATED BOX OFFICE MOVIES. It has good actors that don't do as good in the movie as they should, like Avatar. It's visual style is much more memorable than the actual plot, like Avatar. The story is a mix of clichés, like Avatar! It's just Avatar made for kids!

No doubt visual effects from Dreamworks Studio is great, although not the best. I actually enjoy and laugh at some scenes of the movie, it's ridiculous but funny. The best thing from the movie is the 3D, it really works. The 3D effect really watchable and consistent in every frame. Dreamworks animation continue their good looking 3D after making great shot in Madagascar 3.<br/><br/>Overall The Croods is a good family movie and will entertain the viewers by it's eye-popping 3D.

"lagudafuad","5","2","9","31 March 2013"," A miss fire from my view
","The Croods can be said to have come out a little crude, I felt it was too rough around the edges and the Midas touch of Chris Sanders (which showed up in Lilo & Stich (2002) and he is the man behind the Bolt (2008) story before he left Disney and joined Dreamworks to make the masterpiece How To Train Your Dragon (2010), which he will also be involved in the later sequels of it) is losing its touch after all.<br/><br/>It is not that The Croods didn't have the family fun package because it did and it also had the whole family warmth that I expected from an animation targeted at young audience, but the movie was just too primitive, they went overboard with the whole caveman idea, I actually got tired of the stone age, something The Flintstones have not been able to achieve. The movie has many fast paced scenes, a lot of action (adventure) to make you sit up and not be bored, but at the end, it felt weak in the area of emotional sentiment something Pixar has mastered, which makes the characters memorable. The CGI was OK, but the movie also showed lack in the area of the character development, I actually didn't see any reason to like anybody I saw on the screen.<br/><br/>The plot is about change and people's failure to accept it. The Croods are a caveman family that has managed to survive the harsh conditions that they live in, only because they believe that to be curious or to desire change is to desire death. But things changed when another Stone Age man passes by their cave, he is more advanced than they are and he knows how to make fire. Now The Croods have a problem, this man tells them it is time to move because where they are, is going to be gone soon as climatic changes are affecting the earth's crust. But The Croods don't want to move, except for one, she happens to have developed feelings for the young genius and propels the family to follow him.<br/><br/>The Croods is the first animation film from DreamWorks Animation to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, since the end of their distribution deal with Paramount Pictures in 2012 with Rise of the Guardians.<br/><br/>My take on this movie is that, it could have been better but it isn't. The Croods is a family movie nothing more or spectacular I don't see this having an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","Yes, it is formulaic. But, at no point in the movie was I bored. Everyone in the family, from a 6 year old to a 46 year old enjoyed the movie and was entertained. Is it an instant classic, no, but I think is should be getting more attention than is appears to get.<br/><br/>Don't bother paying for the 3D. It didn't add much in my opinion. I didn't have a choice (2D wasn't offered at my theater). The kids liked it, I felt it either wasn't noticeable or got in the way.<br/><br/>My other complaint is admittedly... sort of silly. The animals in the movie were all fantastical, like the animators were trying to out do each other on who would invent the weirdest creature. I think they should have used real species from the period. Sagan used to call Star Trek a ""missed opportunity"" to show real science, I feel the same way about this movie."

","Eep is a teenage cavegirl who badly wants to spread her wings. Trouble is that Dad Grug is overprotective, afraid of everything, and keeps the family shut up in the cave all the time so that they are not exposed to risks. Then handsome young Guy comes along, full of ideas and open to exploring the world, Eep is entranced, and Grug's authority and philosophy is challenged.<br/><br/>I think one can over-examine this film - by any rational standards, Grug is doing exactly the right thing for his family, and making him the fall guy made me feel a little uneasy. So perhaps it is best to take a step backwards and just look at this as a family movie, on which grounds it succeeds admirably. It is exciting, there are a lot of laughs, the design (characters, environments, quirky creatures) is brilliant, the movie is spectacular, and the voice characterisation is good (Emma Stone's Eep is a bit shrill, but then, she's an excitable teenager).<br/><br/>The big surprise is that the movie, which the trailer sells as a rite of passage story for Eep, isn't about her at all, it's about Grug learning to change. My only real complaint is that Grug's resistance to change goes on for so long, and in circumstances where it is so massively stupid, that it becomes somewhat tiresome. For all that, the family will enjoy it.<br/><br/>The 3D has its moments."

","The Croods is a movie that offers great family filled entertainment and stunning visual 3D effects. Do not let the title fool you. You will not find any ""crude"" humor in it. It's a slapstick film. Slapstick done right that is.The story is unpredictable, subtle and smart enough and the fact that it's an animated feature gave the creators more flexibility in bringing their imaginations to the screen. Taking us with the original ""first family"" to ""follow tomorrow and follow the light"".<br/><br/>This latest feature from Dreamworks animation is about a family who was forced by nature to leave their humble abode due to the effects of an apparent looming apocalypse that destroyed their cave. They were caught in the middle of an evolving colorful world. It's also important to note that this movie could very well be a stepping out of the Pixar shadow by Dreamworks animation. <br/><br/>Grug the character voiced over by Nicholas Cage, is the patriarch who protected his family all his life. He is an over protective dad who only wants to make sure that members of his family are safe from the harmful elements of the world outside their cage. Emma Stone plays the voice of Eep the teenage daughter in the family trying to exercise her freedom to explore and see what is in store for her and her family in the outside world. During one of her escapades she happen to stumble upon Guy the nomadic character voiced over by Ryan Reynolds who helped guide them through the twists and turns of their road trip and starting a Tarzan and Janesque cute love story.<br/><br/>The characters however did not have enough time to develop due to it's fast paced sequences. However, I would not mind seeing a sequel.Hearing the laughs and giggles of kids while watching this movie in the theaters added to the fun and enjoyment to the whole experience.<br/><br/>The tandem of former Disney animator Chris Sanders who brought us Lilo and Stitch in 2002 and How to train your dragon in 2010 and Kirk De Micco who wrote and co-produced the animated feature Racing Stripes in 2005 and wrote and directed Space Chimps in 2008. <br/><br/>Through their screenplay they did a great job telling a story that caters to both adults and kids alike. A story that flows without any unnecessary distractions and through their directing skills they were also able to put together the right voices that brought the characters to life. <br/><br/>The Croods is the first animation Film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox. It opened in 4,046 cinemas 3,000 of which were 3D equipped. The movie debuted at the top of the box office in the United states and internationally during it's opening weekend last March 22nd earning an estimated $44.7 million in the United States during the first 3 day release. Dethroning the former number one film OZ. The Croods is expected to remain in the top for a couple more weeks due to it's family oriented nature and lack of same genre competition."
"sandratry","6","1","5","29 March 2013"," Great family movie but often stereotypical.
","This was a great family movie. I saw the Croods in English and 3D and what I liked most was the artwork. The world created around the the Croods is beautiful and colorful, sometimes even scary. The characters are also interesting and funny (I loved all of their different personalities) and there are numerous jokes throughout the movie for both children and adults. <br/><br/>However, the story is often cliché, and so are the jokes. And from a feminist point of view this isn't a very good movie whereas the persons who get most attention in the movie, and the most important roles, are both male, while the girls and women have mostly stereotypical scenes (a nagging mother-in-law, a caring and sensible mother, a love-crazy daughter) and don't have any important affects on the story. <br/><br/>Despite it's downfalls it was a very enjoyable movie to watch, so I can recommend it as a simple and funny movie for the family."

","Rating: 2.9/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Some nice scenes and refreshing dialogs strung together along with brilliant visuals just about manage to help this animated venture stay afloat. The first half of the movie is what really lets it down with random hurried scenes and a blatant disregard for the law of physics. I agree that an animated film is permitted to take certain liberties, but they should be taken with the permissible constraints of the film's environment and its script. Going overboard with these liberties becomes intolerable after a certain point of time. For instance, there's no way that a human being, leave alone an infant, can run faster than a wild cat or an ostrich-like prehistoric bird.<br/><br/>From the second half onwards, the movie begins the ease up and starts focusing more on its characters and their interactions. Most notable of all is the endearing representation of the father-daughter relationship and the young guy who decides to help their family. The climax again begins on an enthusing note only to stumble into confounding territory that totally defies logic and rationale.<br/><br/>Eventually, ""The Croods"" joins the ranks of an alarmingly increasing plethora of animated films nowadays that promise a lit, convinces us at the onset that it just might deliver on its promises, but alas, disappoints us in the end with the felling of what could have been."

","A good kid movie, but not so good for adults. Again I watched this with my fiancé who loves animated movies and although it had its funny moments, I was bored for most of the movie. The basic moral of the story is to not keep your head in the sand. Traditions are not always good, and education is important else you will become obsolete and it can hurt you in the long run. I found the grandma relationship with the husband to be somewhat funny as was some of the cave dweller behaviors. Aside from that however, I thought the execution was a little bland. If you have kids, this is a good movie though I really wouldn't want my kids to assume that falling in love is how it was portrayed in this movie and others. I really think that animated movies need to stop pushing the idea that liking someone after 2 minutes is somehow ""love."" I see too many people falling into this trap at an adult age and now in my mid 30s I am seeing all those relationships fall apart some in very ugly ways. We really should not encourage this type of behavior... anyway, gripe about absurd love aside, the movie was OK."
"ivern-326-711636","7","1","7","25 March 2013"," DreamWorks Have Stepped Down Their Game
","I've always liked DreamWorks Animation. They've made some classics like Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, and a couple of their movies can even be looked at being as great as Pixar (in my opinion, Kung Fu Panda 2 and How to Train Your Dragon are about as great as a lot of Pixar's movies).<br/><br/>They're normally the first CGI animation company to produce a movie each year, and this year is no exception. This is The Croods. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it didn't look like a DreamWorks film. It looked like something from Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon. In other words, not very appealing. But let's see how this was.<br/><br/>The Croods is about a prehistoric family who's routine is to stay in a cave to survive predators, occasionally going outside looking for food. The family's daughter, however, wants to explore the outside world. One day, a giant earthquake ruins the family's cave, and they have to go out looking for a new one in an undiscovered world, together with a lonesome adventurer called Guy. That's as far as I'll go into the story.<br/><br/>The Croods is actually much better than I expected. It isn't great, but it's at the peek of being really good. The major downsides are two things: The character models and the story. Let's first talk about the character models: They look like they were made for a cheap TV animated movie, but then later put into a DreamWorks film and given some better textures. The animation itself is as brilliant as DreamWorks movies usually are, but the character models just don't fit with the rest of the movie. At the very least, they don't fit in with DreamWorks' other movies.<br/><br/>The story isn't special, but it isn't bad either. But my problem is the ending. I won't spoil anything, but there's a point in the movie where I think they should've just ended it, but then they had to keep going because they needed to make it a fully happy ending. It completely ruined the symbol of the characters, and the dramatic elements present where fully botched.<br/><br/>On a good note, The Croods can be hilarious. It has a more CROOD humor (see what I did there), and I found it a nice change from your typical family animated movies. The characters are also entertaining, with a couple exceptions like Thunk and Sandy, who even though their a part of the family, serve no true point to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, The Croods is a very entertaining movie. There is some lost potential in the writing and the character models are ugly, but the rest of the movie is pretty top-notch. It's not up there with DreamWork's best works, but it's still pretty good. My only worry about this movie is that it doesn't seem like this is just filler for a greater DreamWorks movie to come later this year, like Madagascar 3 was last year. Because the next DreamWorks movie is called Turbo, and it looks like a bland rip-off of Cars with snails. And after that, we get Mr. Peabody & Sherman, who I don't see how they need a feature film. All in all, 2013 won't be a great year for DreamWorks, I'm pretty sure of that. But we'll see."

","Easily The Croods best asset is in it's art direction and animation. The creatures are creative and the character designs are unique and memorable. Unfortunately that's where my praise stops as everything the animation is in service of is so fast paced and lacking in any focus it becomes exhausting. Once the movie begins it does not stop, it keeps movie with virtually no rests and that is not a good thing. There are some interesting ideas here, but those are most likely just brief glimpses of what might've been had Aardman been allowed to go with their original concept of this being a buddy comedy between a Luddite and inventor. If you want to see this type of concept done well, just watch Early Man, it's not perfect but at least it doesn't feel the need to pass off constant unrelenting noise as entertainment."

","Chris Sanders is one of my favorite animation directors of all time. He's worked some pretty fantastic animated movies both at Disney and DreamWorks and I have loved the previous two movies he's directed, ""Lilo and Stitch"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"". Now he and director Kirk DeMicco bring us ""The Croods"" which focuses on a prehistoric family trying to survive in a crazy environment. It's not as a good as his other works, but I still think that this is a pretty fun movie with an okay story, gorgeous animation and some memorable characters to go with it. Here's how the film plays out.<br/><br/>In prehistoric times, a cave family called The Croods is stubborn to typically leave their cave due to their stubborn father named Grug (Nicholas Cage) being scared of the dangers of the outside world. Although most of the family consisting of his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), her mother Gran (Cloris Leachman), son Thunk (Clarke Duncan), and his ferocious young daughter Sandy are fine by these rules, his older daughter Eep (Emma Stone) is curious about the outside world and sick of always being stuck in a cave and goes out to explore. Pretty soon however, the families cave is destroyed in a massive earthquake and the family soon discovers a massive tropical forrest and are forced to find a new home in a matter of time. After discovering another young boy who can create fire named Guy (Ryan Reynolds), they embark on a crazy long journey to the mountain to find a cave before an impending apocalypse destroys them all.<br/><br/>Now before we go over some of the problems the film has, let's talk about the good things that are in it first. The best thing about the movie is the animation. This is some of the best animation I have ever seen not just from DreamWorks, but in general. Everything looked so vast and beautiful and the colors were just eye-popping and rich. The jungle really reminded me a lot of Pandora from James Cameron's ""Avatar"" it was that good. Everything had so much beauty to it that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The characters are also a lot of fun. I think the chemistry between Guy and Eep was the strongest throughout the film as her curiosity matched with his clever personality match perfectly. I really liked how the animators at DreamWorks actually made the characters a little like the actors who were playing them. I found that Eep really did have a resemblance to Emma Stone which included her red hair and even Ugga looked an awful lot like Catherine Keener. It was kind of surprising how much the animators captured there looks in a way. As for the story, it's just okay. I feel that some of the scenes were more sequences of jokes sewn together rather than an actual movie at times, but as a whole I think it's alright. With that said though, the movie does have some problems. For one, I don't think the movie is as emotional as it could have been. It has some slightly effective moments, but they don't make a huge impact like ""Lilo and Stitch"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"". Also, I felt that the movie's ending, which I'm not going to spoil, was a little too long. I felt like it could have been cut down a lot in order to make it work, but it kinda went on and I just kept thinking to myself ""How much longer is this?"" which is typically not a good sign. <br/><br/>Though overall, I did like ""The Croods"". It definitely could have been a lot stronger that it was, but as a whole this is a pretty fun flick. The animation is fantastic, the characters are a lot of fun, and it's story is actually pretty okay for an animated movie. It's definitely not Chris Sanders' best work, but it's certainly not a bad film. I think it's a film you should check out eventually if you want to. Just don't expect anything too grand."

Everyone is to be in the cave before dark and never go exploring strange things. The eldest daughter, Eep (Emma Stone), wants none of that lifestyle and flirts with danger every chance she gets.<br/><br/>The movie was what I expected from an animation.

","Wow. Forget The Flintstones...the original 'modern stone age family' are The Croods. They spend half their life cooped up in a cave for safety (all the other people in their neighbourhood have either been eaten or fallen victim to diseases) and the other half in a desperate search for food.. There's the lovable big lug of a husband, the responsible, sensible wife, a sassy teenage daughter, her slow witted brother, a baby who thinks it's a dog and the abrasive grandma who's sole purpose seems to be to torture her son-in-law. Hmm... I may have heard of character dynamics like that before in... I dunno... Nearly ever single recent animated film ever made?<br/><br/>They are introduced during a scene where they play American Football with an egg to keep it away from some hungry beasties... Shades of Ice Age perhaps? Then we find out the teen girl (who, with her muscles and red hair, resembles a bulked up Merida from Brave) is sick of her lot in life and wants to travel over the horizon. Is the feeling of De Javu overpowering you yet? Later, she meets a cute youth (he's drawn differently to the rest of the cast. Strange) who warns her THE END OF THE WORLD IS NIGH and she and her family must climb a mountain to ensure their safety. He also is ahead of his time in terms of his inventions (See: Flik in A Bug's Life, Rodney in Robots etc...) and has a cute little sloth sidekick called Belt. This creature expresses itself through squeaking noises and reaction shots. I bet you've never heard of any animal 'comedy relief' do THAT before.<br/><br/>That's the main problem here... everyone is very nice and adorable... we care about their quest and want them to succeed. And lovers of slapstick will be in absolute heaven, there's more pratfalls and bonks on the head here than probably in the entire Laurel & Hardy back catalogue (Guess who bares the brunt of the punishment... THAT'S RIGHT!! The dad. You win no points). It's just everything has an air of: Seen it, Done it, Ate the T-shirt. It fails to add much depth to a format which was stale even before the movie is set, and the lack of many jokes for adults means it's one the kids will appreciate more than their jaded caregivers.<br/><br/>Still, while it may be just going through the motions, that's not to say... to borrow a phrase from another cartoon show, you won't ""Have a gay old time"".

","After their cave is destroyed, a caveman family must trek through an unfamiliar fantastical world with the help of an inventive boy (Ryan Reynolds).<br/><br/>How ""The Croods"" made it into the final circle of the Academy Awards (while pushing out ""Monsters University"") is a bit of a mystery. Reviews, although generally positive, were mixed and everyone seems to be in agreement this was no ground-breaking animation or top shelf humor. And yet this leads to a cartoon show and a video game...<br/><br/>The connection between this story and Plato's allegory of the cave has been pointed out, but it is a loose connection at best. If the allegory is boiled down to the basic (and inaccurate) idea that life is more fulfilling outside of the cave, there is a similarity. But any deeper meaning Plato was trying to offer is completely absent in this film which offers no valuable advice.<br/><br/>In fact, some aspects seem to be a step backwards. There are more than a few mother-in-law jokes (we still do those?) and even a subtle anti-feminist message. While early on Eep comes across as a strong female lead, once she meets Guy, she is back in the shadow of a man telling her how to live. What could have been a ""girl power"" film was instead turned into a generic father-reluctantly-gives-daughter-away story.<br/><br/>Again, this film should probably not have been nominated and hopefully has no chance of winning an Oscar.

They follow precisely a prescribed set of rituals draw from this dogma which keeps them nourished. However, one day Guy appears and seduces the teenage Eep (it sounds like ""Eve"" in the movie) by bringing her fire. This makes him the light-bringer - the literal definition of Lucifer. Grug's family follows Eep as Guy introduces other forms of formerly forbidden knowledge until they all abandon the old ways in favor of this more secular existence. In keeping of the agenda of the producers, everything works out for them because of these changes. Well, at least that's one way to interpret it. Another is to say this is largely a decent but forgettable popcorn animated movie long on visuals and short on writing much like ""Kung Fu Panda."" Certainly the film has some exciting moments and decent lines but by about the twelfth time someone is chased by a non-extinct large cat, it gets a little monotonousness. Casting choice aimed toward box office so you wind up with off putting and slightly crazed action star Nicolas Cage voicing the put-upon father with a heart of gold. Even in the tender moments you wonder when Grug is going to go all twitchy and spout the tenants of a conspiracy theory or pull out an exotic handgun. In short, atheist activists and Satanists will love the film, people with kids will appreciate that it takes up an hour and half."

","There are stories which are remembered no matter how much time has passed. Also there are stories which entertain us and successfully forgotten afterwards. In some time you may wonder what the movies of the second type were about. You say something like: ""Yeah, I remember it, I watched it . sort of  last year? It was about  what was his name that strange guy. They were being chased by a beast and there was something about getting an egg or was it fire?"" And so on. <br/><br/>So actually all we keep in mind in some months (years) is a number of some bright images (at best).

","I want you to remind you that don't see the movie alone. It could be boring but not monotonous, I guarantee. But you could not find the zest of the movie. I think you've already know the story behind the movie. Its all about a family which maintains its safety from the beginning of the film. Ready for experiencing lots of beautiful natural scenarios, new animated animal, colorful plants, high mountains filled with high tech visual graphics. From my view it can not be a comedy thing. I've not found anything to laugh. But I could assure you, it could be one of the best adventure film in this year, showing lots of unpredicted, unimaginable graphics. My suggestion is watch this movie with all your family members, you will ultimately find out ""Family is the root by which we are bind to this earth and have a meaning for survival"". So enjoy!"

","I'll be honest, but I think Dreamworks' movies aren't great since Madagascar 3. I've watched 'Rise of The Guardians' on the plane between Singapore to London from Sydney and didn't like it one bit and I've seen this movie on the plane between London to Singapore on my way to Sydney and I thought it was better then 'Rise of The Guardians'. There are some likable characters and it has a good message about not being afraid of anything new and the outside world. Plus the story was entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>Some people are saying that this is the 'New Shrek' but looking at this film I don't see it as a Shrek film as those films have hilarious jokes, despite some toilet humor, that is made for adults and kids. There some funny jokes like shoes but they weren't laugh out loud jokes and as well as the 'Family road trip' scene when the dad says they'll enjoy it as a family and in the next scene the kids are moaning and arguing but they did give me a chuckle. <br/><br/>If I have to choose one likable character it has to be the grandmother. Her personality was funny of her hating her son-in-law and her voice was well suited including her 'still alive!' joke. I heard that they're making a sequel and I wouldn't mind seeing it. In the end, it was good but just not the best Dreamworks movie."
"scorp76","6","0","2","7 July 2013"," It seems to go no where fast.
","Croods is an interesting show, you got extremely detailed environmental animation like dirt/dust on gathering and wiping off from our cast then you got ridiculous character designs of the creatures, landscape and of course the cast themselves.<br/><br/>The story follows the same route, in the beginning of the movie you got a retard rat race to get food that breaks any logical behavioral patterns of 'humans' and animals then you got the extremely intelligent scene where Eep first sees fire light and tries to capture it and understand it.<br/><br/>Croods then grinds these alternating themes of stark stupidity and intelligence (childishness and maturity) throughout every aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>The writers and producers should have decided to stick which way they wanted to go and not to mix and match to their whims and fancies. This major failing is why Croods will never be the enduring movie it was might be.<br/><br/>But take heart Grug's climax despite the questionable logic that he uses is very satisfying can, like I said, if the ending has a decent pay off you can forgive almost anything. <br/><br/>For those of you that can't stand this type of story telling consider The Croods like a tech demo, like my sister said, for the upcoming How To Train Dragon movie. It's visuals are simply stunning."

","""THE CROODS"" Genre -Animation,Comedy,Adventure My Rating - 10 (perfect in its genre) First hats off to animation industry & Dream works to give us movies like this . From start(When she introduce her family) to climax watching this movie is really fun. only an animated movie can gives u this type of fun which generates by creativity. movie is about 93 Min's but i feel that it is only 30 Min's or less. and specially watching it on BIG screen with 3d effect was awesome experience . so Please see it on big screen and support (encourage)industry. Bottom Line is movie is a must watch for Ice age,Despicable me , Cloudy with the chance of meatballs,Up,Hotel Transylvania & Open season lovers."
"valadas","6","0","5","17 April 2013"," Too violent and somewhat unclear
","This animation movie tells a story of a family of troglodytes whose cave was destroyed by an earthquake and embarked on the search of a new one led by the family leader and father while the purpose of two young members of the team was to reject the leaders aim and search a life under the sun in open air. The story in itself is not interesting enough and it develops itself through too many violent clashes, tumbles, falls, somersaults and earthquakes most of them unnecessary and even not very funny. Like someone once said about a play written by a novice: it has many good scenes and many original ones but the good ones are not original and the original ones are not good. The most positive feature of this movie is the very imaginative creation of strange, beautiful and fanciful animals that people the scenery. Anyway I have seen much better movies of this kind."

","This movie was a marvel for 3D movies. I do not really care for watching a movie in 3D but after this one it was worth it, just to see the new ideas that Dreamworks is including into the new ideas to really push 3D to the max. <br/><br/>There was a scene that was filled with red crystals and you could see a reflection of the characters in the crystal, I have never seen anything like it. The graphics and the resolution was amazing, the glasses added to the contrast of the movie so there was little darkness.<br/><br/>While even being 25 I still laughed at some points and it was not a long drawn out child movie, it kept you interested the whole movie."
"manas-gogula","6","0","3","13 April 2013"," good family movie
","It is an OK movie as an animation, however, it is a very good family movie.I mean its not like Shrek but it is still pretty good. The plot is built well and theme is strong and easy to relate to. It wasn't the funniest movie but it had some humor in it that made me laugh once or twice.This movie also had strong characters, because you care about each one and they all have there own story. So, if you just want to watch an awesome animated movie then I wouldn't recommend this for you, however if you have kids you should definitely take them to this movie. It is definitely not one of the best animated movies, but it is still a very good family movie."
"mortonkd","Null","0","3","12 April 2013"," A little dark and scary for younger viewers
","Although I see where the movie was going w. its plot line...I felt this movie is a little too dark and scary for young children. There are various references to killing and death, poor language w. words like dummy and the like...There was a scene that showed the ""belt"" toting a knife and threatening one of the family members. My kids are very empathetic and worried constantly for the characters' well being. The minute I thought we were past the conflict scenes, another would show up. I took my 6 and 3 yr olds and personally would have skipped the first portion of the movie. We get it, to Grug the outside world is dangerous, but was it necessary to put sooooooo many life threatening scenes in this movie? My kids had their eyes covered for most of the beginning of the movie. How can you connect w. the characters and build your base if you're scared they'll be killed right from the start!? The threat of lava, dangerous animals (LOTS), crumbling ground... and really guys, the swarming flesh eating birds were completely unnecessary! That's just my opinion...Once they got toward the end, they seemed okay."

","DreamWorks Animation, often the poor stepbrother to Pixar, has had a pretty good run over the past two years with ""Kung Fu Panda 2,"" ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" and ""Rise of the Guardians."" <br/><br/>That trend continues with ""The Croods,"" a wild, colorful tale about the end of the Neanderthals, continental drift, plate tectonics and the never ending war between daddies and daughters.<br/><br/>And while the tale (written and directed by Kirk De Micco and Chris Sanders, ""Lilo & Stitch,"" ""How to Train Your Dragon"") of a cave family on the run from the dangers that surround them may be extremely clichéd and formulaic — and borrows heavily from Fox's ""Ice Age: The Meltdown,"" as well as ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" with even a little of ""The Flintstones"" thrown in — there is a certain charm in its simplicity and often frantic storytelling.<br/><br/>The script is also saved by insane, vibrant animation. The grays of the cave environment are juxtaposed with a crazed world of brightly-hued giant flowers, fiery volcanic skies, vast azure oceans, terrifying pitch-black tar pits, star-filled heavens and bizarre animals — including a lizard/dog-like creature, two varmints that share one tail, large horned birds, a big-eyed blue lemur (that shouts, ""Ta-Da!"" at appropriate moments) and a giant saber-tooth/kitty cat.<br/><br/>Add to this the voice characterizations, as well as the fun trying to guess those responsible, such as Academy Award winners Nicolas Cage (""Leaving Las Vegas"") and Cloris Leachman (""The Last Picture Show""), along with Oscar nominees Catherine Keener (""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Capote"") and Emma Stone (""The Impossible""), oh and also Ryan Reynolds (""The Green Lantern"").<br/><br/>The plot has overprotective dad, Grug Crood (Cage), hiding his family in a cave 90 percent of the time, exiting only to find food. There's a reason behind this, however, since all the other families in the ""neighborhood"" have either been smashed or eaten or infected in some way or another. <br/><br/>Mom (Keener), dim bulb son, Thunk (Clark Duke, ""Sex Drive""), Gran (Leachman) and Baby Sandy go along with this limited lifestyle (even sleeping together in a big ball), but rebellious teen Eep (Stone) doesn't just want to stay alive, she wants to live.<br/><br/>Yes, there are dangers aplenty lurking in this in-between world of abject horror and wacky fantasy of ""The Croods,"" but when Eep meets Guy (Reynolds), a more advanced humanoid who gets ideas, wears a lemur for a belt and is always trying to follow the sun, she is smitten. When earthquakes ravish the Croods' home, the clan is forced to follow Guy on his strange quest to find the perfect place to live. <br/><br/>This leads to a most incredible journey filled with frenetic chases, narrow escapes and a burgeoning love between the two young leads. An increasingly irrelevant dad, of course, does everything he can to break up this budding romance, leaving the audience wondering not only will the group survive, but what will become of the star-crossed lovers.<br/><br/>It's a legitimate question too, since by the end, we really do care about this family, despite their goofy encounters and weird situations. <br/><br/>And even though the movie feels longer than its short 98-minute running time (children at the screening I attended began to become a little restless before the conclusion), ""The Croods"" is the first family flick of the year to check out."
"moviescoundrel","7","0","2","4 April 2013"," Not a horrible animated adventure, but I've had better....
","The review: The opening 15 min. or so was pretty intriguing. The whole family participates in the process of hunting dinner, which is pretty creative and entertaining. Then the daughter meets a young man names Guy, who is not a typical ""cave man"". He has different ideas about hunting, living, and pretty much everything. His ideas clash with those of Grug, the girl's father. Grug has his own ideas about life, and most of them require the family to be inside a cave whenever there is danger and whenever it is dark out. After the family meets Guy, they are curious about his ideas. Their curiosity, coupled with their homeland being destroyed by earthquakes and volcanoes force them to start out on a journey for a new land and a hope of safety. The interactions with the members of the cave family and Guy are pretty humorous most of the time. The members of the family include: Grug- father, protective of entire family, especially Eep. Eep-daughter, kind of likes this ""Guy"" fella, and want s some independence. Ugga-mother, not very vocal, supports Grug, but visibly would like a change like the others. Gran-grandma, Ugga's mother, she doesn't like Grug and is vocal in her dissent for his ideas, this = funny much of the time. Thunk-son, the least intelligent of the bunch, blindly follows, and does some interesting things due to his lack of intelligence. The visuals in this movie are very good, and probably the best part in my opinion. We didn't watch this one in 3D, but I imagine it's very pretty in 3D. The journey got a tad boring for me before they were done, and I didn't love the daughter's constant infatuation with ""Guy"" and rebellion against her father, but it could be because my four year old was with me and I didn't love how she was portrayed and didn't wish her to emulate this behavior anytime soon. Also, I didn't think Grug got enough credit, he was kind of blind to other ideas, but he did keep his family safe and just got constant criticism most of the time from all.<br/><br/>For more, go to www.moviescoundrel.com"

","Ironically, the biggest strength of Dreamworks' bright new animated adventure - which follows an anachronistic family from the prehistoric era - is the cast that are never seen. As the adolescent daughter yearning to explore the world, and the reason the Crood clan must leave their sacred cave, Emma Stone adds a level of vibrancy and energy that has now become expected from the super talented actress. In a bolder, but no less wonderful casting choice, Nicolas Cage is exceptional as the stubborn father who only wants to protect his dearly beloved yet drives them away because of it. The chemistry between Stone and Cage's characters is the film's greatest asset, however Catherine Keener's long-suffering mother/wife, Clark Duke's lovable moron and Ryan Reynolds' modernistic outsider all have their own shining moments, with Cloris Leachman's granny the only weak link among the players. Story-wise there's not much to write home about - the ages old 'living-safe-is-not-living-at-all' message drives the narrative yet thankfully isn't shoved down our throats - and the animation is of the usual standard without ever surpassing it; improvements to both, and a few more laugh-out-loud moments, would've nudged The Croods into real awesomeness. As it stands, this is still a fantastic time-waster come school holidays."
"FlashCallahan","7","0","2","24 March 2013"," Wait..........................Okay......
","The Croods is about a family who do not like change, apart from of course the eldest child who sounds a lot like Emma Stone.<br/><br/>Whenever she wants to venture and do something different, her dad, who sounds like Nicolas Cage, always refers to his stories and states that anything new will end up with them getting killed.<br/><br/>Emma ventures out one night, meets Ryan Reynolds, where he warns her about the end, and so this takes the titular family on an adventure like noting they have experienced before, because they haven't experienced anything before.....<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that really surprised me, not because the animation looks really beautiful, or Nicolas Cage is really restraint for most of the film, but the fact that its actually good fun and hilarious throughout.<br/><br/>You could be forgiven if, like me, you thought it would be Cage and the old woman arguing through the film. This does happen, but the makers haven't been that predictable, and kept this to a minimum, making it all the more funnier.<br/><br/>This focuses more on inevitable change, and getting the traditionalist person (here Dad) and getting him to accept the change.<br/><br/>There are many troupes in the movie, Not liking Reynolds, everyone turning on Cage, Cage and Reynolds bonding after a near death experience.<br/><br/>But it doesn't matter, because it all feels fresh, and it seems that the makers have done a little tribute to those cheap prehistoric movies that Doug McClure starred in in the seventies.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's predictable, but doesn't throw it in the audiences face, and it looks really good too.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing."
