"SKG-2","8","87","103","5 April 2000"," Cusack continues winning streak with this film
","I read the novel when it first came out because the title intrigued me, and I found it quite good.  When I heard John Cusack was adapting it and moving the action to Chicago(from London in the novel), I was a little worried, because I worry about changing things during adaptations for arbitrary reasons, but I needn't have worried; though I have a few quibbles, which we'll get to later, Cusack and Co. have done a fine job adapting the novel.<br/><br/>First off, I've read one comment which claims it stereotypes ""music geeks."" The type of people Hornby, Cusack, his co-writers(D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink, who also co-wrote GROSSE POINT BLANK, and Scott Rosenberg), and director Stephen Frears are portraying is a very particular type of ""music geek""; the type who is a snob about music.  Almost all of us, I would say, are aggressive about our likes and dislikes when it comes to music, but not many, I agree, compare liking Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel to ""agreeing with both the Israelis and the Palestinians.""  And probably not many of us would be so cut off from feelings that, when hearing about a person's death, would find no better way of expressing their sorrow than listing their top 5 songs about death.  Yet we do like these people as characters because we see even if they have some snotty attitudes, they do have a genuine love for their music, and they're in a low-paying job because they love what they do. And who among us hasn't turned to music when we've felt sad(or happy), like Rob does, or wished that Bruce Springsteen(and a pox on the person who, in their comments, implied he was passe.  Bruce will NEVER be passe) would talk to us directly like he talks to us through his music?  The novel and the movie captures all of that.<br/><br/>Another strength, of course, is Cusack's performance.  Woody Allen once said that while American actors were very good at playing virile men of action, there weren't many who could play more ""normal,"" regular people.  Cusack, on the other hand, has carved out a niche for himself playing regular guys.  He doesn't look like The Boy Next Door, and he's neither stereotypically sensitive or hip, but comes across as a guy who feels both at ease and yet still longs for something more.  At his best, like in movies such as THE SURE THING, SAY ANYTHING, THE GRIFTERS, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, GROSSE POINT BLANK, and this, he plays people on the cusp of growing up, who are able to if they want to, but aren't sure if they want to, and yet he's made each of them different.  Rob's condition may be a little more conventional - he's not sure if he wants to settle down yet - but Cusack, while unafraid to show his unlikable qualities, makes us like Rob anyway.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also quite good.  The well-known names only get short takes(Lisa Bonet, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones), but they make the most of their time.  I've never seen Iben Hjejle before(I haven't seen MIFUNE), but she does well as the most grown-up person in the movie.  But the real stars, besides Cusack and the music, are Jack Black and Todd Louiso as Rob's co-workers.  Black especially reminds me of people I knew.<br/><br/>As I said, I do have some quibbles.  There are a couple of incidents in the book which don't make it to the film which I would have liked to see(the Sid James Experience, and the lady who wanted to sell Rob a ton of valuable records for a ridiculously low price).  I'm getting tired of movies which use rain as an expression of sorrow, and this is an example of overuse.  And the character of Laura isn't developed as well in the movie as she was in the novel.  Nevertheless, this is well worth checking out."
"MovieAddict2016","8","133","168","13 December 2004"," One of the best of all comedies but also a very poignant study of male life
","Having read the very good Nick Hornby novel of the same name I looked forward to ""High Fidelity"" quite a bit, but I never expected it to be as good as it is. This is easily one of the best comedies of all time for its laughs alone - but what separates it from other comedies (particularly new-age ones) is that it's a very poignant multi-layered tale that focuses, primarily, on males - and why we are as we are. Love, life, relationships, music, movies, hobbies, jobs, ticks, ups, downs - everything is here.<br/><br/>It's to John Cusack's credit that he took a ""classic"" contemporary novel set in London and transposed it to Chicago - and it works just as well (if not better) than the British version. It shows what a universal story this actually is, if so many people from all over the world can appreciate it, no matter where it is set. What we lose here are the abbreviations such as ""mate,"" ""cos"" and other British expressions - but essentially the story is exactly the same, as is the character of Rob Gordon.<br/><br/>Cusack proves his worth here and there isn't a single bad performance in this film, except perhaps for the love interest who tries to sport an American accent and it's quite uneven at times.<br/><br/>Jack Black is fantastically funny and reveals once again why he's leagues ahead of other obese comedians like Chris Farley who merely relied on OTT acts and weight for laughs - Black, like John Candy, actually acts and so far in his career has turned out some really good films which is more than can be said for many of his competitors.<br/><br/>The script has some very funny one-liners and movie/music in-jokes (I love the ""Evil Dead"" bit - ""Because it's so funny, and violent, it's got a kick-a$$ soundtrack...and it's so violent!"").<br/><br/>But at the end of the day what really haunted me (so to speak) about this movie long after I had seen it was the fact that it DOES stay with you ages after the credits have stopped rolling. It's poignant and really spot-on in many regards - add that to a film full of flawless performances and great direction and clever ideas and one-liners and jokes, and you've got a top-notch comedic masterpiece that places ""High Fidelity"" in the top ranks of American (and British!) comedy - ""with,"" as the DVD back cover says, ""a bullet."" Highly recommended. 5/5"
"Patuquitos","9","61","76","9 October 2005"," Now this is what I would call a musical
","It was about time someone put together a film with a genuine appreciation for the love/music connection that didn't end up being something along the lines of ""Singles"". For music lovers who tend to put a soundtrack to everything they experience, this film is a blessing. I am one of those people, so I understand that if you're not, you'll get less from the movie. All I'm trying to say is that this is one of those films that demand you to root for the characters and the events if you want to enjoy it. The deeper the affection you feel for them, the more you'll enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Personally, I think John Cusack's character is one of the most engaging in the comedy genre of the last decade. This is the kind of character I like: simple and complex at the same time, just like in real life. Somebody likable but annoying at times. Again, I feel a deep personal connection with him, and I understand him every time, even when he acts stupid.<br/><br/>But he is not alone. The rest of the cast is terrific.<br/><br/>Anyway, don't forget this is a comedy. You will laugh your ass off with some situations and dialogue. Hilarity comes from many different sources: you've got black humor, silly humor, complex (people would say ""intelligent"", but I despise the term) humor... Special mention goes to Tim Robbins paying a visit to the record store. Genius.<br/><br/>On a very personal level, I think there's a magnificent scene that sums up the heart and the brains of this movie. John Cusack talks to the camera (something that happens often) instructing the audience on how to make a perfect music compilation for your loved one. If you like that concept, the movie will grab you and won't let you go. If that idea doesn't sound seductive to you, you might just have a good time. If you are a rock music devotee, this flick is heaven.<br/><br/>RATING: 9.0"
"the ninja","Null","88","115","16 April 2000"," Music is the soundtrack to your life
","And High Fidelity shows that this is more true for Rob Gordon (John Cusack) than most people. Rob owns Championship Vinyl, a record store where he and his two employees, Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), argue about music and insult customers. This is the background for a fantastic movie early in the year and one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>The movie's main plot is Rob recounting his past breakups via his favorite organizing device, the Top 5 List. He purposely excludes his most recent girlfriend, Laura, from it. He is trying to deal with her leaving him for a strange, world music-listening, martial arts-doing freak named Ian (Tim Robbins). Then he decides to look up all his old girlfriends, and in the process finds out a lot about himself.<br/><br/>The best scenes, however, are those in the record store - Todd Louiso and especially the utterly hilarious Jack Black steal every scene they're in. They argue over music incessantly, and anyone who knows a good deal about music will be laughing hysterically during these scenes. Dick is a quiet music geek in the classic sense of the word, while Barry is a cruel, ridiculous elitist.<br/><br/>In the end, High Fidelity is a wonderful, terribly funny movie with a lot of great stuff in it. See it."
"Funkapus","10","50","63","13 December 2002"," Honesty Never Felt So Good
","Who says familiarity breeds contempt?  In this film of heart break, betrayal, true friendship, and love, Cusak adapts Hornby's book perfectly, melding self doubt, fear of death, and a search for truth with modern cinema and pop music.  Rob, Dick, and Barry are all struggling men in their late twenties (thirties in the book) trying to find a way to identify themselves, and live at peace.  Rob has the most conflict as he flounders through one relationship to another, never getting comfortable, and always finding a way to mess it up.  It's a brilliant tale of coming to terms with reality, and having a bit of fun along the way.  The casting was pheonimal, scenes perfectly picked, and music parallelling that of the mood set in the book. It's just a shame so much had to be cut.  I would recommend this movie to anyone with a calloused ear and a desire to finally relate with a character."

","You don't need to be a John Cusack fan to enjoy High Fidelity, nor do you need an overt appreciation of music, the film is a highly humorous, poignant and informative look at men, relationships and love.<br/><br/>Cusack is at his 'Grosse Point Blank' best here, investing in his character a realism that at times is so hilarious you will need to see the movie again to hear the lines you missed the first time because you were laughing too much. His emotionally strung-out breakdown is disturbing. Here is an actor that knows his craft and knows it well.<br/><br/>Watch out for the air-conditioning 'alternate outcome' scene. It still makes me laugh!<br/><br/>Cusack is by far a more talented performer than many on the scene and 'High Fidelity' is a testiment to this."

","One of my favorite movies, based on one of my favorite books. ""High Fidelity"" is perfect if you already had a broken heart, and if you tried to heal it with some pop songs.<br/><br/>John Cusack is not acting - he REALLY IS Rob Fleming (Rob Gordon in the movie). If there are doubts about it, I just say that he made the soundtrack compilation and collaborated with the screenplay.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also perfect. Jack Black and Todd Louiso couldn't be better. Tim Robbins, as the world-music-fan, is a nice surprise, and Joan Cusack is always funny.<br/><br/>It looks like everyone had a lot of fun making this movie, and the result is a nice and funny and full of emotions motion picture, to see again and again and again to remember how music and love can help each other."

","Well, I don't know. The further one goes back on the IMDb 'Top 250' lists, the quality of pictures that made it seems to get weaker and weaker, and here's an example. ""High Fidelity"" was at #205 in the year 2000 when it first came out, dropping to #241 the following year. That it doesn't appear again since should not surprise discerning movie watchers. It's entertaining enough if stuff like this is your thing, but really, should a twelve year old that you made out with once for a total of six hours over the course of three days be on your Top Five All-Time Break Up List? By the end of the story, you'll more than realize that Rob Gordon (John Cusack) seriously needs to get a life. But by that time, you'll probably be bored to tears over his incessant barrage on the fourth wall of your viewing screen. <br/><br/>I will say I got a kick out of Jack Black's character Barry, the snobbishly arrogant music fan who works at Rob's 'Championship Vinyl' record shop. The same with Dick (Todd Louiso), but come to think of it, do you think they collected a paycheck there? I tend to doubt it, as most of the time, it was only the three of them in the store at any given time. And this is the only time I've ever seen Lisa Bonet as an adult after all those years as Cliff Huxtable's daughter on 'The Cosby Show'. So that was a surprise, and a very good looking one too. <br/><br/>The one thing I'll agree with though is that ""Books, records, films..., these things matter"", otherwise I wouldn't be posting reviews here on IMDb. But as a service to adults over say, the age of thirty, save yourself the frustration of sitting thought this picture. Chances are you lived through the angst of this story yourself already, and who needs to be reminded of all that? And if you have your own Top Five list of All-Time Break Ups, better chuck it before the wife or significant other find it, or you'll be talking to the TV yourself."
"george.schmidt","Null","37","50","11 May 2004"," Classic Cusack: One of the year's very best!
","HIGH FIDELITY (2000) **** John Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Jack Black, Todd Louiso, Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones (unbilled), Lili Taylor, Joan Cusack, Shannon Stillo, Tim Robbins, Joelle Carter, Natasha Gregson Wagner.<br/><br/>John Cusack is my favorite contemporary actor for many reasons, which due to time and space will not permit me to go into lavish detail, but it's basically down to a simple formula for me, that he continues to full tilt in his latest variation of the good hearted, somewhat sarcastic anti-hero with a heart of gold: Fearless Fragile Funny.<br/><br/>Based on the cult best selling international novel by Great Britain's Nick Hornby the story is transplanted from modern day London to modern day Chicago focusing all its angst and comic philosophies in its character, Rob Gordon (Cusack in one of his finest performances, who also co-wrote and produced the film),<br/><br/>the owner of a vintage LP album shop, `Championship Vinyl', who is having a pre-mid-life crisis in his life: namely his latest girlfriend, Laura (the fetching Danish actress Hjejle in her first American role), a lawyer, has just dumped him and the fact that he may have to grow up or come to terms with his existence of being a den mother to his yin and yang clerks, Barry (Black, riotous) and Dick (Louiso, best known as the au pair from `Jerry Maguire', is pitch perfect in his humorous approach), the former a loudmouth know it all and the latter a soft-spoken lover of all music, both the book ends to Rob's equally passionate take on pop music and how it has somehow manifested itself to his  being ; the end all to end all.<br/><br/>`What came first.the misery or the music?' Rob asks at the very beginning of the film and it is here that Rob decides to investigate just how he is at fault to the 5 all time greatest break ups in his love life a la The Top 5s he and his co-horts in crime habitually categorize all things pertinent to music.  What follows is a laugh-filled introspection of the heart on its sleeve and its tongue sharply in cheek as to Rob's quest of finding all his faults and foibles in hope of wooing back his recent romantic dismissal that includes 5 prototypes of all heterosexual men: The First Kiss/Crush; The Adolescent Urgency/Loss of Virginity, The Woman Out of His League; The Rebound Best Friend/Possible Soul Mate and finally, The One True Love He Isn't Even Aware Of.<br/><br/>The approach may seem old hat and gimmicky (Cusack breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly into the camera) yet it isn't intrusive but enlightening into what the hero is really thinking and more importantly why.  Surrounded by a truly winning cast, Cusack shines once again as a likable average guy who is trying to remain a guy although the inner voice of Be A Man is palpable and reverberating inside.  His nonchalant, casual way of speaking and his slow burns are priceless (he finally takes out his frustrations on Laura's new beau, the unctious sensitive pony-tailed Ian played by Cusack's best bud and former co-star of `The Sure Thing' and the cult classic `Tapeheads', Robbins, in the film's funniest fantasy sequence of Rob, Barry and Dick pummeling Ian to death). Cusack's constant streak of the smart alecky good guy continues from the quintessential portrait of Lloyd Dobler, kickboxing student of the affairs of the heart in the classic `Say Anything.' and the previous purveyor of romantic comedy, Walter `Gib' Gibson in the update of `It Happened One Night', `The Sure Thing' to his hit-man Martin Blank pondering his high school reunion with dread in the black comedy  `Grosse Pointe Blank' (reunited here with his screenwriters/partners in crime D.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg).<br/><br/>The women portraying Rob's Girlfriends of Christmas Past , so to speak, are exemplery especially Taylor (another Cusack repertoire player, who played his best gal pal/voice of reason in `Anything.') as Sarah the rebound fling and Zeta-Jones as Charlie (showing some nice moments of sublime sardonicism), the sexy babe completely out of his element). Bonet has a few nice moments as local singer Marie De Salle who provides some unsubtle ways of bringing Rob to his senses.  Sister Joan provides some comic bile as well as mutual friend to Laura and Rob. But frankly it's a guy's flick and thanks to the boisterous Black (late of HBO's comedy series `Tenacious D' and a score of films as diverse as `Mars Attacks!' and last year's co-starring with Cusack in  `Cradle Will Rock') and geeky, quiet Louiso adding some color especially in their scenes together debating their varied choices of musical tastes.<br/><br/>Directed by Stephen Frears, a fellow Englishman who appears to know the American arcana striking a responsive chord (he put Cusack through the paces in the neo-noir classic `The Grifters' a decade ago) allows his characters time to pace themselves from one setup to the next and skillfully keeps the smart patter gleaned from the book alive on screen.<br/><br/>Easily one of the year's funniest films and finally  a film I whole heartedly recommend in what seemed to be dearth of mediocrity thus far in the new millennium.  To paraphrase the emergence of Bruce Springsteen (who has a funny cameo) into rock's pantheon I will allude this to comedy: I have seen the future and it is John Cusack.  Rock On!"

","High Fidelity is directed by Stephen Frears and adapted to screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg from the Nick Hornby novel. It stars Cusack, Jack Black, Iben Hjejle and Todd Louiso. Music is by Howard Shore and Cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.<br/><br/>Record store owner and compulsive list-compiler Rob Gordon (Cusack), embark's upon a what does it all mean mission when his latest girlfriend leaves him.<br/><br/>Cusack and Pink take Hornby's hugely popular novel and redirect it to Chicago, with joyous results. High Fidelity is a tale of human love and a love of music, a sort of battle of the sexes with a soundtrack of masculine life. Rob's voyage of self discovery is highly amusing, the trials and tribulations of relationships bringing out a number of scenes and scenarios that ring true, not just tickling the funny bones, but also tugging the heart and cradling the brain.<br/><br/>Away from the doomed love angles it's the music threads that literally strike the chords. Rob and his two co-workers Barry (Black) & Dick (Louiso) worship music and continually indulge in making top 5 lists whilst bickering with sarcastic glee in the process. All three actors are superb, a trio of odd balls bouncing off of one and other with a zest that's infectious, though it's decidedly Cusack's show. A perpetual miserablist who addresses us the audience at frequent intervals, Rob in Cusack's hands garners sympathy, pity and laughs in equal measure.<br/><br/>In the support slots is a ream of talent well in on the joke, beauties like Catherine Zeta-Jones (dropping F-Bombs like they are going out of fashion), Lisa Bonet & Joelle Carter are complimented by the comic skills of Joan Cusack, while Hjejle turns in a wily and womanly performance as the girlfriend who kicks starts Rob's search for meaning. Elsewhere the sight of Tim Robbins as a new age hippy type - with a black belt in martial arts - is so much fun it reminds of what a good comic actor he can be as well. <br/><br/>As with Grosse Point Blank, another Cusack/Pink production, sound tracking is everything, and naturally given the setting of the story there is an abundance of classic tunes to delight in. All told it's a special movie, for all sexes and for all music lovers, but especially for anyone who has had relationship problems. Now what did come first, the music or the misery? Priceless. 9/10"

","I'm relatively easy to please. If just one thing in a film is an ambitious attempt and it works rather well, it is enough if most of the rest is merely competent. But a competent simple film isn't enough for me. Good acting alone isn't enough.<br/><br/>This film takes one chance and does it in my favorite area -- Cinema is essentially a superficial medium; it cannot capture an internal dialogue as a link with the viewer/reader like a novel can -- or at least not without taking chances.<br/><br/>Cusack deserves a lot of credit for what he's done here in playing with the link between movie and viewer.<br/><br/>(Caution! Some may see these as spoilers...)<br/><br/>--He has a dialog directly with the viewer, that dialog is often in the very context of the action, and the matter of the dialog is substantially different (more honest) than what he has with any character.<br/><br/>--One episode has three different versions. This is a part of the dialog with the viewer. It is a point of art that the effect is only used once.<br/><br/>--The dialog is essentially about the relationship between events and the soundtack of life as if it were a movie, so when a musician (Bruce Springsteen) comes from the soundtrack to the action, it blurs the distinction. Very clever.<br/><br/>--As the film is about music as analog (""using someone else's poetry"" to annotate or even activate your life) it's rather elegant how Cusack has created a soundtrack for us in precisely the way he creates DJ tapes, like the one for his wife at the end.<br/><br/>This film takes intelligent chances with that tough boundary and makes them work.

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","15","27","27 January 2001"," This one really shocked me. I don't even like John Cusack, but I loved High Fidelity.
","Why was High Fidelity so good? That's the question that has been going through my mind ever since I saw it. There really wasn't anyone spectacular involved with it. I mean, it's not like Tom Hanks was in it or Steven Spielberg directed it. But somehow, it ended up being just a great comedy.<br/><br/>High Fidelity just had a really entertaining story, and it was extremely well acted by everyone involved. This is what I have come up with in my mission to find out what it was about High Fidelity that made me like it so much. Sure, there's not a whole lot to the story  a guy gets dumped and goes back and recounts his relationships and break-ups with his top five girlfriends, but it was presented in such a clever way that it made bland material a lot of fun. <br/><br/>One of the things that was really good about High Fidelity was the way the `top five girlfriends' premise was complemented by Rob Gordon (Cusack) and his music geek friends coming up with countless top five lists. Top five dream jobs, top five first songs on music albums, top five this, top five that. Anyone who is into top five lists or top ten lists will probably love High Fidelity just for that small part of it. Speaking of Gordon's music geek friends, the person who really stole the show was Jack Black, as Barry, one of Gordon's employees at the record store that he owns in the film. This is particularly notable given the variety of unenviable roles that Black has played, such as those in Cable Guy and, more recently, The Jackal. The hilarious music discussion scenes that take place in the record store are probably the best scenes in the film, and Black steals nearly every one of them. <br/><br/>Almost as amusing as Black was Todd Louiso, playing the part of Dick, another employee at Gordon's record store. Dick is a very soft-spoken music fanatic who is probably so entertaining because we've known someone like him. In fact, that's what is so appealing about Gordon and Barry, too. They are a cross-section of music fans in the urban world and they provide many more laughs because of their familiarity. <br/><br/> A number of well-known actors also played relatively small roles in High Fidelity, such as Catherine Zeta-Jones, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Joan Cusack, and, of course, Tim Robbins as the antagonistic new boyfriend.' One of the really good things about High Fidelity is that it eventually delivers a good message about stepping up and actually doing something with your life. It warns of the dangers of getting too comfortable doing one thing, and of giving in to the temptation of hopping from relationship to brief relationship. At the end, Rob begins to realize the mistakes that he made in his relationship with Laura, and these are mistakes that I think a lot of people have made and continue to make. <br/><br/>High Fidelity is just good comedy. It's fun, it's entertaining, and above all, it's refreshing because of it's relative originality. There are plenty of memorable scenes in the film, many because of their sheer, if illogical, hilarity. Some of the customers who come into the record store are treated much worse than they would ever be treated in real life, but the laughs are delivered. Don't miss this one."
"Red-Barracuda","10","5","7","26 May 2014"," Excellent romantic-comedy about a musical obsessive
","I remember reading Nick Hornby's novel 'High Fidelity' and laughing out loud an awful, awful lot. The characters were so well drawn and the comedy was right on the mark. I suppose I saw parts of myself in there I would have to admit. Although admittedly, while I did organise my CD collection alphabetically, I was never tempted to sort it biographically! The story in a nutshell centres on a mid-thirties music geek who slowly accepts his adult responsibilities, while never actually discarding his obsessions. It's obviously great fun for those with certain musical tastes, seeing as it features references to important alternative acts such as The Beta Band and Stereolab, amongst many others.<br/><br/>But what elevates the film higher is, like the book, it has three dimensional characters that are believable and it has a strong romantic-comedy aspect. Like the very best rom-coms its observations about relationships are intelligent and the characters are ones we root for. John Cusack as the main character Rob is in fine form in a role where he is a sympathetic lead, a selfish idiot and an amusing music geek. It's a multi-layered performance. Iben Hjejle as his long suffering girlfriend Laura impresses a lot too. We completely understand why Rob wants her around but it's not hard to see why Laura has serious issues with their relationship. Hjejle, like Cusack, is given quite a lot to work with and her performance also has quite a bit of emotional range. The rest of the cast is very good too with Jack Black playing the ultimate obnoxious music snob, Tim Robbins is equally amusing as the even-tempered neighbour Ian, who briefly has a relationship with Laura much to Rob's horror, while Lisa Bonet and Catherine Zeta-Jones are also on hand as other women who come into Rob's orbit.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Frears and producer Cusack have to be given a lot of credit for adapting Hornby's book to the screen so seamlessly. The novel is set in the UK but the movie is set in America. Some of the references have had to change accordingly but none of the amendments make any difference to the overall impact; in fact it makes it an interesting contrast if anything. My advice is simple - watch the film and read the book. You won't regret either."

","John Cusack is the star, and one of the screenwriters and co-producers, of this likeable adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel. At its core, it capably tells a good romantic story, and does a very amusing job at poking fun at people who lord their supposedly superior musical knowledge (and tastes) over others. It's got an attractive and endearing cast, and it naturally also has a non-stop, eclectic soundtrack.<br/><br/>Cusack plays Rob, the neurotic owner of a record store that is far from prosperous. His employees are the timid Dick (Todd Louiso) and the far more brash Barry (Jack Black, who walks away with the film). After his longtime girlfriend Laura (charming Danish actress Iben Hjejle) dumps him for another man, it forces him to take stock and reflect on the major relationships - and break-ups - of his life.<br/><br/>Cusack is typically engaging, although this viewer could have done without that over-used device of having the main character directly address the camera. The film itself, despite being a little overlong, has some good laughs. I cracked up when Rob fantasized possible reactions to the annoying Ian (an amusing Tim Robbins), including a scenario of him, Barry, and Dick beating the almighty hell out of him.<br/><br/>Some intelligent and pointed dialogue is brought to life by this talented cast, with a steady parade of lovely ladies (Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, Joelle Carter) as the women who have caught Robs' eyes over the years. Rob himself is not too sympathetic for much of the running time, but then, that is the whole point as it takes a while to pinpoint himself as a common denominator, and have his eventual epiphany.<br/><br/>Nice cameo by rock star Bruce Springsteen, too.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

"angelic_wounds","9","2","2","25 December 2017"," Might be the only rom - com that throws the spotlight to a male character
","Most rom - coms made in Hollywood were either told by a woman or written/thought by one, so we always got a one sided affair that contained emotional swings, unreal scenarios, fantasy endings and plot twists that only strengthen the happy ending; an ideal scenario to a female fantasy regarding love, born out of fairytales. Additionally, when such movies were more realistic and on the mature side, they continued to tell the story through a woman's lenses. <br/><br/>High Fidelity is such a poignant chapter in the Hollywood annals of romantic comedies precisely because it breaks the norm - the story of love, sorrow, confliction, friendship and personal psyche is finally told by a male's point of view, and explained in a very realistic scenario of a simple, every day man. Rob Gordon (John Cusack) owns a record store in Chicago, and he is going through a break up. A man who always seems to have everything sorted and in order, he narrates through the whole movie, cataloguing his top 5 break ups up to the recent one, explaining the reason they occurred.<br/><br/>Through the course of the film, we see him going through the motions of his break up, the so called five stages of grief, so to speak. Along the way, with his ex - girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) constantly on the forefront of his mind, Rob tries to sort out his feelings, going into deep musical conversations with his employees Barry (Jack Black), an elitist music lover who often connects day events with a ""top 5 tracklist"", and Dick (Todd Louiso), the sentimental part of the trio. Along the way, Rob goes through a soul search of his own, eventually coming to conclusions about his character, his behaviour, and acceptance that for love and a relationship to survive, you have to take a leap of faith into the unknown.<br/><br/>Do not believe that this movie is anything sappy, for it remains a comedy for the bigger portion of its 2 hour course. Black ensembles a perfect character on himself, and you'll definitely laugh with his constant opinion on contemporary and old music alike, especially when he downgrades a poor old customer about it. Cusack is as believable as it gets, bringing forth every emotion possible associated with falling in love, from anger to envy, and nostalgia to care. <br/><br/>Above all, it's a very educational film into the male psyche, and will definitely become a favourite of both genders, because it lacks any ""fairytale ending"". It's a dive into an emotional trip, seen through the eyes of an everyday man, where it is bound to stay with you long after the credits roll."

","This movie captures so perfectly the perspective of many who love music: to have such passion for a band, to take pride in knowing lesser known artists, their influences, and music trivia, and to snobbishly judge others for what they listen to, even though it's all of course personal and subjective. It's also a pretty good movie about the difficulty of relationships. John Cusack is talented, funny, and likable as a record store owner floundering his way through breakups, mainly because as much as he's an expert on music, he's a dunce about women. He often talks directly to the camera, drifting back to memories and musing over various 'top five' lists.

"sharky_55","8","2","2","23 July 2016"," Is this the new Green Day?
","Rob Gordon is stuck in middle-age purgatory, constantly flitting from relationship to relationship when asked to take an step forward and grow. Like Woody Allen's characters in his great romantic comedies, who couldn't help from making a joke of all but the gravest of situations, he segments and designates his life by his love of music. He and his two friends share this talent of musical elitism and snobbery; they spend all day berating the poor taste of their customers, they immediately try to define any real life scenario with the best song to fit, and then every now and again they even sell a record. But Stephen Frears isn't just playing the bad guy; Rob's passion for music, however snobbish, is authentic, and Frears finds a way to elicit not only humour out of it, but eventually good. They want to broaden the tastes of the wider public, and Cusack is so confident in his love for The Beta Band and their ability to turn heads and ears. When two youthful thieves run off with a bunch of records, they furiously give chase, before the confrontation turns into a hilarious argument about the poor taste of their stolen records. Frears plays this straight, making it funnier, but also seeding the roots of Rob's passion and eventual discovery of the pair's talent. Naturally, he wants to help foster and let others hear it too. <br/><br/>Cusack is the perfect choice. He is a product of his early career, the teen movies, and he brings this experience and baggage into his portrayal of Rob. Much of the exposition has him talking and facing the camera, narrating his own story, as if he was one of those directors or writers who make themselves the main and best character. So the frames close in on his story, the backgrounds vanish, and Cusack motions and pours out his life story for the audience. His voice-over is angry, volatile, unable to consider any perspective other than his own, and has self-depreciating quality that swiftly sheds himself of any blame. Perplexed, he beings a journey of diving back into his past to discover exactly the reason for his failed relationships. When he meets an ex who is similarly despondent, he recognises the same signs of ""sad, single person culture"", but has no empathy. He is too high and mighty for that. <br/><br/>The best scenes of the film come from his back and forth with his most recent ex-girlfriend Laura, who has finally had enough and packed the bags. This is where Rob is at his most self-righteous, most unaware. The messy breakup process is very clearly painful for her to, but Rob is only concerned with himself, so he sabotages each encounter with her with crass, unimportant queries. He feels entitled to have a say in the negotiation of this period, so he assaults her with a barrage of requests and phone-calls, and because she is much nicer and more mature than him, she plays along. Rob seems to have picked out the score for the film himself; when it seems certain that they will not get back together, it croons with Velvet Underground. And in a moment which completely illustrates his lack of sensitivity and maturity, he jumps for joy to Queen's We Are the Champions, just because Laura has not yet consummated her next relationship. Very funny, and very sad indeed. <br/><br/>But of course they do eventually, and Rob, whose short-sightedness prevented him from seeing so, descends back into the mopey, 'the whole world is against me routine'. He calls her in the night, soaking in the rain and holding back tears, blubbering and trying to win her back. This act is so perfectly reminiscent of Cusack's iconic moment in Say Anything, holding the stereo aloft all night. The connection works because Cusack is no longer a teenager, but still held ransom by these teenage swings of emotion, so heart-wrenching he can barely function. <br/><br/>What prevents High Fidelity from being a great film is how it momentarily slips up into soppy, conventional romantic comedy territory. Much of the film is ruthless in its dissection of Rob's faults, but it all falls into place like a typical romance does when he and Laura get back together. Laura is barely a character here; she simply flops over for him, conveniently sweeping Ian aside to reward an undeserving Rob with sex. It so clearly feels like one of his 'cool' fantasies that I was begging for the scene to rewind. Instead the film acts like a broken record, skipping ahead of the implied complications to that sweet-toothed ending. It isn't a bad ending; there is nothing wrong with expecting Rob to pick up the pieces of his life and finally move forward in his relationship. But it does seem like a bit of a let off."

","""Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?""<br/><br/>Stephen Frear's High Fidelity breaks the fourth wall from the very opening scene as Rob Gordon (John Cusack) begins sharing with us about his top 5 breakups right at the time his girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), is moving out of his apartment and leaving him. It is evident he is hurt, but he brushes it off by saying she doesn't even rank in his list of the most hurtful breakups. That is when he begins listing who each one of them were while we get flashbacks of those memories intertwined with the present in which we are introduced to his job, friends, and his passion for music. Rob is a vintage record store owner and his two employees, Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), are as much music snobs as he is, and they too enjoy making lists of their favorite things usually involving music. The more we get to know Rob, we realize that he isn't the typical romantic character we'd find in a film like this. He is deeply flawed, he has cheated on his girlfriend, he doesn't seem to be going anywhere with his life, and he is afraid of commitment. Somehow he always believes to be the victim in the break-ups, but from what he says we know that he has never been boyfriend of the year material. It is hard to root for a character like Rob, but John Cusack delivers such a charismatic and engaging performance that we accept his flaws and want him to get over the heartbreak. Along the way he realizes that Laura really belongs on the list and decides to revisit some of his past flames to discover what he has been doing wrong. <br/><br/>Frears has directed some great films (The Queen, Philomena), along with not so good ones that feel like direct to TV movies, but High Fidelity belongs in his top list of best films. It is a romantic comedy that has an entertaining script, some great performances, and of course a wonderful soundtrack. The screenplay was adapted from Nick Horny's book but instead of setting the story in London they bring it to Chicago and it absolutely works. Jack Black and Todd Louiso give strong supporting performances and you believe they actually are these snobs who are living music encyclopedias. They complement Cusack's performance and deliver most of the comedic moments. As for John Cusack I believe this is one of his best performances although I still need to see a couple more of his films to solidify that claim. The romance in High Fidelity is also incredibly believable and relatable which is hard to come across by in most rom-coms. Neither Cusack nor Hjejle are portrayed as these perfect role models in a relationship, they are both flawed characters who have made some poor decisions.<br/><br/>Even though my music knowledge is very limited, I was able to relate to these characters because of their shared passion. I may not have that same passion for music, but I do for movies or sports so I understood where these characters were coming from and believed the culture this film created surrounding music. The screenwriters knew what they were writing about and each one of the actors delivered, and that is what has made High Fidelity such a cult favorite for many teens. It manages to be smart and funny at the same time. It is also one of the best examples of a film successfully being able to break the fourth wall and including the audience in the genius of the movie and its charm. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

"eschetic","7","3","4","20 December 2006"," Decidedly endearing (seek out the flop musical which followed! It's even better!!)
","For all the apparent (if modest) success which greeted the release of this film adaptation of Nick Hornby's well remembered British novel about the owner of a second hand record store and his trouble with women and life (some might say ""growing up""), it was a 14 performance (ie. commercially failed) Broadway musical (December 7-17, 2006) by respected playwright David Lindsay-Abaire with composer Tom Kitt and lyricist Amanda Green (daughter of Adolph) which first brought me to the movie to explore how the adaptation had been done. <br/><br/>The movie proved droll and endearing and captured most of the best lines and situations which later highlighted the more focused stage piece. Even better, the DVD release fleshed out several of the characters through the always welcome ""deleted scenes"" bonuses and very interesting interviews with film director Stephen Frears. <br/><br/>While the movie moves the action from author Hornby's more atmospheric London to Chicago (presumed Middle-America appeal? The later musical would further relocate the action to Brooklyn), the essence of the characters is international: the ""slacker"" who is satisfied with his life and doesn't want to change a thing, the friends who both want him to and (even when they don't want to) are changing their own lives around him and the fast dying world of the passionate record (LP) collector (but you could substitute ANY collection and the story would be as valid).<br/><br/>Ultimately, we see him find that he must change to truly remain the same, and if the details (not to be revealed here) are mildly mundane, they are also believable and well acted. Other authors (BILLY LIAR) have taken the story in other directions - the hero refuses to change when led to the brink and falling back, but they were ultimately tragedies. This is a life affirming comedy. A happy story that wants to make us feel ""grownup"" and largely succeeds. <br/><br/>I've never been a real John (or Joan) Cusack fan, but both are at their peak form here. (Joan is the old friend who is a good enough friend to call John every name in the book and embarrass him in front of a new friend or client when she discovers he's done something to his girlfriend, Iben Hjejle, which already makes him feel as guilty as possible). They are joined by a well chosen supporting cast. <br/><br/>Jack Black is quietly perfect as the wanna-be rock-star record clerk who is infuriatingly ""pure"" in his tastes. Lisa Bonet and Sara Gilbert are essentially thrown away in parts almost too small to be remembered.<br/><br/>The old stage technique of having the lead break the ""fourth wall"" and speak directly to the audience (ala Jerry Orbach in the stage PROMISES, PROMISES or Matthew Broderick in the FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF movie) is perfect for this story which could just as well have been an entirely interior monologue in Cussack's head illustrated by scenes from his memory. The feel is refreshing and comfortable.<br/><br/>If ultimately I found myself preferring the later musical which flopped (for any number of reasons - not enough people identifying with LP collectors, poor direction, no identifiable stars and ticket prices ranging from $41 to $111) it is largely because those authors sharpened the story and made it flow even better than the multiple screenwriters (including Cusack) and director Frears had in the motion picture and the later piece added a fine original score with excellent first time lyrics from Green. As of this writing the score has been recorded for release by Sh-k-boom (Ghostlight) Records in May, 2007, so fans of the movie might want to further explore this later incarnation.<br/><br/>Those who have not yet enjoyed the movie shouldn't expect a high powered knock-about roller coaster of hilarity. This is a low powered, intimate charmer with real humor which will ultimately warm your heart. How it merited an ""R"" rating is anyone's guess - I'm sure Frears thought it would help business with late teens. It's worth risking a couple hours (114 minutes) of your time no matter what your age."
"StevePulaski","8","4","6","10 January 2015"," A trip inside the crowded contents of the male psyche
","Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is a man stuck in a rut and that rut is one that occupies childlike sensibilities, an inability to adapt to change, and a lack of understanding, or effort to understand, the women in his life. Rob has yet to really come of age and has been stagnant in his ability to mature and grow up, sticking to what he knows in the most primal sense. He runs a record store with his friends Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), spending most of his days engaging in meaningless conversations about which musicians are better than other musicians, what records have a long-lasting impact over others, and so on, almost as if their musical elitism predated the kind you see in the same place where this film is set, Chicago.<br/><br/>Rob has just gone through a breakup with Laura (Iben Hjejle), a woman he clearly cared about but had no idea how to act on his feelings in a way that pleased her in a significant manner. She was troubled by his childishness and he was unwilling to change for the better. Depressed and distraught, finally questioning what role he had to play in his breakups, Rob cycles through five of his old romantic partners to see if there's some sort of consistent screw-up he is faced with in all his relationships.<br/><br/>High Fidelity works instantly because of Cusack's character and character acting abilities. He embodies Rob Gordon, who we grow to find likable at times, mostly thanks to his quick-witted mannerisms and ability to keep a conversation moving, and incorrigible at others, for his inability to realize that he is his own worst enemy. Cusack's ""cool guy"" approach to the material, complete with first-person narration and frequently employed witticisms, make him nonetheless an interesting protagonist because you can fault him and appreciate him for many reasons, but the main one is that he's human. Louiso and Black work well as the side characters here, in addition, particularly Luiso, who is given some of the funniest lines of the picture. Jack Black is your typical Jack Black character here, but ostensibly boasting more controlled chaos than outright chaos here (either that or his craziness gels well enough with Cusack's coolness that typical results aren't as blatant).<br/><br/>Director Stephen Frears and the quartet of writers at hand here (Cusack himself, D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, and Scott Rosenberg) are commendable because they understand the way males think. If a woman goes through a breakup, as least from what I've seen from my female friends and based off knowledge from films I have seen, she often reevaluates herself, checking herself with her friends to see what could've possibly gone wrong and if she had anything to do with the relationship's demise. Men, from what I've seen from my male friends and other films I have seen, are almost too prideful for that sort of thing, rarely showing too much emotion and holding it in for a rainy day. We move on to hooking up, letting our feelings out to only our closest friends, and simply try to find another woman who will provide us not with the same kind of love but the same feelings as the previous gal did.<br/><br/>Of course I'm speaking in rampant generalities here; the heart of my argument is that so is Frears and his writers. They're evaluating the character based on terms typical of the male psyche, and are effective in at least portraying a pragmatic situation for a character who has been through a plethora of rough breakups. High Fidelity also features the soundtrack from heaven to compliment our leads characters' musical elitism that works to bring life to a screenplay that could've either showed its worn qualities or lessened in impact over time. However, thanks to Cusack as the center of the film, complimented by two other effective actors, the film stands strong and offers us a glimpse into the mind of a male during one of the most vulnerable times in his life.<br/><br/>Starring: John Cusack, Jack Black, Todd Louiso, and Iben Hejejle.

It's as if ""A Night at the Roxbury"" and ""Dick"" were to copulate and have one hideous, deformed movie-child...  that child would be High Fidelity.  Not only does the movie have no redeeming value, but I can't even see what redeeming value it's SUPPOSED to have.  Apparently it was supposed to be a dramatic, romantic comedy, but I can't think of a single moment during the movie at which I felt any emotion other than an outpouring of suicidal rage.  There was no comedy whatsoever (unless gratuitous use of ""F***"" counts as comedy), no romance whatsoever (unless talking about people you had sex with counts as romance), and no drama whatsoever (unless you count the precious seconds until the movie is over).  Avoid this movie like the plague.  In fact, if you have the choice, choose the plague -- I wish I could say that I am exaggerating, but High Fidelity has taken 113 minutes of my life away that could have been used to drown myself in a bathtub so as to never be forced to endure such a horrible, traumatic film."
"Superunknovvn","10","7","13","25 April 2004"," Hey, finally a movie about me!
","I've seen this movie before I read the fantastic book by Nick Hornby which is probably a bad thing to do. Still I think I enjoyed the movie more than the book. The actors are damn good, especially Jack Black whose scenes are the highlights of this film. One must also mention the incredible appearances of Tim Robbins. Has anyone ever given Robbins the credit he deserves for not only being such a talented actor (comedy and serious roles alike), but also an important director (""Dead Man Walking"", ""Cradle Will Rock"")? Anyway, John Cusack (starring for the fifth time in a movie alongside Tim Robbins, I believe) is great once again as the abandoned lover. And although I had problems with her at the beginning I have even gotten to like how Joelle Carter portrays Laura. (I still wish I could recast the movie with Winona Ryder playing this role, though). ""High Fidelity"" is highly recommendable for people with broken hearts and of course for everybody who is as obsessed with pop music as Rob & Nick Hornby are."
"DavidYZ","1","17","40","29 April 2017"," A miserable and irritating film
","This is an awful film that doesn't have any likable characters. It was misleadingly marketed as a fun, happy romcom. It's actually a really bad drama.<br/><br/>John Cusack plays an annoying, miserable record shop owner who incessantly goes on and on about his personal top five of this, that and the other. <br/><br/>Jack Black (as usual) plays an insufferable, juvenile, overbearing, arrogant, hyperactive nuisance."

","Rob is the owner of a small record store who spends his time arguing over record lists with his two hapless employees.  When his relationship hits a bad patch and breaks up, lending Rob to re-examine his life through his top five break-ups while trying to salvage what he can and start his adult life.<br/><br/>`They're setting a Nick Hornby book in America!?'.  How would Fever Pitch have played out if it had been based around American Football and not the Arsenal?  Happily there is one thing different with this book  and that's the fact that the book is about me  it's about men.  And this subject is the same in the UK and the US.  As a result the film is as good as the book because the character and the situation is so very real.  Rob's life may not be a copy of everyone's details but the basic character is so recognisable. A guy who lists everything, is a geek for detail and screws up relationship because he isn't ready to grow up.<br/><br/>If you can recognise yourself then you'll love this movie.  I saw myself and the film meant more to me as a result.  Despite this it is very funny and yet quite touching.  Rob's to-camera delivery works very well and really helps get into the film with minimum work.  It may be a film (hence we have the constant soundtrack and the gorgeous girls that we don't have) but the meaning is the same.<br/><br/>Cusack became one of my favourite working actors with this film even if some of his stuff is mixed.  Here he is the typical man and it's a role he carries without overdoing any of it or without mocking himself.  Black and Louiso are the comedy duo who overdo it to great effect.  They are lesser characters but really help the film. The `girlfriends' are all excellent and a mix of faces  Hjejle is good while Jones, Taylor, Gilbert etc are very funny.  Oh, and Bonet is `oh my God' sexy<br/><br/>Overall this is a great film if you can relate to the central character.  If you can't then you might enjoy the comedy and the story but you won't take as much from it.  I hated Rob because his petty listing and bickering reminded me of myself but it was a good ride nonetheless.  Funny and insightful  all men should watch it rather than arguing over the top five movies which feature male flaws."

","I'm not one of these people who can watch a film over and over again because i get bored to easily but once in a while a film comes a long that you think after watching it"" i would like to see that again"" and High Fidelty is one such film. It stars Nick Cusack as a record store owner who is having a mini mid life crisis when it comes to his relationships. This is a very intelligent movie and funny throughout which i dont say too often about American comedy's but the Yanks cant claim this one for themselves. Although the acting from everyone is superb the real hero of this movie is Nick Hornby the writer. He has written a book that is so engrossing that you cant fail to be mesmerised by the film. If you are new to Nick hornbys work watch the film FEVER PITCH or read the book of the same name , it is of the same mould as Fever Pitch. The best way i can describe Fever pitch and High Fidelty is that they are love stories for both women and men , maybe they are even more suited to men and how many love story's can you say that about? Very,very good. 9 out of 10."

He plays the role well, but the character is so obnoxious, I felt like I wanted to bitch slap him in every scene.<br/><br/>Dick is a decent character, although he is a weenie. He attempts to counteract the over obnoxiousness of Jack Black's character. At least in the parts I saw saw him in, he seemed like  baggage rather than character with something to contribute.<br/><br/>John Cusack plays a perfect generation x recrod store owner. He can never get anything right.

"andrew-hamilton","9","4","7","14 April 2005"," Better Than The Book
","A film being better than the book is pretty unusual, I think, but this is definitely the case here. The main character of the Nick Hornby book is more annoying and dispiriting than the guy played by John Cusack. I couldn't relate to the book-version Rob's mean-spiritedness and his relentless selfishness. Hornby apparently said the book was about 'England', but his main character isn't someone I recognize, and I'm British. Yes, the English have their sad-sacks, but someone this 'sad' (British meaning) is way off the chart, even in places like Peckham. He was a depressing guy to read about. So chopping out the worst excesses of the annoying Rob lightens the tone of the movie a lot, and the fact that they kept the humorous bits in - the top five lists, the musical snobbery, the talking to the camera / reader saying things like 'I swear I'm not making this up' - makes the movie the story the book should have been, I reckon. And the excellent performances from John Cusack (co-writer), Jack Black, and the weird little guy who plays 'Dick' make the funny bits even funnier. All-in-all a really well done movie. From Rob's girlfriend walking out on him at the beginning through to Jack Black's amazing singing at the end, hardly a bum note in the whole piece."

John Cusack, who I don't mind as an actor/performer in general, totally curls up into his Cusack shell with this one, being nothing but himself on the screen (my, what a challenge).  Too many personalities, too many cameos, but no real characters.  Two-thirds of the way through this sneak preview, I overheard someone say, ""This is stupid.""  And soon people were walking out.  Around this time, Cusack yells, ""When will it end?!""  My thoughts exactly, Johnny."

Allison married Kevin! I don't care dude. Leave me alone. Another thing that bothers me here is the unstoppable avalanche of pop culture references. Pretty much every band the writers like is mentioned in this movie, which comes of as pompous in a ""hey, check out the obscure stuff we know"" kind of way. They try their best at clever dialogue, but then bail on that and figure they can just play some Beta Band music. Generally when a movie has a cult status I can at least see why exactly that is, even if I don't like it. Here however, I'm just dumbfounded.

This surprised me given that I am in my mid-20s, worked for years in an indie record store, and knew of every musical artist mentioned.<br/><br/>Anyone who has worked in an indie record store knows how funny employees and customers can be.

"The_Void","10","3","6","10 January 2005"," Top five romantic comedies of this decade so far - number 1...High Fidelity
","Stephen Frears' analysis of one man's love life is a very personal tale of love, told by our hero; Rob Gordon (John Cusack). Despite being predominantly a tale about a love life, High Fidelity also finds time to be a very hip musical study, as well as integrating a fistful of hilarious lines and sequences. As mentioned, the film pans out from the perspective of Rob Gordon; an insecure young man that cant hold a relationship down and so embarks on a personal voyage of discovery to find out why he's doomed to be left. What follows is a journey through Gordon's 'top 5' break-up's, and present insecurities and through this a complete three dimensional portrait of the character is painted in front of the audience's eyes. The way the story is presented is dynamic and makes the film easy to like. Of course, the fact that it's carried by the charismatic John Cusack and features the awesome comedy talents of Jack Black doesn't exactly do it any harm eitherÂ… <br/><br/>This film is a very different take on the classic romantic comedy as the humour is very potent, much more so than the easy humour that the genre usually leaves us with. The music in the film is mostly of the indie pop persuasion, but despite this; it gives it a distinct sense of cool, and puts the film at the 'cutting edge', so to speak. The film is excellently cast, but I don't think there is another actor in existence that could have played Rob Gordon like John Cusack does. He's believable in the role because he's good looking, but he also has that sort of self loathing atmosphere about himself, which is put to good use in this movie. Cusack has spent far too much time in the romantic comedy genre and it's a shame because his talents could be used well elsewhere, but here he makes the film his own and this is definitely one romantic comedy that I'm glad he did make.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is a rare thing; a romantic comedy that is original, hilarious and quite touching all in one go. Rom-com's like this don't come around often and this is one that you will not want to miss!"

John Cusack does a fine job of portraying Rob, but Rob is so bland you have to wonder how he managed to snag Catherine Zeta-Jones, in an enjoyable cameo. Rob and Laura's entire relationship is boring and frustrating to watch, as well as their chemistry- or lack thereof. High Fidelity has a lot of great stuff going for it: good actors, a perfect soundtrack, witty lines, and nice timing. Unfortunately, this is all overshadowed by the tediously drudging conflict between Rob and Laura. By the end of High Fidelity, you're half expecting John Cusack to pay *you* for all the whining you put up with.

Not all of this is funny though.  The humor comes with Cusack's employee's at his record store (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) which were pretty good at what they shouldn't do (not acting wise).

"roark183","1","6","19","10 January 2005"," Worthless
","This film simply consists of the ramblings of one Rob Gordon (characteristically played by John Cusack) who simply rambles on about his life. He discusses why his girlfriends left him, and of course Gordon has no responsibility for that, as if it was their shortcomings for leaving him. Then the other half of his life is his record store where he has hired two people who are less responsible and intelligent than Gordon is, if that is possible.<br/><br/>Jack Black very characteristically plays a real jerk that drives customers out of the record store, but Gordon complains that he can't fire his employees.<br/><br/>If you enjoy films that have absolutely no plot and consist entirely of the ramblings of an irresponsible person complaining about his life, then this might just be the film for you. This film has absolutely no plot. It has no entertainment value whatsoever, except for people looking for empathy in a degraded life."

"Horst_In_Translation","4","2","4","24 June 2015"," Didn't keep me interested
","Here we have a British/American movie from 15 years ago, which runs for roughly 110 minutes. It is directed by Stephen Frears (""The Queen""), who also made the wonderful ""Philomena"" a while ago, but somehow his effort here did not appeal to me very much. One major reason may be John Cusack. He seems a likable fellow, but as an actor I just don't think he is particularly talented. When he was very young, in his early 20s or so, I remember people thought he would be a real superstar one day, but not really. This film was made in 2000, but somehow, maybe also because of Cusack, it comes off as a lot older to me, maybe because all of the references about music, mostly older music. Another thing that did not appeal to me was Jack Black's character. He came off as extremely unlikeable and I totally cannot see why the main character would want to be his friend. He seems arrogant, self-righteous and totally looks down on everybody around him. And the worst: We are even supposed to like him with his performance near the end. Louiso's character on the other hand was the exact opposite: shy and not confident at all and it was nice to see him get a girlfriend.<br/><br/>Another thing that did not appeal to me at all was Cusack's character constantly breaking the fourth wall here. I am generally not a fan of this technique, but here it became fairly annoying really. I mean he always gives off this vibe that we totally want to know what was going on with his relationships and the people in his life, but honestly I found all the characters in this movie so dull and unappealing for the most part that I just wasn't interested at all. The performances were pretty forgettable too, especially Black's, but I guess it's not really his fault as he was written that way probably. It just did not fit in my opinion. The central female character is played by Iben Hjejle and her portrayal also wasn't memorable at all. There's a reason why her Hollywood movie times have been a thing of the past for a long time now. I found this a very forgettable effort from everybody involved. Not recommended, unless you really are a huge music geek. Then all those references about records and songs will maybe make it bearable for you. But everybody who isn't should better stay away."

","I saw this movie when it originally came out, but had missed a large portion of the beginning. I think I liked it and had always wanted to see all of it, especially because I wanted to see all the top 5 lists I missed. So I rented it today.<br/><br/>It is a decent film. I don't think it's great, or as good as I felt is was before. The main reason is that all the trials and tribulations Rob goes through, just seem like a waste of time. How can you feel empathy for a character that has the time and luxury to do all this worrying and scrutinizing? Especially when it comes out that most of the problems he suffered were self-induced. How can you forget that you dumped a girl because she didn't put out? Or not realize that someone you were dating before was a whack-job? It just seems like if any decisions that should have been pondered earlier weren't, and that again makes it tough to swallow a character who is obviously very into introspection.<br/><br/>Another problem for me was that we have seen so much more of Jack Black's antics since this movie was released, that his part did seem more tame this go-round. He is still one of the strongest characters in the movie however. I also didn't wholly understand Lisa Bonet's character. Was she the actualization of the 'Fantasy Girl' girl Rob talks about later, just for an emphasis in reality that the ideal is un-attainable in any sense of permanency? If not, why didn't he just stick with her. <br/><br/>There were some really funny parts, and it had a nice sweet ending, but I did find myself looking at the movie timer quite a bit. I now have a strong urge to go read the novel, and maybe that'll open up some things that I didn't get straight away from the film. I wanted to give it 6/10, but I guess it does have enough of that little something that I can give it a 7/10."

","Cusack delivers a lighthearted performance as Rob Gordon, an introspective self-loathing record store owner who is stuck riding a perpetual roller coaster of relationships and breakups. We are introduced to the character of Rob as he descends a downward spiral soon after his breakup with his latest girlfriend Laura (Hjejle). Being a quirky enthusiast of pop culture music, Cusack's character obsessively constructs a ""top-five"" list for almost every occasion in his life. The story unfolds with Rob embarking on a journey of self-realization. Using pop music as a soundtrack for the autobiography of his life, he recounts his track record with the multiple women from his past relationships, creating a ""top-five"" list of the worst breakups of all time. We are introduced to a variety of wonderful actors (Jack Black, Tod Louiso, Tim Robbins) and actresses (Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joan Cusac) along his journey, and we see the character of Rob undergoing a natural metamorphosis of coming to terms with himself, casting aside his dead-end single life, and becoming a mature individual with realistic goals and direction.<br/><br/>This movie is simply one of the most natural movies I've seen. It appears to have been easy to make, and it plays in such a manner that it is very easy to watch. The characters are extremely organic, very tangible and realistic. The movie's comedic aspects are well balanced by plot and character development and are almost entirely carried by the dialogue and the dynamic between the characters. Two sub-plots include Dick (Louiso) and Barry (Black), two socially misguided employees in Rob's record store whose extremes in personality bookend Rob's character and actually make him look more normal, and Laura's new fling, Ian (Robbins), an urban Zen-junkie that specializes in conflict resolution. To say the least, this movie is a satirical view of the male standpoint on love and romance, and many men may a find a piece of Rob Gordon within their own lives.<br/><br/>SIMILAR MOVIES: Swingers (1996); Bottle Rocket (1996); Clerks (1994); Chasing Amy (1997); 24 Hour Party People (2002)"

","Music and movies are like white on rice. It's the perfect blend of sight and sound that can make or break a film. Even when sound wasn't available for pictures, music was still played when people saw them. Movies about music have been produced and music about movies have been recorded. Sometimes, one of these films just stands out...<br/><br/>High Fidelity is a comedy about Rob Gordan (John Cusack), a record store owner/operator who has recently split with his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) and now is trying to get it all together. The movie opens with her leaving and Rob giving us his top five list of the most painful breakups. At work, his two ""employees"" Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black) share his passion for music and to tell people that what to listen to. The top five motif is present throughout the entire movie, giving it a unique take on life. Rob cheated on Laura, borrowed money from Laura and hasn't given it back to her, and caused Laura to have an abortion. He pretty much feels like a jerk, but it all goes away when he finds out that she is living with Ian Raymond (Tim Robbins), his former neighbor known as ""Ray"".<br/><br/>When Rob realizes that he is miserable from thinking about his breakups from past years, he has an epiphany. If he just confronts each one individually, the pain will go away. To just see that they have moved on so he can move on as well, but the anguish over Laura resonates due to the fact that she keeps coming over to get her stuff. Now Rob must figure out if he should just move or try to make amends with Laura and get back together.<br/><br/>Stephen Frears directs and his style is perfect for the story. Going from flashback to reality to dreamworld and back to reality effortlessly is quite an accomplishment. He takes Nick Hornby's book and makes it into something amazing. Cusack is fantastic as the funny, sometimes self loathing music enthusiast. He narrates just about the entire movie and some of the dialogue he gives us is priceless. Black and Louiso seem to be on opposite ends of the rock and roll spectrum but they come together to appreciate the art of making music even with their sometimes totally different styles. Black is very energetic as the self-proclaimed 'know it all' of rock music and Louiso is the calm, quiet rocker. Even Hjejle and Cusack's sister Joan give great performances. All together the cast did incredibly well.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is one of the funniest and most creative comedies to hit the big screen. It is a perfect movie to just pop in one night and enjoy. It's a great date movie, buddy movie, or anytime movie. This movie will have you making 'top five' list's in no time..."
"Blondie_","9","2","4","4 August 2005"," One of the best romance movies out there!
","I love this movie, have seen it at least several times, and could see it many times more. It is entertaining and funny every single time I see it, that is how great this movie is. Next to 'Say Anything' and 'When Harry Met Sally', it is the best romantic movie out there. For one, the film is very unique in that it portrays a love-lorn man instead of yet another love-lorn woman, as is the case with the majority of romance movies. When was the last time you saw a movie where a man talks about his feelings?? The film has many tender, touching moments without being the least drippy or milquetoast. This is offset by great humor throughout the film. John Cusack shines in the lead role and gives one of best, nuanced performances of his career so far. He is surrounded by a nearly-perfect supporting cast, and my nearly-perfect leads to the one and only criticism of this movie: the character of Laura. The actress who plays here (sorry, I can't remember the spelling of her name right now) gives a mostly dull, uninspiring performance. While Cusack performs perfect chemistry with her, she gives him nearly zero chemistry back. I feel she was the wrong choice in casting for this role. Who I feel should of been cast is Lisa Bonet, who had a small supporting role as one of Cusack's lovers. She totally sparked chemistry-wise with him and they were a perfect on screen couple. Lisa Bonet should of been cast as Laura. But this is just one criticism of an otherwise excellent film, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone."

Then I realised that would be the behaviour of a nerd, and besides, my pockets just weren't big enough.<br/><br/>I mean the book's a 10/10, and the movie is probably a 9/10.<br/><br/>A lot of fans of the book were up in arms at the movie being set in the US instead of England, but after watching John (& Joan) Cusack and Jack Black's performances, not many were left complaining.<br/><br/>So where did the extra 1/10 go then?<br/><br/>Well, firstly the soundtrack. Did they run out of money? This movie had the ability to be perfect, and the soundtrack is really good, don't get me wrong- I just think they had the opportunity to weave in some of the greatest songs of all time, and instead just put in some good ones. We Are the Champions by Queen was a really good touch though.<br/><br/>Secondly, how about the softening of Nick Hornsby's book and the characters? They left out Rob refusing to buy some guy's entire record collection from an annoyed ex-wife, though probably a time issue. But they changed the end. In the book, he doesn't propose to his girlfriend; he proposes to the girl writing the column who he doesn't know that well.<br/><br/>Apart from that, flawless as a movie, and very good as an adaption."

","A man suddenly closer to middle age than to the carefree frivolous years of youth begins to understand the consequences of non-commitment in terms of his relationships with women, in `High Fidelity,' directed by Stephen Frears and starring John Cusack.  When his girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), leaves him for the guy upstairs in their apartment building, Rob Gordon (Cusack) begins to take stock of his life by reflecting upon the `top five break-ups' he's suffered over the years, seeking answers to the seeming pattern of rejection that has plagued him since Junior High School.  As he does so, it establishes a thread that runs throughout the film through which some insight into Rob's (as well as some of the others) character is gleaned: `Top five' lists that reference music (Rob owns a specialty record store, specializing in `vinyl') based on category and sub-category, with his `break-ups' and finally `top five jobs,' framing the story. 	Set in Chicago, with Rob's store in a neighborhood not especially conducive to `walk-in' trade, Frears sets a mood and atmosphere that conveys the freedom of a rock n' roll lifestyle and evokes the yearnings of youth on the threshold of discovering reality.  Though Rob personifies an entire generation that has `been to the mountain,' only to be faced with coming back down again, Frears takes something of a lighthearted approach to Rob's angst, with a brisk pace and by infusing enough subtle humor (though somewhat dark at times) into the proceedings to keep it lively and entertaining.  There's a gritty, down-to-earth feel to the film, along with a sense of time and place with which anyone in the audience will be able to relate on a personal level, for this is the kind of territory, in one way or another, that most people have traversed; a vicarious route to self-discovery, if you will. 	John Cusack is perfectly cast as Rob, carrying his cloud of burden with wry, almost self-deprecating amusement.  His naturally outgoing persona is just right for illuminating Rob's introspective thoughts, which he shares with the viewer by speaking directly into the camera, and it works exceptionally well, for it conveys a sense of being privy to a most intimate confidence.  And Cusack lends something of a Nicolas Cage `hang-dog' look to Rob, which gives him a quirky, likable appeal.  Hjejle gives a notable performance as well, as the woman in Rob's life who at last precipitates his life altering musings. 	The supporting cast includes Jack Black, who turns in an exuberant, memorable performance as Barry, one of Rob's employees with aspirations of becoming a rock star; and Todd Louiso, as Dick, Rob's other employee, whose stark contrast in personality to Barry makes him equally as memorable. Rounding out the supporting players are Lisa Bonet (Marie DeSalle), Catherine Zeta-Jones (Charlie), Joan Cusack (Liz), Tim Robbins (Ian), Lili Taylor (Sarah) and Natasha Gregson Wagner (Caroline).  Cleverly written (screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis from the book by Nick Hornby) and well presented, `High Fidelity' succinctly captures a specific culture and a lifestyle of ambivalence invested with obsessions and eccentricities (Rob, for example, sorts his personal record collection `autobiographically'). It's an entertaining, funny and sometimes insightful look at life as we know it; a good story with plenty of music, some laughs, and engaging performances, which make this film more than worth seeing, especially for fans of John Cusack, and for anyone who wants some insight into the influence popular music has indeed made upon the world in which we live.  I rate this one 8/10."

Even made him get down in the dirt, like a straight male fantasy of women mud wrestling. Totally irrelevant comment I'm making right now, I know, but it was an odd amount of dramatic rain scenes for a single movie.<br/><br/>This is an extremely realistic story about the insecurity of significant others, and the uncertainty of the future we have with others. How fearful we are of commitment, failure at our goals, being alone, and that jumping for one slightly better thing could cause us to lose what good thing we already have.<br/><br/>I feel like this movie was niche relevant to the year 2000, and nothing beyond, which is manifestly fitting when you consider that every line of dialogue out of John Cusack's, or Jack Black's, mouth is about niche interests. The artists and albums and songs he references or jokes about are constantly obscure ones. I had to turn on subtitles just to know which artists etc he was saying because they were so unfamiliar. Like a foreign language. You could make the argument that this was purposeful, that Cusack's character was supposed to be elitist and therefore possessed a wealth of knowledge a layman wouldn't. However, I always felt like the viewer was supposed to be on his side for these jokes. These chastising remarks for customers who have bad taste for liking [Song/Band] was where I was should be laughing, in on the joke. It never happened.<br/><br/>I felt like I, the viewer, should have envied Cusack. Should have thought of him as a cool guy for owning a record store, and having a catalog of hot past girlfriends. But really I just was annoyed with him. He does redeem himself by the end, sort of. The movie at least stayed true to its themes of realism, that even in our redemptive moments, we still retain traces of our destructive tendencies."

","This has generally positive reviews and in fact it's not bad. More than anything else it brings Woody Allen's work to mind. Not his early flat-out comedies and not his late erratica but his midstream features like ""Manhattan."" John Cusack runs a Chicago shop full of old vinyl records and more recent CDs. He knows his way around pop music. Unfortunately he can't figure out a relational calculus when girls are involved. What we do is follow him through a series of full and partial affairs, all of which seem to puzzle, frustrate, and anger him.<br/><br/>The style is really Woody Allen's. When a former lover tells Cusack that she's slept with her new boyfriend but they haven't ""done it"" yet, he agonizes over the particular meaning of the word ""yet."" He pummels his friends with questions about it. Does ""yet"" mean you haven't done it but you intend to do it in the future? In a Woody Allen movie this would be done in narration but the director here has Cusack breaking the fourth wall, directly addressing the camera and leaping with excitement or slumping with depression as he describes one contretemps after another.<br/><br/>I could allow myself to be drawn in by some of his feelings -- that the girl is too classy, too good looking, for a schlub like me, even though I myself closely resemble the youthful Robert Redford. Why, just the other day a toothsome blond in the supermarket looked at me and swooned. At least I think it was a swoon. Can swoons follow an expression of utter horror? My understanding of his obsessions with post-Beatles pop music was a little forced because I think most of it stinks. True that one of Miles Davis' better albums is on display, but then some numbskull makes a sarcastic crack about Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.<br/><br/>On the whole, if you've enjoyed mid-stream Woody Allen, you should get a kick out of this character-driven story."

It's honest in its eccentric way by saying the protagonist even messes up, as Cusack's character admits that he cheated on his girlfriend in the film. Most movies would never have the protagonist cheat, most movies would have him/her be perfect, where this is a movie about a real human being, a human being that is likable, but who messes up and throughout his soul search journey he starts seeing all of the things he was doing wrong on, all of the things that are wrong within himself. <br/><br/>A movie true to form, in it's eccentric, story telling way. John Cusack is a good actor. He always plays himself (even though he's probably playing different characters , but we always just see him playing himself). I think a great actor plays himself well (meaning 'what if I was in this situation', 'what if i was in that situation' and that's very tough to do believably), but yet he can play other characters too, which I've never seen Cusack play anyone but himself. Cusack is extremely good at playing himself in all of the different circumstances he's in, in each film he's in. And because he always plays himself, I believe that also adds to his likable appeal. He's got extreme likability and we always love to watch him.<br/><br/>This is a very good film, with great acting, great music, very funny all around. A must see."

","High Fidelity (2000): Dir: Stephen Frears / Cast: John Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Jack Black, Todd Louiso, Lisa Bonet: Wonderful film that examines reasons behind relationships. John Cusack works at a record store where he narrates his flawed relationships. He compares his top five breakups to popular music. He still loves Laura and struggles to win her back after she walks out on him. Cusack addresses the screen as he confronts past girlfriends to analyze what went wrong. Funny and observant masterpiece by director Stephen Frears with Cusack making intriguing references to pop culture. His past relationships were all unique and he even hooks up with a local musician thus convicting himself when cheating is addressed. Jack Black and Todd Louiso are scene stealing record store employees. Black is obnoxious yet performs in his own band. Louiso is quiet and reserved but romantically rewarded when met with a customer. Iben Hjejle plays Laura who is confused about her feelings. She is dating an older guy, which drives Cusack crazy within his analysis, but she also knows him better than anyone. Lisa Bonet is a great asset as a musician who enters the store and Cusack hooks up with her. The record store location adds character to the film, and the music only highlights the mood perfectly. Great film that urges viewers to examine relationships and make honest realizations. Score: 10 / 10"

","When I first saw this movie a long time ago I thought it was amazing. But watching it now, it's alright. Still a fun flick about coming in terms with oneself and relationships to a degree but nothing all that amazing. It's a overrated movie with overrated Jack Black. This is probably one of John Cusack's trademark movies and also launched Jack Black to overrated level for a short while. Although John Cusack was perfect for this role. The story is basically about a guy named Rob Gordon(John Cusack) that owns a record store, he critics records and people constantly. But mostly people while also being a hypocrite. He is this conceited, judgmental, critical, hypocritical, selfish jerk. And puts others down when he isn't going anywhere with his own life. In another words a difficult character to like, although some maybe able to relate with the guy. As a matter of fact some audiences actually like this character while admitting the guy is a jerk. Which can be understandable with some other movie characters but not really with this one for me. And during work time he is part of a trio in the record store. with only one of them being likable. Jack Black's character is one of the three trios and I don't know why audiences like this character of his. As this obnoxious, immature, crude and rude guy that works in a record store while forcing his opinions onto others. And he isn't even funny or interesting in my opinion. And this is the character that Jack Black is mostly known for. His character is like Lester Bangs from ""Almost Famous"" except annoying. The protagonist Rob Gordon coming in terms and getting over his inner demon aspect is cool and sometimes even interesting at times. While he meets up with his past girlfriends, each with different style and characteristics(Penny Hardwick being my favorite). But it seemed to be missing that flare that leaves something behind and didn't care much about the characters or what happens to them. This movie is just full of characters that are jerks, it's actually humorous and entertaining when they are jerks to each other though. Overall despite few annoying characters, it's still a enjoyable flick and you can tell the actors had fun making this.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

I can't recall seeing any other movie adaptation that followed its literary counterpart so closely. There were a few minor differences, additions and omissions, but all-in-all, the cast might have been reading the script straight from the book.<br/><br/>Cusack plays Rob Gordon with just the right amount of bitterness and low expectation. Jack Black plays Barry *perfectly*, every bit as annoying as the book character was. Todd Louiso as Dick, the introverted record geek, was also perfect, particularly in the succession of scenes when Ian (Tim Robbins) is in the record shop.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 for style, plus several million for everything else."

"arthurpewty","10","0","0","26 March 2000"," For fans of the book and GROSSE POINTE BLANK
","John Cusack, as our lead character the record shop owner Rob, talks to the camera, narrating his own story, in between the bits where it unfolds on its own. The genius of this is that it allows the prose from Nick Hornby's extremely enjoyable book to remain, without voice-over, which would seem inappropriate for this story. And therefore the only real fault of the movie is there is not as much book in the movie as there is in the book.<br/><br/>Some of the REALLY GOOD bits from the book that stick in memory are unfortunately missing, but there is plenty good left. Cusack is quintessential Cusack, Jack Black takes the abusive record clerk Barry to bigger heights than any reader could have dreamed, and Iben Hjejle - the only wonderful thing in the formulaic MIFUNE - is again wonderful as Rob's on- and-off girlfriend Laura. One of the additions not in the book, a scene where Laura's new guy Ian (Tim Robbins) comes into Rob's record shop and he envisions revenge is a hilarious showstopper."

","Romances and comedies end with marriages.  Tragedies begin with a marriage. Or so the saying goes, more or less.<br/><br/>And ""more or less"" is the overriding feel of ""High Fidelity.""  It's like the book, more or less.  It explores life and love, more or less.  It's okay, more or less, but pretty formulaic in the end.<br/><br/>What Nick Hornby accomplished in his marvelously witty and fresh London-based book has been transmuted, more or less, into a distilled and sometimes lifeless form by John Cusack and his screenwriting cohorts.  It lacks the sharp personal speculations, the unconventional blend of story-telling and fantasy-telling, and the charming mock-period-piece feel of the book.  Championship Vinyl feels eerily out of place in contemporary Chicago, not unlike watching a Mini roll down Interstate 95.  The film-makers can drop as many references to Sam Raimee as they'd like, but this is no beauty in America.<br/><br/>Alas, Mr. Cusack is also the weakest link amongst the cast -- which might be a bit understandable given the outstanding performances Todd Louiso and Jack Black offer.<br/><br/>The movie does offer a few new subtle jokes to the tale.  The worst of these is the film's inability to take advantage of a Bruce Springsteen cameo; the best of these is an early mockery of Mr. Cusack's ""Bill Cosby"" approach to fashion -- followed by an appearance by Lisa Bonet."

Jack Black and Todd Louiso were both hilarious as were most of the characters related to the record store. Definitely an odd appearance by Tim Robbins too.

"tonpro","Null","0","0","2 April 2000"," The spin on generation X
","There are some funny moments in this film and uniformly good acting and direction.  What's missing?  Well, a plausible story to begin with.<br/><br/>Record store proprietor John Cusack's live-in girlfriend moves out, triggering a personal journey of discovery in which he tries to find out why he hasn't wound up with any of the significant loves of his life.  He revisits as many old girlfriends as he can and talks about it, mostly to the audience in monologues fired like a machine gun directly at the camera.<br/><br/>But here's the rub.  Cusack plays a whinny, needy, totally dependent loser. At one point he says to the camera: ""You're probably wondering how a guy like me gets all these girls.""<br/><br/>We are, and the answer is, he wouldn't.  Most intelligent, self confident and attractive women wouldn't have given him the time of day.  But this movie follows the current trend of playing to ""me"" generation fantasies, and one of the most popular is to take loser guys and show them getting somebody like Catherine Zeta Jones into bed. The truth is, it's rich, powerful, successful guys like Michael Douglas who get Catherine Zeta Jones into bed. Guys who work in record stores get to help these girls sort through the resale bins, but it stops there.<br/><br/>Cusack's store and staff are colorful, filled with generation X types who have an encyclopedic known of record trivia, but probably couldn't have located Kosovo on a map if their lives had depended upon it. (I always knew ending the draft was a mistake.)<br/><br/>The whole movie, as a matter of fact, is an ode to a generation that bases the measure of a person's intelligence on how well they can formulate top five lists.  Cusack's character admits he has been a professional appreciater all his life. He himself can find nothing more creative to do than refine the art of making compilation tapes.<br/><br/>Cusack is a good actor, but he's becoming the sort of poster boy for the slacker generation. ""Being John Malkovich"" was about a similar guy whose idea of creativity was looking at the world through someone else's eyes, but doing it well, of course.<br/><br/>In truth, the entire premise of this film -- the ""personal journey of discovery"" concept --is one more piece of evidence that Hollywood continues to lower the bar when it comes to film writing. No matter what kind of resolution the story has,the problems here are largely inconsequential and so is the story.  I got tired of watching a totally self indulgent guy doing absolutely nothing but feed his own fantasies. It was like a two hour Seinfeld episode and I could never even sit through a half hour one.<br/><br/>There has to be something better to make films about than this!"

By the way, I haven't seen this next observation in any other comments, but Cusack is gorgeous--born with a handsome face and trained to use it well.

Some person that is somewhat awkward, but not too geeky. Actually, someone like me. When I saw it for the first time I thought: well that's okay but not too great. But I expected it to be better than my perception had been so I rented it from the local video store. But again: The music wasn't that great and it didn't seem to be very much in the middle of the film like one would expect. The ex-girlfriends-stories were kinda flat. It was not pointed out by the story why he was left by Laura, and it wasn't even clear why she came back (maybe because Tim Robbins was such a lame esoteric). I couldn't even laugh about most of the apparent jokes. The movie seemed short and empty to me.

"naun","7","0","0","9 February 2001"," Top Five differences between the book and the film
","Some semi-spoilers below.<br/><br/>Top Five differences between the book and the film:<br/><br/>1. Thanks to Iben Hjejle's wonderful performance, Laura emerges as a real, independent person more strongly than she does in the book, where we tend to see her only through the prism of Rob's self-absorbed personality. The film also builds up our perception of what Laura means to Rob by giving us Rob's Top Five Things I Miss about Laura, which I don't remember being in the book. The film does add something here.<br/><br/>2. The film ends with Rob and Laura implicitly but clearly on the way to middle-class, middle-aged prosperity and contentment. Rob starts his own record company, Laura enjoys her career success. The book is more equivocal. In the book, Laura resents having to work in the corporate world, and Rob just ends up sticking with what he knows. The film ends up affirming the American Way; the book gives its characters smaller joys in the bleakness of post-Thatcher Britain. The film's relatively upbeat ending isn't overdone, but I prefer the book.<br/><br/>3. In the film, things take their natural course in the car scene. In the book, Rob finds an excuse to desist, as a way of hurting Laura. In a way, the book is more complex and interesting at this point, but it's probably one twist too many and, anyway, it assumes a degree of self-control on Rob's part that he doesn't show any sign of anywhere else in the story. I give this one to the film.<br/><br/>4. In the film, Dick meets his girlfriend by discovering mutual musical interests in the record shop. Those of us who have spent half our lives hanging around used record shops know that those places aren't exactly the Love Boat; the only people you ever meet are sad, solitary, dissolute males like yourself. The book has Dick meeting his girlfriend somewhere outside of hours, and then progressively trying to indoctrinate her with his favourite music. This is a lot more true to life.<br/><br/>5. Ian/Ray is a somewhat distant, shadowy figure in the book. Tim Robbins brings him to life brilliantly in the film. Rob imagines a much more physical comeuppance for him in the film than he gets in the book, and this works very well on the big screen. This is a good example of the film staying very true to the spirit of the book even when some of the details differ.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is very enjoyable and if you read the book you'll see how skilfully the film has been adapted from it. But inevitably the book has more time to dwell on Rob's thoughts, and since it's Rob's internal mid-life crisis that the story is all about, I think the book does have more to offer. It's a pity also that the film didn't make better use of the soundtrack to reflect the characters' emotional lives, which after all is the whole idea of the story. Still, this is a great film to sit down with in front of the video player with that pizza and that beer and those kettle chips."

Good music is like good characters in a script, they do not make sense without the story plot. We all have our own music history in our life, which every songs do flash back and also represent certain memory which we only had and only felt at that exact moment, that moment we were listening to that particular song.

","I don't know why some people are so enchanted by this movie. This film in generally rather depressing: a sad story of a loser, and the various losers with whom he surrounds himself.  The humor purports to find beginnings in a failed relationship between the Cuzack character (the owner of a record store in a fringe neighborhood of Chicago(?) and the most recent of his girlfriends, and the antics of the screwball ""employees"" in his store. These last two characters were actually rather well written and clever.<br/><br/>   There are several clever aspects to this movie, which was apparently written by people quite knowledgable about music, but it basically is about a selfish, immature loser who still somehow ends up with the girl, who upon any reflection whatsoever, is revealed as no great prize herself.  Why would anyone be interested in either of these two?<br/><br/>   The movie itself is filmed in a quirky kind of style in which the main character speaks directly to the viewers (even furtively lowering his voice when others are nearby) and was shot in a quick-cut fashion reminiscent of a cough syrup commercial one might have seen on television and quickly forgot. The continuous smoking of the protagonist made me wonder if the movie was funded by a tobacco company, and made my eyes sting just watching.<br/><br/>   It was essentially a depressing movie interspersed with some funny (but eminently predictable) moments.  (One clever remark: describing a sweater as ""So Cosby"" in a movie featuring a former castmember in a small, but very noticeable role).<br/><br/>   It's worth a look, particularly if you are interested in music, or John Cuzack, otherwise, keep on browsing the aisles of the video store...<br/><br/>    By the way, how did he afford this store or paying his employees, with no customers?"

The critics are talking about the movie dialogue being chock full of pop culture and underground music; the reason they noticed the dialogue so much was that they weren't actually into the stuff the characters were talking about.  True obscure pop culture freaks (people who had actually heard of Jesus and the Mary Chain instead of a movie critic thinking that would be a clever name for a band) were busy noticing the scenery.  Both are extremely enjoyable; I haven't mentioned until now that High Fidelity is a really great movie.  It's fun and funny, serious in between, and never ever boring.  John Cusack's melloncollie is right on target and wonderful to watch.  And while the scenery is there, it's never better to watch than the movie itself.  High Fidelity is, in short, the geek's dream movie.  The dialogue is overflowing with references to old school punk (how Green Day is influenced at all by Stiff Little Fingers I'll never know, but hey...) and eighties power pop, all the while commenting on human nature when one is alone, in love, and part of a whole.  The characters are extremely likable and lively.  The soundtrack is jammin. Just... a good movie.  See it.  Enjoy it.  Cheer for the Wax Trax t-shirt."
"stephen niz","Null","0","0","10 September 2000"," Music is soul.
","I knew HIGH FIDELITY was hitting the mark when I became jealous of Rob Gordon's (John Cusack) knowledge of ultra-obscure rock history. Music appreciation lends itself to snobbery you see, but in the best possible manner. Music is soul, and the characters in the film understand as much. It is surely the sign of a great film when you look at the screen and see people just like yourself up there.<br/><br/>You rarely see films as committed to people as HIGH FIDELITY that are this much fun. It is about men dealing with themselves, with women, and with music, often all at once. After the break-up of a relationship, Rob proceeds to organise his record collection not chronologically or alphabetically, but autobiographically. `Music is the soundtrack to your life' as the tagline tells us.<br/><br/>HIGH FIDELITY is about so much more than music. It handles relationships sincerely, not sentimentally. When issues like infidelity and abortion arise, director Stephen Frears avoids making it feel like these are merely plot devices or sympathy plays. In fact, the characters make little effort to be liked. It is credit to the ego-less performance of Cusack that Rob's story is so affecting.  <br/><br/>But apparently there were creative differences between director and star over editing, Cusack wanting the music to play a more significant role in the film. This is intriguing because the ultra-cool soundtrack is relegated to the background throughout. It is annoying that while the songs represent such a strong emotional significance to the character, they're little more than hipster muzak to the audience. <br/><br/>Struggling with an unconvincing pledge of male sensitivity, the film loses its legs a little towards the end. That said, HIGH FIDELITY is a grand achievement. From the first scene until the killer Stevie Wonder/Love 1-2 over the closing credits, it preaches genuine cool all the way, something films are always trying to force, but rarely achieve."

","I went to see High fidelity with mixed feelings about the film. From what I had previously heard and see it looked like this was going to be another 'romantic comedy' with little or no imagination put into it at all. How happy I was then to be proved wrong. This film does involve romance and it is a comedy, but this time viewed from a male perspective, unlike so many. The narrative given by John Cusack's character is excellent, as is the whole script, which grips the viewer from start to finish. I don't normally like romantic films but this was one which subtly blends the romance in with humor and cutting social and psychological obeservations. True, it did feel as though it was perhaps a little too long, but in no way should this detract from the film as a whole. I remained interested right up until the end. All in all a fantastic movie about relationships, but about what men feel about relationships this time, fantastic stuff!"

On retrospect, the side characters were more memorable and comedic. Little else comes to mind."

","Excellent adaption of Nick Hornby's novel where Cusack plays Rob Gordon a second hand record store owner who recalls his past loves as his present one is leaving while also assessing his whole life in general. If your a John Cusack fan great pleasure is provided by the flashback sequences where Rob recalls his Top Five break ups. We see Cusack in 80's garb and matching hairdo bringing back memories of his early teen classics such as ""The Sure Thing"" and ""Say Anything"". However if your a fan you may also be disappointed that Cusack keeps on returning to this persona and doesn't try to concentrate on becoming a ""star"" for want of a better word, just look at his performances in ""The Grifters"" and ""City Hall"" and you may know what I mean. Anyway back to this movie, Rob's co-workers played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso are great especially Louiso who is so geeky but at the same time very funny and likeable. The women (even though their roles are largely secondary) are great especially Iben Hjejle and Lisa Bonet and Frears direction is assured and Cusack is Cusack, and no one does it better."

The film says that women are a great but sometimes weird species and that it takes a lot of time and heart to get along with them. OK! Maybe this is nothing new. We`ve seen stories like this before. But in this movie we got real people! People we can meet on the street tomorrow, this is not this all beautiful, all happy Hollywood crap. The only cliche is, that it always rains at the right time. But it`s funny, some kind of running-gag! I think you should check that movie out. Because it makes you feel good when you leave the theater. All the characters are so different, odd but also so lovely and brilliantly played by the whole cast. And John Cusack is the PERFECT cast for the record store owner. You better not miss this!

","High Fidelity was out in Italy yesterday, July the 7th, and I was in at the first showing. The first question to arise is ""who turned the book into this script?"": it's true the book is a sort of monologue, but turning it into 90 minutes of ""speaking into the camera"" was the easiest, although worst, way to do the job; anyway, John Cusack adopts a theatrical way of acting and manages to keep your attention up. But the good points of the book are almost all missed, first of all the theories on how to make a cassette, then the anger against Ian, or Charlie's Marco...<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this movie adds very little to the book, and what is added is not worth the effort of adding: why is the singer played by Lisa Bonet? Why is the story set in Chicago, when all the inside locations (Rob's house, Charlie's house) look absolutely British? What's the use of having Bruce Springsteen appear like Humphrey Bogart in Woody Allen's ""Play it again Sam""? (not to mention that the Italian dubbing killed the song Bruce is playing in his scene!!!!)<br/><br/>Still, most of the actors do a great job, especially Cusack, the guys in the record shop and Tom Robbins (wonderfully disgusting!).<br/><br/>See it only if you read the book already, it would be like meeting old friends you haven't seen in a while; otherwise, read the book first."

Although much of the music referred to in the book and in the movie is unknown to me (I was raising children in the 60's and 70's), I loved the characters in the book and in the movie.  The displacement of the locale from London to Chicago was well done and all the actors were well chosen. The beef I have about this movie is the camera work!

"Kevin-94","Null","0","0","8 June 2000"," A sour, bleak film
","Please forgive me for writing my review in list form.  It seemed highly appropriate, though perhaps a little unoriginal.  <br/><br/>The reasons I didn't like `High Fidelity'.  <br/><br/>1)  Rob is: <br/><br/>a)  immature, b)  alienated, c)  depressed, d)  self-destructive, e)  passive and f)  almost completely aimless.  <br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie, I can tell you that none of these things are played up for comic purposes.  He's just a pathetic man living out a pathetic existence.  <br/><br/>2)  Rob isn't just the main character here, he's the whole movie.  He spends roughly half of the film alone, talking to the audience.  I don't think I'd want that much one-on-one from any character in any movie, let alone this character (see # 1.)  <br/><br/>3)  The scenes he did have with other characters almost always fell into one of three categories:  <br/><br/>a)  Rob lies or is lied to. b)  Rob is criticized, or criticizes, or feels hatred towards someone. c)  Rob engages in meaningless small talk.    <br/><br/>What the film (and Rob's life) lacks is Rob engaging in any meaningful, positive interactions with other people.  He's very alienated.  This makes the film very bleak and unpleasant.  It make it harder to grab us emotionally, and care about Rob.  <br/><br/>4)  Rob's life (and this movie) lack any sense of urgency or trajectory. Rob is aimless, blowing through life, with few goals.  The story drags. <br/><br/>
5)  I know that people like Rob exist, and that the filmakers did a good, uncompromising job of capturing him, warts and warts (I was going to say `warts and all' but I couldn't figure out what the `all' is.)  Nevertheless, it's not enough to be realistic.  I wanted to care, to get involved, and I never did.  The characters never generated any sympathy and the story never developed any momentum."
"nicardo","Null","0","0","2 June 2000"," Not a Comedy
","The Main Thing by nicardo@bigfoot.com Review of High Fidelity <br/><br/>Do I watch movies because I'm miserable, or am I miserable because I watch movies? <br/><br/>At the beginning of High Fidelity, the main character poses the same question about his passion for music. `Do I listen to records because I'm miserable, or am I miserable because I listen to records?' he asks, but it's a rhetorical question. Since Rob Gordon (John Cusack) owns a vintage record store, he listens because he has to, it's what he does, it's part of him. He has no choice, really. Anyway, what he does is only the backdrop here. It's not really about his job. It's about a regular guy attempting to figure out if he wants to grow up and accept change and responsibility. Go see it if you want to see someone, who may be more screwed up than yourself trying to get a grip.<br/><br/>As far as we're concerned, what he should have asked was, `Do I get into relationships because I'm miserable, or am I miserable because I get into relationships?' That is actually what the rest of the story is about. His current live-in girlfriend is Laura (Iben Hjejle). She's gorgeous, smart and ambitious. Well, she just moved out, so he digs up memories of his personal top five break-ups of all time, and tries to figure out what the hell went wrong. That's right. Rather than focus just on his present relationship, he delves into the past and looks up these old girlfriends to find out where they are now in order to feel better about himself. Why do we care? Well, it's John Cusack. Isn't he good? And because Rob has a very big... record collection. He owns a record store. You'd go there, right? And because he's `hip.' How do we know? Well, he knows way more about records than you ever will. He loves records. He would like to have been a reporter for Rolling Stone magazine. He doesn't understand about love and commitment, but he listens to music.<br/><br/>When I saw it, I was distracted for a couple of hours, saw some decent acting here and there, but felt that if this movie were a song, they were singing at me, rather than to me. It's a situation where there was a good novel (by Nick Hornby) that had trouble being made into a good movie. Cusack is very talented. Even with all his romantic comedy film experience, I'm not sure that his helping to write the screenplay adaptation made it funnier. This is not really a comedy. That's okay, but I don't like to be mislead. There are a few funny scenes, only not enough of them. Like when Rob has a major confrontation with his rival for Laura's affections, Ian (Tim Robbins), he plays the scene several times in his head. We're not sure which scene is real until they end. That's the kind of quirky thing that works in a movie. The replay button in our mind that we wish we had in life. Since music groups, songs, albums, liner notes and lyrics are the most important things in their lives, Rob's two employees in the record shop (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) are either funny, cruel, pathetic, or all three, depending on the scene and your personal point of view. Lisa Bonet plays a local struggling night club singer and recording artist. It's a role that must have been more interesting when the story was set in London rather than Chicago. She's really just an object of Rob's lust.<br/><br/>Cusack spends a lot of time mulling things over and talking directly to the camera explaining to us his confusion. I can see where a book can be like that, but, I felt like he often held things up rather than moved them along. When exactly do we get caught up with the history lesson and get on with the story? So, what's the point? We just look at him suffer because she walked out and he doesn't know why. Well, it's obvious from the start. There are big questions every man has to face at some point in his life. Are you serious about your woman or what? Is she the one, or are you just spinning your wheels and using her? Who do you want, and what kind of person do you want to be? That's the main thing. E-mail and comments are welcome."
"acm72","8","0","0","31 May 2000"," An English Review
","For those of you who are concerned that Nick Hornby's comic novel would lose out by being moved to the US, fear no more. This film is right at home in the suburbs of Chicago, and having said that it could equally have been set anywhere in the UK or US and it would have still held good. The only major thing that has been changed is the music, and enough effort has been put into updating the selections to make any differences immaterial. The central premise, or premises, of Championship Vinyl is an example of second hand record shops the world over, and the types of music obsessed occupants equally reflect those that staff them. John Cusack is superb as the lead Rob, but the support, and it is some support (Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones and others), all give excellent comic performances. I'm sure that other comments have covered the rest of the film, but I just wanted to reassure you all that the book has been faithfully rendered onto the big screen, a lot better than Fever Pitch, that's for sure. Now there's a film that sucked hard."
"Bob Pr.","9","0","0","28 May 2000"," Really good movie; please read Peter Dykstra's comments (4-23-00)
","I agree almost completely with Peter Dykstra's thoughtful comments (4-23-00, please read them) although I didn't find the Charlie character as compelling as he did.  Like him, this is not my type of music so I missed many of the in-jokes, but the same kind of elitist snobbery shown by Rob and his help can be found among people in many areas.<br/><br/>Dykstra's point about the Barry character being a mite improbable (to connect with an audience as a performer, given his previous track record) is well-taken.  But that doesn't bother me much because Rob's conflict of commitment, his very prolonged adolescence -- and his final summing up and resolution of it -- analyzed and laid bare that dilemma with a clarity and truthfulness that I've never before seen in movies.  (Would that all people, men _or_ women -- with similar immaturity/insecurity problems with relationships -- could resolve them with the insight Rob's character finally showed.)   <br/><br/>Cusack and all the supporting actors fit well in their roles and did fine jobs.  It's a really good film and you don't have to be familiar with the current pop music scene to enjoy it (that  could only add more pleasure)."
"girlplusboy.com","Null","0","0","23 May 2000"," Smaller points aside, High Fidelity is delightful.
","For those who appreciated the sardonic wit and self-confessional style of Nick Hornby's novel High Fidelity and were concerned when the story was being turned into a Hollywood film, set in Chicago, rest easy. While it seemed to be such a hopelessly British theme: 30-year old man lives his life vicariously through his extensive record collection, thereby disabling himself from adult relationships with women, and so on, director Stephen Frears has created a vivid portrayal of a vinyl fetish subculture, American or British. Some obvious references to Brit-American differences have been changed: thus, Marie who was American (and thereby a bit exotic) in the book, here is black, which makes the line about her looking like Susan Dey `post-Partridge, pre-L.A. Law' somewhat superfluous (one would have thought).<br/><br/>John Cusack, who also co-wrote the script, is absolutely flawless as Rob: shoulders drooping, tired eyes - a perpetual loser/underdog. Joan Cusack is also fabulous, but unfortunately she has far too little screen time. Fun cameos abound, the nicest one being Bruce Springsteen as himself, giving Rob a bit of relationship advice (coming from a guy who's been there, man.).<br/><br/>Generally, the pace of High Fidelity is high and the script is witty. The scriptwriters haven't shied away from the occasional pop nerdy reference (obviously a good thing), but it is just a little bit (no, make that a lot) annoying that Rob refers to Belle and Sebastian's `Seymour Stein' as `something that I can ignore.' Also, Green Day, like The Clash? Come on.<br/><br/>Smaller points aside, High Fidelity is delightful. Rob's talking into the camera to explain his miserable life could have been very annoying (such as Christian Slater in the horrendous Kuffs), but it isn't. Rather, it adds both to the intimacy and the brisk pace of the film. Plus, it makes  it easier to fit in Hornby gems into the dialogue, like Rob's declaration of his credo: `Barry and Dick and I agreed a long time ago that what's important is what you like, not what you are like.'"

","Warning: does contain spoilers<br/><br/>Women, do you ever wonder why a man just can't seem to settle down?  Do you ever cringe and shudder when you realize how vacilating men seem to be, and not just a few of them but all of them?  Here you are, this beautiful, intelligent career orientated women and you are full of verve and love.  And you think you've found the right guy and things are great.  But then suddenly, apathy comes knocking on your door and now it seems that you have lost your man.  Ever experience that or know how that feels?  Well, so does this film.<br/><br/>Has anyone out there ever known someone that seems to be obsessesd with either the world of music or the world of film.  I mean the kind of guy where he can tell you not only the name of a song from 1979 but who it was made for or what the flip side of that single was?  Or a guy that can list his record collection in chronological order that they were bought?  Well this film does know guys like this because they exist here, in this small record store in Chicago.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is one of the most original films to come out of Hollywood in quite some time.  It combines the backdrop of music and the foreground of dating and both worlds are hilariously dissected and an honest attempt is given to help us all understand the cataclysmic world of one and the obsessive world of the other, you figure out which world is destined for which.<br/><br/>John Cusack plays Rob.  Rob is a small record store owner that specializes in hard to find records, or better yet, records that the fascist staff think is worthy for people to buy.  The other two guys that work there are pathetic in their own way.  Dick and Barry are complete opposites but one thing that is clear is their love for music.  Dick is a shy and submissive man that has many opinions but doesn't give them out as noxiously as Barry. Barry on the other hand, thinks mainstream music is the plague and only music he deams worthy is even permitted to cogitate about in the store.  Any modicum, any scent of an artist like Stevie Wonder or Bryan Adams is frowned upon, God only knows what he would be like if Britney Spears was mentioned. These two characters provide much of the comedy in the but it is such an intelligent and original way to do it.  It is refreshing to see comedy try something new every once in a while.  I am not opposed to films like Road Trip and American Pie ( I actually like them very much ) but once in a while it is cleansing to see Hollywood come out with something original.<br/><br/>The crux of the film is about Rob's inability to stay with one woman.  He can always find something wrong with them and this in turn causes him to break up with them or they seem to find him banal and they leave him.  From these experience, Rob starts his top five list.  This list consists of top five things about everything.  Top five records about.. top five songs about... and top five breakups.  Laura is his latest break-up and he does not want to give her the pleasure of admitting her to the top five so he goes on telling himself how worthless she really was.  But as the film goes on he can't get her out of his head and wants her back badly.  Now this is where most films take the course that is subscribed to as Romance 101.  This is where scriptwriters set up the love interest, take it away, and then the rest of the film kinetically involves the one party proving to the other party that he is worthy of her.  End of story, they live happily ever after. But High Fidelity is different.  Laura is different.  Laura knows what Rob is like, she has spent the last two years of her life with him and she is not going to come back that easily.  And it is here that Rob goes on one of the most honest and complete journeys that I have seen a character go through.  Sure he learns about himself and wants to change that, but it is what he learns about himself that is the fascinating part. <br/><br/>
"" Then I began to realize that they only have one pair of frilly red underwear.  The rest is just regular cotton.""<br/><br/>Rob begins to learn that the idea of the perfect relationship is just a fantasy, and in fantasies, nothing ever goes wrong.  But eventually those fantasies turn into six month relationships and work is actually involved and spontaneous sex on the floor turns into sex on the weekend, on a bed, between the hours of midnight and one in the morning.  It's not to say that relationships get stagnant and boring, but they are not sex on a first date either.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is honest, smart and incredibly original and funny in so many ways.  But it is the honesty that I enjoyed about the film the most, well, that and Barry.  After all, a film that can tell you why men are as mobile as they are and then can end it with a man that apparently has no talent singing his guts out and sounding like Barry White, well it is a treat. Films don't come out like this often and that is because they are smart. Smart is not easy to do in Hollywood.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 ( also look for a hilarious cameo by Tim Robbins )"
"Dkish","7","0","0","1 April 2000"," Breaking up is funny?
","High Fidelity By Dean Kish<br/><br/>	Trying for a Reality Bites type feel we are faced with a comedy about breaking up. This is funny? 	High Fidelity, based on the cult novel by Nick Hornby, is a about a rash, lazy, socially confused, record store owner named Rob Gordon (John Cusack). Rob is faced with the fact he is the king of breaking up and if he doesnt rectify this dilemma soon he will end up alone. 	High Fidelity is a lot like Reality Bites in that we are voyeurs to losers finding love. The difference between Fidelity and Bites is that Fidelity isnt as smart, fresh or nearly as funny. But what saved me in this film was John Cusacks grasp of his character, we havent seen a Cusack like this in a long time. I loved a lot of his anecdotes to the camera and his illusion that the character is smarter than he can express. His chemistry with his cronies and their constant Top 5 mutterings were great character development. 	As the movie unfolded I was reminded of Kevin Smiths Clerks where the characters in that film were as ironic and socially confused as these guys. Is this an attempt by Hollywood to do a Kevin Smith type movie? If so I can see why Smith is the king of these kinds of films. Another Smith element used here is the use of visible Hollywood alumni in basic cameo type roles. Cameos here were done by such stars as Catherine Zeta Jones, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Lili Taylor, Sara Gilbert, and of course Tim Robbins. Robbins role was one of the funniest in the film. That whole confrontation scene will be a crowd pleaser. Where the movie waned for me was characters obsession with not letting go of the past. Also why was their constant communication between Cusack and his ex? Did the end of the film really solidify the end of this characters quest for happiness? Was making a commitment enough? In some ways I found it to be a Hollywood way of arriving at a happy ending. I would have preferred him grow into an adult and then find a happy relationship. But instead it seems the woman sacrificed it all to take one step back to be with him. Well breaking up is hard to do. (3 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer"

A song will never judge you<br/><br/>or walk out on you and there is a kind of comfort in that.<br/><br/>The screenplay also makes some fantastic observations on how men view love and relationships. Throughout the<br/><br/>film Cusack's character delivers several monologues to us<br/><br/>about his thoughts on past love affairs, one of my favourite<br/><br/>being the top five things he liked about Laura. It's a<br/><br/>touching, hopelessly romantic speech that reminded me a<br/><br/>lot of Woody Allen's list of things to live for in Manhattan<br/><br/>(1979).<br/><br/>The screenplay works so well because not only it is well<br/><br/>written but it also features a solid ensemble cast. The role<br/><br/>of Rob Gordon is clearly tailor-made for John Cusack. Rob<br/><br/>contains all the trademarks of the kinds of characters he's<br/><br/>known for: the cynical, self-deprecating humour, the love of<br/><br/>80s music, and the inability to commit to the woman of his<br/><br/>dreams. Even though High Fidelity is not directed by Cusack, like Grosse Pointe Blank, it is clearly his film, right<br/><br/>down to the casting of friends in front of and behind the<br/><br/>camera (i.e. actors Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor, his sister<br/><br/>Joan, and screenwriters, D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also fantastic, in particular, Jack<br/><br/>Black and Todd Louiso as the two guys who work at Championship Vinyl. Louiso's Dick is a shy, introverted guy<br/><br/>that you can imagine listening to The Smiths religiously,<br/><br/>while Black's Barry is a rude, annoying blowhard who says<br/><br/>everything you wish you could actually say in public. It's a<br/><br/>flashy, scene-stealing role that Black does to perfection.<br/><br/>And yet, his character isn't overused and only appears at<br/><br/>the right moments and for maximum comic effect. His sparing usage in High Fidelity made me want to see more<br/><br/>of him, which is why he works so well.<br/><br/>Even though the world and the characters in High Fidelity<br/><br/>are unashamedly of a rarified type: the obsessive music<br/><br/>geek or elitist, which some people may have trouble relating to, the film's conclusion suggests that there is<br/><br/>much more to life than one's all-consuming passion for<br/><br/>these things. It also helps to be passionate about someone. And that message is delivered in a refreshingly<br/><br/>honest and cliché-free fashion as it provides what is ultimately the humanist core of High Fidelity."

","There are rare occasions when I'm afraid to tell my friends how much I really loved a movie, because I'm afraid if I get too enthusiastic about it, they'll go to the theater with high expectations about it and won't be as pleasantly surprised and enjoy it as much as I did. They'll think, ""Well, that wasn't so great. What's HER deal??""<br/><br/>But, you won't do that, right? I can tell you how I really feel about High Fidelity, right? <br/><br/>I LOVED it! I laughed so loudly and for so long, that I was afraid I was going to be disruptive, so I held my hands over my mouth and had to stomp my foot on the floor to release some of that energy of mirth. At various times in my life, I've known every character who populated High Fidelity, and it was fun to spend time with them again. There was so much truth in the film and slice of life irreverence, there were moments when it hurt to watch.<br/><br/>
Director Stephen Frears likes to put surprises in his films, and there are some fun twists here. But mostly, this is John Cusack's world.  And welcome to it. <br/><br/>In the beginning of High Fidelity, Rob Gordon (Cusack) gets dumped by his girlfriend (Iben Hjejle). This prompts a period of soul searching and direct eye contact with the camera, during which Rob recounts his top five worst break ups. In between his introspective and revealing monologues, we get to see Rob's friends, family, fantasies and former loves. <br/><br/>There are so many fun cameo appearances here. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor and Sara Gilbert all have small parts. I wondered what in the heck prompted them to do the movie and hope it was Cusack's influence or that they just don't mind spending a few days on a fun flick. There are surprises from an actress playing a rock star and even a real rock star who gives Rob some good advice. <br/><br/>But, my favorite characters are the two guys who work for Rob at his vintage record store. Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso) provide a sort of Greek chorus for this modern male tragic comedy.  And many of the scenes that cracked me up were the three guys marking time at work debating lists of The Top Five... whatever.<br/><br/>The previews for High Fidelity made it look to me like mostly a chick flick, sort of a Say Anything for twenty somethings. But the truth is, this is a guy baring his soul and confessing to the guy flaws that make him unable to remain faithful and commit to a girl he loves. Fidelity isn't just the way a song is reproduced on vinyl, it's also the test of a relationship. The film High Fidelity remains faithful to the book by Nick Hornby. And it all rings true to me. <br/><br/>High Fidelity is rated R for language and some sexuality. The mature crowd enjoys High Fidelity more anyway, because we get all of the obscure music references. High Fidelity earns a four and a half on my scale, 0-5. It cracks the list of my top five movies of the century, with a bullet."

All that aside, High Fidelity is pure joy. You'd have to have the old stickeroo pretty far up your whatzit to not enjoy this movie. Cusack is great, of course, Cusack is my on screen counterpart, as ever (at least I'd like to think so) but the greatest pleasure I took in this move all came from JB.

That would have really pushed it over the top, however.<br/><br/>I thought Jack Black really stole the scene, however, with his patter and his attitude.  He's a whacko, for sure, and I hope we see a lot more of him. Someone mentioned that he was just playing Belushi playing Barry, but I disagree.  Belushi would have painted that character with a much, much broader brush, becoming a physical caricature. Jack's Barry was something a tad deeper.  The whole lounge-lizard routine at the end was a little shocking, and if Kyle had showed up for an acoustic set, it would have been really damn funny.<br/><br/>And what was up with Catherine Zeta-Jones not being credited?  that was kinda odd.<br/><br/>If I was inclined to rate it, I'd say 3 1/2 out of 5."

It becomes our secondary vocabulary, our means of assessing others. (As Cusack's character Rob Gordon says - ""It's about what YOU like, not about what you ARE like...""<br/><br/>And yes, the bad stuff is there too.  The elitist nature of the knowledgeable versus the neophytes, and the, at times, VERY compulsive nature of the hobby, to the point where it begins to overshadow everything else.<br/><br/>John Cusack nails the part of walking the line between being a bitter schmuck and someone you still feel worthy of rooting for.  Jack Black's character reminds me so much of many of my friends, quick to judge, elitist, and grating at times, but someone you still feel compelled to keep around.<br/><br/>And the character of Rob Gordon, scarily enough, is the closest thing I've seen to myself in film.  And yet there's still hope for him at the end. For this alone, the movie deserves an 7.

His self revelation is not overly surprising, but was to me tremendously satisfying.  The conflicting urges we all feel to see what is around the next bend, while simultaneously hang back and not commiting to the present and its potentials, are a large part of what makes us human.  This portrayal of his struggle to figure out where his failures have been (or, more precisely, why he has viewed certain events as failures), is enlightening and well-acted.  An excellent film."

Here's Cusack, forever rejected and confused.  Jack Black is the slightly deranged yet passionate musical nut, who definitely shines in the end.  I agree on some standpoints that it can lag with the constant monologues, but this definitely makes it easier for someone to become engrossed in the film if they can't happen to relate to the subject matter.  Some of the music titles flew over my head.  Maybe I'm not as well versed in that subject as I would like to be, but I feel that this film definitely deserves kudos for it's very snappy dialogue.  I haven't checked out the book, but I definitely plan on it.  For those of you who didn't enjoy the film, I think you should give it another chance.

","High Fidelity leads the audience through the lovelife of Rob Gordon (Cusack) as narrated by Gordon himself.  Rob has recently had a breakup with his girlfriend of several years, and this opens up a period of time in his life where he begins asking whether he is incompetent in relationships or merely if relationships are inherently faulty.  This dialogue with the audience is punctuated with hilarious instances of conflict with the two music nerds that work at Gordon's music store.  The choices of music in this movie are fantastic because most of them are quite obscure yet very good--perfect for a movie about music gurus.  Most of the acting is performed nearly flawlessly.  High Fidelity reminds me a lot of Annie Hall both in quality and content (although this one is more post-modern).  In fact, you could almost call this a Woody Allen movie without that annoying, neurotic Jewish guy.  The plot has numerous twists and turns without seeming busy, and the narrative format is perfect for conveying the personal tribulations that Gordon experiences.  I've given High Fidelity a tentative 10. . .almost a nine but the music is so good.  This one will surely be a classic sometime."

","The problem with HIGH FIDELITY is that it's already starting to look dated, and it's only five years old. The core problem is that it emerged from a very late-nineties cultural phenomena, that of the 'new lad' (i.e. men who think it's okay to be self-serving, self-indulgent slobs who treat women like dirt then laugh about it with their stagnant social circle over a beer) and its worthless offspring, 'lad-lit' (as in literature), which got a bunch of narrow-minded book critics raving over the ability of mediocre hacks like Nick Hornby and David Baddiel to pad a life of porn videos, football matches and failed relationships out to the length of a slim paperback. Another core problem with lad literature is its nerdy obsessiveness. Hornby could fill page after page with anally-retentive statistics regarding his favourite football team in the name of ""authenticity"", and nobody complained once. Bret Easton Ellis did a similar thing when he listed is-he-or-isn't-he psycho Patrick Bateman's endless array of gadgets and gizmos in American Psycho, but he was at least poking fun at the vacuous consumerism of the yuppie crowd - with Hornby, it all seemed depressingly real, as if he honestly believed people gave a stuff about what an anorak his lead character was. (I dread to think how many tedious conversations he's been cornered into by similarly inadequate football geeks.) HIGH FIDELITY does itself no favours by relocating the story to Chicago and getting John Cusack to play himself yet again (though I'll always think of him as playing his Better Off Dead character when confronted with this kind of shtick, but that's another story), but the real problem is that the film is way too long. It would have been entertaining as a one-hour TV special, but at its current length it drags, particularly after the halfway mark when the screenplay really seems to drag its heels, throwing in endless diversions and sub-plots that lead nowhere. And maybe I'm being overly picky, but would a music snob like Cusack's character really like someone as populist as Bruce Springsteen? Surely he'd have gone for Tom Petty, who did at least sing a lot of songs about girls rather than cars or redemption by water or whatever nonsense 'the Boss' is grumbling about half the time? Ah well..."
"stevencsholly@yahoo.com","2","2","5","16 October 2005"," Why change the location from London to Chicago?
","Having read the book by Nick Hornby, I was very much looking forward to seeing the movie. Imagine my surprise (and the surprise of everyone else who read the book and then saw the film) when the movie was transported to Chicago.<br/><br/>Taking a story written from the standpoint - and cultural milieu - of London, England, and transporting it to Chicago, Illinois, really ripped the heart out of the movie. The location change was self-indulgent on somebody's part, and wholly unnecessary. And not only was the location changed, but the music that the story revolved around was also changed.<br/><br/>Imagine putting a story about the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Paris or Brussels - the location change for High Fidelity makes about as much sense as this. This could (and should!) have been a good movie."
"gvf","Null","2","5","30 August 2004"," One of my all-tine favorites (may contain spoilers)
","This movie sums up a lot about failed relationships... especially about what it's like actually being the one who fails (i.e. gets dumped repeatedly).<br/><br/>John Cusack plays Rob Gordon, an introspective college dropout in his early-to-mid 30s who just barely gets by, running his own record store called ""Championship Vinyl"". One day his girlfriend leaves him, throwing his whole world in chaos. So he sits back, digs up old, painful memories and starts to wonder why he is ""doomed to be left"" - why he is always the one that gets dumped. He decides to get in touch with his ""top five"" ex-girlfriends (""those were the ones that really hurt"") to find answers and of course he also tries to get his now-ex girlfriend to go back out with him. Unfortunately, she is already ""otherwise involved"". So much for most of the story - I won't give away the ending here though, that's for you to find out ;-)<br/><br/>To base a movie on a Nick Hornby novel, like this one, is surely a good place to start, depending of course on how well the novel is adapted to the big screen. In this case, it works quite well, although not-so-minor changes have been made. For one thing, the setting is downtown Chicago, and not London, as it was in the original novel. <br/><br/>The casting is well done. First of all, anyone who appreciates Jack Black's abundant acting talent will LOVE the way he plays his freaked-out, neurotic ""Eric"" character. John Cusack also does a good job in his lead role, especially in sad moments where you can really feel the pain in his character while he has that sinister, regretful look on his face.<br/><br/>The film really is entertaining and offers a couple of great laughs alongside a somewhat deep and serious storyline. Maybe it lacks some pace every now and then, but instead you are rewarded with a few thought-provoking dialogs on the nature of relationships and why people fail at them. It makes this movie even more worthwhile. In fact, the first time I watched it, it did much to comfort me during a time when MY girlfriend had just left me... **spoiler ahead!!!** in my case, however, I wasn't lucky enough to get a happy ending like John Cusack does at the end of the movie... bummer :-/<br/><br/>All in all: Absolutely recommended... not just for someone who likes to be deep in thoughts about relationships ;-)<br/><br/>8/10"
"Idolprincess","7","2","5","11 July 2004"," A good movie that I couldn't really enjoy
","""High Fidelity"" is a movie that a lot of my friends liked and that had a high rating on most movie reviewing websites I've been to. It was also a comedy, and since I love comedies, I decided to rent it. I'm not sure if I can judge that movie properly for many reasons. First, I haven't read the book. Also, I'm not the age of the characters. I'm much younger and I haven't gone through high school in the early 80's like they have. And most of all, I don't know half of the music they talk about in the movie, which is one of the most important aspects to it. <br/><br/>This movie is very realistic and even though the characters are much older than my surroundings, they reminded me of people I've known before. I suppose this is because it tried to portray the ""alternative"" crowd, I guess. A lot of people would find humor in the realism of the movie and of the main character. The way modern love is shown in this movie is also very realistic, maybe too realistic for my own tastes... This is my problem with this movie, I guess. It's not that I expect typical fluffy movie romance with roses all over the place, but.. This doesn't exactly match with my ideals.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, the main character is very realistic. Sometimes, that made me feel like I could relate to him. I also felt sympathy for him and laughed at times. But sometimes, this realism had the complete opposite effect on me. I don't know if anyone else felt this way, but I guess it's a good thing. It means it was well-made. <br/><br/>There is a few very funny scenes involving the main character in my opinion, but the funniest part of the movie involves his co-workers. Jack Black is very funny.<br/><br/>I think this is a great movie for many reasons. I can tell that some people are going to relate to the main characters and to his experience with women as well as his love for music. I know people are going to relate to the whole universe of ""high fidelity"". I just couldn't personally relate to it."

You might also have got away with the idea if it was very moving or maybe had a surprise ending, neither of which happened here.<br/><br/>I never remotely cared or liked any character in this, the time scale & flashbacks didn't appear to always be coherent, (the scenes could've been put together in any order) I found the Jack Black character one of the most annoying in any film ever (maybe he was meant to be, but he irritated me almost as much as the bird in Blair Witch Project). As a 20something male, none of Rob's behaviour struck any cords with me.

I felt like I was watching a cinematic, though darker version of How I Met Your Mother and can see this might have influenced the character development of that show or at least Mosby.<br/><br/>Some viewers, will say it's not funny - I heartily chuckled in places. Tim Robbins, the love rival, gets too small a part, a sub-plot. How much of this feature was haphazardly left on the cutting-room floor? At no point are we informed as to why Cusack needs the girl and they have zero chemistry. Cusack wears the same hang-dog expression throughout, often whilst standing in the rain in his Brando leather jacket.<br/><br/>I like music. I like indie music. So what. Yes I know of Belle and Sebastian, but this in no way makes the film more relatable and shouldn't alter anyone's appreciation of the proceedings. The problem I found was the uneven pace and loose structure. It's slow and feels like an almost 3h feature but I persisted. The last half hour feels rushed and seemingly attempting to squeeze in a large section of the book, with sparse dialog. I was enjoying it, but then it ran out of steam so noticeably that I scored it a 4 rather than a 7. It's overrated."

In my personal opinion, the first half of this film is fantastic, funny and sophisticated. The second half of this film fell quite flat with that typical romantic comedy storyline which seems to plague most of these films. But all in all, the film ends up being decent, leaves a slightly bad taste in your mouth at the end, but you will reminisce the first half to make it better. <br/><br/>Good for the most part, but I very much dislike the final half hour.

","John Cusack has made a career out of playing offbeat, off-center characters. High Fidelity could well be his finest hour. <br/><br/>The movie centers on the trials and tribulations of the love life of Rob Gordon. Rob runs a used record store (as in, they sell vinyl), and he likes to put not just music, but various aspects of his life in the context of ""top 5"" lists.<br/><br/>When the story starts, we see Laura, Rob's most recent girlfriend, leave him, prompting him to come up with, ""My desert island, all-time, top- five most memorable breakups, in chronological order, are as follows...(various names) Can you see your name on that list, Laura? Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten. But there's just no room for you in the top five, sorry! Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliation and heartbreak you're just not capable of delivering."" Rob then proceeds to give a recap of his various misadventures in love, starting with his first breakup in grade school. He also talks extensively about the highs and lows of his relationship with Laura. Of course, we find out that Laura's departure has gotten to Rob a lot more than he initially admits. Rob talks to the camera throughout this movie, much in the same way he might talk to his therapist about his life, his loves, his friends and his hopes and dreams.<br/><br/>In between flashbacks, we meet some of the quirky people in Rob's life, most notably Barry and Dick (played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso), the two cultural rejects who work for him at the record store. Along with Rob, they like to fancy themselves as pop music aficionados and look down on the musically undiscriminating masses (Barry is especially annoying in this regard, even refusing to sell a record to a potential customer and treating him like garbage simply because, ""he offended me with his terrible taste!"").<br/><br/>Cusack is great at playing characters who are borderline insane, and this movie is definitely no exception. One passage pretty much sums up this flick: After Charlie, #3 on his list (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) dumps him, Rob essentially goes nuts and rants on the street outside her window, ""Charlie! You f#%ing b!tch!! Let's work it out!!"" Then there's the scene where Rob fantasizes about pounding the stuffing out of the condescending and pretentious Ray (aka Ian), ""the other guy"" Laura's been seeing (played by Tim Robbins).<br/><br/>High Fidelity is a terrific story about life and love with intelligent, clever, thoughtful dialog and memorable, quirky characters that draw you right in. It's far too innovative and non-formulaic to be classified as your basic rom com, but it's definitely a good one to see with a date."

However, the jokes and the situation makes it hard to see and kind of love him, which in turn enables you to really appreciate the whole story.<br/><br/>The characters are well played, Jack Black is his exuberant early self, and even the other sales clerk provides us with a lovable quiet self-effaced persona (a great balance to Cusack and Black). John Cusack himself is great, if a tiny bit over the top (which makes the movie, I must say), and his sister, Joan, is particularly well casted.<br/><br/>The dialogs are near perfect, the montage is without reproach (I especially like the one live mental alternate possibilities), and the soundtrack amazing.<br/><br/>See it, especially if you like lots of smart text."

The musical moron twins, Barry and Dick, played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso, is an absolute treat to watch.

"napierslogs","9","1","2","1 June 2011"," The realistic and insightful comedy to the hopelessness of relationships
","""High Fidelity"" is really not a romantic comedy. It's a comedy about the hopelessness of men and romance. Rob (John Cusack) is thirty-something and he owns a record store, but that's just because that's what happens after you break-up with a girl in college and you go into a stupor for days, weeks, months, years and when you wake up you have aged but not matured. The fact that Rob and his fellow record store employees are not mature is an understatement. And that's where the comedy comes in.<br/><br/>The narration of Rob's thoughts and the analysis of his ""top 5 break-ups of all time"" are hilarious. The overall consensus that men are stupid and women are from another planet is taken to extremes, but realistic extremes. I, too, was shocked that his ex-girlfriend Charlie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) was in the phone book! Girls like Charlie shouldn't exist, but I'm not surprised that people like Nick Horny and his alter-ego Rob find them.<br/><br/>Author Nick Hornby has an incredible talent for characterization; turning every day life into absurdities but back into realities and then making light of it all. Cusack fully embodies the immaturity and frustrations of slacker Rob, while Jack Black pours all of his manic energy into music exhibitionist Barry.<br/><br/>Set in a record store with music lists like ""top 5 albums to play on a Monday morning"", music is certainly a major part of ""High Fidelity""—but not overwhelmingly so. It's funny and meaningful for snobs and neophytes alike, but preferably somewhere in between so you can appreciate their jabs at the smarter-than-thou indie-hipster scene.<br/><br/>Breaking-up may be hard to do, but ""High Fidelity"" does it with a pumping soundtrack, insightful humour, and immensely quotable and hilarious dialogue."

Some nice performances, however. Cusack is not one of them. He seems to be in this for the paycheck. He mugs and has all of the emotional range of a chicken. Mugging is not acting. The girlfriend is good, unknown to me and convincing, given the banal script. The balding clerk does a wonderfully ditsy nerdy turn with just the perfect physical and verbal mannerisms that make you believe he is who he is playing.

Kids these days all have mp3 players, I'd be surprised if they even knew what a CD was. But these elements do not date this film, they enrich it, give it nostalgia.<br/><br/>Don't be too quick to heap this film in with other so called music flicks like Empire Records, which is good in it's own right, but these are two different flicks. High Fidelity recounts the top 5 break-ups from Rob, who breaks the 4th wall to talk to the audience about those break-ups. He decides to go back and talk to these girls to see what went wrong and what does it all mean.

","One of the top five best movies of all-time about the fear and loneliness that is settling down. I decided to revisit this masterpiece after I paged through Nick Hornby's novel that inspired this Chicago filmed classic.<br/><br/>It is unbelievable that movies can sometimes just hit you and let you know that other people have experienced exactly what you're feeling (probably one billion times before, like even cavemen looked at their girlfriends once or twice and said, ""that's it, eh?""). Most people will take this as a movie about breaking up (but it's not), and lots of people just see this move as a chick-flick for dudes (but it sort of is). It's the greatest dude-flick of all time (if you count Terminator 2 and The Matrix as ""guy movies"" and say Swingers as another ""dude flick"").<br/><br/>Being a business owner in his mid-twenties who used to live in the same neighborhood Championship Vinyl was in skews my opinion a bit, but I have to say that the movie is about growing up in the twentieth century. We're not supposed to be married at twenty-one anymore and that creates a lot of time to mess up our relationships and turn into jaded, pessimistic, intelligent, nerds. Cusack is so believable in this role, and you like this character so much that you find yourself defending his flaws in your own mind. He creates a character that allows the viewer to suspend judgment. I suddenly find myself scanning through the minutia of my own hobbies looking for the smallest details to enjoy. Few movies make you think about them after they're long done, but I make constant correlations to myself and Rob as much as possible. It becomes a parable to live by.<br/><br/>It gets a nine because the ending isn't perfect. Most of the time I turn the movie off right when the girl comes in to give him an interview. I can't stand the real ending of this movie, or the book for that matter. This movie is so much like real life that it kills me that the ending drapes itself in a fairy tale. As if to say, ""Okay ladies, I know you'd all be angry if it ended like real life right now, so to please all sexes I'll throw a little happy ending in for you."" Hmm... sounds like a masseuse I know...<br/><br/>There are scenes in the book where Rob is hanging out with his parents that are not in the movie. Where Rob contemplates suicide because some nerd-looking-thirty-five-year-old enjoying a movie with his parents smiles at him to clue him into being in the same predicament. Rob takes the smile as a clue-in to his hell. It's a classic reading moment where you're literally laughing out loud (instead of the figurative internet way that makes my brain want to explode). Plus, the whole funeral scene is completely different in the movie. The book in general really comes off as so much more anti-women. Laura isn't so damn lovable. Except that I really don't see how people can find Iben Hjejle sexy, or even likable really.<br/><br/>Cusack is better in this movie, than anything I've seen him in. Jack Black is perfect as Barry and is closest to his novel character. I can very much tell Jack Black is a Hornby fan (hmmm.... thirty-something stoner with a rock band... is that such a stretch?) I can sit around saying how great the book was, but the only thing that matters is that the movie really gave it justice and if I'm Nick Hornby, I owe a big one to Frears and Cusack for really giving my readership a little (no, a big) reach-around."

I had heard about the book and the film quite a while ago in passing - probably on Wikipedia - and when I heard that the film featured loads of music and film references, I was intrigued. I had seen ""Tapeheads"" before, which was both Tim Robbins' and John Cusack's first feature film in which they acted. ""Tapeheads"" was about the two starting a music video directing company. It's was really strange, and absurd to say the least - very very very 80's! Just to tell you what the film is about. It's about a man (Robert) in his thirties who lives in Chicago and owns a record store. He has a great fondness for popular music, and likes to talk about music if he can in conversation - in fact, there's one scene in which he discusses the ""science and art of creating the perfect compilation"". Featured throughout the film are pretentious ""Top 5"" lists he compiles - like ""Top 5 opening tracks"" or ""Top 5 Dream Jobs"". The first one that he begins the film with is his ""Top 5 Worst Break-Ups"" and he proceeds to talk about them, through the aid of flashbacks. He has recently broken up with a girl named Laura (played by Hjejle), and has consequently positioned her at ""No. 5 with a bullet"" because she has decided to be with a ex-neighbour whom he particularly detests (incidently, played by Tim Robbins). He then seeks out his ""Top 4 Break-Ups"" in an attempt to discover why he always screws up with the opposite sex.<br/><br/>I was very glad to have caught ""High Fidelity"" three minutes in on BBC1 - and am even more so now that I have seen it. Much like the ""Top 5"" lists featured in the film, there are films that just, once you've seen them once, you just adore them and want to share them with as many people as you can - High Fidelity is no exception, and makes my Top 5, I think.<br/><br/>The film is essentially more about love than music or pop references however, but don't be expecting embarrassing clichés and whatnot! Every reference to love or relationships and everything isn't sweetly sick and all the funny moments are neatly scattered across the film to ensure that the ""love"" parts don't become too forced or cheesy. Love is dealt with within the film to a great big deal, but it's very subtle - and it's done in a very tidy way, with John Cusack giving soliloquies every second scene as to how he feels, and analysing what he wants.<br/><br/>I think it's a great film for people my age - the bombardment of pop references do nothing but help this film achieve a ""youth-savvy"" status - and as a result, it helps people like me, who are still learning and coming to grips with the all relationships thing, to have an interest in this film, and Cusack's situations. The film explores the theme of not just falling in love, but also falling out of love - a topic not touched on by many authors or film-makers.<br/><br/>I've only seen this film once, but I'm convinced it will stand the test of time, as they say, because it effectively demonstrates how messy and how confusing ""break-ups"" and ""get-back-together-agains"" inevitably are. And even despite the fact that I didn't recognise all of the tunes played, it's ""dated"" soundtrack is filled with old-fashioned, hearty music. It's good stuff - music that you don't have to put much effort into listening to appreciate it. This film doesn't need to be updated with today's popular hits for its music to remain modern - sounds perfectly cool as it is. (There's at least one Chemical Brothers song, so it's not all Belle & Sebastian or Stevie Wonder)"
"nymovielover1961","10","1","2","17 January 2008"," High Fidelity, is an outrageous comedy that presents life, love, and job, of Rob Gordon, a self-destructive list-maker, dealing with all three.
","""What came first, music or the misery? People worry about kids playing with guns. Or watching violent videos and that some sort of cultural violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands, of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable or was I miserable because I listened to pop music."" <br/><br/>From the opening words, High Fidelity will make you laugh and fall in love with it. John Cusack's best movie to date. While watching the movie, you'd never know that he wrote some of the screenplay and was a music supervisor for the movie- two very big accomplishments since the movie is so great for its sharp and endearing comedic aspects and the music that lies beneath them. <br/><br/>With artists ranging from The Chemical Brothers to The Vaselines, High Fedelity easily has one of the year's, and perhaps the century's, greatest soundtracks. The music knowledge displayed by both the people who pick the songs and the characters who exhibit them will make you feel so musically inadequate that you want to go out and by every record mentioned (even the Peter Frampton).<br/><br/>Besides it hilarious and precise writing, courtesy of Nick Hornby, High Fidelity offers a look into the inner workings of the male mind-- with everything from crappy-yet-not-crappy jobs, life-styles, list-making habits, and self-destructive love lives. Rob's love life provides the heart of the movie (letting old loves die and growing up), while his job provides his hilarity (with Barry, portrayed by Jack Black, and Dick), and his list-making seamlessly ties the whole thing together. <br/><br/>All together, the movie is nearly flawless, musically brilliant, and a work of art. Many call me crazy for loving it so much, but this movie will give you chills (even when Jack Black sings ""Let's Get it On"")."
"cericsso","10","1","2","4 January 2008"," A real study of male behavior, in high fidelity
","It needs to be said right from the start; ""High Fidelity"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, period. Based on British author Nick Hornby's novel, and adapted into an American surrounding, co-produced and starring, among others, John Cusack, this is The Movie of heartbreak, sorrow, break-up, love, sex and most of all, music. And it's all told from a male perspective.<br/><br/>Cusack stars as Rob Gordon, a juvenile thirty-something guy working at a record store with his two equally-minded friends. Rob is a music enthusiast with a collection of (what can only seem like) hundreds of labels, which he meticulously re-arranges in different orders at various times of his life. The story kicks off when Laura, Rob's long-time girlfriend, decides she's had enough, and leaves Rob, moving out of their mutual apartment. This thrusts Rob into not only an endless pit of sorrow and self-deprivation, but also a quest to find out what it is that has always made him such a lousy boyfriend. To do so, he goes through what he calls the ""Top Five Break-Up""-list of previous relationships, trying to contact them again hoping to gain some more knowledge about himself, with varying results. To top it all off, it very quickly seems as if there is a ""certain other"" involved in his ex-girlfriend's life. This all, while working with two guys who are of no help whatsoever. In other words, it seems like a nightmare..<br/><br/>What, for me at least, made ""High Fidelity"" so enormously superb is, that you just really connect to it. Not just as a great story, but from your own experience. It's funny to the point where you laugh out loud (which happens a lot) and you just sympathize with the characters and the misery, grief and subsequent happiness, as if you know exactly what's going on, because at some point in you're own life, you've probably experienced it. Going through the entire process of a break-up, Rob essentially functions as a mirror of every guy whose been in that very situation. The movie capture all those familiar quirky thoughts, those worst of fears visualizing in your head, the feelings of self-loathing and hatred and the hope that the music you listen to will speak to you directly, and they're so well written and acted out, that by the time the ending credits hit you, it actually feels quite spooky.<br/><br/>At this point, a word can be said about the casting. If there ever was a role made for John Cusack, this here is it. Portraying the juvenile, self-deprivating and melancholic Rob with his own distinguishable charismatic style and mannerisms, Cusack is just spot on. This is absolutely one of his best works. His constant narrations straight to the camera and audience, and as such, the breaking of the fourth wall makes it so much more tangible. Other roles include Jack Black, as one of Rob's co-workers, which he plays very similarly to all his characters, but with some great lines. Tim Robbins, as the new boyfriend, is also just plain awesome (which can be expected of Robbins), as is the relatively unknown Danish Iben Hjejle as Laura. The movie is also filled with some other celebrity roles, and don't miss the cameo appearance by Bruce Springsteen as a ""mentoring voice"" in Rob's head.<br/><br/>To top it all of, let it be known that ""High Fidelity"" has one of the best soundtracks, ranging from Lou Reed, Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Blondie and Marvin Gaye to The Kinks and Queen. And to ignore the role this music has in ""High Fidelity"" would be more than unjust, since it is, like the title implies, the soul and essence here. Instead of just working as background and fill-in for the on screen events, these are hand-picked tracks, sometimes played by the characters, but mostly just adding that exactly right momentum to the scenes that makes you want to smile. Like the soundtrack of your life, this is a movie everyone should see at least once, with, or without, you're significant other by your side."
"miguelfeyfer","Null","1","2","11 December 2007"," Does love belongs to music?
","I must say that ""High Fidelity"" is an amazing movie, and really surprised me as I expected just a comedy, which is certainly not. I love Stephen Frears, who made ""Open your ears"" or ""My little launderette"", a film that let the world hear about a guy named Daniel Day Lewis. As British Stephen don't loose the habit of letting us know stars-to-be, Jack Black's appearance almost justify the whole movie. But of course there is a lot more. I couldn't read the Nick Hornsby's novel in which the script is based, but the idea of finding out the reasons for failure in love just revisiting former girlfriends is wonderfully developed. The cast is remarkable, John Cusack plays one of his best roles, and Lisa Bonet is so beautiful that made me think that the story is -in a point at least-quite false. Who can leave her so easily? Not me. I'm a record fan myself, and we know that making a tape means a lot, and is not easy at all, specially when the woman involved is important or pretty. Near Zappa, we can ask ourselves ""Does love belongs to music?"" The answer is in ""High Fidelity"". Ah, and Jack Black can sing."
"Antigoon","6","1","2","15 February 2007"," Life is music
","High fidelity tells the story of Rob Gordon (John Cusack), a record store owner whom his girlfriend has just dumped. Rob is reassessing his top 5 break ups to figure out why it always goes wrong.<br/><br/>The film's central place is the record store Championship vinyl; music geek Dick and annoying little prick Barry (the very well casted Tod Louiso and Jack Black) rule the place. Many of the scenes here are hilarious (especially when the great Tim Robbins appears) and form the heart of the film. The setting is really good, a pretty dirty shop at the edge of town, Rob and his employees are everything but commercially minded, filling the days with seemingly useless discussions (but we all know that useless discussions are very important), annoying customers and arguing  just lovely. Gradually we learn about Rob's former break ups and how he moves on in his relationship with Laura.<br/><br/>There's no great cinematography here, no extraordinary directing or camera-work, none of that, just a very honest, enthusiastic narrating about a guy living the life and everything that goes along with it. Love, rejection, pain, happiness,  with characters which many of us will relate to, normal people in all there shortcomings, no heroes. As it's main characters, the film as well suffers from shortcomings, e.g. the part after Laura's father died, is not adding anything and there is no prominent role for music, at least not enough, truly a mistake seen the setting of the film and Rob's life which evolves around pop music.<br/><br/>But it's hard not to sympathize with the characters and hence to like the film, it doesn't pretend to be more than what it is, I'd even say it wouldn't be as good as it is if it was made less spontaneous. The story holds a lot of truth and is lovingly told; it's warm, it's funny and it's damn real.<br/><br/>No great cinema but good for the heart."
"havefun2687","7","1","2","6 January 2006"," Great idea, not that great of a film
","Before starting this review i would just like to say that my two greatest loves are film and music. Therefore when i heard about this movie I just had to see it.<br/><br/>Upon seeing this movie i was very disappointed due to my expectations. The movie is nothing special. It often drags and the story line is weak. However there are many good factors of the film too that must be pointed out.<br/><br/>The dialogue in High Fidelity is very creative. Anyone who has a love of music or who has been in love and heart broken will be able to relate. In addition, the movie uses some really effective techniques that provide a very comical atmosphere, such as Rob (John Cusack) narrating the film and at times talking to the camera.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is flawless too. The actors are able to entertain and portray the characters perfectly.<br/><br/>The characters are very well constructed. My favourite two characters would be Dick and Barry. Barry is a music lover who believes that his view on music is the only right one and Dick is a music geek. They are able to give the movie an extra comedic spark.<br/><br/>The idea for this movie is excellent. The characters and the acting is great too. However, this isn't translated into the story line which is bland at times. Anyone who loves music and movies should enjoy this film, but should not expect to much because it is no masterpiece."
"gelman@attglobal.net","6","1","2","2 January 2006"," Too Talky and Too Long
","""High Fidelity"" has its moments: But it meanders all over the place, has Cusack on screen talking to the audience far too often -- and it's self-indulgent. But the Danish actress, Iben Hjejle, is excellent as Cusack's girl friend and I'm sorry she hasn't chosen (or hasn't been asked) to make additional movies in America because she more than holds her own both as an actress and as a beauty. The best thing about this movie, however, is Jack Black as a clerk in Cusack's record store who won't sell to customers whose musical tastes he considers inferior (which seems to be everybody who enters the store) and Todd Luiso as another and even weirder member of Cusack's sales staff. There are cameo appearances by Catherine Zeta-Jones as one of Cusack's former girl friends, Tom Robbins as Cusack's temporary successor as Hjejle's boy friend, Lisa Bonet as a singer whose bed Cusack occupies while he's separated from Hjejle and Bruce Springsteen as himself. Whether it's Cusack, who co-produced and co-scripted the film, or Stephen Frears who directed, I don't know. But someone should have trimmed 20-30 minutes from this movie and improved it by 50 percent."
"w2amarketing","6","1","2","3 September 2005"," Better Off Dead -- 15 Years Later
","***Some cryptic spoilers possibly ahead*** In many ways, this is the sequel to BETTER OFF DEAD (1985). Rob / Lane is 15 years older, has a job, but still struggling with relationships. The movies are strikingly similar -- music plays a key role in both; Cusack's character is dumped at the beginning; he finds true love at the end (albeit in BOD with a different person); there's a hodgepodge of bizarre supporting characters that move in and out of the story with, in the end, Rob / Lane and his ""true love"" being the only ones that are anything close to ""normal."" There are differences, also, of course -- Rob speaks directly to the audience throughout, something Lane never does. For that reason, HF is a heavier film -- more drama, more ""black"" comedy, versus BOD with its lighter comedy bordering on slapstick at times, and dramatic elements which are present primarily in the background. Then there's the constant profanity, again perhaps inevitable, but an obvious difference.<br/><br/>Even without making the comparison (unfortunately, for me every Cusack role ends up being inevitably compared to BOD), HF is still rather rough around the edges. Granted, it will have meaning to many, but I found myself halfway through being grateful that I got married young and don't have to worry about all this serial dating / relationship nonsense. Cusack is about my age, so I look at his roles as portraying people my age. I got married at 22 and have never regretted it; the idea of cohabitation with multiple partners without any sense of security of stability is therefore entirely foreign to me. Again, it probably means something to other people in my age group, but I'm personally glad I ""missed out"" on all that.<br/><br/>My other criticism, alluded to earlier, is that this really isn't a comedy. I don't think I laughed once. On the DVD, I watched the trailer after seeing the movie and laughed out loud. The trailer is a thousand times funnier than the movie itself (and, in fact, contains several scenes that aren't in the final cut, while misrepresenting other scenes). The movie really isn't that funny -- some black comedy, some irony, some clever twists and dialog, but it's really a ""heavy"" film about struggling in relationships, work, friends, parents and overall identity for twenty- and thirty-somethings."
"philip_vanderveken","8","1","2","17 August 2005"," Not too sweet and very recognizable.
","This movie has been on my list of movies that I want to see for quite some time. I knew that it got a very nice rating on this website and I was quite curious about it. But it wouldn't be the first disappointment because I was expecting too much of it and that's why I never came to watching it. Until now. Don't ask me why, because there was no special reason for it. I didn't just break up with my girlfriend, so it wasn't a choice of movie that seemed to be right for the moment.<br/><br/>Rob is in his thirties and is the owner of a record-store that is situated in one of the worst neighborhoods to start a business in because there is almost no-one passing by. He doesn't have too much clients and his two clerks aren't exactly a great help either. But he doesn't really care, because he has other, bigger problems on his mind. He isn't a teenager anymore, although he sometimes still acts like one and he finally realizes that it's about time that he starts to grow up. His girlfriend has left him and in order to deal with the pain he starts to make a list of the five worst break-ups in his life. And while doing so, he recalls each break-up, tries to reconnect with his former girlfriends in order to find out why they dumped him...<br/><br/>If the ladies are looking for an insight in the mind of the average man in his late twenties, early thirties, this might be a good movie to watch. And for us men it's nice to see that you aren't the only one who still seems to think like a teenager from time to time, even though you're already past that age for at least more than a decade. It's all recognizable and that's what makes this movie so funny. We all went (some of us probably still are) through such a 'crisis' and it's always nice to see a comedy that makes fun of it. And it has to be said, even though this could be categorized as a romantic comedy, this is by far one of the best in the genre, because there is absolutely nothing syrupy about it. I've seen several romantic comedies lately and seeing one as good as this one is a rarity, believe me.<br/><br/>That it is so good also has a lot to do with the acting of course. John Cusack, Todd Louiso and Jack Black, who were really perfectly cast for their roles, really did a very fine job. Their three characters together made it perfect. If one of them would have been left out, this could never have been the same fine comedy. But they weren't the only good ones in this movie. A nice 'surprise' was Iben Hjejle. I had seen her once in ""Mifune's Last Song"", but I didn't know that she had played English speaking roles as well. She really did well and I hope to see her in similar roles soon.<br/><br/>All in all this is one of the best examples when it comes to romantic comedies. This may well be one of the few that will appeal to women as well as to men, because it all is so recognizable and not sweet at all. I certainly liked it and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10."

Like the location, in the book it takes place in England, in the movie, Chicago.  And in the book the top five all-time desert island break-ups list was a bit different, anyway, I still don't get why I liked it that much.

"Bulldog332","7","1","2","16 May 2004"," I liked it, but...
","I have to admit, I was very sceptical about the predicted success of this picture in the weeks before it's release.<br/><br/>Nick Hornby - even though he's an Arsenal fan! - is an incredibly touching writer. He can put into words all the things that men, whether in a relationship or not, just cannot explain. When I first read the novel I was dumbstruck - he seemed to be describing the exact same emotions I went through in similar (if a little more acrimonious) breakups. It felt personal - he seemed to understand ME in a way no mate or other confidante could. I sang the writer's praises, recommended the book to all my friends...then heard that he had sold the film rights, agreeing for it to be set in the States. <br/><br/>I was, to say the least, annoyed and a little...well, hurt. Betrayed, even. How could he cheapen what we had together - our mutual lack of understanding of women (London women, I hasten to add) - by doing this? I was indignant!<br/><br/>The American film and TV industries have a knack of destroying anything decent to come out of our English screen market in recent years - 'Absolutely Fabulous' and 'As If' immediately spring to mind - but that's forgivable. However, changing the location of an essentially English, or dare I say 'London', novel is another thing entirely. However, it seems that to get a British film made these days, you have to either change the location to the States (like this one) or change the lead character into an American (The Beach - a fantastic book ruined to make a highly average film).<br/><br/>It can be argued that basic human emotions, feelings and general reactions to the opposite sex are universal, pretty much the same the world over. But, even though I know it's fairly irrational and a little bit selfish, I wanted 'High Fidelity' to stay just between me and the writer. And if he wanted to sell the film rights, then I wanted it to stay between him and...England, I suppose. Irrationality is a family trait of mine.<br/><br/>Given the fact that a huge percentage of British films that actually get made are funded by American investors, I suspect that this trend for 'Americanising' British scripts and novels will continue for the foreseeable future - unless the British Film Industry (and the British Film Council in particular) pulls it's finger out and invests in the considerable talents of Britain."

","Nick Hornby's novel ""High Fidelity"" was a compulsively readable, daring piece. It combined moments of hilarity with a mindblowing epiphany that completely changes protagonist Rob's life. Sadly, this is all missing in this weak adaptation. John Cusack is convincing for the most part as Rob, but at times comes across as too shrill and obnoxious to ever have been even considered by the women he dates. But this is nothing compared to the series of almost comical miscastings that occur within the film. Iben Hjelje takes on the crucial role of Rob's girlfriend and decimates it with her expressionless monotone. Lisa Bonet, while a fine actress, does not capture the air of grace that folk-singer Marie really should possess. Beside this, the script is generally weak and it truly does lose something in bringing a quisentially British book into an American setting. So is the movie a total loss? Well, no. Jack Black and Todd Luiso are equal parts hilarious and touching in their portrayals of sad sack 30-somethings working at a record store. Their scenes are the only moments of brightness in this dull, dull film."

","Yes, I did laugh occasionally here and there... but the fact is that these characters are pathetic.  Rob (John Cusack) is completely possessive/obsessive and self centered, unable to be vulnerable or caring even for a moment -- his string of failed relationships is obvious and understandable, as is his self-pity (he really is as worthless as he feels himself to be).  Nobody (at least nobody I can think of) could like or relate to this guy, or the people he works with at ""Championship Vinyl.""<br/><br/>Unfortunately, liking and/or identifying with the characters is necessary in a character-driven film like this... so it becomes an exercise in tedium almost immediately.  Although not without some redeeming qualities, even being a vinyl fan (like myself) doesn't save the picture from its own leaden weight and banal predictability.  6/10"

","While it was a bit of a lukewarm surprise to actually hear four Drag City recording artists in the movie (note to the unaware: the ""demo tape"" that the skate punks made was actually real music by a real life established band- Royal Trux- which was a totally unrealistic point in the movie, esp. since the lead singer heard on the ""demo tape"" happens to be a female), I as a non-fictional music enthusiast felt inadequately stereotyped and somewhat patronized. High Fidelity misses the point in portraying record nerds the same way Hollywood usually misses the point in portraying christians: you can't can't get the real humor and drama out of a picture unless you can fully  comprehend the people you are depicting and convince THEM to believe in your story. I was not convinced. This movie did little for me except serve as a strong reminder as to why I prefer mail order to physical record stores: most people who work in record stores are annoying. Beyond that, I thought the acting was standard and the story was completely boring. Buy the soundtrack and wait for the video if you really think you absolutely must suffer through this."

I was right.  Instead of a cute 80s obsessed hitman we have a cute 80s to early 90s obsessed whiner who sleeps with a lot of chicks. And oh how the chicks annoyed me too.  I imagine most people who liked the movie convinced themselves that Lisa Bonet's kickback nu-soul character was 'sultry', or that Catherine Zeta-Jones' too-cool yuppie was sexy, but not me.<br/><br/>One of the few pleasurable moments in the movie was when John Cusak realized just how wretched a person Catherine Zeta-Jones' character was.  But she's the only one who gets what's coming.  I mean, how could anyone want to put cute little John Cusak in his place, with his cute little practiced puppydog look and mushy-wushy monologues about his girlfriend rubbing her feet together in her sleep, awwww......   I just could never be as convinced of John Cusak's cuteness as he is.<br/><br/>So why did I rent it in the first place?  For Jack Black as the fat, bullying record nerd.

","Cusack tries to revert back to his brilliant 80's work, but fails hugely with this aimlessly written nonsense.  I understand that lots of folks absolutely adore this.  For me, I will never see how.  Unknown songs (and I LOVED the 80's) are constantly referred to, Cusack is totally unlikable and miserable, and a guy I'm really gettin' sick of seeing, the pudgy, utterly annoying Jack Black didn't help either.  My honesty must step in here as I only saw the first half hour of this.  My trial period for a film has always been a half hour, and never once in that short time did I come close to cracking a smile.  LOW marks for ""High Fidelity""."

","There was something about this movie that seemed to drag on indefinitely. The pace of the story seemed painstakingly slow and most redundant at times. As for the advertised hilarity, only the character of Barry (Jack Black) seemed to strain for laughs. John Cusacks character (Rob) was downright melancholic in comparison, and through repeated viewing (not by my choice), I find myself yelling insults at his pathetic character constantly obsessing over girl troubles all the way down to his childhood loves. Also, I realized that Stephen Frears used addiction, or love of, if you prefer, vinyl to contrast all the relationship problems, it just didn't come off as being honest enough.  Instead of recommending High Fidelity try Annie Hall by Woody Allen, a superior in every aspect, including the dialogue delivered to audience."

","Everyone seems to really like this movie, not me.  My main problem with the movie is that the John Cusack character is entirely unlikeable but at the same time not so bad that I hate him.  This left me unsure of how to feel about the characters and events of the film.  From one point of view the Cusack character is immature and pitiful, from another he is just down right rotten, this left me kind of unsure how to feel.  Another thing worth mentioning: the musical references in this movie are so absurd that I grew to despise the top 5 lists.  The one thing that saves this movie from a rating of 1 is the cameo by Bruce Springsteen.  Woo NJ!"

","The most singular most interesting thing about this movie is that it made it to the IMdb Top 250 list.  I am not saying that certain parts were not enjoyable, but the movie as a whole was a disappointment.  I rented this movie expecting more of a comedy.  Instead, I got a movie that was more about a defunct relationship and a man trying to breath life into it.  The only enjoyable parts took place in the video store with the very underrated actor Jack Black and funny actor Todd Louiso.  I am a big fan of John Cusack, but he did nothing that he has not done previously.  This romantic comedy failed because it should have centered more around the ""comedy"" component instead of almost ignoring it to a degree.  I did not sympathize or care for the characters at all and I really did not want them to stay together.  They were like children.  Laura left him and wanted him to get over her, yet she showed up everywhere he was.  She called him, she was always around him I just wanted this ridiculous game they were playing to finish.  The movie dragged.  And for some odd reason, I felt suddenly very tired after watching it.  I do not know where the praise for this film came from.  I think that Pushing Tin (similar in that it was about an ended/ending relationship) was much better than this bore of a movie and yet, it has like a 6 and people are so very critical of it on the IMdb. That movie had an equal amount of comedy and romance.  This movie, was more romantic, but I thought it was very unromantic.  <br/><br/>The other good aspects (those of which are few) of this movie is that John Cusack as the dumped boyfriend had bad qualities.  He was not perfect, he was somewhat the protagonist with human faults.  The music of course was great.  And I believe this is why High Fidelity is praised.  People love that the movie incorporates classic songs instead of modern ones to give an underlying message in the movie. <br/><br/>Don't waste your money on this movie, unless you:<br/><br/>A)Love John Cusack B)Love music C)Can relate to a truly messed up and almost hopeless relationship. D)You have enough caffeine to maintain yourself awake through the two hour something long movie."

","This adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel about the owner of a hipster vinyl store who won't grow up doesn't provoke laughs. It doesn't earn smiles, or good will, either. It just sits there implacably on the screen as John Cusack, playing Rob, the owner of Championship Vinyl, talks into the camera about his problems with women. The director, Stephen Frears, has wandered away from his talent. In movies like PRICK UP YOUR EARS and THE HIT he had a stinging, perfectly poised sureness. Here, everything--the casting, the inside jokes, the endless narration--feels horribly wrong. The only admirable moment in the whole fiasco comes near the end, when Rob's hyper-sarcastic store clerk (Jack Black) bursts out into an acutely sincere rendition of Marvin Gaye's ""Let's Get It On."" Even the usually deadly charming Cusack feels miscast. The message--get married and get a real job already, you gen-x losers!--and the air of defeated pseudo-comedy may make you want to slink out the back of the theatre."

","I was looking forward to seeing this film, it being populated by some of my favorite actors (the Cusacks, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Tim Robbins, et al) and partially penned by one of my favorite writers (Scott Rosenberg). The problem I (and all the members of my family, including a college-student daughter) had was that Cusack's character elicited absolutely no sympathy. This chain-smoking, self-centered, amoral loser is certainly no one I would wish to get the girl in the end. I like films that bend genre canon as much as the next iconoclast, but this was just too much. I kept waiting for Rob to finally get his comeuppance, but it never happened. As as for the main character, Laura, she is a one-woman ad campaign for Dr. Laura's book on 10 Stupid Things Women Do to mess up their lives. Who can sympathize with a doormat?<br/><br/>HIGH FIDELITY does feature some insightful and subtle humor, but the laughs are few and far between, and the film drags not only in the middle but toward the end as well. Fine supporting performances are turned in my numerous cast members, most notably Jack Black, Joan Cusack, and Lili Taylor. The much-touted soundtrack does have some good tunes, but over all I found it very uneven--certainly no EMPIRE RECORDS in that regard.<br/><br/>I would echo other comments here to the effect that this is not the kind of movie one would take a date to, at least with the intention of fostering romantic ideation. On the other hand, it might be an effective preamble to a lovers' fight, or even a breakup."

His talent for developing a believable character is extraordinary; sometimes I think his characters reflect parts of him.  Then again, parts of his character in High Fidelity could reflect on a lot of people.<br/><br/>Anyway, the character development in High Fidelity is fantastic, the dialogue is realistic and often funny, and the writing is unique and fresh.<br/><br/>But...the whole movie felt like some really bad sex.  Foreplay for an hour and a half, and just when you think there might be a satisfying climax, it doesn't really come, and you leave smoking a bad cigarette. <br/><br/>
I don't like being teased with a plot that doesn't really grow.  Either make a movie with a plot or make a movie without one.  <br/><br/>I know this movie and the characters are more or less realistic, but that doesn't mean I find the general public very interesting, and would want to continue viewing these anecdotes.  Besides, one can only digest so many ""Top 5"" lists from someone who's terribly difficult to care about.  Without a plot, I wouldn't have tried to care about him, and would've enjoyed his character more.<br/><br/>I think the director tried to hit every base in the world with this movie. For many, it does.  For me, Frears tripped over second base gawking at his own talent."

"bandw","6","1","3","18 May 2008"," Three geeks and some pretty women
","Befitting its title, music plays a big part in this movie, both on the soundtrack and in the story which has three thirty-something, vinyl-obsessed geeks running a music store in Chicago. Rob (John Cusack) is the owner of the store and he is assisted by Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black). Barry is loud, opinionated, and arrogant - if you don't agree with him, then you are beneath contempt. Barry would rather insult a customer who asks for an unapproved record than make a sale. Dick is sensitive, shy, scholarly, and his appreciation for pop-music is sincere. Louiso and Black create vividly articulated, delightful characters.<br/><br/>The central plot line has Rob questioning why he has had such bad luck with women and he details his five most significant break-ups. He winds up talking to the camera much of the time. Some may find this intimate and appealing, but it didn't work for me - I would rather have had his neuroses worked out on screen than recited to us. Somewhat early on Rob asks himself the question, ""How does an average guy like me become the number one lover-man in his particular postal district? He's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out with the musical moron twins."" This question is the one I kept asking about Rob throughout the film and not being able to answer it is the reason I had a hard time swallowing the story. The break-ups Rob describes are with some very attractive women, the most recent being with Laura (the very fetching Iben Hjejle). I completely understood why Laura (a successful lawyer) would move on from Rob and I could not see what she saw in him that made her come back. <br/><br/>The music and supporting cast are outstanding and they supply most of the appeal. There are lots of good lines. Consider Barry's reference to the name of his rock group, ""We're no longer called Sonic Death Monkey. We're on the verge of becoming Kathleen Turner Overdrive, but just for tonight, we are Barry Jive and his Uptown Five."" And what a kick it was for me to see that Black can actually sing. But the movie needs to be carried by Cusack and whenever he was on screen I tended to lose interest. <br/><br/>At a macro level this is a cautionary tale about trying to turn one's passions into a business. You are most frequently going to be disappointed by the tastes of your customers and will wind up playing to a small audience and having a hell of a time making a go of it."
"dead47548","10","1","3","27 October 2007"," Flawless.
","It's very rare for me to start a film and within the first ten or fifteen minutes fall completely head over heels in love with it. High Fidelity transcends this rarity. Within mere seconds, my eyes were glued and my jaw was dropped by how incredibly in love with it I became. Everything from the wild performances to the wonderful moral to the flawless soundtrack was absolutely perfect. It's a film about maturing and realizing that nothing is the way you want it to be, so you need to learn how to settle. It also happens to be one of the most enjoyable films of all time.<br/><br/>This modern tale of growing up takes place under the story of a breakup and one man's desperate need to discover why his partners always go right from him to someone else. Over the first thirty or so minutes, Rob Gordon (John Cusack) goes through his all-time, top-five most memorable breakups and we see that each one of them ended because the girl chose someone else over him (except for the one that he broke up with due to her lack of sexual promiscuity; immediately after their split she slept with a guy). The film begins with the newest breakup, Laura (Iben Hjejle) who we soon find out is now bedding Ian (Tim Robbins), more commonly referred to as Ray. This sends him into a reassessment of his own life and he decides to find these other four women and figure out why they chose someone else over him.<br/><br/>In doing this, he discovers that these women weren't what he remembered them to be. They are extremely flawed individuals whom he wouldn't want to take back, even if they wanted him back. This sparks his realization that all of his fantasies of what his dream life should be and how perfect everything is in his mind is never really the truth. He slowly accepts that in the real world he has to settle constantly and nothing can be completely perfect. No matter what, every element of life has it's flaws and every relationship has bumps to get past. He had been putting all of these ex-girlfriends up on a pedestal and it took this revelation in order to bring them down. Due to this realization, he was finally able to move on with his life and actually mature instead of remaining in the constant void of unrequited fantasies he had trapped himself in.<br/><br/>I'm not one for spoiling endings, but I have to say that High Fidelity features one of the most satisfying finales as far as I'm concerned. Rob's newfound maturity and ability to move on with his life, along with a wonderful decision from a certain someone, does nothing but bring an enormous smile to my face. A lot of this enjoyment comes from the satisfaction achieved by one of the most relatable characters in film history. Rob is easily a character that very closely resembles my own self in so many ways. It goes beyond his excellent taste in music and the fact that he builds up fantasies that are far more perfect than any thing could realistically become to the smallest elements of his life like his trivial tendency to make 'Top 5' lists on the most insignificant things. I can find so much in myself that is similar to Rob, so watching him succeed in life almost gives me a sense that I can eventually succeed as well.<br/><br/>Something I've always said when it comes to film is that my favorite elements belong to the story and the characters. High Fidelity excels in both of these categories by an immense proportion. The story is inspirational and highly engaging with deep characters who entrance you and keep you glued to the screen. Rob's riffs to the audience are brilliant and range from being absolutely heart-shattering to side-splitting hilarity. Speaking of hilarity, comic relief has never tasted as sweet as the combination of Dick and Barry, the two employees at the record store Rob owns played impeccably by Todd Louiso and Jack Black respectively. The three of them bounce off one another seamlessly and give a pure sense of authenticity and keep the laughs coming in this wonderful tale. All of the performances are just as strong as the rest of the film, but the highlight is clearly from the anchor John Cusack. He's also been an actor I felt I could relate to and in becoming this character that relatability only increases massively. He hits such a range of emotion and becomes this character so flawlessly that it seems as if Stephen Frears just put a camera on him and told him to say whatever he wants. A perfect performance highlighting a perfect film."

","Okay, I know more about movies than I do relationships, but if the latter are anywhere near as good as cracked up to be, ""High Fidelity"" would be a killer representation of the highs and lows of commitment, love, and tenderness circa the turn of the century. And it is. So there.<br/><br/>This movie could have been a trap so easily. Self-absorbed Gen X losers whine about losing their perfectly toned girlfriends because they can't focus on how good they have it as they lounge on their Ikea sofas wired to their Bang & Olafson stereos smoking unfiltered Camels. Boo-hoo. But the central character rivets you in, sad-eyed and begging for your sympathy. John Cusack shows himself to have evolved into quite a professional actor, moving beyond the pleasing if callow roles of his youth with a performance that makes great use of his expressive eyes and his spot-on phrasing. The way he answers the phone the first time Laura calls his character Rob at Championship Vinyl, with the start, the stop, the door close, the pause for a puff of his cigarette, and then his matter-of-fact hello, without seeming to miss a beat. Very surface, yes, but in a practiced, disarming way that makes you feel left in, not out. He shines like that throughout; never too showy, just there when you notice it.<br/><br/>As he explains his situation to the viewer in a series of personal narrations, he makes matter-of-fact lines breathe with the understatement of a Robert Benchley bon mot. More important, he reels the viewer in with the same sense of emphathetic desperation that Michael Caine employed in the similarly single-callow-guy-confessional-themed ""Alfie."" At times, you even think of Olivier in some of his juicier, more sinister confidences in ""Richard III."" You find yourself not liking Rob much of the time, but even at his lowest (whining about Laura's inevitable resolution with Ian after Rob just sampled the pleasures of Marie DeSalle) his confessonary character pushes such quibbles away.<br/><br/>Cusack is the central performance, and I love Jack Black's star-making second-banana role as well as the many great cameos, from Tim Robbins to Sara Gilbert, but without even looking at all the people who wrote before me, I'm rashly predicting nearly all ignored Iben Hjejle. I don't know how to pronounce that either, except if we were in Copenhagen it would roll off our tongue like Julia Roberts. (The female lead, despite her excellent English, is from Denmark, and apparently went back there after just this one great role. We did manage to get rid of Brigit Neilsen after ""Cobra,"" too, but it still seems like the Danes got the best of the bargain.) Hjejle makes such an impression as Laura. From reading the screenplay, you might think of her as a bitch just given how she leaves poor Rob flat, but no. Instead, because of her careful line readings, the humble shafts of vulnerable humor she uses to (almost absently) puncture his bleak half-catatonia, and that glorious half-moon smile she shoots while simultaneously defensive and sincere, you really root for her and Rob to come together again, and because you do, the whole rest of the picture works. Hjejle puts over a delicate balancing act. Just imagine Shannon Doherty in the role instead. It's what I mean about the film avoiding the callow trap. You care too much about the people involved, and your caring invests the picture with the sort of meaning that elevates it to real art.<br/><br/>Reading the book, one is impressed by how well the screenwriters did by not veering too far from the veddy British Nick Hornby's story. The four screen scribes (including Cusack) take nearly every cue Hornby gives them, starting with the Top Five list of women/girls who dumped the hero, capturing the record store in much of its written form (even with most of the same pop music references, as we've been on much the same page musically with the Mother Country since the Beatles went on Ed Sullivan). There's not much missing from the book, but since the book's such a fine tight read, and Hornby keeps the plot zipping along, that's a good thing. Still, if you enjoyed the movie, you won't be disappointed. The book fleshes out some things and amplifies others.<br/><br/>Finally, the dialogue is so crisp and effective, funnier and snarkier than a season's worth of ""Saturday Night Live,"" and I love SNL. My favorite line this week is Dick describing Marie DeSalle: ""She's a little Sheryl Crowish, crossed with a post-Partridge Family, pre-L.A. Law Susan Dey kind of thing, except, you know, black.""<br/><br/>Where can I find a good Beta Band CD, anyway?"

","Sorry about the lame musical pun in the summary (I swear it wasn't intended... !) but I truly found whilst watching High Fidelity that I connected strongly with the main character of Rob Gordon.  People here have said that they were turned off the movie because Rob is shallow, selfish, melancholic and anal (A bit worrying, since I said I identified with him!) but in my opinion, it's one of the first movies to show men & women as they actually ARE; not some glossy idealised version of how we want them to be. Yes, Rob is all those things, but then so are men (humans, really) in general, and so am I on occasion!<br/><br/>   (SPOILERS)<br/><br/>   Not only do I identify with the main character, I recognise virtually all of the supporting characters as variants of someone I've met.  There isn't a false note sounded in this film (that one WAS intended!)  Particularly good is the scene where Laura asks Rob for sex after her father's funeral. It shows perfectly that sometimes we do things when they are not appropriate, and we can't explain them, but sometimes we just want them.<br/><br/>   The team have done a brilliant job of adapting the novel by Nick Hornby. The film never seems too static that you get bored, but you always have the sense that it was drawn from a literary source.  Changing the setting from London to Chicago alters nothing.  People are people wherever on the earth you find them, geography doesn't matter.  If it's a good enough argument for Nick Hornby, it's good enough for me!<br/><br/>   Cusack is superb as always in the role of the 'protagonist'.  Newcomer (at least to American cinema) Hjejle acquits herself well as the iconclastic Laura and Black & Louiso are also good as Rob's friends/colleagues.  There are also many cameo's; of which Tim Robbins' in particular is hilarious!<br/><br/>  As with ""Grosse Pointe Blank"", another Cusack labour of love, everything here seems put together perfectly.  The cast work well, the direction is top-notch, and the soundtrack is low-key but fantastic.  I urge anybody who has not yet seen this little gem of a film to check it out!  Feel free to e-mail or PM me if you watched based partly on my advice and were disappointed.  Everything about this film resonates for me, from the dialogue to the pathos of it all.

The story is about his character and how he finally realized that fantasies are just that, and happiness depends on one's ability to accept reality and ""commit.""<br/><br/>The movie has a number of famous actors in ""cameo"" roles that are essential to the plot development - Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Bruce Springsteen, are the ones I remember.<br/><br/>Cusack's love interest is played by a foreign actress whose name I can't pronounce. It is interesting that two female ""American"" characters were played by foreign actresses, who did a good job but always sounded like foreign actresses playing Americans, if you know what I mean. Slightly distracting.<br/><br/>The DVD has a number of interesting extras, including good interviews with the director and Cusack. Plus, the deleted scenes add some enjoyment.<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8 of 10, but that is a high 8. It is a good story and Cusack does his usual fine job of playing a quirky character."

"the red duchess","6","1","3","24 July 2000"," Frears' best film in a while. (possible spoilers)
","'High Fidelity' is about fidelity, and not just of the relationship sort. It is about music, about how we use it to express emotions we cannot - the insights of the songs have a high fidelity to the way we feel.  But somehow the medium has obscured the message, and Rob has become more obsessed by the emotions in songs than the real-life emotions they are supposed to reflect. The former without the latter becomes a sterile, self-glorifying thing - music provides the ready-made emotions so we don't have to go through the experiences needed to feel them.  It's a bit like 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' - when Barry sings a horribly slick, muzak 'Let's Get it On' at the climax, the authenticity of the Marvin Gaye original has been seeped out to a series of amusing postures - we have sucked out others' emotions so that they become pods, and we cover versions.<br/><br/>Or, 'Fidelity' is about maturity.  Specifically male maturity.  About the inability of boys to give up the signs of adolescent independence.  Laura says Rob never changes, develops, progresses as a person.  The collecting and classifying of things is a conservative act, a way of building up so much baggage you can't move.  This is not necessarily unadmirable.  The real world isn't very nice.  The world of music and lists is a nurturing womb far more reassuring than real mother 'love'; it doesn't tell you you're a failure.  Liking independent records is a mark of independence; running an independent store, and not some megastore, is a refusal to play the corporate game.  Rob can only sustain this fantasy, of course, by scabbing off his girlfriend.  Independence is a myth.<br/><br/>So it is with independence in movies.  'Fidelity' might like to see itself as an opposition to generic Hollywood fare - its dish of intelligence, verbosity, character and sense of locale an alternative to the fast food of blockbusters, dumb thrills, idiotic dialogue, stereotypes and flashy visuals.  And 'Fidelity' does kind of ramble instead of offering a conventional three-act-structure.  It mocks (rather misogynistically?) starlets for their powerful vacuity.  It disrupts its boy-girl conflict/resolution with a very adult and unusual doubt and lack of closure. The final ambiguous scene suggest that Rob has finally matured, but also suggests that he is trying to subsume maturity into his unchanging way of life, a project which can only fail.<br/><br/>The brilliant thing about this film is that it all takes place in Rob's head.  Although he doesn't actually seem to like music all that much, the music in the soundtrack, rather archly, comments on his state of mind. Characters and events subtly change or are reinterpreted the more insights he develops.  The mixture of to-camera narration and drama has been done before, but usually the boundaries are drawn - here the mixture of commentary and action within the one narrative means that one always undermines the other, and we we can clearly see the holes in Rob's solipsistic house of cards.  It is easy to forget, such is his verbal facility and winning charm, how many truly ghastly characters John Cusack plays (in this duality he is very much like James Woods), and Rob here is a monster, a raving egotist, who appropriates everything to his own self-image, including the weather (all that pneumonia-free rain).<br/><br/>This is a hugely enjoyable film, full of great insights, comic set-pieces and moments of recognition that made me squirm.  Stephen Frears more usually deals with combinations of people than with one overpowering individual and Rob's monomania soon becomes wearing; the best scenes are those featuring Jack Black, as everyone's been saying.  Frears always excels at a sense of place, especially interiors, a place where people actually live and are defined, and this film is no exception, the bureaucratic stacks of plastic ultimately exposing and overpowering Rob's emotional emptiness.<br/><br/>But 'Fidelity' is, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, as irritating as it is entertaining.  I love John Cusack, and he is superb, unafraid to be dislikeable; but too many of his films are the same, so that there is a mini-genre, the John Cusack film.  I just wish he's try to be a little more adventurous."

","Perhaps the ultimate romantic comedy for nerds of any kind. The film features whip-smart, often outrageously funny dialog, fantastic performances - especially by John Cusack - and it serves as a loving homage to nerd culture as well as a clever comment on male life and the male perspective on relationships with women. It's beautifully directed, and there is simply not a single line wasted in the film; it's one of those movies that are instantly destined for cult status, because it seems to resonate with anyone who is deeply immersed in - and passionate about - pop culture (in other words: nerds like me ;-).

","In one of the last classicly '90s films, High Fidelity, John Cusack stars as a classicly '90s hero: he's single in his thirties, doesn't know why, and wants more than anything to be in a relationship. Nowadays, that type of man doesn't really exist anymore; he got married in 2000.<br/><br/>As John reflects on his past relationships, he talks to the audience and exposes them to his work and friends. He works at a record shop, and music is a huge part of his life, so if you can't really identify with him in his romantic troubles or his love of music, you will probably find the movie irritating and boring. As it is, I'm a '90s kid, but a little on the younger side, and I think I might have missed the core demographic of this movie by a few years. I'm not entranced by vinyl, and I tended to see the main character's shortcomings rather than his qualities.<br/><br/>While nostalgia is a good reason to pick up this movie, you might also want to watch it for the supporting cast. Jack Black, Catherin Zeta-Jones, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Lisa Bonet, Lili Taylor, Natasha Wagner, and Iben Hjejle all contribute to this colorful film in their own way. I didn't end up liking High Fidelity, but I don't usually like dark comedies or quirky romances."
"SimonJack","2","0","3","26 January 2017"," Listless, pointless, and not entertaining
","""High Fidelity"" may have some comedy, but in its raucous setting and turmoil, that gets lost. The fidelity here applies to faithfulness in relationships as well as the quality of music. The plot of Rob Gordon's five worst breakups (John Cussack) left me flat. Nor do I find much entertainment in these films in which the star or someone else talks to the camera between bits. It seems an easy and cheap way for writers to switch gears without having to challenge their brains for clever writing and creativity.<br/><br/>I suppose some of a young generation who would know some of the music in this film might enjoy it. But, I have no proclivity toward the music. I watched this movie because I wanted to see how John Cussack's comedy was around 2000. This is quite empty. Jack Black is way overboard with his Barry Judd character. But, he's often overboard. Here he's just too loud and crass. <br/><br/>The film rightly has an R rating. I can enjoy or appreciate R films if they have character and substance. But this film has neither. So, its profanity, cavalier portrayal of sex and abortion, and listless lives aren't entertaining. Even though a large number of viewers have rated this film, I suspect its appeal has been to a specific group of people. I don't think it will resonate with much of the population 20 or 30 years later, or beyond.<br/><br/>The best humor is in the ironic title. Rob's character has been of such low or no fidelity in the past. Now he's jealous and hurt, so the tables turn."
"Wuchakk","5","0","3","26 November 2016"," Romantic head games become tedious
","Released in 2000 and directed by Stephen Frears, ""High Fidelity"" is a romcom/dramedy starring John Cusack, as Rob, the owner of a Chicago record store, co-starring Jack Black and Todd Louiso as his two employees, Barry and Dick. When Rob's relationship with his live-in girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle) falls apart, he reflects on the five worst break-ups of his dozen years of dating. His past girlfriends are played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joelle Carter, Lili Taylor and Natasha Gregson Wagner. Tim Robbins appears as Rob's rival for Laura's affections while Joan Cusack is on hand as Laura's sister. Lisa Bonet plays a rocker chick, a passing fancy for Rob. Sara Gilbert has a bit part.<br/><br/>What's interesting about ""High Fidelity"" is that it features the five general prototypes of guys' dating life: (1.) the first crush & kiss, (2.) adolescent urgency & loss of virginity, (3.) the hot babe out of his league, (4.) the rebound best friend & soul mate, and (5.) his one true love (maybe).<br/><br/>If you've ever made a compilation tape for a babe and worked at a record store you might appreciate this film. You'll particularly like it if you favor romantic head games, which I find irritating and is the main reason I have mixed feelings about the film (speaking as a one-woman type of guy). Because of this, I had a hard time staying with it, although there's enough good in the movie to make it somewhat worthwhile. It's witty and you can tell the creators put a lot of thought into it, but Rob's mopey reflections as he constantly speaks to the camera get tedious after a while. Don't get me wrong, John pulls off the challenging lead role and does so convincingly; I just found his perpetually-smoking character uninteresting. As far as the soundtrack goes, the 90's pop rock struck me as mostly bland.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there are several amusing moments. For instance, the scene where someone confronts Rob at the record store in the second half is laugh-out-loud funny, but Rob's relationship with Laura is decidedly Uninteresting; and Laura's emotional instability and indecisiveness become increasingly annoying (anyone who would marry such a relationally fickle person would have to be insane). Actually, most of Rob's romantic relationships become annoying although, like I said, there are amusing bits. Then there's Barry who arrogantly thinks his opinion on music is law; I kept hoping he'd get his teeth knocked in. On a positive note, the mental manipulations of Rob's unstable romantic life are offset by Dick, who shows the way to go.<br/><br/>""Empire Records"" (1995) is the better movie simply because it doesn't go overboard with the dating/romance head games crap.<br/><br/>The film runs 113 minutes and was shot in Chicago.<br/><br/>GRADE: C"

","Now this one was a tough call. Everyone knows how much I love movies with LOVE and HEARTBREAK, but this sort of took me by surprise, and NOT really in a good way. <br/><br/>I watched this film first when I was nine, when my dad took me to see it. I probably didn't understand a word and was confused why the main character is hurt so much by a girl.. // What I do remember pondering was how Jack Black was the BEST! and how much I felt bad for the character, Dick (Todd Louiso), who takes so much shyt from him. Viewing it now, as a film student and somewhat a critic, I think he is the best part of the movie. No Joke! We all have those people in our life that make us feel a little awkward and just ask too many god-damn questions. I think he changes the most throughout the film, too. In fact, our main protagonist, Rob (played by John Cusack), does not change at all. That is why I am not being too reviewer-friendly with this entry.<br/><br/>The thing is: I am a realist (sort of). I like movies to speak to me; give me some answers to the things that I should already know that I have not fully grasped yet. That, and the fact that I want to relate with something. But this story let me down towards the end. - I swear, that rarely happens.<br/><br/>****Seriously, though! It is a universal understanding that ""once a cheater, always a cheater"", and I do not take it lightly when someone ends up with the wrong person in the end. I wish it finished more truthfully; BETTER CLOSURE FOR THE BROKEN HEARTED. Not the old 90s ending where everything is okay, because it is not. Especially, for the viewer who, chances are, is alone and wonders why they cannot connect with anyone. <br/><br/>I can go on forever, ranting about how I was let down in the climax of this film, but I do not want to bore you - and frankly, I do not want to write negatively about any project. **Maybe in ten more years, when I am a completely different person than I am now, I might enjoy the corniness, but as of right now - Too cliché (ONLY IN THE END, THOUGH).<br/><br/>I rate this film a 6 out of 10. It honestly hurts me to do this, because I WANTED to like it. Really, I did! I WANTED it to be good, and a ahead of its time.

The film takes a somewhat sardonic view of hipsterdom, but it's obvious, especially with hindsight, that Rob and his friends are onto something, and their love of music seems so much less pretentious than their highbrow counterparts (a particular chicago music publication comes to mind).

I think that there could've been a better fit for that role, but with that said, she did fine. Other than Hjejle, there was an all star supporting cast in this movie: Jack Black, Joan Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Tim Robbins to name a few!

As is typical in most relationships there are 2 sides to every story-Rob has a few surprises thrust upon him along the way. The audience has a few surprises about Rob served up to them as well. I think Hornby did a great job creating a truly 3-dimensional character; one that has faults but is still appealing. Cusack did a great job showing all sides of Rob.<br/><br/>The record store, ""Championship Vinyl"", supplies us with 2 lovable misfits (Barry-Black and Dick) who were hired for part- time but never seem to leave. All three play off each other well creating a chemistry that guarantees laughs. The ""Top 5"" theme carries on into the shop in a few different ways. My favorite example of this is when they pose a question such as name the ""Top 5 songs about death"" and then the three of them will try to beat each other to death with their musical snobbery ... which they do to their customers on a daily basis! Music is present throughout the entire film. It is so essential to the plot that one could make the case that music is the glue that holds this film together or even better it's the gas in which it runs on for those 113 minutes.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an absolutely excellent film which I highly recommend! It is still, after all of these years, one of my favorites.

It's no exaggeration to say I had to sometimes endure ten hours of non stop Radiohead . Very occasionally by accident rather than design he'd play a track I might like such as Dirt by Death In Vegas . One day he played a track by an act I'd vaguely heard of called The Beta Band . I instantly stopped working as a track was played utterly and helplessly hypnotized by the beauty of the song . The song was Dry The Rain and became the soundtrack of what was an up and down job I had but mainly ups and every time I listen to Dry The Rain I'm reminded of very happy memories mainly of Alan's girlfriend Maria who I'd sometimes share a smile with , or a cigarette or if I was really lucky an existentialist conversation on the meaning of life<br/><br/>That's the problem adapting a book like Nick Hornby's HIGH FIDELITY . We're asked to empathise not only with a character on screen but also to remember our own life experience . You can read about it on the printed page and picture yourself in the protagonists place and that's the whole point . We are the surrogate protagonist . It's very difficult to do with on screen visual images that are patently not us especially when they look like John Cusack and speak with an American accent<br/><br/>HIGH FIDELITY possibly isn't a novel that's unfilmable but having the character of Rob Gordon constantly break down the figurative fourth wall and address the audience is a risky venture . You'll probably quickly come to the conclusion that you'll love this or hate this and I afraid I didn't love this concept at all . Changing the setting from Britain to America doesn't do the story any favours since you're constantly distracted as to how Americans at the turn of the century are aware of obscure bands like Belle and Sebastian or perhaps even The Smiths . Director Stephen Frears is a Brit and it shows a little too much as he's under the impression that American record buyers of 2000 are the Anglophile music lovers of the 1980s which they certainly were not when this film was released or even when the original source novel was written . Ironically the film might have worked better with a director who was younger and American <br/><br/>That said it was very nice hearing the criminally underrated The Beta Band get a name check and a snippet of Dry The Rain and if nothing else this makes the film worth watching . Of course even this dubious value is undermined by Rob referring to them as "" The bet-ah band "" which just goes to show even if an American knows their music they haven't a clue about the English language and one wonders how this atrocity of pronunciation slipped by the British director ?"

It is also nice to know when it comes to the things I am a good at (music, movies, Top 5 lists, sucking at relationships) I am not alone. High Fidelity is a funny and delightful telling of the relationship problems of Rob Gordon (Cusack), a struggling record store owner, as he recounts where he went wrong in life with the women he has loved. Gordon breaks the fourth wall of the camera to confide in us where he has gone wrong. It is also a funny telling of the insight of men and their thought processes when it comes to life and relationships.<br/><br/>The cast is what makes the humor and heart of this film. Todd Louiso and Jack Black play Rob's music snob (somewhat loser) employees. Rob: ""I can't fire them. I hired these guys for three days a week and they just started showing up every day.

Those thoughts mainly have to do with his failed relationships. And there have been many.<br/><br/>He's hilarious and totally obsessive. When his ex-girlfriend Laurie (Iben Hjele) tells him that she hasn't slept with his old upstairs neighbor and her new boyfriend Ian (Tim Robbins) yet, it drives him crazy. In the record store, he asks one of the guys who works for him, Barry (Black), ""If I told you I hadn't seen The Evil Dead yet, would you think I was going to?"" An argument ensues. ""But you have seen it,"" Barry says. ""I'm confused - why would you ask me if you were going to see a movie you've already seen twice?"" The scenes that take place in the record store between Rob, Barry, and Dick (Barry and Dick are part-timers who show up every day) and their top five lists are priceless.<br/><br/>Eventually Rob's focus on his ex-girlfriends and his stalking of Laura and her new boyfriend Ian evolves into questions about his life and his level of commitment, not just to women, but to life itself.<br/><br/>There's nothing new about men who fantasize about ideal relationships while they're in a real one, nothing new about men who can't make a commitment, but there's something so fresh about High Fidelity - the interesting characters, the music, and the wonderful acting.<br/><br/>Jack Black nearly walks away with the film. He has some of the best dialogue, too, and I will only say, wait until the end of the movie. Though Todd Louiso has a less showier role, he's no less funny, and he's created a music nerdy type character, quiet but no less passionate.<br/><br/>John Cusack is adorable as an exhausted, frustrated suitor, and it's understandable that Rob has attracted so many attractive women. Holding onto one is his problem. Iben Hjele as Laura, his last girlfriend, had something about her that reminded me of Scarlett Johansson, her mannerisms perhaps, but she was charming and did an excellent job.

Looking back, what would you think?<br/><br/>Rob Gordon (played by John Cusack) is a lifelong Chicago resident and owner of his own record store. The store, Championship Vinyl, attracts very few window shoppers and almost as few intentional customers. The staff consists of Rob, Barry (played by Jack Black), and Dick (played by Todd Louiso). Originally hired to work two days a week, Barry (Black) and Dick (Louiso) decided instead to show up every day. Their personalities are complete mirror images of each other, Barry being loud and opinionated (one of many reasons that Jack Black was perfect for the role) and Dick being soft-spoken and deferential. What they and Rob have in common with each other is an almost encyclopedic knowledge of music and a superior attitude as a result. When we join the story, Rob is being dumped by his live-in girlfriend, Laura. Laura (played by Danish actress Iben Hjejle) has chosen to leave in the evening and Rob, vehemently opposed to the idea, elects to shout out the window as Laura drives away. Rob then proceeds to list the five most devastating breakups in his romantic past, purposely excluding Laura from the list. Noticing that all those relationships ended at the urging of the other party, Rob decides that he is doomed to be rejected. He reaches out to his first girlfriend, a girl he kissed for two hours a day for three days before finding her kissing someone else on the fourth day. While he fails to find his middle school love, her sister informs him that the boy Rob saw her kissing on the first day is now her husband and that they live in Australia. In fact, the woman he speaks to is under the impression that her sister's husband was actually her first boyfriend. Rob tries to disabuse her of this notion but the sister, believing him to be delusional, hangs up. Rob, now believing that his circumstances are the result of fate and not any sort of failure on his part, plans to reach out to his other former partners. Penny Hardwick (played by Joelle Carter) who would not allow the intimacy between them to progress past kissing, Charlie Nicholson (played by Catherine Zeta- Jones) who rejected him and began a relationship with a coworker, and Sarah Kendrew (played by Lily Taylor) who found the ideal relationship with each other, both having been rejected and fearing they would never find their true soul mate. Sarah found someone else while still with Rob and ended things with absolutely no warning. <br/><br/>This is one of those rare comedies that displays truly inspiring performances. Jack Black is, well Jack Black, but he is a valuable addition to the cast and the story. Cusack as Rob plays a character that we lose sympathy for on more than one occasion but ultimately find ourselves rooting for. And, as is typically the case with movies that feature multiple music aficionados as characters, the soundtrack is incredible. Thirteen years have passed since the release of this film and I enjoy it just as much if not more than I did when it was first released. THAT is the mark of true greatness."
"HanPolo","8","0","2","20 March 2013"," Relationships + Music + TopFive Lists + The 90s = My #1 Favorite Movie of All Time
","The fact that this is my favorite movie (at least since 2007) and I still gave it a 8 out of 10 speaks mainly to my acknowledgment that the movie lacks some critical elements that make a ""Classic Movie."" However, for the sheer scope and ubiquity of the subject matter tackled in High Fidelity, I rank it #1 in my All-time favorite movies category.<br/><br/>First off, it approaches relationships from the perspective of any emotionally confused, disenfranchised, 20something male, making it a rare gem for that viewing demographic. The opening sequence launches directly into this motif, as Rob's girlfriend (Laura) is packing her things to leave as he primes us for the main theme of the movie: tracing his relationships with women to the present day in an attempt to uncover a solution to his broken love life. His revelations throughout the narrative reflect the selfishness inherent in his age, and by the time he comes to an emotional nirvana at the end, you almost want him to suffer a lonely life (but not in a sequel). Alas, this story is happier than reality would allow him to be.<br/><br/>The musical flavor of the narrative is central in the same way that the computer theme was central in the Tron movies. Music saturates this movie. Rob (John Cusack) is a music lover running a record store in the heart of Chicago, which gave us modern Jazz and House. Although technically a 90s genre film, the script (which comes from the eponymous British novel) references music from all eras of musicology, and one scene in particular, in which Rob and his store crew (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) are referred to as ""music snobs,"" resonates beyond the film's own yearbook to a future that includes the ""indie kid"" and ""hipster"" generation.<br/><br/>Finally, two aspects of this movie appealed to me in particular, and launched the movie into my #1 spot: the art of the Top Five list and the cult of the 90s. I love Top Five lists, and if you ever have a hard time small-talking someone, just ask them to name their Top Five of anything. Most people will say they like too much stuff to rank any of it, but that's malarkey because once you say your Top Five they'll argue with at least one of your choices, meaning they do have the capacity for ranking things. This movie starts with a Top Five list, which is basically how Rob outlines the order in which he will investigate his previous love interests: the Top Five Worst Breakups in His Life. As for the importance of the 90s setting, let me just clarify by saying that the 1990s are in my Top Five favorite decades list. Musically, it may be #1.<br/><br/>The shortcomings that dropped it a couple of spots (I never give movies a 10) are nitpicky, but evident enough to limit the movie's rewatchability. One such shortcoming is the seemingly free-wheeling script given to Jack Black. Some of the things he says and does appear, well, too Jack Blackish for the movie I want to watch, and he wears thin early on as an obnoxious, abrasive, and fatuous character who wouldn't have many friends in real life (not that he does in the movie...). Katherine Zeta's lines are similarly contrived, as are a few other roles. Another pitfall is the pointless plot detour at the end of the movie when Rob is deciding about his long-term life with Laura and encounters an informed local music journalist. Sparks fly, and just as we think the movie could get 20 minutes longer, it doesn't.<br/><br/>Although there are enough problems with this movie to bring it down a notch or two, it does include my favorite movie elements all in one feature presentation: it's funny, it approaches love from the guy's perspective, it's musically themed, it includes Top Five lists, it's set in the 90s, and it takes place somewhere other than New York or California.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing (and owning) this movie if you like at least two of those elements."

","When watching ""High Fidelity"" at first it is hard to become interested in such a cynical film about love. From the very opening scene one can sense this overlying doom and depression that will take place through the entire films. John Cusack's character Rob is very harsh in his demeanor and his very first lines tend to stick with you through the rest of the film. ""Music or the misery, which came first?"" and ""did I listen to pop music because I was miserable or am I miserable because I listened to pop music."" This is a very alarming statement, many of us tend to find comfort in music which allows for a sense of self soothing. Although at first it was hard to become interested in this movie, afterwords I found it relatable to my life. Many of us have experienced the heartache that Rob is feeling after his break up with his current girlfriend Laura which is why many of us can connect with Rob.<br/><br/>The movie is all about Rob reviewing the five women that have broken his heart throughout his whole life. We then go on this self loathing experience of ""always me"" mentality that leads us to learn more about this character and his obsession with making ""Top 5 Lists"" that are ongoing over the course of the film. Rob blames all of these women for ripping his heart out and stomping on it, when in high school its actually Rob who broke penny's heart. In what one can assume is chemistry class, Rob's lab partner tells him that he had sex with Penny after three days. An explosion happens as a result of the chemical reactants which conveys the anger and frustration and the mixed emotions Rob is feeling inside. After Rob's break up with Laura he decides to go on a journey to talk to his old girlfriends and find out what he did wrong to end their relationship. When he is talking to penny at dinner, Penny tells Rob she was crazy about him, but Rob dumped her; she was tired and emotionally drained when Rob's friend asked her out, she said yes. Later Penny tells Rob that the chemistry partner didn't rape her since she said yes but it wasn't far off from rape. He then compares his breakup with Charlie to how ""some people never got over 'Nam"" in the fact that after the break up he was scared for life and never really wanted to date again. He had a traumatic experience that sticks with him and changes his views and ideas on the world. Throughout his relationship with Charlie, Rob is very hard on himself and doesn't think he is good enough to be with a girl like her, which many of us can relate in our dating experiences. We all have our ideal dream girl or guy and once we end up with a person who meets all of our need we don't think we are equal enough to be with them which causes us to doubt our every move we make.<br/><br/>Which brings us to his current situation working at his record store, Championship Vinyl. His record store is a symbol of how he is stuck in a rut and has been for so long and how he doesn't really want to change. The record store just displays further gloom that is overcasting Rob's life, which is ironic because the shop is vibrant inside. At his used record store two eccentric employees spend their time making up Top Five lists and poking fun of the occasional customers that the store draws. Two shoplifting teens are the burden of their existence, we later find out that the teens just want to make music and end up making a mix tape and leaving it at the store. Cusack's character becomes inspired by their song and welcomes a turning point in the film when he gives the teens a record label and starts to promote their band at a night club. After the major turning point in the movie store is getting busier, the workers are no longer making a mockery of the customers playing more audience appropriate music also.<br/><br/>Cusack's direct address to the camera and his self-reflective narration of his failed relationships tends to become boring and allows for a loss of interest in the film until the major turning point in the record store. Although it seems like even when everything is going his way ( him and Laura got back together, he has a record label, is making a return as a DJ... etc) and he still seems unhappy with his life, and makes the viewer wonder if he will truly ever be satisfied."
"ems97","10","0","1","8 April 2012"," For All Reflective Men
","This movie portrays a man who hyper-displays many stereotypical male characteristics: collecting and categorizing, aggression, inability to take corrections. This man talks to the camera, defending his behavior. To the audience, though, it is clear that his actions are totally silly. I think the point of the movie is to make men like myself think about whether we sometimes have some of the traits portrayed by the main character. For me, one of the things that struck a chord: getting super- excited after it now appears that there is the remotest possibility a relationship, any relationship, going forward (in the movie, ""We Are the Champions"" plays in the soundtrack here). Also, being more concerned about whether we share interests with a potential partner than whether we are interested in her. So I have a lot to reflect over after watching the movie. I'm sure other scenes will lead other male viewers to reflect on their personal lives."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","0","1","19 January 2012"," Confessions of a Self-Obsessed Connoisseur
","John Cusack routinely breaks the fourth wall in this portrayal of a sad sack record store owner going through a flustering mid-life crisis. Eccentric and clever at times, he's also a bit of a selfish, standoffish prick and that duality, combined with a stern lack of motivation to do something with himself, has long wreaked havoc with his love life. Very funny at moments and stretched thin at others, it's a wordy dissection of Generation X's slow, sad loss of touch with their adolescence and the lies we tell ourselves and our loved ones. Though angled and multi-dimensional, Cusack's character never turns the corner into someone worth rooting for, so his chase after a nearly-lost girlfriend lacks teeth. Good for some bright laughs, it lacks much depth beyond the satisfying validation of identifying a few cherished LPs from your own collection in the background."
"dylan-grieve","9","0","1","30 May 2011"," Where do I start?
","Maybe I should just make a bullet list of all the reasons why this is a great film, but will attempt to do it in paragraph form. John Cusack plays a somewhat neurotic mid-thirties record store owner. He is almost past his prime, and having just been left by his girlfriend, begins to panic, inspiring a sort of cathartic, self-absorbed, grandiose pondering of the opposite sex, and begins framing his life by what he perceives as his failures with women.<br/><br/>This movie is amazing in terms of dialogue; so good I could probably listen to it as an audio file. If you are a fan of movies such as Chasing Amy or Alfie, then you will likely appreciate the way this film explores the desires and insecurities of the male psyche. This movie seemed geared somewhat more towards a male audience, but never felt chauvinistic. John Cusack's acting had me feeling extremely empathetic, even as I laughed at the sheer pathetic nature of his plights.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie felt very human, and very real. His speech at the end carried a wholesome message, and seemed like one of the best things any guy could say to a girl to set her mind at ease. So ladies, check this film out."
"oneguyrambling","9","0","1","25 April 2011"," I am mostly Rob, part Barry. High Fidelity is all good.
","Rob runs a record store, as in vinyl not CDs. He has two staff, one a mopey withdrawn emo-type named Dick who would like it if you agreed with him but y'know, no pressure. The other a brusque and loud 100% music snob Barry (Jack Black) who knows better than everyone else, including customers. Especially customers.<br/><br/>Rob is in between, he loves his music but seems to respect everyone else's right to like what they like even if he doesn't agree. He seems a low key music snob. Rob's business remains afloat only through the continued business of similar music snobs of varied levels who go out of their way to shop there.<br/><br/>The trio often share mixtapes and make impromptu music related lists with such titles as ""Best Side 1, Track 1s"" or I would guess ""Best revenge songs"".<br/><br/>This is not what the film is about. This is merely a description of Rob and his two staff and the goings on in his record shop called Championship Vinyl.<br/><br/>This is actually the part of the film I like best because it is the bit I identify with most.<br/><br/>In my 20s I was the loud and obnoxious music (and movie) snob. I knew better than you (still do) and was more than happy to prove it. Mixtapes were my specialty, and if we were going for a drive of more than 15 minutes I would make sure that I had a tape or CD of my own, as I could not stomach listening to the radio or someone else's crappy music that was invariably nowhere near as good as mine.<br/><br/>Now in my 30s I am probably more like Rob. I still think I know better, can still prove it on demand (my last ""mixtape"" – now Mix-CD was done a couple months ago), but I am happy to let others like what they like, admittedly behind a visage of well concealed disgust. I don't think I have it in me to be the withdrawn ""each to their own"" guy.<br/><br/>And don't think that the correlation between me and the guys in this movie hasn't been pointed out before, many, many times.<br/><br/>+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ That's only the backdrop though. High Fidelity is actually about Rob (who I need to mention somewhere is played by John Cusack so there you go), and his relationship with Laura.<br/><br/>Near the start of the film Laura dumps Rob unceremoniously, and due to the long term and intertwined nature of their relationship they remain in reasonable proximity.<br/><br/>Close enough to give each other the shits and allows themselves to get wound up over nothing. Laura moves on, Rob stays and mopes, using music as his coping mechanism. He starts by reorganising his vast personal collection in different orders (personal CHECK!), not alphabetically or oldest to newest, but in order of purchase. He then lists the best breakup songs followed by his own personal Top 5 breakups from his past.<br/><br/>Rob ultimately decides he must revisit these Top 5 breakup women personally to gain some form of closure. What results is a Schneider-lite version of the various wacky things that must ensue in film when you have a montage of different people, only without the obscure and pointless disorders that Schneider films (and Seinfeld episodes) demanded.<br/><br/>Some meetings go well, others not so much.<br/><br/>Later on Rob breaks the ice and hooks up with a local 27kg singer-songwriter played by Lisa Bonet, while Laura has moved in with her new man who not so conveniently lives in the floor above Rob's apartment. The best part being that the new lothario is played by an over-the-top Tim Robbins at his greasiest and most faux-sincere.<br/><br/>Things get complicated as they must when Laura's situation changes once more only in more dramatic circumstances than a mere break up.<br/><br/>+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ <br/><br/>High Fidelity justifies its existence through the inclusion of much guy banter with a keen eye on the role music plays as (guys) mature and move through life.<br/><br/>If you are a guy and have no idea what that sentence above means, then this is merely a rom-com for you. Stay away.<br/><br/>+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ <br/><br/>John Cusack is John Cusack, reliable, sensible and convincing. Like an old warm jumper you know what you're gonna get, and you like it.<br/><br/>Jack Black steals the show in a role that he played before he morphed into ""Funnyman Jack Black"". (If I ever had the good fortune to run my own music shop I would go broke in 10 minutes as I would refuse to sell mainstream crap and would forever be pushing obscure CDs that no-one else would want to listen to but me. That is why JB's Barry is an employee, he would similarly fail if running the show.) Tim Robbins is hilarious in his bit part and Iben Hjelje is convincing in the confused and undecided Laura, especially when things turn and she momentarily loses her way.<br/><br/>And Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas is actually vaguely likable and dare I say it attractive for a nanosecond despite being one of the more loathsome creatures on the planet.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is a movie for music-snobs or people that at least partially identify with the obsessive nature of collectors or ""fan-dom"". I think if you are a go with the flow sort of person not much of this will ring true and you'll be left with a run of the mill rom-com.<br/><br/>I like High Fidelity, but I no longer identify with it quite as much as I did 10 years ago.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. A solid film that will mean more to those that lived the life of Rob, Barry or even Dick."

","This is a great movie, but I recommend reading the book first. The filmmakers adapted it with a sense of creativity and respect for the original text, and the casting could not be more perfect. John Cusack is immensely appealing even at his most hapless, and every moment Jack Black is on screen is hilarious. Part of the fun of both the book is getting inside Rob's head and hearing his thoughts, which gave me a delightful mix of amusement that someone could be so clueless and relief that I'm not the only one who feels the way he does. The book deftly works the first-person narration of the novel by having Rob address the camera, ala Alvy Singer in Annie Hall, but naturally some of Rob's sharp observations had to be cut. Since I watched the movie the same day I finished the book, the words were fresh in my memory, so I felt like I knew what he was thinking even when he it would have disturbed the flow of the movie to have him actually say it Unless you're the type who can't enjoy a film adaptation if it veers even an inch from the book, read the book first. It has even more insights into the pain of relationships, and is darker and more cynical than this charming film. After reading it, however, I could still enjoy the film for its delightful performances and the clever changes that turned it from a British novel to an American film."
"Vomitron_G","9","0","1","3 February 2010"," An unmatched romantic comedy in my book
","I watched it for the third time and it's still one of my favorite comedies ever. Intelligent and witty. A romantic comedy about relationships in a city. A touch of sadness, some genuine laughs and a lot of struggles. Well, actually, a film about girls, music and vinyl records. And more.<br/><br/>What I like most about ""High Fidelity"", is the way it stands out amongst other romantic comedies. Most of these are either aimed at teenagers or for adults. Those teen romance comedies often tend to follow a clichéd, formulaic path heading for a happy ending. Those about adult relationships, often add a bit of drama & violins at proper times, to which you can set a timer. Not too keen about that either.<br/><br/>But the ways of ""High Fidelity"" are much more original and both younger (those entering their first relationship) & older audiences (those who've had a few) should be able to relate to certain aspects. It's also not telling that good old story of ""boy meets girl"", but when the film begins, we're already stepping into a relationship with a lot of issues. It's pretty unpredictable, has a unique & clever way of telling the story (John Cusack often rambling on straight into the camera, flash-backs, flash-forwards), incorporates lots of cool stuff for music-lovers and above all, it's realistic, recognisable and pretty damn funny too. <br/><br/>On a technical level (directing, acting, cinematography, editing, sound, etc), it's simply perfect. Films of this ilk, don't come much better than this."

I've listened to lots of bands to my life so I know most of the music they were discussing in there. Setting in Chicago, I've been to most of the locations shot in the movie. It reminds me a lot of the movie ""Reality Bites"". About relationships, music, friends... that most people can relate to.<br/><br/>I also found many characters to be memorable.

Whether its Titanic, The Notebook or As Good as it Gets, it just doesn't make me feel right to watch one of these movies all alone.

","There's always been an inexplicable connection between music, love and the movies. Certain songs always seem to set the tone for various kinds of love and romance in film, whether the light-hearted or the dramatic. ""High Fidelity"" not only uses the power of that emotional mixture, but also focuses on it and attempts to understand it. <br/><br/>""High Fidelity"" is the story of Rob (Cusack), a vinyl store owner, and his understanding of his most recent break up with Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) through analyzing his ""Top 5 worst break-ups."" Rob's affinity for music and being a self-proclaimed ""professional appreciator"" of music clearly influences his understanding of love and his quest for some kind of greater fulfillment.<br/><br/>Written by a team of writers -- including Cusack himself -- and based on a novel by Nick Hornby, ""Fidelity"" takes on a first-person narrative structure, with most of the story being Rob talking directly into the camera. Normally narration is voiced over or kept distant from the action of a film, but this choice for ""Fidelity"" creates an intimate relationship between Rob and the audience. Part of this success is how natural Cusack takes to the part. You believe he's treated you as a close friend the entire time -- there's no lack of sincerity whatsoever. In general, it's a technique that works phenomenally for this movie because it's all about trying to make sense of love and seeing how music influences that interpretation. <br/><br/>There are many people out there who strongly identify their emotions with music and those people will absolutely love this film. It is candid, witty, mature and it's dead-on when it comes to identifying with music appreciators. Not a lot of films really connect to audiences on this level. There's no glorifying of romance when all is said and done -- it's not overdone Hollywood style -- it's just honest and doesn't claim to know any more about love than any of its viewers. An admirable and heart-warming depiction of how music and love simultaneously weave through our lives."

","*High Fidelity SPOILERS* <br/><br/>Rob Gordon (John Cusack) has just been left by his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle), who's just moved out and, it seems, in with Rob's martial-arts practitioner, world-music listener upstairs neighbor Ian Raymond (Tim Robbins).<br/><br/>This brings him to ponder about what he's accomplished this far in his life, which isn't much; he opened a record store called 'Championship Vinyl' which, to borrow a Martin Balsam line from Psycho, looks like it was intentionally hidden, and has two 'employees' (they wondered in one day and he decided to keep them); the meek and quiet Dick (Todd Louiso) and the boorish, arrogant and just plain obnoxious Barry (Jack Black) who's such a snob he drives a client off just because he asked for a vinyl of 'I Just Called To Say I Love You', and and basically thinks he's better than anyone else, and... well, not much else.<br/><br/>So, he decides to make a Top 5 of the five girls who broke his heart the hardest and see them again, to understand why he's always been dumped, and in the search he'll find himself and a new direction...<br/><br/>Very cleverly, this comedy offered a quite realistic view of a man's outlook on life and relationships, all the while remaining genuinely funny and faithful to the original awesome novel (even with the London/Chicago switch), which took a team of talented writers, among whom main star Cusack. The director is very good and so are the actors - even though I wanted to kick Jack Black's character in the teeth right after he made his obnoxious entrance, and kept on wanting to for the whole film.<br/><br/>And of course the music; and to complete the package, a cameo from the Boss Bruce Springsteen, giving Rob some advice.<br/><br/>Don't miss this! <br/><br/>High Fidelity: 9/10."

","Some people have trouble understanding what this movie is really about, it is not about the music, it is about relationships. It is truly one of the great love stories of our time. There are some very important lessons that people could learn from it to improve their own relationships. The music is integral but not what this movie is about. The most important lesson to learn about having a good relationship is commitment! Watch it without interruptions and with someone you care about, and buy the CD as the music is great. As romantic comedies go this movie sets the bar very high indeed. It's not for people who never shut up even during a good movie. The dialog is intense and should be listened to with out someone talking in your ear."

","If you have seen Alfie (1966), then you'll love this modernised version appealing to the millennial generation, from director Stephen Frears (Mrs. Henderson Presents, The Queen) based on the British novel by Nick Hornby. Golden Globe nominated John Cusack plays Rob Gordon, a thirty-something record store owner who talks to the audience, and must face growing up. He is also a compulsive list maker, and the key one is his top five breakups, including the one he is on now. As he revisits all past girlfriends (memory or practically), and he discovers he built these exes into more than what they really are. He is even surprised he fell for most of them at all, this is especially evident with old college classmate Charlie Nicholson (Catherine Zeta-Jones). As he searches for other past partners to make a closure to that part of life, Rob struggles to get over the recent breakup of Laura (Iben Hjejle), who begins dating his former neighbour Ian 'Ray' Raymond (Tim Robbins), and he worries of them breaking up for good. It is when Laura's father dies, and she invites Rob to the funeral that they share a quick night of passion, and after a talk they try their relationship again. Now comfortable after talking to his old girlfriends the relationship begins in healthy form. The major setting of the film is Rob's failing record store with employees Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black in his breakthrough role, before the even better School of Rock) discussing mix-tapes, constructing top five lists and discussing their opinions on artists and music. This comes into the main story when Rob makes a record label, Top 5 Records (of course), he becomes a DJ, Barry's band (a hint to Tenacious D) plays to promote the label, and in the end Rob begins to make a new mix-tape for Laura. Also starring Lisa Bonet as Marie DeSalle, Joan Cusack (John's sister) as Liz, The Haunting's Lili Taylor as Sarah Kendrew, Joelle Carter as Penny Hardwick and Natasha Gregson Wagner as Caroline Fortis. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay. John Cusack was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Catherine Zeta-Jones was number 10 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 39 on The 100 Worst Britons. Very good!"
"Goodbye_Ruby_Tuesday","9","0","1","7 July 2007"," There are more than 5 reasons to love this movie.
","One only has to look at the movies section of the local paper (NOT during the winter Oscar months) to see the astonishingly high number of low-brow movies made specifically for 14-year-olds with Daddy's allowance. So seeing a comedy that is so fresh in its humor, so honest in its views on male romance, and so imperfect its lead protagonist, is about as rare as seeing Halley's comet. It's a moment to savor, for you know it'll be a generation before another like it comes along.<br/><br/>Rob (John Cusack), a thirty-something who owns a record store that ""attracts the bare minimum of window shoppers,"" has just been dumped (yet again) by his current flame Laura (Iben Hjejle) because he hasn't changed or grown up. This sends our immature hero on a journey of self-discovery as to why he can't seem to sustain a relationship, which includes visiting (and re-visiting) all the other girls on his Top 5 list, including (in chronological order) Alison Ashmore, Penny Hardwick, Charlie Nicholson (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Sara Kendrew (Lili Taylor). All the while, he tries fruitlessly to win back Laura and to grasp why she prefers the company of hippie ex-neighbor Ian ""Ray"" Raymond (Tim Robbins), in addition to having long talks about music with his two employees, Barry (Jack Black)--imagine a human version of Cartman from ""South Park"" but with an impeccable taste in music--and quiet Dick (Tod Louiso). Through his journey towards self-discovery, Rob slowly grows up and realizes what relationships are all about.<br/><br/>Rob on page comes off as a self-pitying, adolescent jerk, a challenge for a character-driven comedy/drama. The casting of John Cusack immediately helps the problem, because 1. Cusack is becoming the most automatically charming and lovable star since Cary Grant and 2. as a co-writer of the script, he knows Rob inside, out and backwards. This role is his. And because slowly, we see a boy becoming a man, a common theme of Nick Hornby's books. First Rob wants Laura back simply because his pride is hurt by being dumped, but as time goes by we see that he did truly have affection and love for her, which results in Rob making a list of ""Top 5 Things I miss about Luara."" There isn't a moment we don't root for him, even when we question his maturity.<br/><br/>The supporting characters provide the movie with a great deal of needed laughs to help ease the at times brutal honesty. Jack Black is a scene-stealer as music snob Barry, a guy so self-righteous he doesn't even give service to a customer who wants to buy ""I Just Called to Say I Love You"" because it insults his own taste. He's the kind of guy that you would violently assault in reality...if you weren't laughing so hard your stomach feels sore. Had the movie not been saddled with an actor as strong as Cusack, Black would've stolen the show. Tod Louiso is also great as Tod, as quiet as Barry is loud. Tim Robbins must've had so much fun playing the rebound man with a ponytail who inadvertently makes Rob's life a living hell. Joan Cusack, as usual, brings larger-than-life energy to her role as Laura's friend Liz. The only weak link is Iben Hjejle. But it isn't entirely her fault; the movie spends so much time focusing on Rob's dilemma when it should've spent a little time explaining what made Rob fall in love with her in the first place. And against such a great supporting cast, anyone would pale in comparison to Mr. Black.<br/><br/>This movie is, quite simply, the ultimate male chick flick (a dick flick?), one that men can learn from while the women drool over Cusack and both can laugh at the numerous funny and truthful incidents (who HASN'T imagined killing the new flame of an ex?). A great movie if you've been married for 30 years or, more especially, if your relationship can't last longer than a tic-tac. An essential John Cusack role, whose exclusion at awards time is further proof that the 2000 Oscars were a joke. Not since ""Say Anything"" was Cusack more romantic or lovable. Never again will be more self-confessional. Movies like this don't come out every Friday. What are you waiting for?"

This is a movie about music, my other love and so how could I not love it....<br/><br/>High Fidelity is funny, honest and a refreshing tale of love and loss from a male perspective.

At first I could not remember much about the movie but after watching the first hour I remembered exactly why I own it. High Fidelity is a great movie that any movie or music buff could probably relate to in some capacity and enjoy it at least a little bit. Cusack is excellent as usual and Jack Black really shows just a bit of the super talent he would become in the following years. Anybody with a sense of humor should not feel cheated by this movie.

","I would take High Fidelity as an ode on music and breakup. It revolves around the life of Rob Gordon (Cusack) his love-life and breakups and his two employees Dick and Barry, arguing daily about the music in a small music store. The man topic is Rob's struggle to find a stable relationship, why his other relationships has failed. Its not mainly about his breakup with Laura, relationship with Laura, its about looking for answers. Why he ends up in painful break up, why he is afraid of committed relationship It is a comedy but its humor is very subtle, the funniest scenes are taken by Jack Black but he doesn't take it too far.<br/><br/>I love the way it is narrated by Cusack, not in voice-over by directly in the film, while it doesn't interrupts the film at all, it really brings feeling and thoughts more closer to the audience, its more sincere, open and helps the narration, mainly in flashbacks.

","When figuring out my favorite movie, I went back and forth between the typical Godfather II, Shawshank Redemption, etc. But I landed on this film. Never has another movie spoken such truth about music. In his first line of the movie, John Cusack indirectly defines pop music. Throughout the rest of the movie, we see his character go through highs and lows, all the while being accompanied by some of the greatest songs ever made. From The Velvet Underground to John Lennon to the Kinky Wizards. However, the music is not the only thing that makes this movie great.<br/><br/>This movie presents one of the strongest ensemble casts I have ever seen. The three guys at the music shop played by John Cusack, Jack Black and Todd Louiso. First you've got Cusack who plays the imperfect hero like no one else could. It's hard to make a character like his likable, when he constantly makes mistakes and makes an ass of himself. Cusack comes through. Jack Black stirs everything up from his first appearance in the movie. He combines his one and only Jack Black timing with a real sense of musical snobiness that makes you want to hang out with him yourself. Last but far from least, you have Todd Louiso who can take a normal line and leave you in stitches just with his facial expressions. I've never seen anyone deliver a line like he can. With these three characters creating the backbone, and some great cameos along the way, the cast is far and above perfect.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. It will make you fall in love with music all over again. It will make you drag out the record player and dust off your Dylan vinyl. But most of all it will make you feel. And that's what movies are all about."

","High Fidelity is smart and funny. I liked the book but the film is even better. Rob Gordon (John Cusack)is the owner of a struggling record store in Chicago. He's a thirty-something rock-snob who judges people according to the music they like. Rob is a man who refuses to put away childish things. He is someone many of us thought about becoming, before we decided it was simpler to just join the rat race. <br/><br/>When Rob's girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) leaves he begins to re-examine his life. Laura is a lawyer who decides she wants a boyfriend with more than an encyclopedic knowledge of pop music and believes that Rob has failed to become an adult. Rob wants Laura back, but is happy with his dead-end career and his music obsession. He's also afraid of committing to one women. Rob tracks down former girlfriends to find out why his relationships with women have not worked out. He attributes it largely to being dumped in college by Charlie (Catherine Zeta-Jones). <br/><br/>John Cusack is perfect as Rob, but all the actors do a brilliant job. There is an exceptional performance from Jack Black, who has tended to ham it up in subsequent movies. The book's London locale is switched to Chicago and it works. This is a great movie."

It's a story that proves that all you really need in the world are a few good friends, not the thousands you meet on myspace, and a good woman. In terms of its adaptation from the book, it's almost perfect. Aside from the obvious location change and some different character setups, for instance Dick in the book has long black hair and wears a leather jacket everywhere. But I have to give props to is the fact the dialogue between the book and the movie are incredibly similar. Some parts are actually exactly taken from the book.

","To derive maximum enjoyment from this film, you must (a) be male, (b) have gone through an extended period of trying to figure out why you couldn't keep a girlfriend (c) love a talky, monologous movie. Women who find John Cusack adorable will also like this film.<br/><br/>There are three major selling points for High Fidelity. The first is the novel technique of mixing 1/3 traditional narrative with 2/3 talking directly to the audience (that's ""breaking the fourth wall"" for you dramatists). Usually, I hate this technique, because it indicates a lazy/untalented scriptwriter who couldn't figure out how to get his points across skillfully. But the technique works here (for the most part), because the script is intelligent. It made me remember back to the dreadful period in my and my friend's lives where we experimented to reconcile our preconceptions of relationships with what we actually wanted, and what the women we dated seemed to want (they were doing the same thing, you know).<br/><br/>But a good script needs good execution, and Cusack's believability and likability are the film's second selling point. By the time he'd made High Fidelity, Cusack had perfected the blending of being earnest and wry. In fact, I think Julliard has added a ""Ham on Wry"" course just to study his technique. In this film, he adds the right amount of youthful, rebellious surliness required for his character. His skills as a monologist are impressive, and I'd like to see him take to the stage for a show.<br/><br/>The third selling point is the performances of the supporting cast. Rob and his two record store employees (who show up twice as often as Rob hired them for) are pop music snobs who desperately need to develop their lives. Todd Louiso, plays Dick, the painfully shy and nerdy clerk, pitch perfect. Jack Black scores a bullseye with his obnoxious-funny characterization. (Several times, Joy or I looked at each other after one of his despicable bits and said ""justifiable homicide,"" to which the other nodded.) And Iben Hjejle (no, I don't know how to pronounce this) plays a remarkably complex, level-headed, and unbitter girlfriend with the right amount of maturity and straightness necessary to convince us that Rob might want to grow up enough to be with her.<br/><br/>The only nit I'll pick is the absence of rap and hip-hop from the musical vocabulary of the movie. Even if Rob and his buddies hated the genre, they couldn't deny its impact or sales figures. But the film ignores this musical and social category entirely, for reasons never explained."

Maybe he'd prefer how this character chose to sort his CDs autobiographically, as in he'd find stuff from when we shared the same taste in music) to the loving explanation of what goes into making a compilation tape (has anyone else been as hurt as I when I spend hours doing a mix tape for a friend or relative and they either just don't get it or worse never listen?)--and here the girlfriend even gets what it means. Too bad Iben Hjejle isn't otherwise convincing in her role.<br/><br/>Critics have pointed out how unusual that this is a relationship movie from a guy's viewpoint and even more interesting that both characters do change. I of course adored Cusack before this (it was ""Say Anything"" that convinced me that guys are in fact part of the human species though he didn't co-write that as he did with this though he didn't co-write of that as he did with this adaptation of a Nick Hornby novel I haven't read yet as well as pick the music) and I adore him grown-up even more.<br/><br/>(originally written 4/19/2000)"

They also make it into more of a romantic comedy than the book was. The casting is pitch perfect, John Cusack is the person I thought of when I read the book, Jack Black and is amazing as Barry as is Catherine Zeta Jones but unfortunately Joan Cusack lacks life, and John Cusack is an actor who needs a great director to really work well and although greatly cast lacks the great director, and so he just really doesn't work. As I said this is a really badly directed movie, and that is part of what ruined it. The visual effects are pretty good but not that good.

Though he tries to move on; he cant get over these woman who hurt him so much; so he goes back to find out why the broke up with him so he can finally understand what is wrong with his life and why every relationship ends the same.<br/><br/>This is a great black comedy about lost love, lust, redemption, forgiveness and a look into the male side of relationships. There is a lot of honesty to this movie, all the characters seem like real people. It was interesting when Rob always broke things down into a top five list; this is a very predominant feature of Rob, there's always a top five to everything. Though this does focus a lot on Rob's life, its great when we break off occasionally and we look into his two employees; Dick and Barry. They are such interesting characters, and such polar opposites of each other.<br/><br/>John Cusack is great as Rob, he really suited the role. His narration; its more of a one on one conversation with the audiences, gives you real connection and insight with him, you can see whats going on in his head. Todd Louiso as Dick and Jack Black are great. Jack Black with held his hyper energy and gave a great ground performance, he really shines here.Iben Hjejle gave real beauty to Laura.<br/><br/>What also makes this movie is the soundtrack. Every song is just perfectly picked and timed. The music does seem to organically come from the situations, instead of clashing.<br/><br/>High Fidelity gives you a real high, you feel like hugging someone after this."

","After watching this film a couple times, it grows on me even more. High Fidelity is a perfect example of a great Hollywood film that is filled with great music and is hilarious throughout. I think Jack Black is best here, have never found him this funny, a great role for him as the snobby record store worker, barry. The film features several great cameo-like performances from Catherine Zeta jones, lisa Bonet and Tim Robbins who were all great in their roles. John Cusack was also great, as was newcomer Iben Hjejle who played the main character (Joh Cusack)'s lover interest. After watching this movie once a while ago, i thought it was great, but not one of my favorites, now after watching it again 3 times in past week, i love it even more. A perfect film.

","this is a great film. not only does this movie look into the dysfunctional nature of men in relationships, it is also very funny and has outstanding performances by John Cusack and Jack Black in particular. Cusack is neurotic and yet still lovable, his life and break-ups all center around his music, he constantly makes lists (usually of 5). High Fidelity has both a serious and funny side. the way he narrates through his top five break ups is highly entertaining and is a great way to present them instead of him just listing them off with them having no real meaning to you. the idea that he goes back to visit all his old girlfriends was initially quite hilarious but then i saw another side that he was desperate for validation and in someways attention.jack black is awesome and the scene when the three of them beat up Ian is radical. a great film all in all. was very happy with the transition from novel to screen also 10 stars or points or whatever this is great!"

Out of over 100 DVDs in my household, I have easily watched this more than any other. Great believable characters with the only possible exception of Lisa Bonet who, though I liked her in other films, seemed miscast as a singer. A unique movie with a killer cast, especially the rare U.S. film appearance of Iben Hjejle.

"lifeisnteverything","10","0","2","30 June 2005"," On my all-time Top Ten list
","This is one of those movies that has the potential to change your life. Underneath the humor (of which there is a considerable amount) lies a truly sweet movie about an adult who still needs to grow up. Watching Rob, played charmingly and realistically by John Cusack, mature as he traces his life through music and various romantic entanglements is a joy.<br/><br/>The central message of the movie seems to me to be that relationships take work. Well, duh, you may be saying. But this film illuminates that point, showing each of Rob's formative (or, as he puts it, ""All-Time, Desert-Island Top Five"") relationships, why they went wrong, and, to a certain degree, how they could have gone right.<br/><br/>Rob's most important relationship is with music--it's his true love, and the film treats it as a character. Given the choice between his girlfriend and his record collection, the viewer is left with no doubt which Rob would choose--music, hands down. This disregard for human feelings that Rob shows throughout much of the movie proves something else: as much as we may like him, Rob's kind of a jerk. It is a testament to the heart of this film, the strength of the story, and the talent of its large, varied cast that ""High Fidelity"" emerged a thoughtful, funny movie, rather than an annoying pity-party about its main character.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone."
"ILoveMcFly","9","0","2","30 June 2005"," High Fidelity - Narrative Report
","This film is built around different top 5 lists. The protagonist Rob Gordon (John Cusack) lets us into his life and through his depression and self-analysis he describes us his top 5 all time break up list, throughout the film. Stephen Frears uses a wide range of narrative techniques to make the film have a more entertaining yet poignant look at breaking up.<br/><br/>Frears uses a non-linear narrative to lay out the film so we can gain different information as the films goes on. When the film begins we start at the middle; this is the day when he and Laura (Iben Hjelle) first break up. Then eventually as his depression and self-analysis develops, flashbacks are used and we go to the beginning. This is where he begins to show us the start of his top 5 all time break up list. The film soon jumps back to where it left off and as Rob continues to describe his thoughts and feelings as he begins to show us more and more about his life.<br/><br/>Frears uses a restrictive narrative so we don't have any more knowledge about the break ups than Rob. This also gives Rob power over us because we will only know what he shows us. Frears also uses little cause and effect narrative in his film, he does this when Rob thinks about his top 5 break up list (cause) and then when he actually goes to visit the girls some time after (effect). During the middle he goes into more self-analysis and goes into more detail of why the girls might have ""dumped"" him and why it didn't work out.<br/><br/>As the film continues Rob also persists with how he and Laura could still work out. He goes into even more depression when he uncovers that Laura has been having an affair with Ian (Tim Robbins) this is when he really starts look at his life and then later decides to go and visit his ex girlfriends.<br/><br/>Frears also uses different narrative techniques to allow us learn more about him and the way he thinks. The most commonly used narrative technique is direct address. He mainly uses this when he comes to a point and he is unsure what he thinks so he decides to try and analyse what he thinks and come to a conclusion. He does this when he analyses the reasons why his mutual friend Liz (Joan Cusack) has just marched into the place he and his employees; Dick (Todd Luiso) and Barry (John Black) are hanging and she shouts at him ""I talked to Laura, Rob. I talked to her and she gave me a little background"" then she continues to describe what Laura told her and how she no longer thinks of Rob how she used to. This is when he directly addresses the audience and tells us what he thinks about the situation, or at least what he thinks he thinks. He tells us individually the five things, which Laura might have told Liz to make her act the way she did. I think this particular narrative technique is very effective as it shows us the way that Rob thinks and does things and also it also allows us to reflect on the way things occur.<br/><br/>Frears uses a series of images of which Rob imagines. He uses these when Rob is experimenting in his head so he can find out the truth to something. A good example of this is when he imagines Ian having sex with Laura after the break up. Yet we later find out that Laura has not yet had sex with Ian so Rob is clearly imagining things.<br/><br/>This film fits neither Propp nor Todorov's narrative models; however, it does almost fit Todorov's technique as it does have stages 2, 3, 4 and 5 of some description."
"~AleXa~","6","0","1","14 June 2005"," Entertaining and innovatively comedic, but emotionally shallow
","It's interesting that they present the main character as more or less an asshole, and we might otherwise just write him off, but his complete and utter honesty is his redeeming quality. John Cusack and Jack Black play off each other wonderfully. Rob's (Cusack) quest for self- discovery, starting off by focusing outward and eventually turning inward, is more or less the point and purpose of the film, brilliantly executed with humor in all the right places. But in spite of its honest nature, the film remains undeniably lacking in character and emotional depth.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Entertaining as well as a nice change of pace from traditional comedies. Recommended to all, particularly John Cusack fans or anyone on the prowl for an innovative comedy, with the exception that you don't mind narrative films (Rob discusses his most inner thoughts while looking directly into the camera through about half of it).<br/><br/>6.0 out of 10.0<br/><br/>~AleXa~"

","After breaking up with his girl, thirty-something Rob, the owner of an indie record-store in Chicago, examines his failed relationships and decides that something's got to change.<br/><br/>Based on Nick Hornby's best-selling novel (though the action is relocated from London to Chicago), this is a well-made and sometimes witty love-story/comedy/drama. As ever, Cusack gives the movie all his energy (he also co-scripted and co-produced) and makes the non-committal loafer he plays a likable rogue. The rest of the cast are good too, particularly Louiso and Black as the two music-loving goofs that hang around the store, and there is a nifty cameo by Springsteen, as well as some funny moments and plenty of good songs on the soundtrack. However, the film never really comes to life for me; Cusack plays an identical role in several other movies, the drama is hardly inspiring and the constant direct-to-camera addresses annoy me. I hate direct-to-camera; when adapting a book with a lot of first-person perspective, I find narration much more emotive and much less intrusive. This is an entertaining movie, but it's a movie where nothing really happens and the images are pretty ordinary, and movies shouldn't be that way. I find it ironic that at one point this film pokes fun at The Big Chill for being a staid mid-life crisis drama, but when this movie is as old as that one, it will be equally dated."

","Yes you heard me. AND I'm a Brit. AND I've read the book.<br/><br/>But why? Well, if it had been made in Britain then (possibly) some morose independent director would have made it into a depressing and painful film. That's just what I reckon would have happened, and to quote the author Nick Hornby 'This is about more than geography'.<br/><br/>I think transplanting it to an American scene makes the whole film a bit more cheery, can you imagine Barry being played by a Brit actor? No, because unfortunately the stereotype of Brit actors in the eyes of Hollywood are villains and aristocrats, or both; not the kind of dynamo that Black pulls off to PERFECTION. He really is that good. Not forgetting Dick of course but then his role is one of understatement.<br/><br/>Also, having watched the deleted scenes, you wish they had kept them in but I suppose everything has to be short and sharp. Don't worry if you didn't catch it at the cinema, this film is not really a visual spectacle.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who loves music especially, as you probably know some characters like the ones you see here."

A really simple story line of a man whos made many mistakes in his life, finds himself alone again after a breakup. He proceeds to go through his life categorically through 'Top 5' things. Including top 5 breakups, this is to discover himself in a way and why relationships have failed with him.<br/><br/>The way the movie is done is tremendous, the film is fully focused on Rob Gordon, he talks into the camera as if its a diary, and we see everything through his eyes. And look into his past with him and the present, The characters in this movie are tremendous. Barry played by Jack Black, takes the cake he is simply hilarious! an absolutely genius performance as Rob's co-worker. And the quiet, insecure yet lovably opinionated Dick (Todd Louiso) The two workers are the complete opposite to each other- Barry's loud foul mouthed and highly opinionated to Dicks's quiet nervous demeanor is a superb comic dynamic. These 2 serve to make Cusack look like the normal one of the gang. <br/><br/>Cusack's top 5 thing is instantly relatable, i do that often with everything. ANd everybody wishes, well i do anyway that there is a camera you can talk into to relate your life into! Cusack's relationship problems throughout his life are easy to relate to for both sexes not just males. Its also universally appealing with the huge influence of music, his life is music and he sets songs for his moods which i'm sure we've all done. I remember when i first watched it after one of my relationships broke up, i prophesied by it! the stuff is just so...true! Its still a comedy and there is plenty of humour throughout-Cusack portrays a tremendous character and very funny. Everybody is tremendous innit Catherine Zeta JOnes, Joan Cusack have small but effective roles. The main love interest seems slightly wooden, but shes nice to look at! English is her second language in real life and the girl at times looked as if her American accent was slightly forced. However thats a minute detail to a wonderfully uplifting and probably of all films i have seen this is the most down to earth and relatable film in my list."

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","2","19 January 2005"," Worth watching due to the narrative and the study of the male way of thinking
","I had quite a few doubts about whether or not to see this film. First of all, Iben Hjejle is in it. No matter how international she thinks she's become, she's still Danish. I haven't seen that many of her films, but I've seen enough Danish films to back up following broad statement: Danes just can't act, in the majority of the cases. Second, no one I know who enjoy films have any clue as to whether or not it's worth watching. I'm talking about people who have seen even the least known 70's and 80's films and can describe what's good and bad about them. In detail. Third, this is a romance comedy. A romantic comedy. The genre of film that is without a doubt the easiest to make and mass-produce, because half of the worlds women go nuts over them and cry their eyeballs out, if there's at least one good-looking guy in it who doesn't portray a complete asshole. So, when I found this available for borrowing at the local library, I was uncertain at first, but eventually decided to check it out. I'm glad I did, though I wasn't too surprised by what I thought of Hjejle. I was surprised at how good this was for a romance comedy, though. I will make sure that my friends know that this is worth watching. I like how Cusack throughout the film addresses the camera and tells us exactly what he's thinking. Without any bull. He's entirely honest, and through this honesty, we feel connected to him. We feel what he feels and we understand why he feels this way. I doubt there is any other film that so perfectly describes how men feel about love and sex. We follow Cusack's character through a recounting of his Top Five worst breakups. First we get a brief retelling of the list, and then he delves into the list, as the film goes on, and he's in the middle of the last breakup on the list. The plot is very good, and has a fairly good pace, though I felt it moved both too slow and too fast at first, somehow. The acting is pretty much all good. No actors really surprised me. Hjejle was about as annoying as I had expected, albeit more tolerable than I had thought. Black was his typical annoying self. The characters are well-written and credible. I really enjoyed this film, and recognized just about everything about the way Cusack acted. Everything he did and most of what he said. The fantasy sequences, particularly the one where he fantasizes about what to do when he faces a guy he hates, are great stuff, something that every guy can relate to. As Cusack says in the interview featured on the DVD: what's great is that it reveals the dark sides of us, of our love lives and relationships. I recommend this very good film to anyone. Yes, anyone. If you can sit through two hours of, basically, a study of the common male's thinking, and you can enjoy a somewhat non-Hollywood movie, you should see this film. It's not the best out there, but I doubt there is or can be a better movie about this subject. 8/10"

Since you get along with Rob, you'll dive into his life and thoughts, you realize how truthful this movie is. Even so, it's hilarious and funny.

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>One of the few writers who has been able to describe the male emotion of the last ten years is the legendary Nick Hornby. In his book ""Fever Pitch"", Hornby discussed his years as an Arsenal supporter and what football meant to him. In ""High Fidelity"" Hornby switched his attention to music and ex-girlfriends.<br/><br/>In the film version of ""High Fidelity"", we are introduced to Rob Gordon (John Cusack). Rob, owner of a record shop and an obsessive music fan, has just been dumped by his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) and is in a fit of depression. Spending time at the shop with his staff Dick and Barry (Todd Louiso and the glorious Jack Black), Rob attempts to win his girlfriend back and do something with his life, whilst simultaneously being able to listen to the music which he loves.<br/><br/>""High Fidelity"" is a truly brilliant film. It's one of those films which people know and love. It's not an award winner, although Jack Black is superb as eccentric Barry, but that doesn't matter as this adaptation of Hornby's film is stunning.<br/><br/>John Cusack as Rob is excellent. A master of the art, Cusack is an actor which nobody hates. With a sense of normality, Cusack seems to make every character he plays likable and believable. Whilst he has recently attempted to expand his range (Max Rothman in ""Max"" for example), Cusack is generally stereotypical as this anti-hero slob who we all love and adore.<br/><br/>The thing which makes ""High Fidelity"" so wonderful is that it is ultimately an excellent adaptation of a beautiful book. Whilst DeVincentis' screenplay has relocated the story from London to Chicago, this relocation has been tolerable due to the simple fact that there are no aspects of the book requiring reference to location or historical buildings. If the original story had featured a scene where Rob had taken Laura to the Tower Of London whilst he explained how he felt, difficulties might have occurred. Ultimately though, this never happened and we can breath a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>Finally, perhaps one of the best aspects of ""High Fidelity"" is it's soundtrack. With a soundtrack ranging from Stiff Little Fingers to Stevie Wonder, ""High Fidelity"" has what is a beautiful collection of music. The personal favourite being when Rob claims he will sell so many copies of the Beta Band's album simply by playing part of their song ""Dry The Rain"". By knowing a wide variety of music, this film shows how close to it's subject matter it truly is.<br/><br/>All in all, ""High Fidelity"" is a joy to watch. Combining the feelings of the typical music lover and romantic alike, this film cannot be questioned. As Rob, John Cusack is spot on and does himself a great credit. The same can be true of Jack Black as Barry. All in all, to add a personal tone to this review, ""High Fidelity"" is one of my all time favourite films. To use the film's notion of Top 10s, ""High Fidelity"" is often suggested as being my all time number one film. If you haven't seen ""High Fidelity"", you don't know what your missing! Go now and rent this film."

Yes, there is a lot of moralizing and deep thinking by our beloved Cusak as only he or maybe Kevin Spacey or Woody Allen does it.

","You have to love record stores. I mean REAL record stores that have vinyl and long memories, where shoppers feel like they  might actually unearth some forgotten gem in a bargain bin. That's the kind of place that Rob (John Cusack) owns and operates in ""High Fidelity"", a comedy directed by Stephen Frears and based on a novel by Nick Hornby. The scenes of Rob and his co-workers - played to perfection by Jack Black and Todd Louiso - are wonderfully authentic and very funny; and probably could've made a worthwhile movie on their own.<br/><br/>But ""High Fidelity"" is more than that. We're clued into Rob's stormy love life, including his recent break up with Laura, who he still loves. Rob is scarred by his romantic past and compulsively lists his worst break-ups the same way he does his favorite records. It takes time and some misadventures for Rob to heal and realize what he really wants from love, but getting there is a blast. Cusack is a great fit for his role and gives an excellent performance. The cast provides strong support, particularly the hilarious Jack Black. Too many movies lack heart and soul, but ""High Fidelity"" has it. It's a rich, knowing, funny film to be savored."

","For any guy with relationship problems, any girl who wonders what the hell men are really thinking, or if you want to watch a Romantic Comedy that's actually romantic and funny, watch this film.<br/><br/>Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is the epitome of the modern man.  He's sad, happy, lonely, funny, and a bit of a pig.  He's full of contradictions when it comes to relationships, including anger at his ex for sleeping with someone else the day after he does the same.  But that's actually why Rob is such a lovable character.  He has flaws, many of them.  He questions everything, and he has an obsessive compulsion with Top 5 lists.  He curses, he smokes, and he flies off the handle amid weird fantasies, but this lets the audience know he's a real person.  He's not some made-up romantic hero.  He's an anti-hero.  He's far from perfect, but we root for him, anyway.<br/><br/>Barry, played by Jack Black, is a hilarious, fun-loving rocker.  This film forever establishes Jack Black as Hollywood's hard rock comedian.<br/><br/>The role that surprised me most was Todd Louiso as Dick.  Dick is nervous, twitchy, but sensitive and brilliant.  He's basically what chick flicks try to characterize all men as, except that Dick is real, in that he has these qualities, but isn't some ravishing Mel Gibson model actor man.  Combine the three guys, and you have a combination of almost all men.<br/><br/>The soundtrack (the backbone of this film about music and love) is simply amazing.  Unless you are the greatest expert of music history, I can guarantee that you haven't heard half of the songs on this soundtrack, but by the end of the film, you want to buy every record and song mentioned.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is the perfect romantic comedy, and has quickly become one of my all time, Top 5, favorite movies."

It didn't remind me of ""reality bites"" as other people have stated, because this was much less ""hollywood"" then that. I kind of was reminded of ""clerks"" in an odd way. There were definite similarities and the characters had an excellent element of realism that I'm sure is the main appeal of the movie, many could view this and found parts of themselves, their relationships, and their friends in many of the characters. Add some great music and a record store setting to the mix and a great cast, and you've got all the ingredients for a really good picture.<br/><br/>I didn't love when I first saw it, though I definitely liked it a lot. It seems the type of movie to definitely grow on you, when I see it a second time I have the feeling the movie will jump a couple of points.

His sincere fragility and his worship of Cusack's character are palpable without him having to say a word.  Brilliant.  The only weak spot I saw was Lisa Bonet. I just wasn't convinced she was worth the attention of the guys.  She looks a little gaunt, and her acting was thin to match.  Cusack was more sincere here than I've seen him.  He was very suited to this role.  I wish someone would go to Denmark and bring back Iben.  I couldn't take my eyes off of her.  She has a natural look and her acting is so genuine.  I like that she's not a typical American barbie doll.  She has a face that's beautiful and full of character.  Her smile... woa.

All that was missing from the stellar soundtrack was one of many apropos tracks from that way cool band from Canada, the Pursuit of Happiness.

Girls are not just sitting by the phone waiting for the boy to call, indeed they have careers, interests and agendas. They might even be ahead in life.<br/><br/>This is not a physical comedy, more a sound comedy - the mental torture of listening to Katrina and the Waves (Walking On Sunshine) at ultra high volume was the best joke of the whole movie. Closely followed by a cameo from a well known superstar.<br/><br/>The great thing is that nothing really happens. No one is going to change much. This isn't a journey movie or if it is it is on a circular track. Cusack is merely learning that a cake once eaten disappears and that the things that matter in life and attract you to people are often trivial.<br/><br/>Credit must go to book author Hornby who is one of life's great introspectionists, he says out loud (or rather in print) what we really think and feel and when we hear it our laugh is the laugh of recognition. This work is not as good as his first novel ""Fever Pitch"" (about football), but works better as a film.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is a small movie about big things. There is more to it than meets the eye, you think about it later and spot the central characters in real life. The central moral is that records and hobbies are great and let us all enjoy them for what they are, but they are not something we can put our arms around on a cold night or share feelings and emotions with."

","I have read the book. Usually films made from books are a letdown, but this is maybe the only one I know that is better than the book! The book is good, but the characters and dialogue really came alive in here. Cusack and Black were really the best choices for the parts."

","I saw this movie for the first time about 3 months ago and I was surprised. My brother told me I had to see this movie, and damn he was right! I literally suffer with John Cusack along the entire film. I could see myself in his situation. I´ve been totally there! I don´t know if there´s another film that can describe a man´s feelings as good as this one. Specially the scene where he says he thinks his ex-girlfriend was having the best sex a woman ever had with this guy Ian.  This is exactly the movie a guy must see after being dumped by a girl. And the music... the soundtrack must be great! At the moment my favorite movie! Absolutely a Must Buy!"

","Without doubt, this is one of the finest movies I've seen in a long time. The story has a very surprising perspective, in which the main character addresses you directly, therefore soaking you into his life.<br/><br/>
Good laughs, funny dialogs compensate for a more serious underlying theme: ""what has sexual freedom done to the way we handle relationships"".<br/><br/>
Actually this movie is good, that it's even fun to watch the outtakes included on the DVD."
"whaleking","Null","0","1","1 September 2003"," Not quite as expected
","There were some witty dialogue and clever lines here and there, but most of the time, it is just the leading character, Rob, rambling on and on. The plot is loose and moves on at a slow pace, with nothing stimulating happening in the end. Simply put, there is no climax.<br/><br/>John Cusack's performance in this film is disappointing.  I don't know if it is his acting, or his role in the film that annoys me. The leading character, Rob, is unfunny, grouchy, sour, ill-tempered, and wears a grumpy face throughout the whole movie.  I don't hate John Cusack(in fact he IS cute), it's just that I don't think he is suited for this particular role: he lacks the ""aura"" for a music-lover. On the other hand, Todd Louiso(Dick) and Jack Black(Barry) were brilliant! I'd say that ""the musical moron twins"" had saved this movie.<br/><br/>One more thing. If you are not familiar with the American pop music culture(as I am not :P), you might have some difficulties understanding some of the dialogue, since there are many many references to bands, songs, and lyrics(which I am oblivious to---but this is my problem really).<br/><br/>I rented High Fidelity in hope to see a clever, inspiring cult movie, such as Fight Club is. But it seems to me that High Fidelity is not quite in the same league as Fight Club."
"genevadavid","9","0","1","21 July 2003"," Perfect Pitch
","I've watched this movie twice this weekend, and I could easily see it again. It is a pleasure to watch such good acting and direction, even if the story revolves around a fellow in the process of maturing. I particularly liked Iben Hjejle's portrayal of Rob's latest girlfriend, Laura.  She is completely believable as the girlfriend ho seems to have matured six months ahead of Rob.  <br/><br/>Of course, Jack Black's Barry electrifies the record store, but he stops short of going over the top.  He is perfectly balanced by Todd Louiso's deadpan Dick. Fortunately, these guys are around to relieve us from the Rob's self-centered examination of his failed relationships.  <br/><br/>I haven't read the book (yet), but I appreciate characters who aren't afraid to say ""I don't know"", because they are still groping their way to the next stage in their lives.  So much of the dialogue feels realistic.  <br/><br/>Finally, the music provides a terrific backdrop.  People change; styles change.  At one point, Rob is dismissive of Peter Frampton, but his ears open up when he hears ""Baby I Love Your Way"" interpreted by Lisa Bonet's Marie De Salle.  The same is true of Barry's rendition of a Marvin Gaye tune.  Growing and maturing is all about seeing, hearing and feeling things that you weren't aware of before.  This film conveys that process wonderful by weaving music into the story of Rob's love life. Bravo!"

"1B12A","10","0","2","17 June 2003"," Imagination is not reality!
","'Variety is the spice of life'. 'Familiarity breads contempt'. 'Absence makes the heart grow fonder' and last but by no means least 'Assumption is the mother of all f*%@ ups!'. For this movie - see all of the above.<br/><br/>The film lobotomises the average single thirty something male's relationship dilemma. Through historic self-analysis Rob (Cusack) surgically probes in to the realms of 'commitment', 'dependent responsibility' and the fear of loosing the 'freedom of lustful choice', finally emerging from the 'past relationship exorcism operating theatre' content in the knowledge that he is not terminally condemned. High Fidelity is not a movie about love, nor it is a movie about trying to find love, it is instead a movie about the male's perception of love and the frustrations associated with their female partner's interpretation of the same. Ultimately we learn that love is not an emotion requiring identical thought patterns. Instead we see that love is sexless, born out of mutual dependency, personal differences, forgiveness and true friendship. No more vividly is this displayed than in Rob's loving charity towards Barry and Dick. The fantasy world of casual sex has its place too, but here lust betrays love, socially flawed by it's own shortermism and existing optimally in our imaginations. Consequently lust is flawed by the complications of reality. Ladies - see this film, please - if for no reason other than to understand (and hopefully forgive, or even learn to love?)the basic flaws inherent in the decision making process of the male species!"

","I'm pretty sure that anyone who has seen this film can relate to it in one way or another. I imagine that everyone has at some point worked with one or two goof-balls, has cheated on his/her partner, dumped over and over again, and feels that they have been s**t on their entire life. That's why I love this film. It is simple and it has class. The fact that John Cusack speaks to the audience makes the viewer relate to the character.<br/><br/>    I enjoy the fact that John Cusack's character feels that he is always being s**t on, because then when he runs into a problem the problem seem more critical and more intense. A great example of this is when Rob (Cusack), discovers that his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) is seeing Ian (Tim Robbins).     Another thing that I find very fascinating is the fact that Rob is very smart but in a aggressive and bold manner. Therefore his dialogue is made very impressive. High Fidelity has everything that a down-to-earth film should have and I'm sure that everyone would enjoy it. So, therefore they would enjoy it as well."

Even Rob and his buddies consumed by the music and popular culture, but that not so help much his relationship with either his long time girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) or all his previous.

It is a sure thing so refreshing in the genre.<br/><br/>John Cusack plays his role respectfully and so do the rest of the casts.  It is surprising me that Catherine Zeta-Jones as one of the cameo, and she looks so gorgeous and talented as usual.<br/><br/>In closing, you will fill a little (or much) distracting by the time you watch `High Fidelity', if you usually could enjoy a plain and typical romantic comedy.

"rzajac","Null","0","1","22 January 2003"," Fun, fun, fun flick...with a bullet!
","I must take a minute to honor the Summary line of another commenter:  High Fidelity just might be the ultimate chick flick gracefully and effectively masquerading as a guy flick.  The love element is as boldly subtle as a cannonballing freight train loaded with goose down.  This is a movie about love.  This is a movie about spirituality.  I was hit by the metaphor of ""top five"" (same for ""top ten"", etc.).  This is a reflection on the way spirituality obliterates lists, levels, medals, hierarchies, comparisons. The hero is lost in comparisons, just as he is lost in his fetishising of his ""top five"" songs, breakups, etc.  Watch how this evolves through the movie.<br/><br/>Ironically, my sensitivity to this may well have some relation to my reluctance to contribute the numeric values to movies that contribute to the IMDb ""Top 250""!  'Ts not my thing, man....<br/><br/>And, while you're at it, be sure to just enjoy the writing and deliveries of this movie.  The characterizations and timing are fantastic, all 'round; kudos to each and every participant!  I will take the liberty of making special mention of Jack Black:  What a monster!  I get the impression that he's not just a one-note johnny.  But I'll have to see more of his work to find out for sure.<br/><br/>See this movie; with your boy/girlfriend!  And get out there and find true love!  Have a good journey."

He's rash, crude and way over the top - perfect performance as the wacky Barry. The other co-stars who play Dick and Laura are great, although the girl who plays Laura seemed like she was just put there cos she was a pretty face. Could be better.<br/><br/>As usual, I have no faults with John Cusack's performance. This man is just talent beyond talent. He's normal joe guy one minute and insane record shop owner the next. He really draws you into the world with a life and personality that easily grows on you.<br/><br/>MUSIC: Brilliant.

","Once again it just so happens that the movie that I think is terrible turns out to be a hit not only among other viewers, but with tons of critics as well.  'High Fidelity' is a boring film with very few laughs.<br/><br/>I rented this film for one reason and one reason only:  John Cusack.  I haven't seen Cusack in too many films, but once I did manage to catch him in something, I was immediately interested in seeing him again. <br/><br/>
Cusack is good, very good, but unfortunately, he can't save this disaster. I was a little surprised to find out that he also co-produced and wrote for 'High Fidelity.'  Iben Hjejle is terrible and annoying.  I guess that's a little harsh, but I just didn't care for her one bit.  Todd Louiso and Jack Black are funny.  Black made me laugh a couple of times.  The cast itself was a disappointment, but Cusack is great by himself.<br/><br/>I expected 'High Fidelity' to be quite funny, as the video box read that it should hit the top-five list (with a bullet).  I managed to laugh maybe five times, if that.  As I said, Black was somewhat funny, but I really only laughed once or so at Cusack's jokes.  Bottom line is that this movie is not to be rented if one is looking to actually laugh.<br/><br/>So, the acting is pretty good, but the actors aren't that enjoyable except for John Cusack.  Laughs are very few and far between.  The writing is pretty dull in general.  Don't be fooled, I would definitely pass on this bomb."

","This is an unusual romantic comedy because it is told from the perspective of those unromantic little canines known as men.  It ridicules our fear of commitment, our willingness to endlessly (and pointlessly) argue what is or is not the best this kind of thing or the worst of that kind of thing, our appalling need to outgrow the egocentrism that comes from being raised as guys, and generally makes guys laugh at themselves because the people responsible for this movie just know us too well.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, women seem to love this movie too.  I think it allows them to say to their boyfriends, ""There, you see?  That's you, you incorrigible, primitive, ape-like being"".<br/><br/>Ebert put this movie among his list of great movies with Casablanca and Citizen Kane.  He may be overdoing it a little because he has a soft spot for movies related to Chicago, but not by that much.

I thought it would be difficult to translate the store's neighborhood, the socio economic status of the various ex's and the guys from the store, into American terms. And they missed the mark.<br/><br/>If you liked the movie, you'll love the book.  The work buddies are pretty close--Dick is surprisingly good.  John Cusack is just okay, not really showing all the neurosis and passion of Rob.  He seems too good looking and superficial to be really as miserable as the character in the book is.  I disagree with most of the female casting choices.  His mother, for instance, looks only about 10 years older, whereas in the book, you get the feeling that she's old enough that he feels guilty about disappointing her--30-35 years older.  Sad to say, I couldn't watch it long enough to see if the scene where he goes to the movies with his parents is included--in the book, it's both funny and poignant.  If you like this author, About a Boy is a much better adaptation of one of his books, which captures all the nuances of personality and self-deprecating sarcasm of the main character."

While he reaches out to his past heart-breakers, he suffers a great deal from not having his recent ex, Laura, around and shows how desperate he is in one scene by standing in the rain outside her new boyfriend's apartment (played very well by none other than Tim Robbins) repeatedly calling just for her to pick up.<br/><br/>However, Rob manages to surprise himself after every visit with his old girlfriends.  He discovers that either they're lonelier than he is now and even more desperate to have someone in their lives, or in one case it was him who threw away what would of been something because of his impatience. In addition, when getting together with his ex-lover from college who he always thought was better than him, Catherine-Zeta Jones's character, Rob realizes that she's shallow and narcissistic and probably always was. Feeling great after all of these recent discoveries, Rob finds some clarity of what he wants, and what that is is the comfort and security of being with someone who cares and respects him.  His view on relationships and the opposite sex alters; he stops giving into the fantasies and jumping from rock to rock, and decides he wants to settle down into a nice, comfortable reality.<br/><br/>There are many hilarious moments throughout this movie.  Rob, who just now I mention is a record store owner, and his two clerks played by Todd Louiso and Jack Black create great chemistry on-screen, usually when Cusack is at Black's throat.  One memorable scene that goes down in my ""Top Five Comedic Skits"" is when the despised Ian (Tim Robbins) enters the record store and confronts Rob about the non-stop phone calls he's been making and Rob trips off into fantasy which involves Louiso knocking Ian's teeth out with a phone and then crashing an air conditioning unit on top of his head...i keeled over laughing.  There are many other great scenes that make up this movie which also is glued together with a great soundtrack.  My rating:  ""Two snaps and a twist""."

","I absolutely love this movie.  John Cusak is the best, and I have always liked the movies where he does ""asides"" to the camera.  ""One Crazy Summer"" comes to mind.  Jack Black is excellent, and I get the feeling that his part in this movie is very close to his actual character.  It's a love story, a comedy, a well researched music-movie and it all takes place in my beautiful city of Chicago."

","High Fidelity: 9 of 10<br/><br/>Let me start out by saying that I made a list of things that I liked about this movie as I watched it for the second time, and I will try my hardest to not turn this review into a list of ""things I thought were totally cool about this movie, man.""<br/><br/>1. It's not the way you are that's important, it's the things you like. This sentiment was expressed by Rob Gordon / John Cusack during one of his narratives, and is affirmed many times, e.g. when Rob asks Barry about Evil Dead 2, a cult movie with fans of equal standing to the characters in this movie. Why is that this simple plot idea could be so dead on for snobs like you and I? Really, because only a snob would write a review on imdb and only a fellow snob would read it.<br/><br/>2. I would swear that Dick is based upon a guy I know named Lee, except Lee is too good for Belle & Sebastian.<br/><br/>3. Non-linear movie. Think Rashomon. Think Catch 22. Well, not quite to those degrees, but the movie has many flashbacks and much commentary outside the flow of time. The train of thought can be dropped off and picked up later in the movie without acknowledging a gap.<br/><br/>4. ""I believe sex is a basic human right,"" Marie DeSalle. A lot of the movie is tied up in sex, and putting it in the same line as life, love, and the pursuit of happiness makes so much sense. Rob's number one agonization about breakup is sex, Laura has sex to forget her father's death, and ultimately Rob is tired of fantasizing about sex so he gets married. There is something fascinatingly romantic Rob's honest desire to become tired and old.<br/><br/>5. And, the ultimate, record collection as extension of self. Rob rearranges his record collection when he breaks up like he is rearranging his feelings. The fact that Rob puts his records in autobiographical order when he breaks up with Laura shows from the start that Laura not being in the top 5 list is bull, she's number one. We have no indication that Rob did anything nearly as painful when he broke up with Charlie.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I see so much of these full of life characters around me every day in our own quagmirous obsessions."

","When I first heard of High Fidelity, I have to admit that it didn't really appear as a nice film to me. This changed later on. For some kind of reason I think John Cusack is terribly funny. After I found this out, I decided that I should see High Fidelity, since I had heard a lot about it. And I really liked it! Apparently it's a guy movie, but I still like it. Rob Gordon is really, well, a huge loser - but that only makes it more fun to watch. The story really has no point what so ever, but who cares!<br/><br/>John Cusack plays a very Cusack-like part as a thirty-something record-store-owner (which is a nice excuse to use all kinds of music that nobody really listens to anymore (walking on sunshine? Come on!)) with fear of commitment. Things get worse when his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle or something like that) decides to leave him for Ian Raymond (Tim Robbins, with the most awful-looking hairstyle in the history of his films). Rob then tries to find out what  he has done wrong to deserve all of the other girls leaving him. He seeks help with his ex-girlfriends (including Lily Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones) to find out what he has done wrong.<br/><br/>And of course, there's always Jack Black as Barry, the hard-boiled shop assistant who has made a living of insulting people. Being a very funny element in this film, it basically set of his further career (remember Shallow Hal?).<br/><br/>I could give you many other reasons which would oblige you to see this film, but I'm running out of time. Therefor, I can only say: go and see it. You'll hate it, or you'll love it, but at least it's worth a try."

","High Fidelity was a reasonably enjoyable comedy about three guys that work in a music store. Not having read the book, I can't really draw any comparisons between it and the movie, but overall it was a pleasant enough way to spend 2 hours. One gripe though - John Cusacks character is very irritating and as such it is difficult to sympathise with him when things don't go his way. It is bizzare to hear these American actors waxing lyrical on bands like the Smiths and The Jesus and Mary Chai - bands that were successful in Britain but virtually unheard of in the States - but I think that it just adds to the idea that these guys are musical snobs. Also, watch out for Tim Robbin's scene when he ventures into the record store, its a gas."

Now, to get an idea of what High Fidelity is like, imagine that, on the day after Ferris's day off, Sloan dumps him.  What would he be like ten years later?<br/><br/>Ferris would be what Jon Cusack is in this film.  Angst, wonder, trouble, self-deprecation all in one.  It even uses the self-narratory from Ferris Bueller!<br/><br/>The movie is great.  The cast is incredible, highlighted by the always mournful Cusack and the ""Turned up to 11"" Jack Black.

"Infofreak","Null","0","2","11 May 2002"," A great book turned into a mediocre movie.
","Nick Hornby's novel 'High Fidelity' is funny, wise and much more complex than it first appears on the surface. Unfortunately Stephen Frears' movie adaptation almost completely misses the whole point. Frears, Cusack and co end up with an occasionally amusing romantic comedy with music as the ""colour"" or ""background"", rather than it being the cornerstone of the movie. Transferring the setting from the UK to the US is one thing, but to mess around with the clearly defined characters and musical tastes of Rob, Dick and Barry in such a way as to make them almost meaningless just shows how little of the book was really understood. Music is the most important thing in the world to these guys, sometimes more than relationships. Good or bad, that's the way it is. The book knows this, the movie does not. As a musical obsessive myself I could relate to the book. From this mediocre effort it seems Cusack and his three(!) co-writers did not. A major disappointment."

Stepping back into the older ""Say Anything/Better Off Dead"" mode was a smart move by Cusack who combines comedic pathos with manic energy. However the half hour or so that John spends talking to the camera is way overkill and no one in the packed theater I went to was amused by any of it. The plot is also muddled and teeters out at the end. Jack Black was OK-but unlike professional reviewers us average normal folk know people just like his character in real life and thus are fully aware that his character is not as endearing and humorous as Hollywood seems to believe."

","I have rarely consumed a film that I fought to stay in my seat for the first 2/3'rds of the film then enjoyed the denouement... This is one of those films where the trailers from T V suck you in and generally, that's all there is to it! The concept of Cusack ""narrating"" his ""lists"" (that were very uninteresting to begin with, I really didn't care about him or his lists) made this film a very lonely situation for the viewer. I have spent lots of my life consumed with the days this film was based upon, trying to ""recapture"" my similar period of  life because it was as the filmmakers tried to capture, a very free, uncertain and exciting time of life. But it didn't do it for me. Cusack was boring in his narration mode and that's all there was to this film for a long, long time. Only when the main love interest's father died did the film move at a nice pace with an interesting ""backstory"" in that the old girlfriend ""saw the light"" at the same time as Cusack which made for ""chemistry"" this film so sorely lacked until this point. When the writer from the music magazine that Cusack had a spark for, appeared I ""felt"" exactly what the filmmakers wanted me to and I was thrilled!! I woke up!. The main interests continued their pursuit of ""life"" situations and showed some maturity and made me feel like I learned something from this particular situation towards the end of the film. The sound track that I heard so much hype about actually sucked, in my opinion. I hope the producers didn't pay much for the drops (music) because they didn't make any sense to me until the film started to be interesting.<br/><br/>It should have been made as a short film for a film festival, say the last 30 minutes, then it would have been completly watchable."

We are the guys who grew up watching too much television, listening to too much music, and watching too many movies.  We were tricked to think that life without misery was no life at all.  We were fooled into thinking all romances were story book and that all of life's problems can be wrapped up in thirty minutes or less.

I have been a Cusack fan for a very long time and this was one of his best performances ever.  I loved the way his character 'Rob Gordon' was talking to the camera and letting the movie-goer journey through his emotional state.  He is one of the few actors in Hollywood who could have pulled it off.  His facial expressions and emotions were very real and by the end of the movie you really got a sense of the characters persona.  The supporting cast did a marvelous job, especially Jack Black and Tim Robbins. This movie bought back so many fond memories of those John Cusack 80's classics.  It was like watching Lloyd Dobler (Say Anything), Lane Meyer (Better Off Dead) and Walter Gibson (The Sure Thing) grow up and tackle ""grown up"" problems.  The setting was great, Cusack was born and raised in Chicago and he knew exactly where to film it.  The Soundtrack is also amazing and Cusack personally picked out many of the tracks for the movie.  He also co-wrote the screenplay. I hope that this film finally gets Cusack the recognition he so richly deserves.  Unlike other 80's teen actors who have faded to obscurity, Cusack will be around for a long time.  In my opinion he is the greatest actor of his generation. My Rating: 9/10"

"Aardsy","Null","0","1","3 April 2000"," A slice of real life
","""High Fidelity"" is one of the best films of recent memory.  The reason? Simply put, ""High Fidelity"" doesn't insult the audience.  In a way, ""High Fidelity"" is an anti-movie movie.  Its positive qualities can best be explained by discussing what its NOT.<br/><br/>Instead of shouting movie cliches at each other, the characters have conversations that feel real.  Characters in the film speak with inflection and phrasing that people actually use in real life.  When was the last time you found yourself involved in a case of mistaken identity?  How about a run in with a pesky dog?  An elaborate slapstick bout with the meal you're cooking?  These things only happen in movies and they don't happen in this movie.  The film is not built around funny scenes, rather great characters. The plot isn't moved forward by awkward plot points (Act 1: ""I know CPR!""; Act 3: ""Now I can use my CPR!"").  One could complain that the film feels long and boring, but that might be because we're more used to movies about crap blowing up than character-driven plots.  There are tons of obscure music references in the movie.  I didn't get them all and, more importantly, the movie didn't feel it had to bend over backwards to explain the references to me.<br/><br/>Further, any single one of the characters in ""High Fidelity"" can easily support his or her own film.  We might only see them for a few minutes of screen time, but one gets the feeling that there is so much more about these characters than the movie is letting on.  It's nice to encounter the rare movie where we only get a seeming slight glimpse into the lives of the characters--that when a scenes ends the characters continue to live fully developed, multi-faceted lives without our having to directly witness it. For example, Joan Cusack has, at most, eight minutes of screen time.  Yet we have a complete understanding of who her character is.  Tim Robbins even has less screen time and we know him better than we'll ever know his character in ""Mission to Mars.""<br/><br/>The movie also manages to overcome two movie no-nos: it's an adaptation of a cult hit novel and the main character constantly breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience.<br/><br/>Dealing with the first, its remarkable how faithful the movie is to the Nick Hornby book.  Having fond memories of the novel, I did not leave the theater complaining that the movie left out this or the movie changed that.  If you liked the book, see the movie.  If you liked the movie, read the book.<br/><br/>The second point, John Cusack addressing the audience isn't at all irritating, as one would expect it to be.  On ""Malcolm in the Middle"" I tire of Malcolm's asides after about fifteen seconds.  In ""High Fidelity,"" Cusack spends half the movie talking to us and it works.  Maybe it's because John Cusack's likeable; maybe it's because we can relate the reality of what he's saying.<br/><br/>""High Fidelity"" leans towards the male side of the relationship game, but regardless of one gender, the viewer can find characters and situations that can be related to one's real life.  Highly recommended for viewing and reviewing."

High Fidelity allowed for intimacy one finds when seeing a play because he interacts with the audience by speaking directly to us, as he is trying to understand himself.  Rob involves the audience who wonders at his inability to see what he finally figures out, that is with the help of Laura.  She is the one who dumps him at the beginning of the movie, to which he responds that she should have gotten to him earlier if she really wanted to get to him.  Obviously she did get to him because it sets the premise of the whole movie.  The introspection of Rob.  Laura does seem a little preoccupied with her American Accent, but the few times her homeland comes through adds some interest.  She should have let the accent stay.

"mercury-26","7","0","1","4 April 2000"," good movie, better book
","John Cusack's latest manic love story is not only based on Nick Hornby's novel of the same name, but nearly copies the book word for word.  When I read the book a couple of years ago, I remember thinking what a great movie it would make. When I heard that John Cusack would be starring in sort of an Americanized version, I could see it. Just the right fit.<br/><br/>
Now that I've seen the finished product, which is pretty much what I envisioned, I'm a bit disappointed. For one thing, I didn't expect Cusack's character, Rob Gordon, to talk into the camera all the way through the movie.  I thought they'd find a more inventive way to show the inner workings of this thoroughly confused person's mind.  Nearly every time Rob is talking to another character, he'll turn to the camera and give us his thoughts, sort of including us in the conversation.  I'm all for innovative filmmaking, but this just seems like a cop-out to me.  We like movies because they find ways to show what's going on in a person's head through their interaction with others and their behavior.  If they'd cut Rob's monologues, the film would have been a half hour long.  This type of blatant exposition is becoming a problem in the industry as a whole:  too many thought-revealing voice-overs and other conversations that sound like someone reading from an encyclopedia.<br/><br/>Not that high fidelity is a bad movie.  It's actually very amusing most of the time and I'm sure if I hadn't read the book, I'd have enjoyed it more. Music and the intense emotions behind it create the film's landscape.  It's fun to watch the arguments over what songs belong in a certain `top five' list. In fact, Rob and his employees, Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso), have a Top Five songs for every life situation.  For example: when Rob's girlfriend's father dies, they create a `top five songs about death' as a tribute to the man, which is the only way they know how to express their sympathy.  The result of all the lists and mix tapes is a very eclectic mix of music of all styles and from all eras.  It's proof that when you mix it all together, you find that the old stuff is just as cool or, more times than not, cooler than the new stuff.<br/><br/>Rob's Top Five All-Time Worst Breakups is the list on which the entire story is based.  He uses it to deal with his frustration over his latest breakup, Laura (Iben Hjejle).  This is one area in which the film improves upon the book:  Laura's character is more fully developed here.  Rob comes up with the list just so he can leave her off of it, to prove how little she really mattered to him (when in fact, she's the love of his life).  High-profile actresses Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, and Lisa Bonet take small roles as the other loved and lost women of Rob's life.  Rob is not an easy guy to like, the way he uses these poor women just to sort his own feelings out.<br/><br/>Seeing the film version makes me want to go back and read the book, a format in which the narrator is welcome to express his feelings right to the audience.  If you're about to go and see the movie, don't.  Read the book instead or at least read it first and then see the film if you must.  So consider this the official warning:  the book is better. <br/><br/>

"Castor-5","Null","0","1","4 April 2000"," Early in this year there are still many great films on the way, but this one will stay my favorite throughout
","John Cusack is back on the turf where he was best at.  High Fidelity almost plays like a sequel to Say Anything, one of Cusack's first and best films. Throughout the years he's done some great stuff such as Grosse Pointe Blank, but it's great to see him take a role like his Lloyd character in Say Anything.  This film works on so many levels that it's hard not to like it. The best element that it offers is the same as Say Anything did, no matter how old you are, you can relate to what he's going through.  Some great supporting characters are seen here, his employees especially.  Tim Robbins and Catherine Zeta Jones do a great job with their cameos.  I've always liked John Cusack throughout his career, and High Fidelity only makes me like him more.  He really is one of the coolest actors out there and I hope we see more of this in the future.  It seems every time John and Joan are in a movie together the film automatically becomes great.  Screenwriters, Directors, and Actors take note, this is a comedy/drama you can learn a lot from."

The way the English characters in the story were translated to American ones was really well done, and I felt the spirit of the book was maintained really well.

","In a time where quality flicks have been few and far between, High Fidelity shines bright. It flows really well, with the narration from Rob Gordon (John Cusack), the record store owner, leading us from scene to scene. I left the theatre glowing, because I knew that everyone in the theatre along with me could relate to what he was talking about. It's one that speaks as one of the regular guys; it doesn't talk down to the viewer in any way. There were also some stellar supporting roles; Jack Black, who played Barry, was easily the funniest character I've seen in a long time. He's the perfect opinionated loudmouth; he'd rather give you his opinion than sell you a record that sucks. Todd Louiso (Dick) and Iben Hjejle (Laura) were a couple of others that were good as well. Tim Robbins appears briefly, but he fills his time well. Overall, it was well put together and superbly acted. I know it probably won't get any nominations from those stiffs at the Academy, but it certainly deserves a couple. Hey, Ebert actually gave this thing four stars! How bad can it be?"

","John Cusack has consistently turned in understated, very funny, and sharply insightful comic performances.  It's great to see him offer cynical truths that force us to reflect on some of our own funny brokenness.  This movie is full of this kind of bleakly offered, yet amusing reflection.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is also very funny in many other ways, and though the conclusion is somewhat routine, the journey is anything but.  And the journey is what we're here for anyway, isn't it?<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, there is constant profanity, strong sex talk and some relatively frantic (though funny) sexual imagery and this keeps me from recommending it for anyone who might be offended by this.<br/><br/>
I wish Cusack and his co-writers, as well as director Frears would have contented themselves with less vulgarity (in both language and imagery).  I think it would have been just as funny and insightful."

She felt it was slow, she didn't care about the characters, and she totally couldn't relate.  John Cusack's character reminded me of several college boyfriends, the references to obscure alternative bands from the 80s totally hit home with me, and I laughed through the entire movie.

","So you liked Grosse Pointe Blank, you think you're hip to the dry, sarcastic, often morbid wit of John Cusack.  You even got a kick out of Pushing Tin, watching him spiral into an ocean of self-analysis and despair as he tries desperately to deconstruct then reassemble his relationships. Now you're ready for the big leagues.<br/><br/>High Fidelity lacks both the gunslinging fun of Blank and the aerobatic insanity of Tin, replacing them with a total omnibus on the male point of view on women.  This is told through narration, both first and third person, as well as a sizeable chunk of flashback time.  The jokes are often quick, said low, not waiting for a laugh.  The kind of humor only some people really get, and the rest of the theater takes the cue to laugh along.  I was rolling in the aisles.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is not a date movie, unless guys want their girlfriends asking them a lot of difficult questions afterwards.  Though not many of us obsess to the incredible lengths Cusack's character takes us, the issues and questions he raises are all too real.  The movie lacks any kind of Seinfeld quality, for although it deals with mountains of minor details, the viewer always feels their sense of importance in the larger picture of life.<br/><br/>In summary: you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hope it doesn't inspire any awkward questions from your date..."

Anyone who's ever dabbled in rock and roll minutiae (""There's no 'the' in that title!"") will see themselves in this movie, for better or for worse. I've worked with these guys, I've been these guys, and because of that, it's totally hilarious. If you're too young, most of the references will slide right past you, just like Reality Bites (one of the referenced movies) slides right past me.

It was about two hours long, but by the last half hour I was praying for the end.<br/><br/>I was expecting something funnier.  There were some really funny moments, but overall I would never call the film a comedy. Jack Black absolutely stole the show, and I truly believe that the movie would have been a complete disaster without him.<br/><br/>The lead female role is annoying.  I spent the entire two hours wondering what she had been in before and why the hell she cut her bangs so short. (She's from Denmark, and hasn't been in anything I've ever seen.  I still don't know about the bangs.)<br/><br/>There were a lot of references to obscure bands, which bothered me because I felt like I was missing the joke a lot of the time.<br/><br/>I found myself laughing at things that were only slightly funny.

","High Fidelity is a wonderful book, and I feared for its transition to the screen.  But I need not have worried - this film is a brilliant translation of something that is usually  portrayed well only in novels, i.e., the internal dialog between our better and worse selves in a time of crisis.  To make a film protagonist's inner life manifest, the filmmakers have used a technique that often screams ""contrivance,"" but in this film, works well: the protagonist's direct speeches to the camera.  They genuinely carried me into protagonist Rob's thought processes, self-deceptions, soft spots, and, ultimately, enlightenment.  <br/><br/>The music is terrific, and the fast pace of the film was jazzy and fun. Likewise, acting, editing, and dialog all sparkled.

","As was Cusack's habit of naming top 5s (can't come up with songs right now), 1) The setup for the movie was too long. 2) Once the setup was established, they should have rethought it. 3) The scene with the record store packed with people seemed to be a big occasion (Laura asking about it), but it looked like the lead-in was cut. 4) Laura took Rob back without much effort on his part and 5) We only saw Catherine Zeta-Jones topless from the back (okay, that's a lame one, but still!).  Cusack loves making quirky movies and this one was no exception.  I wavered between a 6 and 7 for voting (would have given 6.5 if you could), but had to go with a 6 because this isn't a movie I would tell people to run out and see.

","Initially I was worried about this movie adaptation of a novel I really liked, because they relocated it from London to the U.S. -- but fortunately, they moved it to a gritty Chicago neighborhood and not some sun-blessed upper-class California zip code. Also, they kept the authenticity of the music store geeks and their propeital snobbery. It actually carries over very well, and I expect even Nick Hornby will find it works as well in Chicago as it does in London. It maintains the convivial, confessional, and unpretentiousness of the book. The cast is very good. A couple of scenes really killed me. I think a lot of people will see this movie and say, ""I know that guy!"" or ""This is my biography!"
"TinnyPhilly","9","0","1","2 April 2000"," Thank You, John Cusack!
","John and his writing partners have done a wonderful job crafting a great movie from an entertaining book.  The move from London to Chicago works out well, though initially I was a little put-off by the idea.<br/><br/>I first remember seeing John Cusack as Anthony Michael Hall's geek friend in ""Sixteen Candles"", arranging for a showing of Molly Ringwald's underwear in the boy's room during a school dance.  You can imagine his character in this movie, Rob, having that history.<br/><br/>The record store denizens (employees and customers) are dead on; I used to spend many an hour skulking through cement-walled record stores searching for that elusive Smith's 12-inch single with James Dean on the cover. These record-store snobs just don't get it--they break down life into top five lists, without really participating in life at all.  The character Rob, played by John Cusack, goes from relationship to relationship, never considering the girlfriend's point of view.  In fact, his fidelity isn't high at all; he can't commit to anyone.  Even at the end of the movie, when he has had an epiphany of sorts, you know that he still has far to go before he can deal with the reality of relationships.  I think it pretty impressive that an American movie can end with this sort of ambivalence; usually characters do such an about-face by the end of a story-line that it becomes totally unbelievable.  But Rob can only manage to change his life little by little, just like the rest of us poor slobs.<br/><br/>John Cusack is at his best in these small, character-driven films.  Please God, don't let him do another ""Con-Air"" again; I'll even sacrifice my nearly mint-condition 1980 copy of O.M.D.'s Enola Gay, pressed in England, if that will help!"

Cusack is superb in walking the line between cool-guy-you-root-for and far-from-a-saint, and Jack Black finally comes into a role that people will remember him for. The film sometimes feels like it wants to end sooner than it does, but then starts new scenes with vigor.  Only complaint:  you never quite see Cusack and Iben Hjejile really click at any point, causing one to wonder what the attraction was in the first place.

","The co-stars (too many too list) who play in this romantic-comedy-I-guess, are far more interesting than our central character played by Cusack. Cusack plays a record store owner who spends the whole movie whining about his failed love life.  For the first 40 minutes of it, I hung in there, waiting for our main character to show SOME character.  After that, I begin to look at my watch.<br/><br/>The problem with High Fidelity, is that our main character is too much of jerk to like.  He is totally selfish and immature for his age and his habits are a complete afront to women.  I was okay with that, at first. But a shallow main character can't carry a picture all the way through without showing SOME promise along the way. This is supposed to be OUR guy. We are supposed to be rooting for him the whole way through. But after awhile, I just wished that one of his many ex-girlfriends would have shot him in the head and put us all out of our misery.  John Cusack's character has no perspective or enough depth to carry a movie. John, GET A REAL PROBLEM.<br/><br/>I was insulted, because Cusack was potraying someone my age and it just makes our generation look useless.  Cusack finally does get his act together at the VERY END of the movie. Not soon enough. And I never really believed he was a lover of music.  He didn't have the passion for it the way his employees at the record store did. They were believable.  Cusack could have been a shoe salesman for all we know. He says a few snappy lines about music trivia and owns a lot of vinyl, but he just doesn't ""fit"" the part.  He would have been more believable if he cut his hair, put on a suit and played a RECORD LABEL EXECUTIVE.<br/><br/>THANK GOD for his co-stars. They were excellently cast and offered plenty of comic relief to break up the monotony of Cusack's pathetic love life and his journey to ""find himself"". If they had let this movie play dark all the way through and then killed Cusack at the end, I would have liked it better. But the Hollywood ending was so cliche I wanted to VOMIT PROFUSELY. They spend the whole movie trying to sound ""INDIE"" and they have that cheesy ending...<br/><br/>LOTS OF SHALLOW LAUGHS, BUT IGNORE CUSACK."

But most of all, the many quirks about record collecting, music discussion, and the ""elitist"" attitudes one has when you appreciate music.  It's not a ""music"" film, but rather music circles the life of John Cusack's character, coming up with Top 5 lists, lyrical verses, and references to the first songs on Side 1 of any album as a metaphor for his need for romance.  Of course, diehard collectors will complain that the movie is not an accurate adaptation of Nick Hornsby's book, but who cares?

","I'd like to say that this movie was terrible, just so that I'd fit in with the crowd.  Apparently, not many folks liked this movie.  But, unfortunately for my reputation I must go against the masses and say that High Fidelity is one of my favorite movies!  If I was to break it down by genre, I'd say it was my favorite romantic/comedy....mostly because most other romantic/comedies aren't really plausible.  Usually they're a couple thrown into a horrible situation (like cheating) and then act like they hate each other and then fall in love again.<br/><br/>Anyway, High Fidelity is different because the characters are believable and very compassionate.  I swear, a friend and I put names of people we knew to each of the characters in the movie and they worked out.  Apparently I'm Barry (Jack Black), although I'd like to think of me as the respectably sensitive type.<br/><br/>Secondly, the use of music to express feelings that aren't apparent and emphasis the feelings that are. This is why music is put into films, and unfortunately a lot of movies just put songs that are hits into their movies so that they can sell a soundtrack.  The music in High Fidelity was subtle and unique, and they didn't even stick with one genre of music like How High or Exit Wounds.<br/><br/>Also, the self discovering ""what-does-it-all-mean"" phase that Rob(Cusack) goes through is completely relatable to real people who go through breakups. And his attempt to remember the past, only to realize his memory isn't as good as he thought (breaking up with Penny) is so funny.  I can't remember how many High Fidelity moments I've had.<br/><br/>The Comedy in High Fidelity is top notch, and one thing that really surprises my friends is that I'm not even that impressed with Jack Blacks' comedy.  Don't get me wrong..Jack Black is fabulous, and his band, Tenacious D rocks...but since the things I say and do are so much like him....its the subtle John Cusack and Tim Robbins humor that really shocks and satisfies me.<br/><br/>I give High Fidelity an 8.5, because its one of the only well done romantic comedies of the late 90's that didn't take place in high school."

","From the onset lemme say that I have read the Nick Hornby novel and seen this film twice. There are people out there who have an aversion to this film because the book is set in London and the film is set in America which seems to imply some kind of sacrilege. I must say that I was one of the more optimistic, especially with John Cusack's involvement as behind the scenes as well as in the forefront. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, it achieves one of those rare feats in that it is as good as the film. John Cusack has been doing melancholy from the beginning,One Crazy Summer, Say Anything spring to mind, but he has made that successful transistion from teen to adulthood, eloquently seen in Gross Pointe Blank.<br/><br/>This film embraces the fact that the shop, Championship Vinyl, is not based prominantly in a high street, but in a back road on North London, hence this translates to a back road in America and it translates well, nowhere in evidence is the feared American gaudiness, but the evidence that everyone involved was very aware and handled said material with care.<br/><br/>This film achieves the rare feat of inviting you into a characters life and before you realise it, you are concerned with their welfare and what happens. Also the humour is not played with a heavy hand, there are genuine laugh out loud moments, one of the side splitting moments are the 3 imagined confrontations with the new age Tim Robbins. <br/><br/>It's a love story,a real love story, hell I am going one further and saying that this is a life story, we know people like these, we have friends who have these relationships and it makes a change to see reality on screen. Bravo to Nick Hornby for the book and John Cusack for another great movie."

","High Fidelity is, for me at least, one of those movies that I don't mind watching again and again. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it definately has a lot within it that I can relate to, as well as one of the best soundtracks to grace a film, and some excellent acting. The only questionable casting choice in my opinion was Iben Hjejle as the long-suffering girlfriend of John Cusacks' Rob Gordon. I really have no idea why she was cast, as it seems like she's reading her lines from cue cards throughout the entire movie. I can't decide who I want to smack more, Hjejle herself, or Victoria Thomas who obviously thought she'd be a good choice. Thankfully, an otherwise stellar cast manages to bring this movie to life. I think this is one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen on relationships and the male psyche in regards to women.

So the movie is so far away from the book that I can only rate it with a 5/10. And if you have the opportunity please check the deleted scenes on the DVD edition and you will see that some of the best moments were not included on this poor-compared-to-book movie. Oh!

","John Cusack stars as Rob, the owner of Championship Vinyl, which is a record store. It's where he and his two employees, Dick and Barry, hang out during the day. Rob has recently been dumped by his girlfriend, Laura while Dick and Barry seem never to have had one - prefering records over girls. On the surface the film is a romantic comedy of Rob getting back with Laura, but really at heart its a glimpse into the male pysche through a love of music. I'm sure we are all familiar (and may indeed see ourselves) with guys retreating into their world of music snobbery, attacking each others' ""top five"" music lists of all-time, etc!<br/><br/>Involved in this project from the outset, and credited as co-producer and co-writer, Cusack spends much of the time doing speeches direct to camera, talking to us in his lonely apartment, on the way down the stairs, out on the street and all the way up to the shopfront - speeches taken almost word for word from Nick Hornby's book. Some might see this coming off a bit uneasy, a self-conconscious gimmick that director Stephen Frears could have done without, but I dont think it diminishes from the film much (actually as the film progresses and the action gets more complicated, this narration gets toned down a bit)<br/><br/>As for the other main characters , Iben Hjelje shines as the very likeable Laura, Robs nice, accessible and down-to-to-earth girlfriend, Jack Black starring as Barry is simply superb and Todd Louiso is good as Dick - a character who fits the stereotype of a fan of relatively obscure (in the US at least) Glasgow indie band 'Belle and Sebastian'. Such musical 'in-jokes' are littered throughout the film - such as like the advert for some ""hip young gunslingers"" - a reference to a semi-famous advert placed for new writers in the New Musical Express in its heyday in the late 1970s and Punk and later New Wave was breaking. Its obvious the makers of this film care deeply about their music! If you are also a music fan, then there are parts of this film that you will simply love and the soundtrack is great also. However for those not so interested in music, the film may drag a bit and you wont be able to relate to the characters so well.<br/><br/>However to me its definitely in my top 5 films of 1990s books"

","I have read some horribly scathing reviews of ""High Fidelity""  recently. One person even called it the worst film they ever saw and preferred the plague and ritual suicide to viewing it.  Either this person is deluded or they're missing the point entirely (or both).  This is a film about people. Real people.  It's a hilarious, thoughtful masterwork of cinema.  ""High Fidelity"" is on my list of the ten best films ever made.<br/><br/> A lot of people criticized it for having a ""standard"" John Cusack performance.  I personally don't see anything wrong with that, even though I don't quite agree with it.  If you see it as routine from Cusack, you should still respect the performance because it's still a good character.  Woody Allen has been playing the same character ever since Alan Felix in ""Play it again, Sam,"" but that doesn't make his films any less remarkable.  So I say leave Cusack alone.  He's one of the best American actors of modern times. Stop whining about his characters and go watch ""Top Gun"" or something. ""High Fidelity"" is a brilliant piece of cinema and if you don't get it, then you don't understand real cinema.  There IS romance, but these characters are casual about their romantic existence, that's what makes them real. There is comedy, but it's intelligent, so it goes beyond those who understand only toilet humor.  There is drama and these actors with a touch of humanity that is equalled by few films.  Those who don't appreciate ""High Fidelity"" for everything it is need their heads examined."

","Rob Gordon (Cusack) seems to has set his life to cruise control, spending all of his time talking music and nonsense with whoever`s around. When he`s dumped by his girlfriend, he gets something to really think about. And so, all his thoughts on commitment, relationships and things good and bad are brought to us in a pop culture wrapping; everything can be related to music, and music is always good conversation. And conversation is what this movie is all about. Great conversations on important and not-so-important matters.<br/><br/>""High Fidelity"" can be compared to Wayne Wang`s ""Smoke"" and ""Blue in the Face"", since they are also of the rare breed of strictly dialog-driven movies. All are great movies, but ""High Fidelity"" gets a better score for it`s absolute perfect cast: John Cusack is brilliant in the lead role, his casual insecurity makes the role. Also a very wise choice to cast Iben Hjejle as the girlfriend; the character with the most debth. Jack Black is a natural born pain in the ass, and therefore an obvious choice, and Tim Robbins is absolutely hilarious as Ian (or was it Ray?). High Fidelity is just about the perfect all-round movie, it`s great fun with lots of laughs, while it at the same time gets a message through without pushing it in your face. One of those movies you can watch over and over again. Enjoy."
"diza","8","0","1","20 January 2002"," great movie!
","First of all: High Fidelity is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, John Cusack is just fantastic! But: Still, the movie cannot beat Nick Hornby's excellent book. One reason for it might be, that the location of the story was transferred from Britain to the US.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, High Fidelity is one of my all time favourite  movies."
"clydefrogg","9","0","1","23 January 2002"," Top Five reasons I love this movie
","High Fidelity has become one of my favorite films.  It has, in fact, snuck into the top 10.  Unfortunately, there's just no room for it in the top 5...<br/><br/>Anyway, the top 5 is as follows:<br/><br/>1. I relate to this film more than any film I've ever seen, as do many guys in their mid 20's, I'm sure.  Of course, I haven't personally been through everything Rob has, but I've been through a lot and I've seen others go through a lot.  On another level, I relate to the snobbery expressed by Rob, Dick and Barry as they look down on those who know less than them.  Not for music, but for film.  And I think anyone who has a knowledge of anything that is far superior to that of the common man can relate to these guys, whether it be music, film, books, cooking, politics, whatever.<br/><br/>2. There are a number of great truths in this film.  It is quite possibly the greatest film ever made about the relationships between males and females, at least for our generation.  Rob's wandering and his eventual epiphinies are presented so well, it knocks you over.<br/><br/>3. It has great characters.  Rob is an imperfect hero, but it's hard not to love him, nonetheless.  Laura is, on the surface, presented as NOT the ideal for Rob.  But she is great, and boy, he really does love her.  And I think I love her too!  Suffice to say, Jack Black's Barry is a riot and Dick is incredibly painful to watch (in a good way).  I think we've all known guys like this in our lives.  Joan Cusack has only a few short scenes, but she is spectacular, too, and nails her character.  The characters are unforgettable and so is their dialogue.  Don't even get me started on Tim Robbins!<br/><br/>4. What a great soundtrack.  I have the CD, and whenever I listen to it (or hear a song from it), which is often, I want to watch the movie.  That's how you know a film has a great soundtrack.  Like Pulp Fiction in that respect, and in the respect that one of the reasons I look forward to watching the movie again and again is because of the music.<br/><br/>5. It has a perfect ending.  (SPOILER) Rob proposes to Laura, and she doesn't say yes, she thanks him for asking.  Not your garden variety happy ending, but you're happy anyway because you know things are probably going to turn out alright.  Same for Rob's career as a producer.  He's not exactly setting the world on fire by putting out the record of a couple of skate ****'s, but it's a start.<br/><br/>I love this movie, and it's one of my favorites.  I like it more every time I see it, and it gets better every time I see it.  However, I couldn't give it an ""A"" when I first saw it, and I can't give it an ""A"" now.  I give it an ""A-"" for two reasons, things I can't get past.  One, the unforgivable use of rain to heighten the drama.  Not once, but about six times.  Second, what happens in Laura's car after her father's wake.  I just don't buy a girl wanting to do that in that particular situation, time and place. Ever.<br/><br/>A great movie, an instant classic, and a tour de force for John Cusack."
"bmn-2","Null","0","1","18 January 2002"," A movie that is definitely tailored for a specific audience
","High Fidelity entertained me like no movie I have seen in a LONG time but a lot of that has to do with two things:<br/><br/>1)  I'm male and while I certainly think that females can enjoy this film, I think it is directed in a large, large degree towards guys so that they can see themselves in certain experiences or relate to the lost loves, etc.<br/><br/>2)  I'm interested in music beyond commercial radio, and in discussions about music.  That's not meant to be an elitist statement like ""I know of Belle and Sebastian and therefore I'm better than you"" more so than it is ""I have many friends that have these type of conversations about music so this movie is closer to my heart than hearing characters converse about Britney Spears.""  <br/><br/>The film also does a hilarious job at reassuring ""musical elitists"" or indy-saavy music fans but not without reminding them of how much they can ruin the day (and I'm as guilty as anyone for having those spells).  The scene in which Barry wants to play 80s pop like ""Walking on Sunshine"" whereas Dick wants to listen to the melancholy of Belle and Sebastian is hilarious.  I also especially related to Rob's tendency to rank things a la musical top fives.  <br/><br/>It also features Cusack excelling in his speciality of the melancholy lover who floats between periods of terrible self-pity and terrible self-loathing. The classic replication of the guy that is always bitter when he doesn't have the girl yet incredibly befuddled and suspicious when he does.  But the character does work through this to discover some meaning in what relationships provide beyond sex and feeling attractive so I think he emerges as a much more likable person as the film plays out.<br/><br/>Overall, I think ""High Fidelity"" is very funny especially for younger audiences but in order to consider it a classic (as I probably will for my lifetime), it helps to be male and a non-commercial rock music follower as that is obviously what the target audience seems to be."
"billnted","9","0","1","2 April 2000"," A Guy Romantic Comedy that Rocks
","This film that lives up to Nick Hornby's brilliant, hilarious, inspired book.  Although squeezing the book down to a couple of hours left a few things not quite fleshed out.<br/><br/>This is a guy movie about relationships, a romantic comedy with substance. Rob (John Cusak) relates to his record store employees, and the world, through his snobby opinions about  rock n roll and much else.  In the record store, they're always making up top 5 lists about everything.  He has that most common of guy addictions: he's an opinion-aholic: he's right and everyone else is wrong.  Which doesn't endear him to his live-in girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) though she appreciates his other qualities.<br/><br/>
She moves out, moves in with another guy, and Rob freaks, becomes the ex-boyfriend from heck.  It takes him a while to figure out that opinions aren't everything, and that it is possible to love someone who has what he thinks is a lame CD collection, and that they get along better without that opinion stuff in the way.  As a guy, formerly much more opinionated myself, I can relate.<br/><br/>Cusack brings the novels interior monologues to the screen by directly addressing the camera, as in ""Ferris Buehler's Day Off.""  In lesser hands this would seem too contrived, but he manages to make it believable, even natural.<br/><br/>John's sister Joan has a nice supporting role, not too many minutes of screen time, but well done.  Iben Hjejle, the Danish actress, doesn't quite sound like a Chicagoan (though I wouln't have guessed she was Danish), but does a good job in a role that's not nearly as flashy as John Cusack's. Lots of cameos: Tim Robbins as the new boyfriend is the funniest.<br/><br/>While I was a little disappointed that the film changes the location from London to Chicago, but hey, I live in Chicago, and they did a nice job of revealing the city, not using the stock shots, shooting in neighborhoods that tourists seldom visit, full of realistic touches in the script that someone who grew up in the Windy City like John Cusack (who also co-wrote) would know.<br/><br/>So, definitely catch this flick.  Read the book first, or afterwards, and see what you think.<br/><br/>""High Fidelity"" is on my top 5 list for the year."
"Captain Ed","8","0","1","2 January 2002"," On second thought, a good film
","Originally, I wrote a rather harsh critique of this film. On subsequent viewings -- and oddly, after reading the book -- I've come to appreciate High Fidelity much more.<br/><br/>John Cusack and Iben Hjelje make an interesting mismatch of a couple, which is the fulcrum of most of the film. Cusack drives her away and then spends the entire time trying to win her back without quite understanding why. He's approaching middle age and has begun to question his choices and his lack of responsibility.<br/><br/>In truth, most men reach Cusack's dilemma in their early twenties, but Cusack's Rob is a case of arrested development. Charming though he is, he has to start growing up.<br/><br/>The supporting performances are very good, but Jack Black does a star turn as Rob's music-snob employee at his record store. He's worth the price of admission alone."
"matija-trost","3","0","1","29 December 2001"," PLEASE RATHER READ THE BOOK!!!
","Why?<br/><br/>Well, firstly, it's one of the the best books in modern era. Like a Selinger's ""Catcher in the rye"" for the 60's generation. And, secondly, you'll see, what could a more capable director did with this movie. No offence, Stephen.<br/><br/>Since I read the book before the movie, I certainly expected more funny scenes (for instance, when the main character goes to the movies with his parents and how he comments this event) and maybe a stronger dramatization. I'm not even to sure, if I would put John Cusack for a lead role. While others, especially the guys who worked with him, were much more appropriate.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is a scene (you know, the one with alternate ending, with ""aircondition fight scene"") who laughs my pants out. But, sadly, this was the only thing that was above average in this movie. Otherwise it was just as I was watching the Sex and the city episode, only from a man point of view.<br/><br/>3 out of 10"

As well as John Cusack starring in High Fidelity, the movie also features performances from Catherine Zeta Jones, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor and Lisa Bonet. They all give okay performances. <br/><br/>To me, High Fidelity is nothing special. I didn't find it funny or interesting.

John Cusack's character is a mopey, whiny drag throughout the whole thing...NOT a good move to make him the main focus of the story.  It should have been more of an ensemble piece, ala ""Singles.""

","Rob Gordon (John Cusack)owns a Chicago vintage record store.  His spectacular self-absorption is moderated by his charm.  He is verbal, boy is he verbal.  He has a top five list for everything he has ever seen, heard, or done (songs, movies, and, oh yeah, girl friends with whom he has broken up).  This odd but appealing film has a large and tremendously appealing cast, from Cusack himself to the two music nerds who work in his record store (Todd Louiso and Jack Black), to his girlfriends and ex girlfriends, too numerous to identify here.  The movie's best features are its funny surprises and believable characters.  It is clear that it is based on a Nick Hornby novel.  It is endlessly inventive and its many loopy characters are true to life to a degree rarely rarely encountered in film.  Highly recommended (9 out of 10)."

","I went through a really god-awful break-up a while back.  I was depressed and thoroughly miserable and I must have watched this movie every night for at least two weeks.  While it didn't get me back together with my girlfriend, it certainly cheered me up and put a big smile on my face.  It also gave me a different perspective on relationships and how to handle them easier.  <br/><br/>There is no plot here.  The movie opens with Rob getting dumped by his girlfriend, Laura. He then proceeds to tell the viewer about his all time top five break-ups, in chronological order.  We get flashbacks of his four most important breakups, starting when he was fourteen.  We also get to see Rob's record shop, which ""attracts the bare minimum of window shoppers"". Dick and Barry are his employees who chase off what few customers the store brings in.  You see, these guys consider themselves musical experts and anyone who doesn't meet their standard of musical knowledge is refused service.  <br/><br/>The films biggest laughs come from Rob's self-deprecating remarks and Barry's antics in the store.  Jack Black plays Barry and I'm looking forward to seeing him in more stuff.  He really shines here as the obnoxious clerk who was hired for three days a week but shows up every day.  Dick (Todd Louiso) is the quiet one who looks a lot like Moby with his skinny body and bald head.  His meek, shy manner is the polar opposite of Barry.  His facial expressions are very amusing and his and Barry's arguements are hilarious. <br/><br/>
The film moves along at a nice leisurely pace, without ever getting boring, as Rob attempts to find out what keeps going wrong and why he is forever doomed at relationships.  Amidst all of this, he discovers the musical talents of a couple of skater/punks he busted for shop-lifting.  Barry (who doesn't play any musical instruments) forms a band called the Sonic Death Monkeys and Dick finds a girlfriend.  Rob is also insanely jealous over Laura's new boyfriend, Ian (none other than a pony-tailed Tim Robbins).  Ian is the kind of pretentious, new-age fruit-loop that Rob strongly dislikes and (in this case) hates with a purple passion.  He has only one confrontation with Ian and, done three different ways, it is one of the film's funniest scenes.  <br/><br/>I've always been a huge John Cusack fan. Ever since I was seven years old, ""Better Off Dead"" has been one of my favorite comedies since I was old enough to laugh and ""One Crazy Summer"" follows close behind.   While many stars who got their start in the eighties have faded out, Cusack has really come into his own by finding (and in this case co-writing) good, challenging material that continues to show what a good actor he really is."

","Adaptations of novels are rarely very good. This one feels more like a betrayal. Nick Hornby's novel is a marvellous and truthful tale of what it's like to be a man in the 20th/21st century. John Cusack's Rob Gordon is hardly recognizable as the same character. Admittedly the Americanisation doesn't work, but it isn't just geographical transition from North London to Chicago that causes me so many frustrations it John Cusack's complete lack of identification with the character he plays. Throughout the film it's unignorably evident that he's playing a role and it is impossible to believe that he IS that character.<br/><br/>I once read an article which referred to John Cusack as one of the most gifted actor's of his generation. Well, MAYBE I'd cast him in a school nativity but only as a minor role."

Add into the mix two 'musical moron twins', and problems with a neighbour, and the scene is set.

My critical problem with this pedestrian film was that it trod a path well worn by Woody Allen, and was a rather pale imitation in comparison. In fact substitute jazz for pop and New York for Chicago and you have a Woody Allen plot, but without the comedic engagement. And as for rude shop assistants being funny, well see Clerks instead. It would have helped me if girlfriend four and five looked a little more different from each other, which added to my bewilderment about just what was this jerk whineing on about. However some clearly enjoyed it (what was so special about the sound track, though??) so give it a try - but don't say you weren't warned.

Bored and confused, Rob decides to revisit a series of old girlfriends (played by Lili Taylor, Joelle Carter and Catherine Zeta-Jones) in order to learn from their reasons for having rejected him. When his research produces a somewhat optimistic view of himself, Rob's self-esteem is revitalized and he feels compelled to pursue a new adventure with the exotic Marie DeSalle (Lisa Bonet). Conflicts arise when Rob learns about Laura's sudden interest in his intolerable neighbor Ian (Tim Robbins).<br/><br/>High Fidelity portrays the banal aspects of falling in and out of love. Its main character, who personifies the identifiable ups and downs of bachelorhood, often turns to the camera to describe his misfortunes and to incite the viewers' sense of sympathy and humor. High Fidelity draws most of its comedy, however, from Rob's two eccentric employees, Barry and Dick (Jack Black and Todd Louiso), whose well-defined personalities and distinct tastes in music contrast Rob's overall ambivalence. High Fidelity offers a strictly male point of view by depicting a world where every male character --troubled or not-- is nonetheless a funny character, and where all female characters are either too angered, too hurt or too indifferent, yet always serious. This choice supports the protagonist's perception of the female mind as impenetrable and makes High Fidelity a film which comments one-sidedly on the irrationality of love."

I thought the other guys who worked in the record store were funny.

","Very funny movie about struggling to make important life decisions.I liked the setting of Chicago; for awhile, the film stopped being a movie,and was more like real life.

"kattah","Null","0","2","15 June 2001"," These are the things I can't do without...
","British cult writer's novel successfully translated into American movie. A proof that addictions (particularly those for women or vinylrecords) appear in the same manner universally? And maybe this being an American film rather than a British one also softens it a bit.<br/><br/>John Cusack's role as slightly neurotic, semi-philosophical, soul-searching discophile is complemented with Jack Black's bravado as a motormouthed, elitist know-it-all vinylwiseass. There are plenty of other enjoyable performances as well, like Catherine Zeta-Jones in her usual self-confident and ignorant mode.<br/><br/>This romantic comedy has comforting, joyful elements, and it gives a nice perspective to small but important things of life (like proving that American comedy doesn't have to mean cartoon-like characters and complete lack of credibility!). It can make you a bit melancholic but still oddly contempt. And without diminishing the value of the religious-like approach to vinyl as a format I am tempted to say that the music itself makes the most of it here. Especially like that Stevie Wonder's proge'ish loop-song ""I believe"" in the end! Definitely a movie to be watched over and over again!"

","At first when I saw the previews for ""High Fidelity"" and found out that it was adapted from a book my first thought was ""Oh here comes another movie from a book."" Doggone, I'm glad I was wrong because it's not that it's a really hilarious romantic/comedy. This tells the story of a vinyl record store owner (John Cusack) who's going through a mid-life crisis and has just broken up with his girlfriend that makes No. 5 on his Top 5 Most Breakups. So he starts to question why he has so many breakups and decides to visit all the girls on the list while he's trying to win his ex-girlfriend back. This has a lot of very observing and funny moments, good writing from ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" writers Steve Pink, Cusack, D.V. DeVincents, ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" writer Scott Rosenberg, and good performances (especially from Jack Black). Like I said before this not on my top 5, top 10, or top 20...this is on my top 40!"
"flip304","Null","0","1","7 June 2001"," A comparison between the book and film.
","I've just finished reading my copy of ""High Fidelity"". So instead of just giving a review if the film or the book, I decided to give a comparrison of them. First, I would just like to admit that I absolutely loved both of them and recommend them both highly.<br/><br/>The movie I saw first. I thought it was absolutely hilarious and had some great hints into the minds of men. I remember thinking that the whole looking into the camera thing was very unigue and it would be strange to read something like that. Plus, the acting and everything in the film was nothing but the best. I've heard complaints that the girl who plays Laura didn't do to well, but believe me, she's fine.<br/><br/>The book was different from the film (as most books are). I'm not saying the film wasn't faithful to the book. I'm just saying that there are things that are changed and/or added between the two.<br/><br/>THINGS IN THE BOOK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FILM.<br/><br/>1. Rob has a lot of scenes with Marie in the book. I though Marie was a good character and they definatly underused her in the film. She has some good scenes.<br/><br/>2. The book tells you more about what Rob is thinking. In the film he talks a lot (he does in the book too). But in the novel more time is spent with his thoughts as apossed to his words.<br/><br/>3. This one isn't really important. But in the novel they talk about ""Reservoir Dogs"" a lot. I kinda wish that was in the movie. It's on my top five favorite films of all time list(Platoon, Reservoir Dogs, The Godfather, Braveheart, and Pulp Fiction if anyone cares).<br/><br/>THINGS IN THE MOVIE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE BOOK.<br/><br/>1. I am a big fan of the scene on the bench after the funeral. Well it isn't in the book.<br/><br/>2. I also love his ""Fantasy"" speech to Laura at the end of the film. He says different things in the book.<br/><br/>3. The little skateboarder kids outside the shop. There isn't even a hint that they are outside. So there isn't the stealing scene or any of that.<br/><br/>THINGS I'M HAPPPY WERE LEFT OUT.<br/><br/>1. I am very happy they left out the relationship with Rob and his parents. It is kind of boring to read and I really didn't care about them or why they were there. Truth is I mearly skimmed over some of those parts.<br/><br/>
Overall they are both very good pieces of art. They are both clever and insightful. And they both make me smile when I'm finished with them. FILM: 9/10 BOOK: 8:10"
"Would24","10","0","1","24 May 2001"," The story of my life...
","I just cannot get enough of this movie.  It is probably one of the most accurate portrayals of the typical male psyche that I have ever seen.  Even if you cannot identify with the ""Music Lover"" part of Cusack's character, his actions and thoughts are things that have gone through every man's mind at one point or another.  Cusack's interaction with the camera (the narration) is witty and amusing while the rest of the cast is right on target.  Jack Black is absolutely hilarious, especially if you are a music fan since you will have a better idea what he is poking fun at as well as the fact that I think everyone knows someone like him.  I watch this movie at least once a week and it never gets old.  Its a great date movie and has an awesome soundtrack."

"Heavenly Creature","7","0","1","20 May 2001"," Plenty to enjoy here
","Welcome to the world of men.  Please keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times. <br/><br/>Based on Nick Hornby's best-selling, and rather charming book, this film remains extremely faithful to it, charting the disastrous love life of Rob Gordon, a typical bloke doing typical bloke things.  You know, like cheating on his girlfriend, spending the majority of his time with his loser mates and compiling countless top 5 lists on every subject under the sun.  The setting has been moved from London to Chicago, but as Nick Horny himself explained, this film is not concerned with geography.  What it is concerned with is trying to justify why men act the way they do.  And while it doesn't always succeed, it's an entertaining little ride along the way.<br/><br/>John Cusak is brilliant as Rob.  Having read the book myself, I can't think of anyone else who could play this part better.  It would have been all too easy to cast a better-looking, better-known actor in this role, but had that been the case, I probably wouldn't be writing such a favourable review about the film.  Cusak is engaging, playing the part with humour and vitality. And while the character of Rob may not always be likeable, he is certainly always entertaining.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is nearly always strong, with some shameless scene-stealing from Jack Black as Barry, one of Rob's friends who works in the record shop with him.  But while all Rob's former girlfriends play their parts well (Catherine Zeta Jones a particular standout as the pretentious Charlie), the actress playing his latest break-up, and the cause for most of his anguish, is slightly static and poorly judged.  It didn't come as a surprise to me to find out this was her first film role.<br/><br/>But apart from this little glitch, High Fidelity is almost faultless.  A good soundtrack, some extremely funny sequences (Barry playing light-hearted music while Rob seethes, having just broke up with his girlfriend) and excellent acting from almost everyone involved makes this an extremely enjoyable flick.  Men will relate to it, and women will enjoy finding out what makes men act this way whenever Rob does something a bit stupid.  This is the male equivalent of Bridget Jone's Diary, and it's probably just as funny."

","Excellent relationship comedy that uses the best of the music from the eighties as backdrop to John Cusack narrating his worst breakups. Cusack, who also co-wrote the script based on the book by Nick Hornby, is at his sleepy best as the record store owner who can't seem to get wise to what the women around him want from him. Jack Black is hysterical as the acid-mouthed employee at the store, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lily Taylor and Iben Hjejle are also very memorable as some of the women in his life."

Cusack is funny and Black steals the movie but it drags on sometimes and feels way longer than what it is. The soundtrack has some gooides like the Beta Band and Velvet Underground. I dont think its better than a few of Cusacks others but it is a worthy effort. ***"
"kergillian","10","0","1","14 May 2001"," A rare gem! A perfect ten!
","I don't often think of a film as complete, or even near-perfect, but this one is damn close! Very respectful of the book (and I never thought a transplant from the UK to Chicago would work!), this film relates the story from print to tape in a way that's exceedingly rare these days. It took what it needed and knew when to let go of unnecessary scenes, which is all too often a missing factor in book to film translations.<br/><br/>John Cusack is, IMHO, the most under-rated actor in Hollywood. I've loved his work since 16 Candles, and I can't think of a film offhand that he's in that I don't like. From the best teen film ever made (Say Anything) to outstanding dramas like the Grifters and Being John Malkovich and comedies like Grosse Pointe Blank, there's something about Cusack that just lights up a screen. He doesn't over act, he doesn't steal scenes from other actors...he's *always* on! And this film is no exception; it's hard to believe that this film wasn't written specifically for him (and being an absolute music geek and self-professed obsessed vinyl addict in real life, he wasn't stretching too far, either;)<br/><br/>And the supporting cast is nothing short of brilliant! Todd Louiso and Jack Black are magnificent as the loner vinyl-shop geekboys, and they play beautifully off of each other and Cusack as well (the Cusack & co. vs. Tim Robbins scenes were *hilarious*!!) And John's sis Joan played perfectly off of him as well. In fact the chemistry between all supporting characters was quite good; Bonet, Zeta-Jones, Gregson Wagner and Lili Taylor all worked really well with Cusack, and Tim Robbins was  *very* amusing. I do wish that the adorable Sara Gilbert had a bigger role though;)<br/><br/>Iben Hjejle was the only rotten apple here. The woman simply cannot act. She displays barely an ounce of emotion (not to mention a completely monotonous voice) and her expressiveness is less than impressive (non-existent?). If her role was at all important as anything other than a catalyst for the story, she might well ruin the film. But the scenes with her are all inevitably saved by Cusack, and don't last long enough to spoil the film.<br/><br/>Overall: The soundtrack rocks (*love* that Beta Band song!;). The film is a perfect length. It reflects the book beautifully. It's a boon to vinyl freaks (like me;). The acting is incredible, and Cusack is at his absolute best here! And for God's sake it's got Bruce Springsteen in it!! WHAT MORE COULD ONE POSSIBLE ASK FOR??? A rare 10/10!"

Before I could get all of my thoughts sorted, she ended our two year relationship, luckily.  On the night after she left me, I watched this film again, and it helped to start putting things in perspective.  I then watched it on each of our aniversaries for three months, and by the last time I had watched it, I had sorted out the entirety of our relationship into one little idea: ""Top 5 words that describe my relationship with @#$%&*"" I wont say what these are, but they were not too kind to @#$%&* This movie could change your life too, especially if you're stuck in a poor relationship, or your relationship is seems frozen in time.<br/><br/>Also, it is a damned hilarious film.

","Best one for me after ""Gladiator"". Because I am a movie geek, I could well understand how music geeks behave.  They tend to stick to the past failures and to be occasionally reminded of past broken loves.  On the other hand, it describes the complexity of love affairs and sentiments in modern and urban life, in particular, for people working in the artistic type of jobs. Owing to excellent script, all personalities are quite lively, and narrations by John Cusack are effective.  Very funny and makes you laugh a lot.  Because there are a lot of music we can enjoy through big screen Dolby sound system, and because we should not miss the funny words and sentences, we had better see this in the theater, not by video at home.  By the way, I recognize John Cusack is really handsome, because he is ""proof against"" many and long close-ups, which occupy considerable percentage of the film.  He is much better than in ""Being John Malkovich""."

"edbritton","Null","0","1","18 April 2001"," great movie but probably not for everybody
","I've seen this movie probably a total of ten times and certain scenes in it around a hundred.  To me this movie gets better every time I see it.  In my opinion it's a very well made movie about relationships and the way that people get through them.  I think that the director and screenwriter did an excellent job transcribing a very British book into an American tale without losing any of the great dialogue or characterizations from the book.  To those who saw this one time and panned it, I'm sorry you missed the things that others got from it but you know it's not for everybody, but might I suggest watching it with an open mind a second time.  Having worked in a record store for most of my adult life I loved the way that the music fit into every scene and how it wasn't used just as background filler but in some ways was actually a character in the movie.  Not as well used as in Almost Famous but close.  Anyway suffice to say that I think this is a great movie that makes good use of it's characters and the music that many of us who saw the movie love.  Cheers to Nick Hornby for writing a great novel and to Stephen Frears, John Cusack, Jack Black and all involved with the movie for taking such care in adapting it.  Thanks for making a movie that record store geeks can call our own"

This analysis is going on on the back of a split up with Laura, who is No.5 in his all-time hardest break-ups list (I told you he was anal!).<br/><br/>John Cusack and the whole cast are excellent, the characters well observed, the script full of laughs and emotion.

"Brogan","Null","0","1","31 March 2000"," In the top five of Cusack's best films.
","HIGH FIDELITY is a film that asks the question ""why?"" when a relationship breaks up.  It shows on why is it when a man loves a woman, then only to have a woman show up with another man, making the previous man heart-broken.  I know how he feels, there are times when I find that one girl that I find special, then the girl tells me that there's another man in her life, and I always wondered what the girl was doing when I wasn't around her. In the new Stephen Frears, the character of Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is pondering and asking himself on what is wrong with him, where did things go wrong?  Rob just broke up with Laura (Iben Hjejle) and Rob tells Laura that he isn't even hurt, that her break-up didn't even make his top five of his most painful break-ups.  Then Rob tells the viewers his most painful break-ups in the past.  One is the striking beautiful Charlie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who left Rob for a handsome model.  The other is Sarah (Lili Taylor) who leaves Rob for another friend that she had.  Rob wacks his brain and is searching for the reason on where did he go wrong in life to have these women break up with him. Rob doesn't really get any help from his co-workers at the used record store that he owns.  There's Dick (Todd Louiso) a shy and timid man who is the sensitive man in the story.  Then there is Barry (Jack Black) the wild and arrogant man who only likes to help customers who listen to good music. While at the store, Rob is wondering on why the girls keep leaving him, Barry keeps picking his top five different categories of music.  From top five ""side 'A' songs"" to top five ""death songs."" So Rob goes on his own personal trek to find the big mystery on what went wrong with his past relationships. The trouble is that time is running out for Rob, since Laura has just moved in with her neighbor Ian (Tim Robbins), a spirtual yuppie who believes in inner-peace. Well, like every other reviewer, I'm going to give you my top five reasons on why to see HIGH FIDELITY: 1.) JOHN CUSACK- he is one of the best actors working in Hollywood today.  He is so energentic and convincing at times that you can understand his frustration.  This is one of Cusack's best films, I would say his top five films are: 1.)GRIFTERS  2.)SAY ANYTHING 3.)BEING JOHN MALKOVICH 4.)BETTER OFF DEAD 5.)HIGH FIDELITY  And just like Cusack's character in BETTER OFF DEAD, Lane Myer, he goes through the entire movie thinking about what went wrong. 2.) REALITY OF CHARACTERS- the people portrayed in this film are pretty much the people that you would see on the street.  There is the wild and roudy person like Barry, the quiet and timid Dick, the goddess like person who stands above everyone Charlie, the spritual and inner-seeking self help yuppie Ian, and the sensitive and gentle Laura. 3.) REALITY OF SITUATIONS- the way you see the events happen in this movie seem like it can happen in real life.  Like a man seeking his problems in life, and how many albums can the store sell if they play the music through the store. 4.) SUPPORTING CAST- the supporting cast in the film is great!  Jack Black is funny and wild as Barry, Todd Louiso is also good as the sensitive Dick, Joan Cusack is also enjoyable as Liz, who tries to help Rob, and Iben Hjejle is impressive in her American debut as the girl the Rob wants back. 5.) THE FOCUS ON MUSIC- being the younger brother of a serious music lover, this film does talk about music!  The music topics range from the soul and blues hits from the 60's. The classic hits in the early 70's, the techno pop hits of the 80's like Echo and the Bunnymen and Jesus and Marychain. And the English hit bands of the 90's such as The Beta Band and Stereolab.  I was very pleased to hear and discussion about serious music, instead of music that is only played on hit radio stations, and music that is by a popular artist from the past who is still making new music. I did enjoy HIGH FIDELITY a lot, it's not a laugh a minute comedy like the ads make it out to be.  Word of advice: never believe what the ads show you for a movie, you'll either be disappointed or surprised on the movie.  FIDELITY is a good romantic drama with some nice comic bits thrown in.  Like Cusack's other great romantic/drama SAY ANYTHING, this is a film that will be talked about and mention in years to come. What also surprises me is how did Stephen Frears direct a movie that is so similar to my older brother's life, fascinating. ****1/2 (out of five)"

"sbox","3","0","7","27 March 2001"," Cusack's Shtick is Wearing Thin
","WARNING:  Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>John Cusack has been portraying the nice, cool, yet loveless underdog, for almost twenty years.  Enough!<br/><br/>Yes, these films work on a basic level.  After all, they are formula tested and proven.  However, I'm enraged when I see such films garner wide critical acclaim. The reason is because the storyline of these films are the result of dumpster diving for old material.<br/><br/>Let's take a look at Mr. Cusack's similar films.  They include; ""The Sure Thing (1985),"" ""Better Off Dead (1987),"" and ""Say Anything (1989)."" I am sure I am leaving some out but I think you get the drift.  John Cusack has made a good living out of being the nice guy seeking a nice girl.<br/><br/>""High Fidelity"" is no different except to say that even at thirty something, nice guys have trouble meeting nice girls.  Perhaps so.  However, I find it troubling to grant such movies some deep meaning mandate.  This is not ""Dr. Zhivago.""  Peppering the film with pop culture and anti-pop culture music references may be ""hip"" with some generation x-ers, who seem to love this kind of crap (see also ""The Wedding Singer""), but it does have real limitations, which Mr. Cusack reached long ago.  Alas, a paycheck is still a paycheck, and folks are still driven into delirium by the bozo formula. The lonely Cusack in the night rain might drive you nuts if you notice how abused it is in this movie.<br/><br/>I was impressed by Jack Black's performance as the die hard devotee to the cause of ""music appreciation.""  The viewer see's that Black's character, Barry, is going to love the eighties and the past to the death.  Barry is meant to be the juxtaposition of Cusack's character.  While Barry is content to wallow in the past, Cusack seeks to gain a future.  Unfortunately, Barry is funnier and more believable.  This is because Cusack's real dilemma is not whether or not he will look to the future or the past.  Rather, he only worries if he will find true love.  I could care less if he ever does or doesn't and neither should you.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this film is hopefully the end of the John Cusack unloved puppy series.  Jack Black delivered well and he has a bright future in film.  I rate this rot at three out of ten."

Something that did bother my remotely was the fact that his Laura was blonde (in the book she was a brunette) and that Charlie was a brunette (in the book she was a blonde). Other than that I loved it! Especially the parts in the video store and his burst out towards Laura's new boyfriend. Like I mentioned earlier they had changed a lot of things for an example one of the girlfriends on his breakup list, that he didn't visit his parents and that he didn't meet the couple with horrible music taste.

The last years he specializes himself in roles in which the character starts to doubt his lifestyle (the killer in Grosse Pointe Blank and the puppeteer in Being John Malkovich) and he seems to be born to play this character.

","A sweet and wickedly funny tale of Rob Gordon (John Cusack), a struggling music store owner who deals with his two assistants: Barry (Jack Black), who is basically a nutcase and Dick (Todd Louiso), who is the opposite and presents himself as quiet and easygoing.  Rob, Dick, and Barry spend their days in the store, constantly talking about any type of music.<br/><br/>However, Rob is emotionally crushed when his latest girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), dumps him for Ian (Tim Robbins), a quiet man who has the appearence of a neat freak.  When Ian comes into the store one day and talks to Barry, Rob, and Dick in a calm manner.  Each one has a fantasy of their own which consists of verbally chewing out Ian and scaring him away or beating the living daylights out of him.  I must admit that scene made me both laugh and cringe for a short moment.<br/><br/>""High Fidelity"" marks the reunion between Cusack and the British director, Stephen Frears (""The Hit""), who made ""The Grifters"" in 1990 with Cusack in one of the lead roles.<br/><br/>John Cusack is great here and in some scenes, he talks directly to the screen about some of the real-life facts in Chicago, where the film was made in, but the novel by Nick Hornsby was done in London.  Chicago and London look very similar even though both cities are in different countries.<br/><br/>Besides Cusack, there are some great supporting performances turned in by Black and Louiso, who seemed more interesting out of the duo.  Hjejle is solid here as the girlfriend.  Catherine Zeta-Jones (Traffic"")and singer Bruce Springsteen appear here in cameos.<br/><br/>Composer Howard Shore conducts a solid score and the photography by Seamus McGarvey is simply brilliant.<br/><br/>""High Fidelity"" may be one of Cusack's best films and those people who head the Academy should do themselves a big favor - give Cusack an Oscar."

Look no further than the adaptation of Nick Hornby's ""High Fidelity"".<br/><br/>Yes, they moved it from London to America. Yes, they took a few liberties with it too. However, if you loved the book you *will* enjoy the film too. Cusack is superb in the role of Rob, doing for this film what Colin Firth did for ""Fever Pitch"" - another great adaptation of a Hornby novel. His early mid-life crisis is terrificly well done, the ""to camera"" asides are used well and don't become wearing and the gorgeous Iben Hjejle should really go on to much bigger things after her believable and touching portrayal of the long suffering Laura (by the way, I originally though she was Robin Wright!).<br/><br/>A good film for anyone who can appreciate a good rom-com, or for those that like to laugh at the frailty that is the male ego. - 7.5 out of 10"

I had no expectations, but this movie was cute.  Possibly John Cusack at his best.  I am a huge fan of characters that narrate directly to the camera, so this movie was great in that aspect.  Hilarious scenes in the record shop.  Jack Black is awesome. Great story.  Every thing that John Cusack's character says is so true and insightful.

I like John Cusack a lot, but his desire to set this movie in Chicago made me think he didn't care about the book like I did.  Well, I was wrong.<br/><br/>This movie is awesome.  The acting is excellent, especially from the three main characters: our friends in the record store.  My favorite character in the book is my favorite in the movie, the obnoxious Barry(played by Jack Black).  He is horribly uncaring, but funny, musically knowledgeable but snobbish.<br/><br/>Most people will be able to identify with these characters whether they had read this book or not, but for those folks who have read the book, the movie is still a pleasure.

When renting this movie, I never in my wildest dreams thought that this would be rated with a ""9""!   I didn't expect such a dramatic but yet comedic life of a guy that is like almost every other guy.  A guy (John Cusack) that is looking for that perfect girl, but never seems to find her no matter how many women he goes through, but then he realizes that he has the perfect woman and it is already too late.  Yes, this movie is crafted around music and the love of it, but the greatest thing I got out of watching this movie was look at something you have and really take a look at how special it or they really are, before it is too late to get it back."

"jjordan","Null","0","1","24 January 2001"," Great movie, better book
","When this movie was first released, I avoided seeing it because,  having read and LOVED the book, I was sure they wouldn't do it  justice.  My brother-in-law convinced me to rent it and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>It really is a great movie, however I still think I would have liked it better had I not already read the book.  The problem I had with it is that throughout the book, you get a running stream of conciousness of what's going on in Rob's head.  While they tried to recreate this to a point, it was only possible TO A POINT.<br/><br/>Otherwise you would have had Cusak standing in front of the camera talking to the audience for 85% of the film.  What brought this home to me was that I watched the movie with my wife who hadn't read the book and she was finding it hard to fully relate to Rob.  Eventually I realized, that was because the book does a much better job of letting him provide justification for his actions and attitudes without minimizing his flaws.  In the movie, many of his flaws appear to be those of a self-absorbed boor without giving the other side of his character.  Having said all that, the movie really is entertaining and the cast is tremendous from top to bottom.  And as a record collector myself, I found the soundtrack and discussion of obscure records (even those I've never heard of) very authentic and enjoyable.  And as several others have written here, if you have a choice, rent the DVD for the extra scenes and the interviews.  Many of the scenes stand alone.  My particular favorite is the scene where Rob and Beverly D'Angelo (as Too Tan woman) ""reverse-haggle"" over her spite sale of her errant husband's record collection.  Overall, a solid 4+ out of 5."

"andynicholas_uk","10","0","1","10 January 2001"," Could I be more enthusiastic?
","Often movies of famous novels often fall short of the expectations of the reader. This, however, is undoubtedly not the case with this particular movie. As with the novel, we start with Rob, (John Cusack), discussing in monologue with the camera  about his top 5 breakups. This device works well, and gives the audience plenty of food for thought as well as laughs throughout the film, as he deals with his job, his employees and his own conscience.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the plot is hardly stretching of the imagination, but that isn't the point. It is a phenomenal insight into the mind of modern man, (yes, I too identified with aspects of the lead!!!!!!!!). The script, despite transferring to Chicago from London, loses none of the humour and the wit of the book. Punchy and filled with laughs, you will never be looking at the watch. Indeed, many of the jokes are picked up on only at a second viewing. The acting is first class. The numerous cameos, (most notably from Tim Robbins), all dovetail nicely with the lead, with Cusack giving another reason why he is the best actor in Hollywood at the moment. But, above all else, Jack Black is incredible as Barry. Give the man an Oscar now! The direction is fluid, with the backdrops of the city mixed in for good measure. In fact, there is nothing not to dislike about this film.<br/><br/>In an impressive film year, this beats all comers. See it now! If you have, see it again!"

","Are we miserable because of the movies we see, or do we see those movies because we are miserable?<br/><br/>This is definitely a DVD to own.<br/><br/>I read a lot of the comments here, and especially cracked up at the person who walked out half way through and wondered why Rob didn't ""bitch slap"" his obnoxious employee.  Hey, it's in there - you missed it.<br/><br/>Okay, this movie is like a dose of Gertrude Stein - you get a layer of an emotion, and then another way gets brushed on, and it *IS* more about setting a mood and defining characters than telling a linear story.  But, if all you have a taste for is linear stories, you would find this movie a little frustrating.  Like, ""the characters don't DO ANYTHING"" - they don't take dramatic action.  They kind of live day by day.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a chick flick for guys.  A guy movie without gratuitous violence or gratuitous nudity (although tiny bits of both).<br/><br/>Is it merely a remake of Annie Hall (with hipper music)?  I'd say it's a deeper exploration into the breakdown of the male psyche during the examination of a string of failed relationships, which only part of Annie Hall was about.  Annie Hall actually had a little about Annie Hall.  I felt Laura really remained an enigma to Rob - we don't get to see inside her head, but we get to really see inside his head.  Rob wants answers, and Laura doesn't give them.<br/><br/>That this movie works to build sympathy for flawed characters (both Laura and Rob) is one of the charming aspects.  You are witnessing people in their own self-absorption, which doesn't everybody have at some point in their life?<br/><br/>Here are my Top 5 reasons for purchasing the DVD:<br/><br/>1. You want the bonus deleted scenes, I think there's 9.  I feel 2-3 are throwaway's, 2 were probably cut because they talked down to the audience, and 1 was probably cut because it reveals too much of what's in Laura's head.  But, the rest are gold - should have been in the movie.  It's like I want to edit them back in.  Make my own ""compilation movie"".<br/><br/>2. You want to turn on the subtitles at some point.  It's the quickest way to catch the overlap between the dialog going on and the music/lyrics playing in the background.<br/><br/>3. Nice to have Frears and Cusacks interviews in the Bonus material.<br/><br/>4. Okay, this is a reason the DVD sucks: You have to Chapter skip previews for ""Mission to Mars"", ""Deuce Bigalow"" and ""Scream"" before the DVD Title page shows up.  I think it's lame to put anything before the Title on a DVD.<br/><br/>5. You want to watch it again...<br/><br/>I didn't see this movie in the theater because I thought I had to be qualified to understand obscure musical references and I thought it was completely about tracking down former girlfriends without the injection of the hilariously dysfunctional system of the three folks working at the record store.<br/><br/>I loved this movie; it was a riot.  But, it's a 9/10 because near the ending it really felt a little like ""divine plot device intervention"".  But, not your typical pat Hollywood ending - that's probably why this movie runs a little longer.  You look at your watch, you THINK it's over..."

","Who marketed this film?  They oughta be shot!  This movie looked like a definite ""wait till video""-flick based on the trailer and the marketing campaign.  It's amazing how Hollywood can make a terrible movie like ""Vertical Limit"" seem good and somehow totally miss with an excellent movie like High Fidelity.<br/><br/>I saw the movie when it came out several months ago but I wanted to leave my comments on this website...<br/><br/>What I remember most about this film is John Cusack's effortless performance.  And when I say effortless, I really mean ego-less.  I love an actor that is willing to honestly portray a guy that doesn't know it all, that doesn't have the great looks, basically able to play a human being (by the way JC is a good looking guy but he doesn't have to look his best). Actors have huge egos and sometimes that's all we get to see on the screen instead of the normal guy the writer intended to be on the screen.  John was amazing.  And when an actor does this good, you can't imagine anyone else playing his part.  Kinda like Forrest Gump, who else could've played that character other than Tom Hanks?<br/><br/>The writing was top notch.  It could've easy fallen into cliche.  It succeeds dealing with cliches but it never allows the cliche to be the entire punchline.  It goes deeper.  Frankly, it dares to be honest.  I believed all the goings on in this film.  Wow, I totally related to the scenes when John's character revisits his past.  For example, it was such a great moment when John's character says regarding one of his old girlfriend's:  ""How did I delete all of this?""  If you've seen the movie, you know what scene I'm talking about.  Purely amazing and so true!<br/><br/>Finally, the proposal was done so well.  Wow, how refreshing.  It was honest, well acted, no big score coming in telling the audience what to feel.  Such good movie making...<br/><br/>One last nod... the record store was truly authentic.  I learned about another facet of life because of this movie.  The filmmakers took the time to do it right.<br/><br/>Great work... and maybe it was meant to be insider pick.  Just like the record store itself.  It's not a pop movie.   This is a rare, hard to find-type movie, the kind that the only the clued-in people know about.  I'm not cool but I was lucky enough to stumble onto this movie.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is one of a kind."

","In reading reviews for ""High Fidelity"" I've come across many people who have said something to the effect of ""This book is about me!"" or ""I identify with so much of what Rob (John Cusak's character) goes through.""  Well, just so I can get it out of the way, This movie is about me""<br/><br/>Based on Nick Hornby's book of the same title, this rendition is stirring, well thought out, well acted, and subtle.  So few times in movies do we get to hear character's really talk to each other, much less hear what they are thinking.  This is a role in which Cusak could have gone horribly wrong, but instead he fills the role with a touching sense of frailty while still putting on a mask of masculinity and machoism, and, if you think about it, that is what your twenties and thirties are all about. <br/><br/>

","Just glancing over some of the reviews in the papers, it looked as if High Fidelity was going to be a pure comedy.  The trailers didn't give away anything in the movie - it ended up being a pleasant surprise.  The humour in the movie is the same style you'll find in Grosse Pointe Blank.  John Cusack plays the boy-who-never-grew-up really well.  The entire movie is one, long monologue, but it's spaced out well with humourous interludes and completely unexpected situations.  I was also glad to see Joan Cusack as one his co-stars.  Definitely a good watch: just enough comedy to keep it interesting and a touch of romance to let you walk out feeling good."
"toclement","6","0","1","5 January 2001"," Nice music lover geekiness coupled with a lousy love story
","Some movies you see, after you think about it a bit, you like it even more than when you left the cinema.  With others, the more you reflect upon it, the more you become cognizant of its flaws.  For me, High Fidelity' falls into the latter category.  <br/><br/>Of course I was drawn in by the setting of the story: a guy around my age obsessively into music running a vinyl record shop in Chicago.  But below that somewhat romantic surface is a really tepid love story about two people who I had difficulty mustering any concern for.  The mind- boggling happy ending is unconvincing, to be polite, and intelligence insulting if I think about it more cynically.  Why is John Cusack, a nerdy record store guy in love with this dull yuppie?  And why is John Cusack, a nerdy record store guy so boring?  <br/><br/>The film is full of interesting characters, all of whom are peripheral, but the principal players, John Cusack and Iben Hjeijle couldn't have been more regular, normal, and dull yuppies.  Perhaps that makes them quite realistic as most cool' people are indeed quite normal' under the surface (especially as they start pushing past 30).  Fine, but that doesn't mean I have to like a movie about people like this, does it? <br/><br/>
It's still probably worth seeing for the musical references (if you're into that) and for the exceptional supporting performances by Todd Louiso & Jack Black (playing Cusack's nerdy record store employees - they are infinitely more interesting than Cusack, both the actor and his character), Tim Robbins (who plays the annoying new age hippie guy to perfection), as well as John's sister Joan Cusack (who plays the hot-headed best friend of the female lead).  <br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, but it just lacks much soul, especially regarding the main love story plot.  6 out of 10."

Great cameos by Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor.  Anything that three of those five want to do a cameo in is worth thinking about.  The bits for all five were great. 3.  Music.  I probably teetered on the edges of some of the excesses of music the main characters indulge in.  There was a broad selection of music by different eras.  Don't expect to hear too many obvious songs though - no Beatles, no ""Free Bird"". 4.  The music geeks.  A couple of great supporting characters.  If you saw the performance by Jack Black near the end of the movie, it probably raised your rating of this movie by a full point. 5.

Arty, change of pace, can be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Things to hate: I don't fully agree with all of these, although I see the point of view of those who don't.<br/><br/>1.  Rob Gordon.  Cusack's character is an immature jerk.  I don't consider that a fault of the acting or the writing. 2.  The music and the music geeks.  A lot of the music is obscure, and our heroes are snobs. 3.

Maybe it is just his whole list mentality.  But, we are a generation of media references.

And he uses music to try and understand why he has problems in love.  The title of the movie hints at this.

Sure, there are some funny moments, like when John Cusack is confronted by Ian, the new boyfriend of his OLD girlfriend, and he plays through several increasingly hilarious ways he could deal with the confrontation... but primarily, Hi Fidelity succeeds in Cusack's portrayal of a lonely man that searches for resolution to his ""top five all time WORST break ups"", including his most recent one with Laura, played wonderfully by Iben Hjejle. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is great, and lots of great in-jokes and references to classic pop, rock, and soul artists abound. Jack Black's role as Barry, the slobby, but savant-like record store employee, steals the show when he sings a very soulful rendition of Marvin Gaye's ""Let's Get It On"", and look for Sara Gilbert in a bit part as Anna, a customer who connects with the timid Dick, played by Todd Louiso."

","It's a cop-out, and it has no dramatic structure.  John Cusack plays Rob, the unappealing protagonist who owns a record store and loses his girlfriend to his own apathy and fear of commitment;  he maybe is too believable in the role, and I ended up resenting him almost as much as his girlfriend must have.  By the time the ending rolled around, I was left with no one to root for, and no conflict to resolve except the non-dramatic one in Rob's head. (The film, incidentally, starts over about three quarters of the way through, stranding the viewer in Rob's neuroses -- how much fun is that?) There are a lot of likeable moments, especially when Joan Cusack is on-screen, but there's nothing to hold you, unless you identify with the protagonist -- which a lot of guys must.  It's also dismaying to hear the screenwriters name-checking bands from Serge Gainsbourg to Stiff Little Fingers.  It goes far beyond demonstrating the characters' erudition.  It's there to divide the audience into the hip and unhip:  ""street cred."" 4/10"

All the actors gave excellent performances.  I personally don't know any characters like the ones portrayed, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.

","HIGH FIDELITY (2000)  ***½<br/><br/>Stephen Frears' romantic comedy HIGH FIDELITY is one of the few movies you should see in this crappy year of 2000, full of disasters as HANGING UP and BATTLEFIELD: EARTH. I guess it will be my favorite comedy of the year and will probably figure out on my top 10. One interesting detail is that it doesn't have deep significances and don't blow your mind, but it is certainly one of the most honest films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's superb ANNIE HALL (one of my personal favorites) served as a base for every romantic comedy that was made after it, leaving the sweet aura of the ingenuous (but delightful) films starring Marilyn Monroe, Katherine Hepburn, Doris Day, Cary Grant etc. to focus on more realistic situations (every genre was adapting to that, indeed). It is true that ludicrous and shameful situations were treated as realistic in the 80s' and 90s', but in 1989 WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... followed ANNIE HALL's steps and became critically acclaimed and a box-office hit. Now, more than a decade after WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... and 23 years after ANNIE HALL, HIGH FIDELITY is another perfect example that romantic comedies don't need to be sappy or sentimental. It is not a masterpiece as the 1977 Oscar winner and wasn't a hit as the 1989 best original screenplay nominee, but it has witty lines, great acting, some originality and much honesty, and it is very funny.<br/><br/>Based on the acclaimed book by English author Nick Hornby, HIGH FIDELITY is set in Chicago- and not in London, as in the book. The main character is Rob Gordon (John Cusack), an ordinary man who owns a decadent vinyl shop and has just been left by his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle). He loves music, and sometimes confuses this passion with his love for women. He and his two weird employees are always making top 5 lists of everything related to music. But he decides to make his top 5 of the women who dumped him. While he suffers with his situation and his past memories, he gets involved with a singer and tries to bring Laura back to him- even though she is dating the nasty and weird Ian (Tim Robbins).<br/><br/>There is place for many hilarious scenes- my favorite one is when Ian is talking to Rob at his shop, and he imagines what to do with the rival- and many witty lines as well. The screenplay is clever and very well written and Stephen Frears shows once again that he can do everything- from DANGEROUS LIAISONS and THE GRIFTERS to this film. The cast is full of stars in small appearances- Tim Robbins, Lily Taylor, Joan Cusack and the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones (in her best performance) are some of them. But the real star is John Cusack, who deserves an Oscar nominee for his role. He was incredible in THE GRIFTERS and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and has his second best performance here (the best was in BULLETS OVER BROADWAY). But you have to like him and his character to truly enjoy the film, especially because Rob literally talks to the camera. To make everything better, the soundtrack is great: delightful, nostalgic and feel good.<br/><br/>HIGH FIDELITY is a movie about relationships and (as I said) even if it doesn't have deep significances, it is worthy of discussion. With a realistic view of modern relationships between men and women, all the characters have their importance. Rob is the perfect portrait of the Gen-X guy, with his ideas, beliefs and lots of trouble. Even if the movie doesn't know when to quit in the last 20 minutes, I highly recommend it. It's not very common to watch a romantic comedy that is honest, original, hilarious, ironic, bittersweet, delightful... and romantic at the same time. And it is also something we can relate to (many times I feel like Rob).<br/><br/>As Alvyn Singer says in ANNIE HALL, after he tells a joke about a man whose brother thinks he is a chicken: ""Well, I guess that's pretty much how I feel about relationships. You know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd, but I guess we keep going through it because most of us need the eggs."" Yes! We need the eggs!"

","This is a really funny, well-made, great film.  They marketed this thing very poorly - when I first saw the trailer in the theaters I thought it would be one movie I would be happy to miss.  A friend of mine snuck it into our selection of movie rentals one night, and I was very pleasantly surprised!<br/><br/>I generally like John Cusack, as I am gradually discovering.  I thought ""Gross Point Blank"" was a nice flick, and ""Being John Malkovich"" just blew me away.  This strangely finds it's place in between the two.  I don't know why, but the rhythm of the film is nice, it has many randomly funny parts, it's believable & realistic while being completely outrageous and always enjoyable.  The supporting cast is great, Jack Black stays extremely funny without getting as annoying as the character he plays (if teetering on the edge).<br/><br/>The movie has two central themes: relationships and music.  John Cusack is wonderful as he hashes the two out in his mind, for the viewing audience to see and hear.  I admit, this is a risky film.  It could have easily gone bad - it's a great script that needed the perfect lead and a nice cast to really pull it off.  It does.<br/><br/>A previous comment mistakenly advises the reader that ""Empire Records"" is a good alternative to this film.  It would probably be best to disregard that suggestion completely.  Unlike Empire Records, with which this movie has about two thin cosmetic similarities, ""High Fidelity"" doesn't come off like a bad sitcom with stereotypical, marketing-induced plots and characters. This is one of John Cusack's best movies indeed! it is smart and simple, has a certain subtle charm, a great cast and a witty and relatable script. Enjoy it!"
"Rich B","9","0","1","18 November 2000"," Confused? Commitment problems? Watch this film!
","Personally, I think Cusack is one of the great actors, you always know it's him, there's no disguising that, but you believe everything he says and everything he does, and once again, he does it extremely well. It's easy to identify with this character, or I thought it was. Never having read the Hornby book I found the film very insightful, at times funny and, if you have your girlfriend sitting next to you, sometimes scary. A definite feel good movie, but we all need that, and this delivers but without being too corny or cheesey. A very good film that asks you questions that you've always asked yourself anyway, if you're a guy that is. Yet don't be scared by that statement, it's still a highly entertaining film, with very funny performances from all the record shop staff."

That is, besides the endearing cast, enjoyable sound track, and the fact that it has maintained the same wonderfully clever, and terribly accurate tone of Nick Hornsby's novel, despite slight plot deviations.  What i realized is that this film follows precisely the structure of the best Comedies of remarriage that came out of hollywood in the 30's and 40's.  Every aspect, from the significance of Laura's relationship to her father, to the contented and yet slightly ambiguous ending, falls directly into classic screwball comedy format. John Cusack, while believably portraying his character Rob, also brings with him his presence as a recognizable actor, and the traces of his former characters.  To do so in a way that strengthens the role, rather than weakens it is a difficult task, and Cusack manages it as beautifully as anyone since Cary Grant or Katherine Hepburn."

Eerily similar to a lot of the people I grew up with and the movie is a good satire of what the 30-somethings have turned into. Either the no-lifers or the overachieving, materialistic snobs. It's interesting to see how some recent films have touched on this one way or the other and I hope a true ""Graduate-type movie"" is somewhere on the horizon that will really put this age into perspective.<br/><br/>It's always nice to see some unexpected cameos however Catherine Zeta Jones didn't quite fit in.

Set in Seattle, Director Stephan Frears has made High Fidelity one of the truest, most honest films about modern relationships that I've seen.  Cusack plays it almost as a sequel to Say Anything, his character, Rob, is what Lloyd Doppler could have grown into.  The supporting cast is also wonderful, especially Jack Black and Todd Louiso as his Record Store employees.  My only complaint with this movie would be that with the number of great actors in this movie, people like Joan Cusack and Lisa Bonet (just to name two) had far too little to do (and this isn't even counting the fact that Harold Ramis was actually cut from the movie).

","High Fidelity is an angst ridden narrative comedy about Rob's (John Cusack) bad luck with women.  His girlfriend Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) has just dumped him.  This sends him into a hurricane of self-doubt and introspection about all the most traumatic breakups in his life complete with flashbacks of each of the top five.  While vainly trying to get Laura back, he contacts all the other breakup perpetrators in an attempt to exorcise the ghosts of relationships past.<br/><br/>The film has plenty of funny moments and a high identification factor for single adults suffering through the dating scene.  Director Stephen Frears gives it a Woody Allenesque presentation and does it as well as if had been done by Allen himself.  Though there is not much that is original about the story, it borrows good techniques and ideas from various romantic comedy formats, and melds them together effectively.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me was the main character, Rob.  This was more the way he was written than the way Cusack played him, because I thought the acting was excellent.  Rob was seriously out of touch with his hand in his own demise, which made him seem like a jerk.  His rationalizations for relieving his guilt and sense of failure for past relationships made him a very superficial and hollow character, regardless of the sincerity of his self inflicted torment.  This inability for me to identify with the lead detracted somewhat from a story that was otherwise well done.<br/><br/>John Cusack was terrific.  He was fabulous at licking his litany of self-inflicted wounds, and though I didn't fall in love with the character, his portrayal of this anguished lovelorn puppy was first rate.  Iben Hjejle was also very good as Laura, giving her a sort of dignified confusion as she tried to sort things out.<br/><br/>This film was good and definitely worth seeing, but it didn't send me over the edge.

","Are modern movie romances stuck in a rut?  Even the best ones lately  and `High Fidelity' certainly fits into that category  seem to feature characters who find themselves mired in a kind of fashionable self-centered angst that has simply become too predictable and familiar to sustain much audience interest anymore.  Infidelity, the fear of commitment, the never-ending struggle to find the perfect balance between sex and love  certainly these issues exist in exelsis in real relationships and these movies merely reflect that reality.  Yet, how many times can one watch films built around these themes without eventually becoming as inured and jaded as the lost-souled characters who comprise their worlds?  Could it be that  after years of carbon copy retreads - the romantic film genre has simply played itself out?<br/><br/>Foe my money, the modern romantic comedy reached its apotheosis way back in 1977 with Woody Allen's landmark masterpiece, `Annie Hall,' undoubtedly the funniest and most keenly observant study of a modern day relationship. Since that time, virtually every movie romance has borrowed heavily from that earlier film's style, theme and substance.  `High Fidelity' is no exception.  In this film, John Cusack delivers a high-energy performance as Rob Gordon, a 30-something Chicago record shop owner whose life seems to have come to a standstill.  Not only does he work in an environment guaranteed to keep him mired in the past  his shop sells vinyl records rather than CD's  but his most recent girlfriend has decided to walk out on him because of what she perceives to be his lack of ambition to move ahead in life.  Confronted with yet another failed relationship, Rob decides to go back and contact several earlier partners and discover why it is that he always seems to be left out in the cold.<br/><br/>`High Fidelity' is at its most amusing and likeable when it concentrates on the milieu of the vinyl record shop and the minions who haunt it, and less interesting when it focuses on the romantic travails of its main character. Jack Black steals the film with his hilarious portrayal of Barry, a cocky music snob who would rather insult a customer whose taste he finds objectionable than make a profit by selling the said offender the execrable product for which he is asking.  Screenwriters D. V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg astutely zero in on this strange esoteric world where a person's innate value as a human being is determined by the kind of music he or she happens to like.  The scenarists and director Stephen Frears demonstrate a truly genuine affection for these socially backward losers who have convinced themselves that they alone hold the key to determining musical greatness and  by extension - the meaning of life itself.<br/><br/>It is when the focus in `High Fidelity' moves from background to foreground that the film loses much of its uniqueness and passion.  Rob's romantic obsessions simply mirror those of far too many characters in recent similar romantic comedies.  How many more self-absorbed, whining, commitment-phobic romantic leads can we handle?  But `High Fidelity' borrows not merely its themes, but much of its style from `Annie Hall' as well.  Like Allen's character in that film, Rob often turns directly to the camera and addresses the audience with running commentary monologues that are never quite as witty or profound as the filmmakers undoubtedly intend them to be.  In another example of stylistic cribbing, Frears also occasionally interrupts the realistic flow of the action by intercutting fantasy sequences, one of which involves a guest appearance by none other than Bruce Springsteen himself (shades of Marshall McLuhan's cameo turn in `Annie Hall').<br/><br/>Frears has assembled a youthful, attractive cast for the occasion including Lisa Bonet, Sara Gilbert, Lili Taylor and Natasha Gregson Wagner.  The fact that some of these performers have had very little screen time accorded them in the film obviously implies that they may have signed onto the project as a labor of love.  The same could probably be said for Joan Cusack, but really must she and her brother co-star in EVERY movie together?   I'm certainly not opposed to sibling devotion  but isn't it time they cut themselves loose from this rather strange tie that binds them?<br/><br/>Like so many films, `High Fidelity' tends to concentrate on its majors when its minors are so much more interesting.  It is certainly a likeable enough film - but only when Jack Black is up-front and center stage does it ever really soar into comic delirium."

Both succeed.<br/><br/>""High Fidelity"" isn't really plot or story driven, it is very much an intimate character piece.  I doubt most people are familiar with films like it, and it wouldn't surprise me if some people were put off by the lack of story.

In a movie so completely about one character what better way to learn about him, than to have him tell us everything about him?<br/><br/>The film is filled with obscure musical and pop culture references, funny sight gags, slapstick, dream sequences, and dialogue.

Cusack's frank and candid confessions to the audience about his past girlfriends and the nature of his male bonding with his co-workers make this film an absolute gem.  Expertly directed by Stephen Frears who directed Cusack in 'The Grifters' in 1990 and written by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, Cusack and Scott Rosenberg make it a good collaborative effort.  Original, memory inducing and a great look at relationships, this film will make the lonely rush to find the snakes and ladders of life and this film will become a great cult classic while finding a mainstream audience at the same time.

"Aw-komon","Null","0","1","30 August 2000"," OH! THE PLEASURES OF MASOCHISM! Frears comes up with much more than you might think.
","HIGH FIDELITY-a very funny film and yet quite complex if you're inclined to dig deeper. Go rent it if you haven't seen it people<br/><br/>These comments were written in part while listening to Zeni Geva's `Autopsy Love,' Paper Lace's `The Night Chicago Died,'  Maria Muldaur's `Midnight at the Oasis,' `Soothing Sounds For Baby: 1 to 6 months' by Raymond Scott, and, of course, `Broken Hearts are for A--holes' by Frank Zappa.<br/><br/>'SPOILERS'  AHEAD<br/><br/>Stephen Frears' `High Fidelity' is a multi-faceted analysis through narration (often directly into the camera) of John Cusack's character (Rob Gordon).  Cusack confides to the audience (and not anyone else in the film) certain soul-baring confessions of heartbreak and disappointments suffered with girlfriends over the years, and also how these events evolved in an odd symbiosis with his one all-consuming passion in life: pop music.  Every event in his life is directly accessible to his memory through some pop song he happened to be listening to when it happened.<br/><br/>Rob is not untypical of a certain male type in American society: self-styled, middle-class rebels who create more problems than they solve by rejecting traditional 'straight' alternatives but who are compulsively driven to this behavior by the frustrated 'artist inside' struggling to get out.  These are guys who, ideally would like to be artists (Rob considers his dream job to be any kind of musician except for classical or rap), but barring that would still like to live as close to their ideal as possible--for instance, by owning a record store, writing a music column, or producing a band (as Rob tries to do with the two skateboard-punks who steal from his store).<br/><br/>Rob's relationship with his latest girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) is coming to an end.  Rob is very much afraid of commitment and traditional marriage and rightly so.  The end of freedom to grow (which includes the freedom to associate with members of the opposite sex who could be a source of growth) is the end of creative impulse.  Rob's whole life is a struggle to keep this impulse alive.  This type of person can never be cured by something as anachronistic as traditional marriage or anything of that sort.  It's 'open marriage' or nothing; the freedom to cheat if it comes to that but not wanting to cheat because the main relationship is strong enough.  And where does it get this strength? Well, to a large degree from being 'open,' in the first place, as a matter of fact.<br/><br/>The fact that Rob's cheated and 'gotten it out of his system' during the 'living together' phase will mean very little once the burden of traditional marriage and its prescribed roles falls like a yoke around his neck. Frears implies this throughout the film and, at the end, ONE of the conclusions possible is that for someone like Rob the traditional marriage he's about to get sucked into will have to be modified into an 'open' one; otherwise it will lead to: at best a quick divorce and return to old ways, and  at worst: a dull, long, monotonous life of petty bourgeois pleasures, dishonest and manipulative CHEATING, and, of course, creative mediocrity.  Other conclusions are also possible, of course, because Frears left things ambiguous on purpose.  However, the semi-tragic, end-of-Rob-as-we-know-him, marriage-trap, one-way ticket-to-sterile-yuppie-hell conclusion cannot be avoided just as much as the so-called 'happy ending.'<br/><br/>`High Fidelity' is far from 'square.'  It does not advocate a return to long discredited 'traditional' values as a refuge from insecurity.  It shows the pressures that MAY lead even a relatively nonconformist 'rock 'n' roll' bonehead to become 'square' or consent to living the 'square' or 'straight' life. Frears PUT MORE THAN ONE OVER on the Hollywood geniuses  who financed his venture by giving them their superficial 'happy' ending but very subtly undermining it to create an ambiguous ending.  CASE IN POINT:  The final Stevie Wonder song played during the end credits 'If I ever fall in love I want it to be forever.'  Its lyrics are just as nauseatingly symbolic of conformity as 'I just called to say I love you' which Jack Black so savagely and hilariously criticizes as the symbol of everything he hates.  This song choice is a subtle warning that Rob may be about to embark on a dangerous journey to the land of what he's always hated: a traditionally restrictive marriage.  Frears in no way implies that Rob's marriage will be successful in the traditional sense; on the contrary, if success is implied at all, it is that Rob's marriage will succeed and 'be forever'  only if its terms are kept 'open' as experience has warranted and as Rob and Laura are currently practicing in their relationship.<br/><br/>Neo-hippy, new-age types represent another pocket of conformity that establishment America's created in order to pass itself off as 'liberal,' and tolerant of 'fringe activity.'  But people know a suck-up when they see one, even and especially if he has long hair and an earring.  In 'High Fidelity,' through the character of Ian (Tim Robbins), these 'types' are made the object of as much hatred as 'the middle-aged square guy' wanting to buy the Stevie Wonder song for his daughter.  The fact that THIS is the man Laurie's left Rob for only adds insult to injury.  The scene where Rob imagines three different ways of violently reacting to Ian's 'let's work out our problems' mumbo-jumbo--two of which include 'aggravated' assault--with his buddies backing him up all the way to loud sounds of belligerent hip-hop in the background, always gets the biggest laughs.  It is direct evidence that many people have contemplated delivering 'beatdowns' to just these types of hypocritical, establishment-approved 'non-conformists.'<br/><br/>Jack Black is the John Belushi type actor/singer who plays Barry, one of Rob's two employees.   Barry is a plump, suburban, middle-class, pop-music elitist.  He has a vast knowledge of pop music down to the most trivial things such as the correct title of songs.   He and Rob are in constant competition as to whose taste in music is more non-obvious, original, and hip.  I've seen a number of Barry types over the years, enough to know they're quite prevalent.  They don't necessarily work in a record store. They just think that they're 'COOLER' than other people in their taste in whatever it may be-- cars, clothes, movies, records,  etc., and look down on these others as a way of boosting their own egos.  They have a condescending attitude towards anyone who purchases products of any kind that do not belong on their list of what is 'unassailably cool.'  Barry  is obnoxious and quite demented.  He wears overstated, loud clothing.  It is his way of flipping the bird to people who follow the rules of 'understated fashion.' At different times he is shown wearing a T-shirt with a huge painting of a tiger and a huge picture of Yanni, the new-age 'composer' whose atrocious music he cannot possibly like, except as something to laugh at. When Jack displays his superb singing voice towards the end of the flick, becoming an instant 'stud,' we are taken by surprise. Frears exposes the folly of being too quick to judge and label someone.<br/><br/>Dick is weird and shy and speaks in a very odd, labored way that irritates Rob.  But because he is a nice guy, Rob cannot do much about it, except try to politely cut-short their conversations, before they become long, irritating monologues by Dick.  Dick is the kind of guy that most people think would find it hard to get sex.  That is why later in the movie when he finds a girlfriend, Barry is taken by surprise and makes fun of him. Barry says what the audience has been thinking for the whole movie.  How does this guy ever get banged being that weird and shy?  Well the answer is:  he finds a weird girl who appreciates his weirdness.  When Barry tells him to `smoke that a--' it is hilarious precisely because it is hard to imagine Dick having normal sex, much less the suggestively passionate kind of 'smoking that a--.'<br/><br/>All three white record-store guys (Rob, Barry, and Dick), take a liking to a beautiful black pop singer named Maria De Salle (Lisa Bonet) and lust after her.  There's very much a racial tension here of three white guys lusting after a black prize. Later in the movie when Rob sleeps with Maria De Salle very quickly and unexpectedly the tension is nicely and abruptly released. The tension is there because most Hollywood films do not feature any sort of interracial romance and people have been programmed not to expect it without 'complications.' Latino actors like Jennifer Lopez are still the absurd racial middle ground in Hollywood films ( Raquel Welch, another Latino, and not Faye Dunaway  had the first interracial scene with Jim Brown in '100 Rifles' some 32 years ago and things haven't changed much).   Both George Clooney and Wesley Snipes get to have Lopez , but Wesley Snipes and some lillywhite actress like Michelle Pfeiffer or Sharon Stone? Not likely in good old Tinseltown.<br/><br/>I couldn't care less about any of this racial nonsense, held over as if we were still living in the '50s, but it's the pathetic truth about Hollywood practice; and they constantly impose this racial nonsense on society, preventing enlightenment, causing regression.  Art is after all, not just a reflection of society but also the precursor.  The drivel that comes out of Hollywood adds up and becomes a precursor of general societal attitudes. The ultimate taboo in racist Hollywood is still the black man sexing the white woman, and they can't claim to be honestly reflecting society since it is not uncommon in society; therefore they're just  imposing their biases and creating more tension than what would naturally exist and forcing people to look at interracial romance as 'problematic.'  In 'the Bone Collector,' for instance, there is a very poetic scene where Angelina Jolie is very much attracted to the paraplegic Denzel Washington and while he is asleep, feels up his hands and arms.  They cannot have sex, of course, because Washington is paraplegic.  At the end of the movie it is implied that they have become a couple but it's never made explicit. In 'He Got Game,' the woman played by Milla Jovovich was a hooker and Washington, a newly released prisoner! Always trust Spike Lee to know where his bread is buttered, but to  take precautions not to offend too much (knowing that black women have been programmed to be insecure about that sort of thing and that some could be expected to complain, there's no question in my mind that Spike was (c. or u.c.) going exactly for JUST THAT MUCH controversy and no more--what other reason would he have to make the hooker white?).    I don't even want to talk about what Spike was trying to stir up with the ridiculous `Jungle Fever.'  `Zebra Head' was a much more realistic version of 'Jungle Fever' and  'Angel Heart' had some weird chicken blood subtext about god knows what (Mickey O'Rourke and the same Lisa Bonet?!).<br/><br/>Hollywood is still stuck in that racist 'Love Connection' mentality that gave airhead-central MTV the chance to gain prestige by completely debunking it.   Until Tom Cruise recently decided to break the taboo in 'Mission Impossible 2'  there wasn't a single Hollywood film I know of that treated interracial romance as an irrelevant, pseudo problem.  Frears isn't new to this game, he has featured interracial romance before (Sammie and Rose Get Laid).  Frears joins Cruise (the true power was in Cruise's, not Woo's hands) in showing up 'the race barrier' as the  psuedo problem that it is. He shows Rob and Maria meeting, finding many things in common, and having sex without giving a single thought as to WHO is going to think WHAT of them.  These are the liberated people much more common in society than Hollywood and Spike Lee would like you to believe.<br/><br/>Cusack's subperb portrayal gives us an in-depth tour of the whole phenomenon of guys like Rob.  Most guys of his age group have at least a few things in common with him and some more than a lot.  Some may even feel the same way about life in general and choose to follow Rob's way.  I don't share Rob's views on many things, but I could definitely identify with his situation and understand him as a REAL person.  I certainly wouldn't react the way he does, but I do know where he's coming from.  The irony is that Rob, of all people, should've known that 'Broken hearts are for a--holes,' as Frank Zappa so aptly put it on `Sheik Yerbouti,' but apparently he still couldn't help being an a--hole and torturing himself!  Oh! the pleasures of masochism!<br/><br/>One final note, and I just have to say this--Catherine Zeta-Jones--god damn! She plays a girl who's supposed to be shallow and 'who talks s--t all night,' but there never was a shallowness more intelligent, sexy and soulfully exotic than that which comes out of ZJ's gorgeous lips.  It's very easy to see why she is 'the answer to all the world's problems' for any heterosexual man  from here to Katmandu; and no matter how much Rob tries to rationalize it away, no male member of the audience is fooled for a second. Stupidity shows through much more than the words a person utters, through body language and tone of voice for instance, and ZJ's are too refined and exquisite to be mistaken for stupid.   It should be quite obvious that all this was fully intentional on Frears' part in order to mine for ambiguity and also turn the camera on the audience.  Frears' uses ZJ as a demonstration model to emphasize how similar us guys in the audience are to Rob when faced with having to interpret the mysteries of the 'femme fatale.' Our only way out of total bondage is a similarly inane rationalization of her 'superficiality.'<br/><br/>When a little later,the music-critic character played by Natasha Gregson-Wagner is introduced, this rationalization doesn't work.  She is almost as good-looking as ZJ but in addition she's 'intelligent' (on the film's own terms anyway)  and a seemingly perfect match for Rob.  So Rob now being defenseless, has to run back to Laurie and ask for marriage.  He sees this as the only way to avoid endless temptations; whereas the real problem lies in the fact that his relationship with Laurie is only beginning to show signs of strength.  This strength has been created through the 'open' attitude they've been practicing of late and is much more likely to be destroyed (and create ever stronger temptations to stray) than safeguarded by a traditional 'closed' marriage."

","""The movie ain't about geography"", or so I read in an interview with Nick Hornby recently, commenting about how the movie version of his book has been transposed from London to Chicago.  There were cries of ""it won't be the same!"", but High Fidelity does not suffer at all in the transition to the backwaters of this particular American city.<br/><br/>High Fidelity is primarily about Rob (John Cusack), a music fanatic and record store owner who embarks on a spiritual journey to find out from his five former loves what exactly it is about him that precludes a long lasting and meaningful relationship.<br/><br/>We are introduced to these former flames via the movies use of ""Top 5"" lists - in this case the ""Top 5 All Time Rejection List"".  The pursuit of the entries on this list forms the backbone of the movie, against which the characters interact.<br/><br/>The other main players are the introverted and extroverted pair of fellow record store employees, Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black).  Both are great foils for Rob, to me portraying the alternating sides of Rob's personality.  On the one side is his desire to be a a popular ladies man, and on the other side is his quiet nature, spending time cataloguing his record collection and making complilation tapes for friends.<br/><br/>High Fidelity uses the technique of having the main character Rob talk directly to the audience.  This is not only used, it is used a *lot*.  If you don't like that sort of address straight to the audience, you will not like High Fidelity.  Most of the time it works, but after a while you just want him to shut the hell up.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of course is a standout, trawling the 60s thru 80s for its gems.  Well worth a listen.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed with this movie.  It didn't seem to ""click"" as much as I thought it would and should have.  Cusack is probably a bit miscast; too much of the trademark Cusack pauses and pouty lips get in the way of good characterisation.  Having said that it was still good entertainment, although it was perhaps about 20 minutes too long.  The end part with the band CD premiere and the tacky ""store employee in supposedly crappy band turns out to be really good after all"" bits did break the flow and appeared tacked on.<br/><br/>Good entertainment helped by a great soundtrack and solid support performances.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

","Nick Hornby's novel ""High Fidelity"" is one of my favourite books, both for its sense of humour and its wonderful insight into the workings of the male mind. Because of my fondness for the novel, I was apprehensive about an attempt to film it, and positively dismayed when I discovered that the setting had been transferred from London to Chicago. It seemed such an introspective, essentially British story that I feared the change of cultural context would distort it beyond all recognition. Happily, my fears were unfounded. Those involved in the adaptation seem to have shared my love for the book; they have transferred its essence, faithfully and skilfully, to an extent I would not have believed possible.

I am of the opinion that you really should know a little bit about a film before you go to see it. It bothers me that someone could vote this film so poorly when it is clearly such a success...perhaps they had it confused with some boorish teen comedy.<br/><br/>'High Fidelity' is a fantastic example of the romantic comedy genre; unpredictable and edgy, believable characterisation and intriguing narrative structure.

Even if you don't fall into the intended age category this movie is a must."

","John Cusak is Rob Gordon, a record nut aficionado who owns a vintage record store in Chicago.  Rob's store is a carbon copy of every music/vinyl nuts salvation.  The movie is told through Rob's narration.  Many times he speaks directly into the camera right to the audience.  He is telling us his life is a dismal failure with relationships and that is what the movie is essentially about.. Rob's relationship screw-ups and that he is a failure.<br/><br/>One thing Rob does is classify everything into top 5 lists.  He then proceeds to talk about his top 5 break ups of all time just as we are introduced to him and see his current fiancée leave him.  We are also introduced to other characters in his life particularly 2 people who work at his store.  Rob hired them to work in only 3 days a week but they drop by EVERY DAY to work and talk shop cause they have no life other than talking about music.  Rob can't get rid of them, particularly one guy who is so uppity with his taste in music, that he frequently insults customers tastes who come to the store with his elitist music attitude.  Thinking Rob is somewhat cursed he decides to revisit what happened to the other top 5 in his life to find answers, and perhaps but his soul at ease.<br/><br/>This movie is a total riot.  You will TOTALLY recognize all these characters as someone you knew or currently know in your life, and that's one of the movies greatest successes.  The characters are so real as they talk about, love, loss, rejection, money, sex etc This movie also has some hilarious scenes, one in particular that is SO funny that I thought I was going to die in the theatre.  The audience was just HOWLING!!!  I can't tell you what it is you have to see the film.<br/><br/>Also the flashbacks of Rob that are shown are great particularly when he is in college during the 80's.  They had the style of the decade down perfectly (even though it was a very small part in the film).  Also it is probably the best movie that deals about relationships that I have ever seen.  Every guy can relate to Rob and his experiences with other women.  I certainly know that for a fact being through what Rob went through as well.  Also a good friend of mine had the exact same thing happen to him with someone he was living with.<br/><br/>This is one of the few movies that I have seen that shows what relationships really are.  They are complicated, they are NOT simple.  There were very few faults I could find with this film.  The only one that I felt somewhat was that it seemed a little long.  Tim Robbins, and Catherine Zeta Jones also make some good cameos.  And the movie has the coolest ending credits I have ever seen in a film.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this is the best movie I have seen this year so far.<br/><br/>Rating 9 out of 10."

","I can't believe I almost did not see this movie!<br/><br/>I read a critique in a Sydney newspaper which called the movie pretty lame and unrealistic (""why would a woman stick around with a guy like that in the first place?""). I guess the particular writer must have been deaf and blind. Hey, I am all for equal opportunity - but as a movie critic?<br/><br/>
I did finally see it (almost being dragged along by friends) and spent the next 2 hours trying gasping for air because I was laughing so hard. Besides being funny (the description of the high society around Chris aka gorgeous Catharina Zeta-Jones almost saw me on the floor), it is also a very musical movie (as if the title wasn't a dead give-away) but even more so about typical men in our times and their troubles with relationships, love and sex. Men beware, from time to time you will recognize yourself in this piece - and you will not like it!<br/><br/>On the other hand the whole story, the whole movie is centered around John Cusack - he not only acts (fabulously as usual I have to admit), he also directs and writes bits of it. Just my luck that I happen to like him :-) That does not mean that the other actors are mere ornaments - his two side kicks in the record shop are brilliant, as is his (ex) girl-friend, ex being what this movie is about. <br/><br/>She leaves him, and even though he tries to cover it up, tries to play it down, it hurts him more than anything before. At the beginning we ask ourselves with him: what is so special about her? But as the movie progresses and she keeps showing up getting her stuff from their apartment, we learn to appreciate her, and more and more dislike our main character for loosing her. But hey, this is a movie with a couple of twists, and in the end ... but see for yourself. Definitely recommended."

","Everything about this movie made me feel good about myself.  While i have not read Nick Hornby's novel, the story seems to ring a real brutal truth to it.  Setting John Cusack as the main character was brilliant, as he is king of the ""I screwed up my relationship"" movie.  The movie centers around his love for women and music and how he struggles to get over the most recent girl that he has lost.  The film almost seems like a documentary, Cusack talks to the camera, like an actor on a stage speaking to the audience.  He makes top five lists of everything from painful breakups to the best songs about death (which sounds morbid, but really isn't). Being brutally honest about how men deal with emotional pain is what makes this movie good.  There are enough comic moments in the film to make Cusack's depression not so bad(the movie is a comedy after all).  Jack Black is also very good as the most obnoxious employee ever.  This film also has the greatest 80's soundtrack ever made, and I'm going to buy it for sure when it comes out.  In my top five movies of 2000 as of 3/18/00, High Fidelity is #1."

","Having seen Fever Pitch I never thought anything written by Nick Hornby would be made as an American film - not made well anyway! However, when the same team that wrote, directed, produced, etc... Grosse Pointe Blank signs a deal to turn Hornby's book about infidelity in a record store you know it's in some of the safest hands it could be. I say that but this film represents John Cusacks Production team's proof that Grosse Pointe Blank was not a fluke. High Fidelity is an excellent film. Well scripted, excellently acted, particularly by the supporting cast and well directed. Actors talking to the camera can sometimes seem uncomfortable but John Cusack carries it off in a style that feels natural to watch. The same though cannot be said of Iben Hjejle (Laura), she is acting in a foreign language but sadly for large portions of the film this makes her appear wooden. This is only seriously noticeable in a couple of scenes but with so many good actresses around I can't fathom how she got the part. She certainly is no Minnie Driver. Catherine Zeta-Jones also seems an odd choice for one of Cusack's former loves. She plays the part well enough but there's something not quite right, she's just miscast I feel. It's hardly a laugh a minute but it's a darn sight better romantic comedy than the average Hugh Grant flick. It is though, in the record store that the film comes to life where Jack Black and Todd Luiso play Cusack's long time muso employees. To call Black a scene stealer is like calling the Saturn V Moon Rocket a firework. All that a great slimy cameo by a ponytailed Tim Robbins. Watch this movie, even if you're not on a date. If John Cusack hadn't done Pushing Tin I'd have though he could do no wrong, 2 of the best movies of the past 12 months have his name above them. This is not as good as Being John Malkovich but it is a good movie nonetheless."

The modern day world is presented well,with a mix of modernism, and older, more lived in areas that perfectly characterizes the real urban world.

And then there is the film and I'm glad to say that it is, without doubt, far greater than the sum of its parts.  If characterisation is important to you then don't miss this movie.  Each character is beautifully developed over the course of this film and by the end they all  despite their many flaws  seem like old and loved friends.  As for the films examination of the human condition then you merely have to look at the list of names above and in turn look at their previous outings to understand why and how this film has no problem in delivering an exceptional story.  My first thoughts on leaving the cinema was that this is a modern day Alfie' and this I think is a pretty fair tribute.

"The Masticator","Null","0","1","25 July 2000"," Campaign: Cusack to be in every film ever
","Thank god Nick Hornby sold his book to Hollywood and the action was moved to Chicago. If we had tried to keep ""High Fidelity"" in Britain, some dreadful couple like Ewan McGregor doing his ""accent"" and Sadie Frost doing her ""acting"" probably would have been cast and it would have been a horrible mess. In the capable hands of Cusack and co though it's mostly a delight, a genuinely funny, realistic comedy about relationships - which is the point of the book, not the fact that it happens in a certain place. It's themes that are important here.<br/><br/>Rob (John Cusack) addresses the camera a lot, which is OK because it's done without any self-consciousness and Cusack is a likeable presence. He also addresses his (ex?) girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) a lot, which is not OK, because she is awful. He gives all the reasons he misses her at one stage and it rings utterly false because Hjejle is barely even one-dimensional. She's going to have enough trouble being successful in English-speaking cinema with that name, and being useless as well... It's a shame.<br/><br/>Apart from Hjejle and the ever-irritating Catherine Zeta Jones, the casting is spot on. Jack Black and especially Todd Louiso are inspired as Rob's desperately sad record-shop colleagues. Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor and others flit in and out in blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos, adding to the picture with their understated but rich skill. The standouts are both named Cusack, though; Joan puts in sterling work as usual while John is simply terrific. Considering he is in almost every frame, not once did I get tired of him.<br/><br/>A few of the book's details have been kept, which will make British audiences feel like they're in on a secret - like none of the first names changing, so you've got people called Ian and Barry and Liz in an American film, which you don't often get. But the real achievement is in the screenplay, which gets laughs - big, genuine laughs - without resorting to jokey jokes and one-liners. It's real dialogue and real people, the humour comes from the situations and the characters - and it's up there with the best examples of this that I know, ""Withnail & I"" and ""Swingers"". And, to be fair, ""Grosse Point Blank""; although this isn't as good as that John Cusack masterpiece, it's pushing it. These two films prove Cusack is one of the finest and most interesting A-list actors working today.<br/><br/>Funny, heartwarming, real, a top-notch comedy. Those moaning about changes from the book should be ashamed of themselves. Stop it. You know who you are."

","High Fidelity is one of those rare movies that offers equal doses of humor and despair. Rob, played by John Cusack is trapped by his past rejections and failures, especially those involving the opposite sex. He explains his past by addressing the camera often which is reminiscent of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. <br/><br/>After breaking up with his current girlfriend, the two employees at the record store that he owns are the only people that offer consistent companionship for him. These two unusual individuals are, like Rob, seemingly going nowhere in life. Although he appears to only tolerate them, these two employees are a sort of surrogate family for him.<br/><br/>
The screen play, acting and directing are all very good in this picture. There are times when the movie is laugh-out-loud funny and there are other times when the desperation and despair of the characters is evident and felt by the audience. All of the main characters grow and advance during the course of the movie, and it has a reasonably good resolution. I would recommend this film."

","In High Fidelity, John Cusack plays Rob - the 35-ish owner of Championship Vinyl, a second-hand record store in Chicago. He's just been dumped by his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle), and proceeds to recount to us his Top 5 hardest-to-get-over breakups to try and understand where he's going wrong. But first he poses a conundrum - do I listen to pop songs (which are mostly about heartbreak) because of my failure in love, or am I failing at love because I listen to too many pop songs?<br/><br/>Like the Nick Hornby novel it's faithfully based on, High Fidelity is smart and funny, and gives an intelligent insight into how men think and feel when it comes to love. It's full of sharp characterisations, with a perfect Jack Black and Todd Louiso as Rob's obsessive and opinionated store employees, Lisa Bonet playing singer Marie DeSalle, appearances by Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones (uncredited) and Joan Cusack (NOT playing Rob's sister!), and a cameo by Bruce Springsteen. The writers (and four are credited, including Cusack) took a risk transplanting (what seemed to be) a quintessentially British book from London to Chicago, but they've done it with care and carried it off.<br/><br/>This is a labour of love for Cusack (who also co-produced) and it's the best work I've ever seen him do. He talks straight to camera a lot of the time and he's so earnest, so enthusiastic that I found his incarnation of Rob impossible to resist.

While his girlfriend, Laura, has changed since they met (from a young punkish lawyer to an older more sedate one) Rob has never progressed, never grown up.<br/><br/>Some liberties were taken with the book - apart from the plot moving from England to Chicago, which changes one of the more important subplots. (Rob meets an American singer in the book, and her American-ness is crucial to what happens.)

Unable to figure why he keeps failing at love he decides to contact the women involved in his worst break-ups and ask them to answer his question ""What is wrong with me?""

Funny, intense, quirky, and generally likeable he appeals to many viewers, and this role is no exception.  Rob is a composite of many guys I have known (including me) and rings true: the quintessential confused post-breakup male who is not yet cynical enough to abandon all hope of finding the perfect person, but ego-bruised enough to try and ""fix himself"".  Whenever the soliloquies or subject matter are getting too heavy, Jack Black steps in as the comic relief pinch-hitter.<br/><br/>To say that Barry  -one of the eclectic employees at Championship Vinyl - is frantic is a gross understatement.

And as a screenwriter, he impressed me very much with ""Grosse Pointe Blank"".  So I went to see this film with very high expectations.  I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>""High Fidelity"" struck a particular chord with me because I have never had a relationship with a woman last more than eight months before I get dumped (well, I'm the dumpee at least 90% of the time anyway).  But you don't want to know about me, just what I think of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a thoroughly funny film about being dumped, and being a slacker (having once lived in the Hyde Park section of Austin, I know all about the latter, too).  Cusack plays Rob Gordon, a record store owner in Chicago whose girlfriend Laura has just left him.  He spends the film brooding as to why he is always getting dumped by women, usually for other men.<br/><br/>Particularly hilarious are the folk-comedy duo Tenacious D as Cusack's loser employees who spend all their time insulting would-be customers and making top 5 lists.  Also worth mentioning is Tim Robbins in a cameo role as Laura's new boyfriend, who instigates one of the funniest scenes in the film.<br/><br/>The film is flawed to a certain degree, Cusack spends more time talking to the camera than to other characters.  While I don't mind that device, using it too much is a bit distracting.  Also there is the fact that Iben Hjejle as Laura is just plain flat.  And the ending is just a little to perfect, happily-ever-after for my taste.<br/><br/>But the pro's of this film drastically outweigh the cons.  I rated it an 8 out of 10."
"giesam","Null","0","1","3 June 2000"," Hooray! Hollywood Twenty-Somethings show some maturity!
","High Fidelity was a beautiful film. I saw it in a rundown bar/theater with awful sound and plenty of the kind of people it portrays. Being a young vinyl enthusiast with a elitist streak, I appreciated this film more than others might. However, let me say that the wit and wisdom of this film go far beyond the specialized subculture that spawned it.<br/><br/>John Cusack is the perfect listless loser unhappy with his life (especially where relationships are concerned). BUT no cliches here- this is not a romantic comedy. In fact, it is neither romance nor comedy, but something entirely different (I don't know exactly what). The romance in the movie is not based on infatuation, mutual respect, lust or any other common basis for Hollywood romance. Hang in there, disappointed moviegoer, because this film delivers an insightful look at relationships, a look that by the end of the film borders on mature and broaches the subject of long-term commitment in the real world!<br/><br/>The laughs in this movie are clever, (Tim Robbins and Bruce Springsteen both have cameos that made me smile, and Rob's two sidekicks were very convincing as snobby but lovable rock intelligentsia. Also, Rob himself is almost pitiful enough to be laughable at times, particularly in flashback scenes.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the storytelling format. The top-5s were very creative. Anyone who pretends to know anything about pop music or culture will be challenged and impressed by the dialogue, and you are sure to leave the film impressed the John Cusack's ability to smoke a cigarette with STYLE!<br/><br/>If you don't like action movies but loved ""Fight Club,"" and hated ""There's Something About Mary,"" if you consider yourself ""clever"" and make less than 40k a year, or if you need advice on relationships, please, I beg of you, SEE THIS MOVIE, preferably with a panel of cynical pseudo-intellectuals in a run-down apartment. It's a blast!"

","If you don't know much about music, you might feel like this movie is a bit of an inside joke.  But if you do know a lot about music, this movie is perfect.  Plus, it's hilarious.  In the sequence in the record store with Ian, I laughed harder than I ever had at a movie.  The record store clerks are so great, Todd and Jack play off of each other so well.  And (drumroll please...) John Cusack.  He is such an awesome actor.  Every facial expression, every line was perfect.  I just can't say enough about this movie.

","An excellent movie about the dysfunctional love life of a vintage record store owner (John Cusack).  Some great characters in this flick, especially his two workers at the shop (Jack Black was very, very good!). <br/><br/>
Catherine Zeta-Jones has a small, almost insignificant role; Lisa Bonet has an even less significant (and odd) role -- neither added much to the film. Timothy Robbins had a small but eventful role.  <br/><br/>But a fine job by newcomer Iben Hjejle as his current love interest, Laura, and by John Cusack himself.<br/><br/>Terrific sound track.

","I just saw ""High Fidelity"" tonight for the 2nd time and must say I like it just as much as the 1st time - or more.  I laughed my head off all over again.  The moment I heard ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" in the first scene I was hooked.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of the book and must admit I was originally very disappointed in the change of location from London to Chicago (for various reasons) but for the past year I kept saying if anyone can pull this off it is John Cusack.  I cannot imagine anyone else in this part.  Not only John, a great cast all around.<br/><br/>Great soundtrack too, and that poster .... brilliant!"
"cottrellpj","10","0","1","1 April 2000"," Triumph for Cusack (and Hornby)
","John Cusack nailed it. He had the sense not to mess with the written word, the primordial text and the result is brilliant. Sure, it's in Chicago rather than London and I'll quibble a bit about the casting of skeletal Lisa Bonet as Marie, but ""High Fidelity"" is a pleasure from start to finish. The audience really enjoyed it on opening night, but it is a very literary movie, with a lot of words in it, so it took the crowd a little time to warm up. Of course, I knew all the words, because they were lifted verbatim from the novel.<br/><br/>The balance between Cusack's soliloquies to the camera, the uproarious scenes in Championship Vinyl and the dramatic passages with Laura is handled well by director Frears (though it's hard not to see this as Cusack's picture from top to bottom). This is also a star vehicle for Jack Black, who chews the scenery very effectively. In true obsessive fashion, I may head back for a matinee this weekend to keep the buzz going. Anticipate several more soundtrack releases and strong ""word of mouth"" box office. If there's any justice (and there just might be) this will bring Nick Hornby's novel to a whole new audience. Maybe Cusack should be handed the reins to ""About a Boy"" as well (though Hugh Grant's lined up for that one, by all accounts).<br/><br/>This is the ""intelligent"" date movie of all time. But as someone once said, men had better be careful...High Fidelity contains too many of your secrets!"
"Sailor-21","9","0","1","23 April 2000"," Thoroughly satisfying
","As I browsed through the comment posted on IMDb about this movie, it occurred to me that many of the people commenting are quite as fierce in their views about movies as the record store guys are about records.<br/><br/>First off, as I was born before WWII got under way, the musical references throughout the movie meant absolutely nothing to me.  That's a statement of fact, not a criticism.  I was able to just enjoy the movie, without having to bother my head about the technical musical stuff.<br/><br/>The movie certainly passed my threshold test of any movie - whether it induces suspension of disbelief.  The characters were thoroughly credible, and the story line held my attention all the way.<br/><br/>The characters were all beautifully drawn and likeable.  I found the Charlie character interesting.  She's more stunning than anybody has a right to be. Us guys just have no defences against anybody that gorgeous.  We just want to throw ourselves at her feet.  So it was very satisfying to see that she's just a gorgeous but shallow facade after all.  Serves her right!  I also liked the subtly steely undertone in the Laura character.<br/><br/>The Barry character was masterfully drawn.  Mr. Relentlessly Knowledgeable himself!<br/><br/>I thought that the looking-into-the-camera bits were done just right.  I gave a little groan when this first happened in the movie, because those bits don't usually go down right for me.  Even a voice-over narration such as Spacey's in American Beauty (a much-overrated movie, by the way) doesn't usually work for me.  But here I found those bits just right, fitting in well with the overall consciously self-conscious nature of the record store gang.  And what a nice thing to say about anybody, as Rob did, that the second best thing he liked about Laura was that she had character, because when she was having a bad day she didn't take it out on the people around her!  If somebody were to say that about me, I'd marry her on the spot!<br/><br/>If I have one criticism of the movie, it's that it drags just a tad towards the end.  The bits after the funeral of Laura's father weren't really necessary.  They added nothing to the story or the characters, except for the surprise about Barrie's stage presence - and I'm not sure I find that aspect of Barrie's character plausible.  (Can you be a relentlessly knowledgeable self-centered vinyl geek and also a performer who has the gift of sharing himself with an audience?  I think not.)  I think the pacing of the movie would have been better if Rob's realisation that he loved Laura had followed smartly after the affectionate sex-in-the-Saab scene.<br/><br/>All in all, a thoroughly satisfying movie - nicely scripted and nicely played.<br/><br/>BTW, I think it's grand that IMDb has a spell checker for these postings.  I get thoroughly annoyed every time I read mis-spelled rants on the web, and Lord knows there are enough of those.  If we're going to rant, let's at least rant literately!<br/><br/>And hey - even a new window for the list of mis-spellings, so that we can easily flip back and forth between our mis-spellings and our text.  I'm impressed!"
"BigGuy","5","0","1","20 April 2000"," Who is this movie for?
","That question kept going through my mind as I watched this movie.  Because while it had its funny moments, overall the mood was rather dark.  This is definately not a date movie, and most guys seeing this without a date would just feel more bummed about not having a date.<br/><br/>I will say the ending brought the movie back from being bad.  It is enjoyable, especially the music, but not great."
"taproot","7","0","1","1 April 2000"," ""Call me shallow"" but it's still a romp.
","John Cusack is one of my better choices to watch in a film; it must be his Irish genetic string, or perhaps it's simply because he is one hell of an actor.  I'm old enough not to recognize many of the songs played throughout this film, but not old enough not to still appreciate people with a passion for music. Cusack owns a record shop, accompanied by his zany (great characters) part-timer helpers. But Cusack is more interested in why his girl friends are, and have been leaving him. And we get a glimpse of his top 5 more painful separations.  There is quite a plethora of beautiful women and much narration in this film, but John Cusack does it so well, that the narration becomes comfortable.  Tim Robbins plays a minor role and performs quite well.  It's a film that is enjoyable, not heavy, and if you're in a good mood to see fluff, but fluff done as well as fluff can be done, you may enjoy this film too."

"jorel1114","Null","0","1","14 April 2000"," I love this movie
","Who of us in the world, as men, have not experienced what John Cusack's character has gone through in this film.  Sure, we may not have had as many women, or maybe we've had more.  But we all know where he comes from.  We use pop culture to get our ideas across when our words can't.  We dream of being around exotic panties all day and night only to realize that women do have special sexy pairs that are too uncomfortable to wear on normal occasions.  We shudder to think of the better sex they are having with their new man.  We yell and scream in the rain calling them all manner of profanities but we still want them back.  We have long lists of things we miss about them and we know full well that any list of things that we miss about them would mostly be a B.S. attempt to coax ourselves into thinking this is for the best.<br/><br/>In addition to the relatability of this film, it is also hilarious, well written, cast and acted and being a Chicago boy it is a plus to see all of our fine locales on screen.  So to anyone who has ever been dumped for reasons too stupid to understand, for all those who have discovered their girlfriend mostly wears plain cotton underwear that is faded and covers most of her butt, for anyone who associates with people who know a little too much about movies or music or tv and being incorrect in their presences is a mortal sin...THIS IS YOUR FILM"

John Cusack has always been a favorite of mine ever since Say Anything (one of the best movies of the 80's) and I try to catch every movie that he is in. Not only is this funny as well as poignant, but it stands out in the way of its writing and character portrayl. His employees, especially Jack Black, are hilarious."

","This movie had a lot going for it. I didn't dislike very much. I also didn't overly like a great deal. That means I rate it in the upper 7's, but rounded to an 8.<br/><br/>John Cusak was quite good. I loved his two employees - especially the arrogant one. They were great and added tremendously to the story.<br/><br/>The ex-girlfriends were all well played. Who wouldn't want to see Zeta Jones even if it was a relatively small part?<br/><br/>Overall, it is a romantic comedy. Possibly a little harder edged than some and a little less on the feel-good romance angle that characterizes the genre, but ultimately, that is what it was. Usually, boy meets girl and they fall in love and live happily ever after. In this, boy loses girl and attempts to recapture her heart."

","In a nut shell: Liked it. If you're any kind of fan of Cusack, you'll love it. If you're any kind of fan of ""Chicago"" flicks, go see this movie, it's going to be a classic Chicago flick.<br/><br/>Long form review: I loved the book. LOVED IT. So I was a bit disappointed that they'd changed locations from London to Chicago. There were some other changes -- about one really big change and quite a few not so -- but it did capture the feel of the book. There were holes, however.<br/><br/>Cusack was great, in both his interactions with the other actors and his forth-wall breaking 'chats' with the audience. It worked because he understood the character almost too well. I had a difficult time laughing most of the time because the movie reminded me that I've been a great big a*****e over the last year (okay, my whole life), but it is amazingly funny.<br/><br/>Todd Louiso and Jack Black were intensely amusing and reminded me of people I know, which is what their characters did in the book. Black's turn as Barry was offensive yet somehow still likable, not an easy thing to do.<br/><br/>My real bitch is the soundtrack, the one that everybody seems to love so much. It is good, but it's the one change from the book that I can't leave alone. There just wasn't enough soul and classic r&b and don't get me started on the meager inclusion of a mere single Elvis Costello song... I think the soundtrack was updated for a younger, much 'hipper' audience, but it really took something away from my enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>But that's just my problem. All in all this was a great film, a real 'instant classic'. I just wish that it had been a more complete adaptation."

The actress who played Laura is new to me and I really enjoyed her acting ability.<br/><br/>I believe that this film and its context relates to almost everyone's relationships.

"Scrnwrt1","10","0","1","11 April 2000"," The first great film of 2000 - a top 5 fave!
","Being a John Cusack fan to begin with, I went into HIGH FIDELITY expecting a good John Cusack flick, but hardly one with much depth or social significance.  Upon leaving the theatre, I was dumbfounded by what I'd just seen.  After losing a night's worth of sleep thinking about the movie, I concluded that in my estimation it was one of the greatest true-to-life character studies of all time.<br/><br/>HIGH FIDELITY's excellence begins with the amazing cast of talent, starting at the top with John Cusack.  Cusack was not an actor portraying Rob Gordon, he WAS Rob Gordon.  His range was fully explored in this film, from outstanding comedic timing on par with some of the greats, to a hidden sensitivity and vulnerability in relationships to which so many of us can relate.  Not to mention the perfect execution of his monologues to the audience.<br/><br/>And then the list of wonderful performances runs down the list from Jack Black and Todd Louiso, to Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joan Cusack and alas Tim Robbins.  Though not a stand out, Iben Hjejle was convincing as a woman who would be worth falling in love with.  There was not a single character in this film that, at one point or another in our lives, we have not met ourselves.<br/><br/>The writing is superb and the soundtrack, as expected, is fantastic.  A beautifully shot film as well, it's worth paying to see it on the big screen.  It's a bit of a travesty that so many people are missing out on seeing this movie - bringing it in at a very modest 8th on the box office top ten - but don't let that fool you into thinking it's not worth your eight bucks.  Stephen Frears and John Cusack have turned out an Oscar worthy film.  10 / 10  (or, #1 on the top 5 list)"
"Ladyhawke","8","0","1","10 April 2000"," Relationship Honesty (for a change)
","The best thing about this movie, apart from the always enjoyable pairing of John and Joan Cusack is that it portrays a much more honest view of modern relationships then the average film. It shows that people can carry baggage from adolescent events and if they're not understood then they can cause problems in later life. Rob Gordon is a refreshingly cynical character who manages to maintain his romanticism, and his girlfriend, Laura, played by Iben Hjejle, is a delightfully true character who doesn't just melt and fall back into Rob's arms where other female romantic leads would have. Though it may appear to be a 'typical' romantic comedy from the trailers I say give this one a chance, it is multi faceted and if you don't relate to it on one or more levels then I'd say you're one of the lucky few who's never had your heart broken without understanding why. In which case I'm not sure if I am jealous of you or sad for you."

I had a similar feeling of mild discomfort as when I read ""The Magus"" by John Fowles.  Both that book and this movie explore the narcissism of young men - the latter much more humorously.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this isn't necessarily just a comedy.

John Cusack is great as always in the lead. His character Rob personally takes you on a tour of his funny and failed romantic history. The record store owner Rob constantly loses at love due to fear,bad luck and his own bad behavior. Even though he is jerky you find yourself rooting for him get out of his own way and succeed. Danish actress Iben Hjejle is strong and beautiful as Rob's latest girlfriend who leaves him in the movie's opening. This starts Rob on his tour of history and self-awareness. Jack Black and Todd Louiso are very funny as his two ""employees"" at the record store. They do their best (or worst) to insure that the record store never see's a return customer. Look out for a large number of cameo appearances by a very talented and very famous supporting cast. I had good time and the rest of the preview crowd seemed to like it too. It's attitude is male, but all should enjoy."
