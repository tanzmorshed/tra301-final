"MR_Heraclius","8","50","55","23 February 2020"," Another great film in the MCU
","I always thought Captain America was a corny ""golden age of comics"" superhero that had long passed his expiration date. I was shocked by how much I liked him in his first film. I was delighted to grow to like him even more in this one. They set up the character beautifully in the first movie, but he explodes as a hero here. It's hard to fault the character or this movie. Not just the MC, but the whole cast was well written and acted here. The action is well directed and tense. Battles feel much more real than most Marvel battles. There was much less obvious CGI than most films in the franchise, and it pays off. This is one of the best Marvel films to date. Lightning in a bottle. A highlight in the MCU."
"TyRawrrnosaurus","9","367","501","23 March 2014"," A Thrilling Sequel that Raises the Bar for Marvel
","With Rogers, Fury, and Romanoff previously established, directors Joe and Anthony Russo do a magnificent job at expanding these characters – along with some secondary characters we've seen before – providing more depth to understanding their actions and how they will affect future stories. Sam Jackson has a stronger presence this time around, validating Nick Fury as a main staple in the MCU among the big boys. Captain America is stronger, faster, and a more refined soldier, equipped with better fighting skills and understanding of current technology. Evans plays the earnestness of Captain America's black and white morality with convincing finesse in an age of grey that he has yet to find a comfortable middle. And Johansson progresses the allure of the cunning and multifaceted Black Widow, while bringing a splendid and lively balance to Rogers' straight and narrow.<br/><br/>Amidst such a tight and clever script, The Winter Soldier introduces a band of new characters, all of whom play a significant role, creating a more layered and conceivably real MCU. Frank Grillo brings the swolling mass of muscle known as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Brock Rumlow to life. Emily VanCamp surprises with her portrayal of Agent 13, whom I wish had more screen time with Cap than just two quick scenes. Robert Redford plays Alexander Pierce, a superior ranking Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., friend to Nick Fury, and representative of the World Security Council. Pierce is a wonderful look into the higher ranks at S.H.I.E.L.D., contributing new insights as to how the organization is run outside of Fury, Agent Coulson, and Agent Maria Hill. Anthony Mackie is Sam Wilson aka The Falcon, an ex-military special-ops paratrooper and a welcomed addition recruited by Rogers to help fight the good fight. Mackie fits comfortably among the cast of veteran actors and should play nicely with the other Avengers.<br/><br/>Enhanced for combat and strength, The Winter Soldier's presence is terrifying when it comes to any action scene. Sebastian Stan does an amazing job holding his own against his targets and those who get in his way of his missions. My only gripe is that it is not explained how he obtains the immense power and skills he beholds. The connection between Rogers and The Winter Soldier is dealt with true care and excels the story of Captain America from the first film brilliantly. (Be sure to stay after the credits for a nice button leading into Captain America 3.) <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is not just a fantastic sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, it should also be recognized as one of the best sequels ever made. In fact, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the duo behind Thor: The Dark World, the Narnia Trilogy, and The First Avenger, have done such a great job shaping Captain America's story that this movie could almost stand on its own. There are many exciting twists and turns in this well-constructed, political action-thriller, but nothing comes as more of a shock than how important the story is at defining the direction of the MCU. What takes place in The Winter Soldier, along with an awesome mid-credits sequence tie-in, will inherently influence Avengers: Age of Ultron as well as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. – which should make the TV series a lot more interesting and reward fans who have stuck by its side.<br/><br/>Tonally, The Winter Soldier is the darkest story we've come to encounter, raising many deep-seated questions about government and soldiers of war while also taking Rogers on an emotional journey. It also has the best action choreography among all of the MCU movies thus far. Whedon's NYC battle in The Avengers is beautifully shot and written, but cannot compare to the hard-hitting set pieces found in The Winter Soldier, each building up to the bigger whole. The Russo brothers come from a background of directing television comedies such as Arrested Development and Community, and it's extraordinary how well they handle a big budget action blockbuster from cinematography to pacing. They do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than Stan Lee, functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story. Henry Jackman (Captain Phillips; Wreck-It Ralph; X-Men: First Class) also composes an adrenaline pumping score that sets the right mood every time.<br/><br/>The biggest fault found in The Winter Soldier is that it does not address the whereabouts of other heroes or where we are in terms of the time line of the other movies. Why can't Captain America call on Tony Stark to help him out or even Hawkeye who is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. himself. This is a recurring problem we have seen throughout Phase 2 of the MCU in Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Marvel Studios needs to acknowledge this hiccup if they want us to continue to believe all of these characters live in the same universe together. You cannot exclude these characters once you have opened Pandora's Box.<br/><br/>Marvel Studios has hit this one out of the ball park with yet another gripping adaptation for fans to enjoy for years to come. By and large, Captain America: The Winter Soldier succeeds on all fronts. It is the perfect set up for future films and at the same time it increases the value of its predecessors. There is little to argue against its merits and should be regarded as one of the greatest superhero movies of all time."
"arnohardwell-41638","10","8","8","27 April 2020"," Maybe the best MCU movie
","The fact that I rate this movie with 10 is not an exaggeration. This particular movie I really consider to be the best of MCU as the character development, the story, the action scenes, the direction and many more details still shock you.It could be said that this is a political drama with a strong Marvel dose in it. The dialogues are also excellent and careful written as well as the casting.
I understand that many other movies like Infinity War, Avengers etc. are considered by most to be 'better', but if you watch this specific movie twice or more, you will realize that you are facing a masterpiece in all respects. In most parts of it, you think that you are in the movie and you feel that you are experiencing the emotions of the characters. In my humble personal opinion, I will repeat that Captain America: Winter Soldier is a masterpiece and will always be my number one Marvel movie."
"fear_da_fro_bro","10","431","630","21 March 2014"," A wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film
","This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well...<br/><br/>What I love about the character is that Steve Rogers has ""I'm-a-man-out- of-time issues"" but he's comfortable with the chaos that it brings. In acclimating himself to this century he is at his best. Yes, most people would be overwhelmed but because of who he is and where he's from, he's able to cope and adapt. The serum that gives him his physical edge also gives him a mental boost. It's his emotions that are raw and unaided. Time has passed since Avengers so we don't get to see his day to day amazement and adjustment. I'm glad they skipped that stuff. What we do see is the man who once represented America and has become alien to America and it's slanted values. The passage of time. Add those struggles to a full blown conspiracy film and what results might just be the best film released all year long.<br/><br/>Steve Rogers is basically a John Wayne American. The world shifts to him and it's his job to tell everybody ""Here's they way things should be done."" We saw that in Avengers and even the first film after he gathered his Howling Commandos. Now, the powers that be are a lot more flexible in terms of loyalties and how they're going to get certain jobs done. How he handles this century's gray morality is at the heart of the film.<br/><br/>Like most men from the 1940's, Steve keeps things to himself and keeps his emotions bottled up. (EX: the first film when he mentions his mother dying of TB and he was even embarrassed when Peggy found him mourning alone for Bucky) So, bringing The Black Widow in to this film gives him someone who is going to draw out his story, because he's never going to offer it up of his own accord. Natasha learns from him. Fury learns from him. Sam Wilson learns from him. Yet, they all give him something in return. Every character used is utilized perfectly and smartly. Falcon for example, is not in awe of the legend of Captain America. This is exactly what Steve wants in a friend and in a fellow soldier, to not have to be Captain America. Everyone fits perfectly in to the plot and allows access to different beats, tones and emotional depth. Yes, conspiracy thrillers need depth and this one has it.<br/><br/>Captain America is probably the only superhero left in this world of the reboot who is singularly heroic. He doesn't have this dark existential quandary like other reinventions. Plugging that resolute goodness into a morally complex story means he doesn't question what he believes, but he questions whether anybody else does anymore. He doesn't question his foundation but he questions where he has ended up and what his role must now be. The conspiracy element and structure of this story helps in that Captain America is not up on a pedestal being self righteous, he's in a corner and that makes you want to root for the guy. He believes in what he's doing and the viewer is along for a great ride sharing that belief.<br/><br/>Marvel movies usually establish character early. This one starts out fast but it's got a lot of character in it. The first act packs a punch but does it laying the groundwork for a remarkable third act. They take time showing the issues and you immediately empathize with Steve. Giving us good character depth means the action delivers more punch. And the action here is beyond great. This movie absolutely punches you in the face in the best way possible. The action has advanced a lot from the first film. How he now operates in the world and kicks butt is all very impressive.<br/><br/>So, this is probably Marvel's grittiest movie and it's also their best sequel to date. There's a dash of humor but there's mostly a wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film."
"Sahl_95","10","355","532","25 March 2014"," Pure Awesomeness
","Went into the movie not expecting much as I felt that the first Captain America was one of the weaker movies in Phase one of the Avengers. However, this movie was one of the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>First off, the action and fight scenes in the movie are just awesome and there is plenty of action to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. There is also enough humour to balance all this. The characters all had their own amazing moments and the acting is decent as well. You get to see more of Nick Fury, and he was awesome in this. Black Widow is used much more in this movie and as well as being badass, she brings out more of the Captain's story. Sam Wilson (the Falcon) is great and is involved in some great action scenes. The villains in this movie were awesome as well.<br/><br/>Quite enjoyed the story as well. There were a few twists; some unexpected, some expected. And the reveal of the unexpected twists in the final third were epic. The story is not just about Captain America and the Winter Soldier, there are darker forces at play and causes the Captain to ask dangerous questions.<br/><br/>This movie is very entertaining, the story is decent, the ending is awesome and satisfying and I would recommend watching this. Makes for a decent political thriller as well. This will easily be one of my favourite movies."
"doomas10","10","295","449","27 March 2014"," Brilliant film!
","Now ""The winter soldier"" is everything a Captain America movie should be. While it maintains some of the humour that now has become the trademark of Marvel films, TWS is way more serious than all of them combined. And this is truly where the film feels so brave and yes different than any other superhero flicks that we have seen. <br/><br/>Which brings me to the most important point, the plot. While of course it is not going to be the most original or complicated film of the century, there is the basic screen writing elements that so much lack from modern day blockbusters. You have the (likable) characters and a mystery they need to solve along with a racing clock. It reminded me the 70's political paranoia thrillers (3 days of the Condor - another Redford link, The parallax view, Z) and it is a welcome tone that makes the WS to differentiate itself from the rest. There are strong scenes regarding political fear, control, and information manipulation but it never feels bloated or overbearing. the purpose is to entertain even if it manages to squeeze through a bit of political views with Rogers replacing the viewer's voice on screen. At one point there is a talk about who is who which results in every man for himself mayhem in one of the most interesting sequences that you may see this year. We do not get this stuff these days!<br/><br/>Besides the charged plot, the introduction of new characters and the mega mayhem in the streets of Washingthon DC, the Russos have found time (and they should bloody do since TWS is 2 and a half hours long!) to inject some sentiments in the proceedings - a visit to Peggy, a confrontation with Fury regarding SHIELDs actions, Bucky's memory recall, Natasha's kissing talk. They could have easily skip these ""crap"" but instead the extra running time feels adjusted and coherent with a bit of more characterization which results to bring us closer to the on screen counterparts. <br/><br/>However, the action is what took me by surprise. The bar has been set higher now. It is truly unbelievable to think that these two directors (of the ""Community"" fame) came with such inventive ways of using Cap's shield. Finally, the shield gets to be seen in all of its glory. In addition, all the fist fights (and they are many) are excellent examples and putting the glasses to the school of frantic edit (which I truly despise) with varied and rapid choreography. A terrific elevator fight sequence probably stands out as truly memorable whereas the encounters with the Winter Soldier never feel repetitive. The Russo brothers keep changing the game from stealth and cloak missions, to car chases, to gun fires, to dog fights, to fist fights. There is something for everyone here and it is arguably among the finest I have seen. Impressive considering their credits. Real stunt work (backflips, wrestle moves, somersaults, etc), real fights and it is a pleasing sight to go away from superhero duels of the Avengers, Thor and Iron man. These characters rely on instincts and bullets. No more and no less and most of them do have some brutal moments for a PG-13 film (and blood too).<br/><br/>The actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles. While Evans came out as a bit arrogant in the ""Avengers"" and the least interesting character, here he truly shines. First time ever, I actually bought what he was bringing on the table. This is a soldier who believed in protecting the people and their freedom. Here though, in the modern era of espionage with multiple intrigues and political events, he finds himself unable to identify which side he is on and for what. At one point he even considers himself Fury's caretaker of terrorist ""problems"". The other side of the coin is Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury and Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. It is nice to see Jackson expanding his role from 1 minute cameo in ""Iron Man"" to a fully supporting actor here. But the real standout is Robert Redford. Kevin Feige (the producer) probably knows how to do casting because so far there has not been a single acting mistake. Bringing heavy-acting-weight Redford to a superhero film is actually a bold move and while most movies do not focus on the talented cast, here the Russo brothers give Redford plenty of close ups and necessary gravitational dialogue that kept surprised me for a ""summer"" and ""mindless"" blockbuster. Antony Mackie plays Falcon believably enough and it is very good to see a great supporting turn instead of being the comedic sidekick. The winter soldier now himself is as you would have expected? probably the best villain outside Loki(!) in the marvel films. A truly unstoppable and cool killing machine that shows no remorse or regret considering his complete disregard (and destructive) actions throughout the film. Shaw manages to bring a bit of menace to a generally light hearted series of fantasy films as he has to act more with his eyes rather than sharing any scenes of actual dialogue. <br/><br/>Is it perfect? Of course not but it does not feel that it is drugging forever or raising any boring flags. There is plenty of plot, intelligence and sweet characters moments to keep anyone satisfying. This is blockbuster at its finest, a superhero film with heart, immersive action and subtle touches of humour. Totally recommended."
"abhishek-upadhayaya","9","193","302","23 March 2014"," Marvel makes a bold move!
","Marvel showed pretty clearly in Iron Man 3 that they are not afraid to take risk, bend comic stories and venture into unknown territories. I was pleasantly surprised by Captain America : The Winter Soldier because Marvel is able to do surprise audience like never before. This movie has mostly everything a fan could ask for. A political drama, conspiracy theories, Chris Evans portrayal of a ""out of his time"" superhero who is trying to blend in with the world and thinks that ""Internet is helpful"", typical Marvel's laugh out loud moments and above all some mesmerizing action sequences. Threat in this movie is not as big as the one in Thor :The Dark World since only our tiny planet is at stake rather than entire 9 realms with imaginative difficult to pronounce names, but thanks to some very smart blend of direction, acting and close to perfect background scores, threat seems to be much bigger and more importantly, real this time. You actually care for the fate of entire planet and characters. You do come face to face with the full potential of SHIELD and its structure, its influence on world politics and when the actual villain is revealed, you just cannot hide your excitement. SHIELD acts as a central character in the movie and shows itself to be far bigger and complex than what we suspected after watching all the Marvel offerings. There is Nick Fury as usual hiding secrets, keeping secrets and digging secrets but watching him vulnerable in this movie is much better than watching him acting all almighty in Avengers. Chris Evans shine in this role and I can imagine he won't be at the bottom of favorite Avengers list after this movie. His portrayal of Captain America is near perfect. Scarlett Johansson is a surprise package in the film portraying Black Widow character. She gets ample screen time presence this time, even in scenes where she is not kicking someone. It is actually the first time we learn something about Black Widow, duplicity in her character just adds tension to the already built suspense in the movie. Sebastian Stan is good in his portrayal of winter soldier. He is a perfect nemesis to Captain America in the movie. I bet you haven't seen such creative combat scenes between these two ever before. Action here is not as loud as Thor movies, it is more real, every bullet which find its target hurts, every punch delivered matters, it is so enjoyable to watch just because it is so real. I wish I could write about some more characters but that will be giving away some key points. Please be assured there are some great character comebacks, some you expected, some you didn't. I was a little let down by the climax of the film by its simplicity after the real motive of the real villain is revealed, but of course you have to remember its a Marvel film, there doesn't exist any situation alien/political/social which can't be solved by few explosions and kicks. Overall it's a highly entertaining film from Marvel, I will put it behind only Avengers and first Iron Man, this movie deserves your weekend. And of course it goes without saying, don't dare to leave your seats until last credits have rolled out, you have probably all heard the rumors about Joss Whedon directing the end credit scene. Yes it is awesome and offers an insight into the next Avengers movie."
"YJLcool","8","164","256","27 March 2014"," What should have been a typical superhero film, now becomes a conspiracy-espionage thriller.
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the third film in Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (after last year's Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World). Compared with the mighty giant green monster, the hammer wielding Norse thunder god or the 'genius, philanthropist, billionaire, playboy' armor man, the Captain was never quite as appealing as the rest of the 'Unusuals'. Steve Rogers is portrayed as an old-fashioned, straightforward, honest, courageous, sincere, patriotic superhero. This makes him a less-interesting, boring character. Moreover, as Tony Stark said it, ""Everything special about you came out of a bottle!""<br/><br/>Most film-goers would know that Marvel films are famous for its bright, fun and not-so-serious approach to its storytelling, together with some catchy, witty dialogues. This film is a game changer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This time around, Marvel decided to take a different approach on things: To make a Captain America sequel with a more serious, darker plot development and more face-to-face close-range hand combat fights. What should have been a typical superhero film, now becomes a conspiracy-espionage thriller.<br/><br/>Two years after the events that happened in New York city, the Captain still struggles with adjusting himself to the modern world, with no apparent social life or girl friend, which is why Natasha/Black Widow tries to introduce or recommend him some cute girls in S.H.I.E.L.D. for him to date with. He is shocked when he learns that the very governmental organisation he is working for is not what it seems to be, as the Cap said in the trailer, ""This isn't freedom. This is fear"". Soon, he finds himself entangled in a conspiracy that puts millions of innocent lives at risk.<br/><br/>The film comes with excellent, fast-paced action choreography. Although the cinematography is a bit dodgy due to the shaky-cam techniques used for depicting the chaotic moments, the fight scenes between the Winter Soldier and the Captain is fantastic and serves as one of the film's highlights. The audience finally gets to see how the Captain's shield is utilised effectively in both offensive and defensive combat situations. It also good to see again how Natasha kicks ass in the film.<br/><br/>All actors delivered a pretty decent performance in the film. Once again, Chris Evans and Scarlett Johannson both proved that they fit their roles well, adding more depth to the characters they portray in the film. Sam Wilson/Falcon is a welcome addition to the Marvel franchise and hopefully he will appear again in the Avengers sequel. Unfortunately, despite the film's title, the winter soldier is not a complex villain and doesn't appear much in the film. It's such a shame to just show him as a formidable physical fighter who's capable of challenging the Captain.<br/><br/>The film is well-scripted, filled with suspense while highlighting some important socio-political issues such as government surveillance and control in its storytelling. Although the twists in the film is predictable and fairly easy to guess, the sequel is a marked improvement compared to its predecessor, Captain America: The First Avenger. The story unfolds gradually and comes with huge, surprising developments by the end of the film. Marvel Cinematic Universe is not going to be the same again. What's going to happen next? How the story is going to progress in Avengers: Age of Ultron, after what had happened in this film? Interesting.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-captain-america- winter.html<br/><br/>Be warned. This is not the typical fun, 'not-so-serious', entertaining Marvel film that you used to watch in the past. You might like it or find it a bore. In order to recognize some of the characters in the film, you need to remember some of Marvel's Phase One films. Most importantly, you need to watch Captain America: The First Avenger before watching this to understand the plot.<br/><br/>Note: Guess you don't need me to remind you to stay for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes. It foreshadows what's going to happen next by introducing a lesser-known supervillain and two new characters, 'Miracles' (another name for 'mutants' because of screen rights issues) which going to be in the Avengers sequel, Age of Ultron. It further confirms that one of weapons depicted in The Avengers is indeed one of the six infinity stones."
"bobochildrunningwild","10","92","139","30 March 2014"," It's smart, intense, well acted and superbly done. AMAZING FILM!
","I'd have to rate Captain America The Winter Soldier as one of the best comic book movies ever made. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get. Superman has generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film even though it has some campy flaws. Spider- Man has generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character. Iron Man has generally held the most grounded and well liked superhero film. The Avengers has generally held the title as most highly rated and best film the genre has seen. Well, Captain America TWS can compete with them all in every category. It is IMO near perfect on every level. It's smart, intense, well acted, fun and superbly done.<br/><br/>The first film delivers a lot of action, a tantalizing and beautiful love interest, many humorous moments, powerful messages about internal fortitude and courage, a classic villain, fine acting and many of the basic essentials of any good action movie. This sequel adds an intriguing plot and does everything the first film did but does it BETTER. Including, incredible stunts, unbelievable feats and, not to be rude, but a climax that plays out like a multiple orgasm. The finish features one wave after another of edge of your seat moments. As fantastic of a movie that's ever been made in the genre and I'm not exaggerating one bit."

","Winter Soldier is the best movie in the Avengers series to date. Breathtaking visuals mixed with a solid storyline, energetic action sequences and they finally make a true superhero out of Captain America. On a whole it follows on nicely from both The First Avenger and Assemble. It also benefitted from the attendance of Black Widow, and also an excellent villain. The action was superb from start to finish, Captain America himself has a venerability about him with a human nature. Its just thrilling, edge of the seat stuff which puts a real punch back into the Marvels best running series to date."

","I applaud the Russo brothers and the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely on a job well done in this action thriller The action is riveting as are the quite scenes between the characters. There are Good humorous punches in this script also. The returning cast are great and expanding their roles from other movies, I am trying to be vague here as not to ruin the movie. Also there are some great additions to the cast as well. Anthony Mackie does a soaring job as the Falcon (pun intended), he has a very comfortable fit to the cast and no way feel forces in. Robert Redford is a very compelling character and presence on screen. The action scenes were fantastic when I saw the resume of the Russos's movies I was a little worried, now I think they might have to worry about being type cast as action movie directors. There are a few changes from the comic book story line but they are not distracting. The Winter Solider is a movie that greatly expands and shakes the foundation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Stay for the two end credit sequences. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it. If it's action you want. Go see the Captain."

","Another hit from marvel!!! can they do anything wrong.<br/><br/>With the success of the recent marvel films, this one again is sure to do well at the box office. whats more pleasantly surprising is that this film is probably the best they've made so far, even rivalling the avengers. I'm sure that with these positive reviews this movie will make upwards of 600 million, beating Thor: the dark world, but i doubt that it will beat iron man 3. however with the success of this movie, i feel that many more people with be eagerly waiting for the third instalment so watch out Batman V superman!! <br/><br/>The acting as expected from Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans and Samuel L. Jackson was excellent. Robert Redford was impeccable in his role and he was worth the effort that Marvel put in to get him on board. The rest of the cast all play their roles extremely well and Marvel have done the right thing by bringing the Falcon in the movie, which was played well by Anthony Mackie.<br/><br/>The movie is a great political thriller and i must admit, even without the bonus of superheroes, the script/story is a great movie. The superheroes is what we pay and want to see but the amazing flow of the movie itself should leave many satisfied. The superheroes and villains were all great and i hope we continue seeing the Falcon in the future along with Black Widow. This movie is the most closely linked with The Avengers and also Avengers Age of Ultron, from the rest of the phase 2 films. This is a great movie and one that i highly recommend watching.<br/><br/>BTW stay for the end credits for an extra bonus!"
"zardoz-13","10","24","35","21 April 2014"," The Sequel Surpasses the Original!!!
","""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" gives super-hero sequels a good name. Not only is this $170 million blockbuster far better than its superb 'origins' predecessor, but it also is a real game-changer for the Marvel Universe. Former ""Fantastic Four"" actor Chris Evans reprises the title role as Steve Rogers, a 90-pound weakling turned 240-pound heavyweight, whose exploits inspired millions in World War II. Remember Rogers spent about 70 years in suspended animation in an iceberg after he contributed to the defeat the Nazis as well as Hydra. Rogers maintains his sense of honor, or naivety, throughout all his trials and tribulations. Evans makes his old-fashioned, nice-guy antics appear both convincing and charming. Meaning, Captain America remains essentially a goody-two-shoes-bachelor-with-a-shield. Our hero takes a licking but keeps on ticking despite whatever adversaries he tangles with in the second, in-name-only theatrical ""Captain America"" feature.<br/><br/>Co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo of ""You, Me and Dupree"" let the action coast occasionally in this larger-than-life, two-hour-and-sixteen minute melodrama, but the combat scenes are staged with so much kinetic artistry that you will teeter on the edge of your seat during them. Everything is still appropriately formulaic but entirely outlandish in the gravity-defying Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely screenplay that puts our hero early and often behind the eight ball. My favorite close-quarters combat encounter occurs in the elevator with our hero cornered and outnumbered. Later scraps on the three Helicarriers emerge as no less electrifying. Predictably, everything is business as usual, but the Russo brothers and their scribes provide enough twists and turns to keep you interested in this noisy nonsense. Mind you, one or two things won't register as total surprises because you know some characters cannot perish. Nevertheless, if you enjoyed the first ""Captain America"" with Chris Evans, you will probably love the second one as much if not more! <br/><br/>In terms of a chronological timeline, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" takes place two years after the cataclysmic New York showdown, but the action itself covers only three days. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) hasn't totally acclimated himself to the 21st century, but he refuses to let it interfere with his duty. While jogging around Washington, D.C., the fleet-footed Rogers befriends congenial Air Force flyboy Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie of ""Notorious"") who counsels veterans suffering from PTSD at the VA Hospital. No sooner have they gotten acquainted than Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson of ""The Avengers"") rolls up to whisk Rogers off onto his next dangerous mission. Later, Sam Wilson joins Rogers in his capacity as the winged hero Falcon. The first major action scene in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is designed to show how extraordinary our eponymous hero is under fire but also how vulnerable he remains. Terrorists have stormed a S.H.I.E.L.D. surveillance ship, and they are issuing outrageous demands for the release of the hostages. Actually, this predicament reminded me of the first mission that Stallone and company embarked on in the initial ""Expendables"" epic. Mind you, Captain America and his trusty boomerang shield clear the perimeter so Black Widow and Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo of ""End of Watch"") can free the hostages and settle with the terrorists. However, more than meets the eye occurs during this seemingly simple mission, and Captain America confronts his superior, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nicholas Fury (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction""), about Black Widow's cyber-exploit. No sooner have Rogers and Fury fussed at each other at the sprawling new island headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D. than Fury briefs Rogers about the next best thing. Project Insight will link three Helicarriers via spy satellites and to eradicate preemptively any threats either domestic or otherwise. Naturally, Captain America doesn't like Insight. If he is shocked that things have changed so much that such a measure must be taken, he is even more shocked later when Fury shows up at his apartment with blood on his hands and an assassin lurking nearby. Of course, D.C. Police are nowhere to be found when these imposters do everything except blast holes in either the engine block or the tires of his fortified SUV during a tense auto chase through D.C. streets. If this weren't enough for Captain America, he must go toe-to-toe with a mysterious combatant with a ""Six Million Dollar Man"" arm to save the day.<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" makes several references to the previous film that strengthens its bond with it. We get a glimpse of the girl that Steve loved and we watch as Steve's best friend, Bucky Barnes, contends with amnesia. The filmmakers not only bring us up to date about Bucky, but also we learn more about renegade enemy scientist Dr. Arnim Zola who collaborated with the Red Skull in the first ""Captain America."" Furthermore, Zola opts to become a 'ghost-in-the machine' like Johnny Depp in ""Transcendence."" The Russos and their writers keep hurling obstacles into Captain America's path, and our hero doesn't have an easy time conquering the villains. Anthony Mackie gets to play the first African-American Marvel super hero, and he attacks the role with relish. He wears a sophisticated set of mechanical wings that enable him to fly and perform far-fetched feats. Scarlett Johansson is just as tough and sexy as she was in ""The Avengers."" Meanwhile, the best special effect in this special effects extravaganza isn't a special effect. Actor Robert Redford proves computer graphics stand no chance against the real thing. Redford qualifies as the most distinguished silver-screen good guy to cavort in such a dastardly manner since Henry Fonda in Sergio Leone's western ""Once Upon A Time in the West."" If you've never seen Redford in action, you owe it to yourself to check him out. By his presence alone, Redford makes this action-adventure opus into a memorable experience. Let's hope that Marvel Studios can keep up with good work with the forthcoming ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" in 2015."

","When Fury(L. Jackson, tough as usual, for him and these) is attacked by an unknown enemy, the Captain(Evans, will of steel, heart of gold) and Black Widow(Johansson, sultry and devious – this uses her right, finally) find themselves(they have a great chemistry, with a charming running gag of her wanting to pair him up with a girl, going through a list of ones they both know; and with his straightforward nature, and her relative lack of integrity, they both affect the other towards them, benefiting both) with no one else to trust, except perhaps the veteran Falcon(Mackie, amiable), as they uncover a genuinely devastating truth, while on the run from a considerable force – including the elusive assassin, The Winter Soldier(Stan, terrifying, pure awesome pretty much every second he's on screen).<br/><br/>This is just short of the level of The Avengers. It uses the strong continuity of the cinematic Marvel(as in, their own studio) universe better than any of the others, and does justice to many different elements, most of them set up prior to this. Events occur in this that will have serious consequences for future entries. The plot-driven nature and approach of a 70's political thriller(where some characters, all credible and with something to do, happen to wear a flag or the like) in a contemporary setting and with biting satire(on foreign policy, something not entirely new to these, but never before this sharp commenting on mass surveillance and executions taking place before any trial against the (supposed) perpetrator) is spot-on. From a 40's war flick, with heroism and defined lines between good and evil, to the modern method of taking on the opposition – with spying, and questionable tactics(compared to one army versus another).<br/><br/>The action all comes about naturally, it's personal, hard-hitting and, on account of next to no CGI, it's ""real"". Each intense set-piece is varied(fighting, shooting, chasing both on foot and vehicular), you will remember them, and except for one bit, they feel fresh and original. Among the very few weaknesses are that Sharon(VanCamp, another compelling and strong woman) has nothing to do in this, appearing as if her important scenes were cut, and/or that she was setup for the next one. She is the only one that that goes for, a pleasant surprise considering the seemingly bloated cast of characters. This explores S.H.I.E.L.D., and how the iconic super soldier fits into it or, whether or not he does, at all. The 3D is unobtrusive, adding depth and atmosphere, similar to Avatar.<br/><br/>There is violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of, well, blockbusters. 10/10"

This movie blew my mind.... It is really AWESOME!!! There are many sequences that will make you jump up in your seats. And though I have not included any spoilers, I would like to recommend you to stay after the credits for two amazing scenes, now this is hardly a spoiler as everyone knows marvel always treats the audience with surprising after credits scenes. I shall say no more here. Marvel has done an excellent job on this movie.<br/><br/>Chris Evans has done some excellent work as Captain America. But Scarlett Johansson as Black widow steals the movie. Her character is evergreen as usual.Others to look forward to are Sebastian Stan as the winter soldier and Anthony Mackie as The Falcon.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. Guys, this movie is really worth your bucks. Moreover, the movie runs for over 136 mins, but never at a single moment during the movie you feel bored. And the ending of the movie leaves you craving for more and more.<br/><br/>The climax is terrific. I haven't seen such an awesome climax of a movie since the Avengers.

"vicvonfate","Null","29","45","31 March 2014"," Superb. This could be the best sequel the genre has seen.
","This film finds Captain America still adjusting to the modern day, while working under the increasingly morally ambiguous government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The set up is masterfully done. This is the third time we've seen the character and it's by far the most complex. The Avengers film touched bit with his feelings of what it was like to be in the modern era, but besides the deleted scenes, they had no time to dive in to the subject matter in that movie. That's not the case here. This is a wonderful character study to go along with a purely thrilling plot. This was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver the film the character deserves at this time. What makes Steve/cap interesting isn't his abilities but the man himself. The ""man out of time"" to be exact. He must come to terms with a past that is long gone and a longing for a better more decent era. Dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of an organization like S.H.I.E.L.D. is taking its toll on a member of ""the greatest generation."" As he's finding his way, his past comes back and explodes all throughout his new life.<br/><br/>Enter The Winter Soldier, who is an amoral assassin and an agent of shady government rogues. Saying any more about what is an ultimately cool character would be a spoiler. Fans of the books know who he is and what he's about but movie fans need to find their own way. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the origin and First Avenger but this movie is darker than the original film. It has a whole new flavor and that;s exactly what was needed. The 1940's romance and even the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" tone fit the first film quite nicely but would have been out of place in this story. Just like Cap, adaptation is a key. Steve is still an unquestioning patriot but he shifts from being an unquestioning soldier. This is where his old-fashioned values pay off. Questioning what is wrong and questioning what is morally cloudy is a test of true character. That is exactly why the character of Steve Rogers is so interesting. He's so much more than a super soldier boy scout. There's depth, angst and pathos to the max. He is out-of-place and he is old- fashioned but proud of that in a way. He also is an enhanced thinker so it's not like modern era gadgets confound him. It's all played just right. <br/><br/>The story itself is a good old fashion action thriller with a ton of intrigue. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this clever. Everything about this movie is a joy to watch. Tha cast is perfect and everyone is used exceptionally well. This could be the best sequel the genre has seen. It's Marvel's best sequel for sure."
"sheance114","10","43","74","26 March 2014"," An ambush of engaging sequences that leaves you satisfied
","Once upon a time there was Iron Man 3 where the hype is on the top of every Marvel movie that I thought wouldn't be surpassed by any other sequels/spin-offs or interconnected movie. The level of Iron Man 3 (not from a fan-boy perspective) was above the top. From the storyline to its action sequences to its comedy was above all commendable (although fan- boys would not agree with me, of course).<br/><br/>Then, there was Captain America.<br/><br/>Although the first movie was a little bit dragging from the beginning up to the end, the storyline was strong and was complementary to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The tone was sepia-ish due to the timeline of 1940's. <br/><br/>But little did I know that the entire first movie of CapAm was vital for sequel: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>It revolves around Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and the events after the cataclysmic Avengers in New York. In his trial to blend with the modern time and facing another familiar enemy which would destroy the entire empire of S.H.I.E.L.D., also a past that is sinister in the present, naming himself ""The Winter Soldier"", that will rock Rogers' world. Betrayal and Loyalty are his ultimate struggle on who's who he will give his trust, to win over the first ultimate test in the modern world he and the S.H.I.E.L.D. will ever know.<br/><br/>There's a lot going in the film, but is not distracting, and the pace is just perfect for the two and fifteen minutes run of it. The character build-up was enough for each, especially on Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the ex-military/side kick of Captain America. With Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), his character was focused from start to finish because he's the focal point of the movie on which the main characters should act upon after his unforeseen demise. But one superstar, aside from Captain America himself, who garnered an applause and bravo credit in the film, was Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson). Her finesse, sinister moves, unprecedented jokes and sensual aura made it work for the entire movie. She is that one person in a film that would give a cool effect, plus she's a woman, so, it all works. I think its Marvel's way to introduce her because of the rumoured Black Widow movie and I'm up for the line.<br/><br/>The only character that was little most exposure was Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), well, I am biased to this because I just so love her. But I guess it's just a build-up to what's to come for her and Steve Rogers in the future.<br/><br/>The story of The Winter Soldier was really compelling. The ambush to the main characters was believable in the sense of real life situations. The betrayal of some will pose a question on whether a main character will die. And that's exciting and dreading at the same time, not knowing if your favourite character will make it or not.<br/><br/>All the action in the movie was up-beat and so good. Although, I just hoped the camera movements weren't that much moving a lot, but still it works.<br/><br/>What I about Captain America: The Winter Soldier was that from start to end, because of the compelling storyline; it will engage you to focus and love every scene. It's a must watch. I'm kind of in battle to what's better, Iron Man 3 or Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the latter is a bit revamped on the storyline.<br/><br/>(This review is also seen in my blog onesettingatatime.com)"
"dreamtakers","10","35","59","28 March 2014"," Marvel Slays it Once Again! Bravo!!!
","I had a feeling that Captain America: Winter Soldier would be an amazing movie once the trailer was released. Turns out, I couldn't be more accurate. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not the usual superhero movie, it underlies a dark theme of politics and conspiracy beneath it. Haunting pasts, betrayals and fake deaths all come into play. In this film, we get to see Steve Rogers' full potential in terms of his heroism and leadership. When the leader of S.H.E.I.L.D., Nick Fury, takes the fall, it is up to Steve Rogers to determine the fate of S.H.E.I.L.D and most importantly, the livelihood of mankind. As the stoic and fearless hero that he is, Rogers takes charge and enlists the help of Natasha Romanoff aka The Black Widow as well as a new sidekick, Sam Wilson aka Falcon, to defeat HYDRA. He exuberates skills that we have never seen before with his gravity defying flips, kicks and punches, even single handedly defeating a whole vessel of villains. It is also exciting to see the strong bond between Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon. The trios are as loyal as ever to one another, never once faltering despite near death scenarios and with multitude obstacles being hurled their way like a violent hurricane. They displayed excellent teamwork in the process of defeating the baddies. The movie also sheds some light and heart-warming moments as well. The playful and snarky banter between good friends Natasha and Steve is fun to watch. The escalator scene, anyone? Also, the scene between Steve and his former love, Peggy was priceless. Here, we get to see the vulnerable and raw side of the Captain which he hides so well on a daily basis.<br/><br/>This film is a perfect blend of thrill, action and drama with an intriguing plot. The action sequences are plentiful; there is not just one ""special"" moment. I was gawking and gripping the edge of my seat throughout the movie. The stunts are top notch and are the best in its genre, perhaps even triumphing the likes of action movies. There are tons of extraordinary fighting combats, insane car chases and fiery explosions that would blow you off your feet. All the actors did a splendid job in portraying their characters convincingly, particularly Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson. Scarlett has a major role and takes up pretty much most of the screen time; so take note of this, fanboys.<br/><br/>Captain America: Winter Soldier has claim its spot as the best Marvel movie ever produced in my list as it exceeds my expectations in every single way. I daresay it is even better than The Avengers (It is a large statement to make as I am a massive Avengers fan). I can't wait to see the next installment of the Captain America sequel and The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Bring it on, Marvel!"

","On March 19, Marvel and Disney withdrew a ban on the publication of any reviews and reviews of the over-coming spring blockbuster ""The First Avenger: Another War."" They were removed because it was on this day that a special, first in Russia closed film was shown at the Oktyabr cinema. Unfortunately, no photographs could be made, since Marvel on similar premieres usually requires to hand over at the entrance to the hall all electronic devices. But, nevertheless, the film itself is important.<br/><br/>After the attempt on the very director of ""Shield"" Nick Fury, it becomes clear that the traitors are deep inside the organization itself. Captain America is involved in a large-scale villainous action to destroy disagreeable ""Hydra"" personalities. Moreover, he, like the Black Widow, is wanted as a possible supporter of a secret conspiracy. Now he can trust only himself. In addition to everything, a mysterious masked man appears on the scene, known as the Winter Soldier, who has practically the same powers as Steve Rogers himself.<br/><br/>Nothing more on the subject can not say, since it will necessarily entail spoilers, because the movie is directly packed full of intrigues and incredible plot twists. During the show, the hall repeatedly exploded with applause at the next plot move.<br/><br/>As a person who has watched repeatedly any of the existing Marvel films, I can say that ""The First Avenger 2"" can rightfully be considered one of the best, filmed by the studio. The fact is that after the plague success of the ""Avengers"" abounding with colorful characters, you involuntarily begin to compare each next film with them. In my opinion, Thor is the weakest hero in order to play solo. If not for the charismatic Loki, the film in general would be very weak. The first ""Captain"" also did not differ in any scale and originality of the plot, but in the sequel everything is quite different.
To begin with, the second part has grown significantly in terms of special effects. It is understandable - after all, the action takes place already in the modern world, and not during the Second World War. In addition to this company Cap was composed of Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) and the red-haired beauty of the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), as well as the new character Sokol (Anthony Maki). All this ensemble is simply superbly interacting with each other, succeeding and joking, and even add a small share of romance. (No blueness, it's all right). Scarlett Johansson has a lot of time, which allows her character and true intentions to be revealed. It makes no sense to say something about the acting, because these characters are performed by the same actors for the first time.<br/><br/>There are a lot of questions in the film, which remain almost unanswered. Why was the attempt on Nick Fury committed? Who is behind this? Who is this Winter Soldier and where did he come from? Who can be trusted when there are only traitors around? Fortunately, you will certainly know the answers by the end of the film. By the way, it is worth saying that the ending leaves room for trikvela, which, of course, will be.<br/><br/>As I wrote earlier, you involuntarily compare any solo film of heroes from the Avengers with the Avengers themselves. So the ""First Avenger"" can easily compete with the flagship team of superheroes. The plot is twisted much more seriously, than there, jokes and references also suffice in excess. The only drawback of the film - the absence of the agent Phil Colson, which has long been an integral part of the Marvel blockbuster. If someone does not know, the most charming agent of SHIELD does not actually die in Avengers. This is seen in the series ""Agents SHIELD"", which also produces now Marvel.
The picture was shown to us in the IMAX 3D format. And I must say that it looks really cool. Again, comparing with the scale of the ""Avengers"", the spectacle here is no worse. And somewhere even better. It can be seen that the creators tried to do without the use of computer graphics in those places where it was possible. Therefore, the natural filming in the film is much more than artificially drawn episodes.<br/><br/>In short, strange as it may sound, ""The First Avenger: Another War"" is different from any other Marvel movie. At least because of the fact that there is not all tied up on the steep heroes and fatal beauties. Here you will find also a certain hidden subtext, which someone, perhaps, will make you think. After all, Captain America is not just another superhero. This is the most patriotic man in America, her symbol. By the will of fate, he was not in his time and not in his world, but he had to make up for what he had missed in 70 years. He is tormented by a sense of guilt and a feeling that he is not the one who needs this world. But only a real hero is able to find the strength to forget about himself and fight for his friends.<br/><br/>And finally, the remark about the localization of the film's name. Someone will find it funny how our distributors translated this title. But I assure you, they did it for a reason. ""Other War"" in this case conveys the meaning of the film better than the original name itself."

","In the latest era, superhero movies are mostly remembered either for its one-liners, inspirational quotes about heroism, or anything deep, but only rare has been reminded straightly by the action. The set pieces are probably too good and too common to be the landmark of a certain film, thus the genre's grander goal has gone to breaking dramatic grounds while the actual fun is unnoticeably taken for granted by the audience. Captain America: The Winter Soldier returns to the forgotten ambition by simply aiming to be exciting. Clever storyline and frantic action keeps it utterly thrilling, which results a refreshing take to action blockbusters.<br/><br/>The title suggests that it's about The Winter Soldier, but it's mainly about what has happened to the world years after the first movie. We get to see Steve Rogers trying to fit in to the future, and look into a time that betrays the real American way of truth and justice. The film smartly takes the virtuous hero to mysteries by setting the pieces into a revelation that was already conspired from the past. Rogers has become a symbol of the old integrity of the nation, and the story contrasts it to the new government. It's a gripping speculation, and it is strange because only little involves the titular enemy. The Winter Soldier feels like an extended arc for Rogers or another cliffhanger for the next movie. Otherwise it's still well constructed.<br/><br/>The cast is never a doubt. Chris Evans still embraces what we love about Captain America; great character of patriotism and heroism. Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie backs him up adding their team a little more personality. Robert Redford lends some real humanity to his ridiculously suspicious character, and Frank Grillo is just warming up to become the actual Crossbones in the upcoming sequels.<br/><br/>CGI is now everything in action movies and they're not always that compelling. This movie of course has a lot of them, but the best parts are usually the ones that involves stuff getting hit, either by fists or damaged cars. The film has plenty of impressively choreographed fighting scenes and they bring reminiscence to the old school action which reminds the audience that nothing can really beat the basics. The larger action may look kind of stale, but the kinetic of the speed and destruction overpowers the spectacles, moves the audience with genuine thrills. This is the enthusiasm that superhero movies lack nowadays and it is encouraged that they should offer more face punching, knife flipping exhilaration like this.<br/><br/>""Redefinition"" is indeed the word. While Captain America the hero represents how true justice works, the film relives why action movies are so awesome. None of the film is groundbreaking whatsoever, but how it is done is terrific and humbly fun without any pretension. It does still need to live up a bit more with the title, but the merits could ignore that fact. Besides, our blockbusters today do need some straightforward thrills like this, plus a consistent plot that explores more of its iconic universe. Some might ask for a little more depth at the intriguing first act and the Winter Soldier mystery, but it would be wiser to just sit back, relax, and enjoy what this genre is meant to be: awesome and loyal to its heroic roots."

","After the Avengers, pretty much nobody thought that Captain America was the coolest Avenger. Everyone thought it was Iron Man or Hulk or maybe Thor. But nobody thought it was Captain America. This film made everybody change their minds. The Winter Soldier turned Cap into the most badass Avenger, and proved why he's the leader of Earth's Mightiest.<br/><br/>Joe Johnston didn't return to direct this film, which I think is a positive. He made the 40's astetic work great, but what Joe and Anthony Russo bring to the table is on a whole other level. They made a superhero spy movie, with a heavy focus on hand to hand combat and spy movie tropes.<br/><br/>The cast is great, with Evans being the highlight. Steve Rogers feels like a man out of time, with the same black and white mindset of the 40's, while the future is filled with grey. He still does his best to do what's right, even if nobody wants to follow him. Pairing him with Black Widow was brilliant, as she is completely grey. Scarlett Johansson gives a great performance, with a truly tortured soul under the surface of her character. Samuel L. Jackson returns as Fury, and he is badass, with a great car chase scene. Sebastian Stan is good, though not given much screen time. Anthony Mackie is introduced as The Falcon in this movie. Falcon is funny, and he adds a sense of realism to this movie. Robert Redford is fine, does good for what he's given. The cast is phenomenal, with some of the best performances in the franchise.<br/><br/>The plot is fantastic. Everything from Cap trying to readjust to modern day society to the big twist that Hydra was infested and even help build SHIELD was incredible. Bucky being revealed as the Winter Soldier was great for the character of Captain America, even though the twist was revealed on the poster. I also love the fact that Bucky killed the Starks, even though that plot doesn't come into play for years. I love the plot of this movie.<br/><br/>The effects are all pretty good. When the punches strike, they feel real and tangible. Cap's shield is awesome in this movie, as are Falcon's wings. Bucky's mechanical arm looks great as well. When the Helicarriers finally go boom, it does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the best movies in the franchise. It captures the character of Captain America perfectly and turned him into a cultural phenomenon. Also Punisher was apparently in the truck that helped Fury, which is amazing.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This movie was absolutely great in my opinion; it might even be my favourite Marvel movie at this moment. <br/><br/>The beginning already sets a bit of a mood for this movie. We see Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, and he is starting to get used to this world, the 21st century. He is a charming and a bit quirky guy. Especially the relationship between him and Natasha Romanoff, aka the Black Widow, is absolutely amazing! She is a strong female character and that is so great to see in a superhero movie. <br/><br/>The movie soon turns into a conspiracy spy movie esque setting, we see old characters returning. Basically: S**t just goes down. <br/><br/>At some point there was a bit too much action in my opinion. Not overwhelmingly much so as it distracts you, but still, a teensy bit too much. The soundtrack is great though, the characters are amazing; it is just a pleasure to watch it. <br/><br/>No spoilers here, so just go and watch it."

","I guess I would be considered a big Fan-boy as I have collected comics for 30 plus years and I was just sure Hollywood would totally butcher this wonderful comic book story arc. (Like they did with the Extermis story arc in Iron Man 3 in my opinion) Despite that I was as giddy as a school girl waiting on this movie to come out because I really wanted to see The Winter Soldier depicted on screen. Based on early reviews and trailers I felt that just maybe this time Hollywood might do this story justice and they certainly did.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier Rocks hands down, the action is fast, deadly and well placed. The acting is great for any movie not just a superhero movie (and let's face it these are usually such one dimensional characters in the films) <br/><br/>The reviews are pretty spot on this is an espionage/thriller and is the best of what captain America really is, he's not as strong as The Hulk and has never claimed to be, he's a soldier that's what he always wanted to be and he's damn good at it. He knows what's expected of a soldier and always does his job, but in a new era of no black and white but purely gray areas, this soldier has to find the truth in a world full of lies and this plays well in the film.<br/><br/>These actors have really come into these roles and this script does give them the chance to really act.<br/><br/>Chris Evens is great and beyond the first cap film or the Avengers I finally see him as Captain America, Sam Jackson is great as usual but with much more depth for his character in this script he's even better.<br/><br/>Another thing i'm happy about is you finally get to see a hint of what the real Natasha Romanoff is like in the comics.(They have just not done this character justice in the other films, until now.)<br/><br/>This time around these feel like real characters for a change and we care about what happens to them. The new characters introduced here to the Marvel Cinematic Universe hold their own especially Anthony Mackie as the Falcon.<br/><br/>I was worried that no actor could play this role correctly without it just seeming cheesy but with modern CGI they pulled off the Wings pun intended, however CGI wings aside what really sold this role was Mackie, in the comics this is one of the big long standing and important friendships in the Marvel Comics Universe, between Cap and the Falcon, (hell the cap comics were titled Captain America and The Falcon for years)<br/><br/>so it was important to get this friendship right, cap needs a friend not a fan and The Falcon in this movie is a soldier and in this version of the story that is where they find their bond, an unspoken understanding and trust between real soldiers not Black Water mercenaries . Though very different from the original meeting in the comics the same unspoken bond forms none the less. <br/><br/>Spoiler Alerts ahead! Though they have pretty much switched the roles of Agent 13 and the Black Widow in the movie version, it works and the Black Widow makes a great counter to Cap in this film while still being one of the good guys. A lot of reviews are saying Scarlett Johansson runs away with this movie but I disagree, no actor runs away with this movie they all play their parts well and are an important part of the story there is no Star here just good performances. <br/><br/>As for The Winter Soldier himself he had close to no dialog in the comics at this point in the story arc and this was a role that really needed to be played with the actor's eyes and Sebastian Stan pulls this off beautifully. I loved the Winter Soldier on screen the CGI was perfect and he was as cold, and menacing as he was in the comics. An emotionless killing machine. The High tech Bionic metal arm looked great and was totally believable. The use of actual stunt men in place of what is usually all CGI in fight scenes these days was great to see and was choreographed perfectly, way to go old school. And no two fight scenes felt the same, even when you see Cap fight The Winter Soldier for the 3rd time.<br/><br/>The best thing about this Movie was the pacing, I was never bored and this did not seem like a 2 and 1/2 hour film, just as things slowed down, and you were getting more of the story BAM!, more well placed action and then back to a good solid script.<br/><br/>All that said and I had a lot to say, did Hollywood fall back into the 10 second count down sequence at the end? Yes. Did they dumb it down some? Yes, but was it great fun and did it give us the spy thriller feel of the Ed Brubaker comics? Yes it did Bret! Yes it did!!<br/><br/>I loved this movie and it's hard to please a fan-boy. So please go see this movie tell your friends and family I really want more Captain America movies based on the Brubaker story arcs and there is a lot more to this story which really gets better down the road.<br/><br/>If you have never read a comic or anything by Ed Brubaker, read some you will be surprised how good comic books can be, good comic writers don't come along often and Brubaker is one of the best.<br/><br/>Oh and look close at Nick Fury's Grave Stone at the end there is a tribute to his character in Pulp Fiction."

","Yes. I never thought I would say that. <br/><br/>I read and love the leading brands of comics in general (Dark Horse is my favorite). But when it comes to movie adaptations I think, after watching this movie I can safely say that Marvel has pushed the envelope (cough*cough*Warner)<br/><br/>This is more than a Super hero movie. More like espionage thriller. From the first shot where it starts with a little humor it never lets you down. Humor/Action/Humor/Action with a good dose of character development. Rinse and repeat. Anthony and Joe Russo got it just right.<br/><br/>All actors have done a terrific job. Johansson is great. Be it action or a smart quip with another character she just steals the scene. After watching Chris Evans a couple of times as a comics character I never thought he can portray Caps as good as this. But he shines. <br/><br/>All the supporting characters are given enough screen time though I wanted to see them more. Jackson as the growling chief and Redford with his snappy dialogs are just superb. Even Smulders who just flashes for a few seconds has her moment. <br/><br/>Special mention must be made of Mackie who as Falcon is awesome. I like the friendly banter and camaraderie between him and Caps. My only disappointment is with Sebastian Stan's character. He has done a credible job but a little more of his character development would have been more welcome.<br/><br/>Action sequences are well choreographed. The Set pieces are mostly CGI but they nicely gel with the plot and do not overwhelm which you do not see very often.<br/><br/>Finally Caps gets his own movie (though a second one) - a fun ride which will leave you wanting more. Do not miss it."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","11","18","10 August 2014"," Excellent sequel that outdoes the first film
","That is not to knock the first Captain America film because I enjoyed that too, just that Captain America: The Winter Soldier personally came off as superior. Some of the second half does try to cram in too much giving off an at times bloated and convoluted quality, other than that Captain America: The Winter Soldier was excellent. It is a great-looking film with stylish cinematography and editing that give off a gritty and audacious look, and the special effects and the stunts are of the quality that you can't take your eyes off them. The music is not quite as good as it was in the first but it has enough of the rousing excitement and haunting intensity to make it a good score that matches what is going on on screen. The action sequences are spectacularly choreographed and of edge-of-your-seat calibre whether it is a highway car chase or a sky battle with some of the destruction authentically harrowing, and the screenplay is one that is smart and snappy with heart aplenty. The story is mostly compelling and very cleverly constructed, it mixes action, comic-book adventure and political thriller and does it in a way that is well-balanced, that is alive with nimble nuances and in a way that the film gives off a sense that it knows what it's trying to be. It's suspenseful and exciting with its fair share of themes that gives the film emotion and depth. The characters are engaging and interesting, with their personalities deeper and more expansive, and there is a much more believable villain this time around(the big reveal was actually quite surprising). A great thing considering that the cast of cast is quite large if not quite to the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink extent; the interplay between the characters works a treat also. Anthony and Joe Russo direct astutely and the acting is fine, with Chris Evans even more confident than he was in the first, Scarlett Johansson at her fearless and Anthony Mackie fitting comfortably in his role. Samuel L. Jackson is as dependable as ever, Robert Redford in a bold move gives seasoned support and is not stiff at all and Sebastian Stan is similarly authoritative. All in all, while there are a couple of issues with the second half Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent sequel and manages to outdo the enjoyable first film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"annebush","5","18","34","13 April 2014"," CAPTAIN America: Don't listen to the critics!
","I will come right out and say that the critics who said this was better than the avengers were dead WRONG. The three main sins of captain America: The winter soldier are 1: There are SO MANY POINTLESS FIGHTING SCENES!! 2. THOSE FIGHTING SCENES GO ON UNTIL THE END OF TIME!! 3. I'm not a hater of old' Cap, but he should have died like, 100 times. And oops! I forgot one, but I'm not sure if it's just me. The story is SO predictable. I could totally tell that Bucky the Winter Soldier would eventually save Captain America from a watery grave. Speaking of, Captain A. Got about five shots in his stomach, got punched multiple times, fell from probably two thousand feet into icy cold water, yet he still lives. So realistic. Also, we see Captain fall off and the Winter Soldier still hanging on to the airship, but about a minute later we see him drag Captain to shore. How could he have found him? And how could he have jumped off a minute later, but still be at or near the site where Captain fell? Those are the cons. The few pros are 1. There are a few funny lines that made everyone crack up. 2. It has a good back-story to it. 3. there are many breathtaking moments. So, overall, we have a film that has a not-too-shabby story to it with too many pointless fighting scenes with a few funny lines and a predictable conclusion, and a film that is definitely NOT better than the Avengers and NOT what the critics claim it is."
"Jakestro","8","9","15","27 March 2014"," Not just a comic book movie, but also a political action-thriller!
","With Rogers, Fury, and Romanoff having already been previously established, Joe and Anthony Russo do a pretty damn good job directing the expansion of these characters by providing more depth to understanding their actions and how they will affect future stories – of course, this is a comic book film so there is always going to be some underdeveloped characters there to advance the plot or deliver snappy one-liners.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Sam Jackson as Nick Fury more in this film than previously, I felt he had a stronger presence this time around. I never quite understood what Nick Fury does, I mean think about it. He assembled The Avengers and all, he sometimes gives them orders but other than that? He always felt somewhat underdeveloped to me, like a character who could only exist in the presence of The Avengers and who would disappear and reappear as they came and went. That's why I love what they did with his character in this film, validating Nick Fury as a main staple in the Marvel Cinematic Universe among the big boys.<br/><br/>Chris Evans is pretty much as you'd expect from what you've seen him do, he truly was the best casting choice for Captain America. Is he amazing, acting wise? – No, not by a mile. Is he good enough? -Yes definitely. This is a comic book movie, we're not exactly going for an Oscar for best leading actor. That being said, Evans portrays the earnestness of Captain America's black and white moral with a decent enough finesse.<br/><br/>When we meet Rodgers in the film he has matured since The Avengers, in The Avengers he was almost immediately thrown in to this huge task of saving the world along with the others after just being awakened. Here he has had time and is now stronger, faster, wiser, he understands modern technology (to an extent) and he is now also equipped with better fighting skills. All around he is basically now a much more refined soldier. Whilst having brought up Cap's improved fighting skills, just a quick FYI, this movie is clearly the most superior Marvel film yet when it comes to the fighting choreography. Just splendid.<br/><br/>The film introduces a band of new characters, some heroes, some foes. But all of whom play a more significant role than previous Marvel films have given their side characters, which helps create a more layered and conceivably real film (and cinematic universe).<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier's presence is terrifying when it comes to any action sequence, Sebastian Stan really does do a remarkable job holding his own in the intense fight scenes. The connection between Rogers and The Winter Soldier is dealt with true care and excels the story of Captain America from the first film brilliantly.<br/><br/>I have to mention something that really caught me by surprise. This is not just your average comic book movie, this is also a political action- thriller. And one that is done well at that, it's hard making a good comic book movie and the Russo's did it with elements of a political action-thriller. That alone, earns it a spot in the top 3 Marvel's Cinematic Universe films for me so far. Tonally, The Winter Soldier is dark. Grimm. I've noticed this seems to be the tone aimed for by Marvel in phase 2, Thors sequel was ""darker"" than it's predecessor as well. The film raises a lot of deep-seated questions about the government and the soldiers of war while also taking Rogers on an emotional journey.<br/><br/>What still baffles me is the fact that the Russo brothers come from a background of directing television comedies such as Arrested Development and Community, I remember seeing the directorial announcement Marvel/Disney put out about bringing them on to direct and I was instantaneously turned off by the idea. Don't get me wrong, I love Arrested Development and Community and I think what they did there was amazing bit I just couldn't see the reason they's put them up to this. It's extraordinary how well they handle a big budget action blockbuster from cinematography to pacing. They do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than Stan Lee, functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story. The score was also awesome, not the most memorable ever but awesome nonetheless. Henry Jackman composes an adrenaline pumping score that sets the right mood every time.<br/><br/>Now, I did have some gripes with the film and the main one being this one.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier does not address the whereabouts of other heroes or where we are in terms of the time line of the other movies. Why can't Captain America call on Tony Stark to help him out or even Hawkeye who is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. himself. It's even illogical for them not to receive a call from Cap given what Cap learns and how vital that info would be to anyone who is working or has ever worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. This is a recurring problem we have seen throughout Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Marvel Studios needs to acknowledge this hiccup if they want us to continue to believe all of these characters live in the same universe together, otherwise the viewers will drop their suspension of disbelief. You cannot exclude these characters once you have opened Pandora's Box.<br/><br/>Marvel Studios has hit this one out of the ball park with yet another gripping adaptation for fans to enjoy. It is the perfect set up for future films and at the same time it increases the value of its predecessors.<br/><br/>Be sure to stick around for the credits because there are two after credit scenes. All things considered, this film will receive a strong 8/10."

","we all know that marvel films sometimes lack in plot, but in such cases they usually compensate with: a)humor b)good acting c)creativity and originality. this film - none of that whatsoever. a predictable plot (first 10 minutes and you already know who the bad guy is), shallow characters, disappointing acting, tedious action scenes with only loud noises to keep you awake...simply a tragedy. The few quips here and there are far from enough for a two hour movie, which on top of that presents quite a dull, grayish setting - no eye candy at all (shame on you marvel). and for a character who pretty much makes up the title of the movie, the winter soldier was...just there - no impressive lines, no stable back story. i think that this movie aimed a bit too high, but ended up being illogical, painfully predictable and all in all - laughable. marvel tried serious? well, marvel failed at serious."

","So another superhero movie. I was hoping it might be at least as good as the first if not better but alas this was really weak (just like Thor II). Some one needs to let movie directors know that action sequences (lots of sequences) do not make up for a really weak plot and exceptionally bad dialog. I agree with a lot of others that they should have developed Cap's story more. His time with his old girl was short and amounted to nothing but I guess they didn't know how not to make it too sad. You know that you're in trouble when the supporting characters are more interesting than your hero and all of your villains. Samuel L again rocks Nick Fury and we all know that Black Widow desires a movie of her own. I could have cared less about the Winter Soldier and poor Robert Redford was really out of place. Everyone should be glad that Shield folded because they really need to start over with some better guys. I hope the next one is a while cause I'm not looking forward to anymore action sequences."

There are scenes in the first film (that we watched before hitting the cinema for this) that make me genuinely smile or utter 'go on Steve'.<br/><br/>To that end I'd been really looking forward to the sequel, especially after I felt he was underused in the Avengers (particularly his deleted scene) and seemed to play second fiddle to Stark, Banner and Black Widow.<br/><br/>After first seeing this film, I really didn't like. So many of the cool scenes and twists in the film had been ruined by trailers that showed way too many iconic moments (the betrayal in the lift, the crashing of the heli-carriers) to the point that they actually ruined my experience.<br/><br/>But over the years I have come to appreciate what a wonderful action film it is. Cap gets a chance to develop, Black Widow becomes more likeable and the action scenes have resonance.<br/><br/>The final fight between Cap and Buck and the music when Cap falls into the water is a beautiful, wonderful scene. Even the end credit sequence with the stark colours is just breathtaking.<br/><br/>A really good film that expands on what was shown in The First Avenger and continues the development of my favourite character into an even better film in Civil War.<br/><br/>Great work from the Russo's and the two writers."

My friend suggested that we go to see this film.<br/><br/>I recall (dimly) seeing the first Captain America film but for some reason I couldn't make any sense of the beginning of this one. It seems that I must have missed a Captain America film at some point as there were lots of references to plot events of which I was completely unaware. Understandably this significantly detracted from my enjoyment.<br/><br/>There is a lot of action in this film; having said that there was only one point at which this succeeded in engaging my attention. Sadly all of it was fairly formulaic cartoon violence, with indestructible people able to withstand the kind of physical traumas that would leave a normal person either hospitalised or deceased. There is also some acting. Not particularly good acting, mind you; the characters seemed to be paper-thin in many cases and the cast gave the impression that they were not hugely interested in anything other than their pay packet.<br/><br/>A plot was present but at this stage I am not interested enough to comment on it.<br/><br/>In summary, if you are a huge fan of mindless Marvel comic films and in particular Captain America then you will lap this up and rave about it to your adolescent friends over a Big Mac while simultaneously Facebooking on your smart phone.

In the following a few examples: SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The propulsion of Director Furys car is destroyed by an explosion, and the damage is fixed by restarting the PC of the car. highly impossible no matter the technological level.<br/><br/>A broken wrist is healed by antibiotics, during a fighting scene. Even so this might be useful in the long term healing of the wrist, but during a gunfight it's probably not the most important thing to do.<br/><br/>Director Furys car has a stationary gun inside the vehicle. This gun safes the live of Fury, however it doesn't explain why it even exists. This gun can only be used to attack people inside the car, why is it stationary? This scenes shows that many gadgets the heroes used were designed by the writes exactly for this one scene, instead they should've tried to create gadgets which might be realistic, and then change the scenes so that the gadgets make a sense, not vice versa.<br/><br/>Fury escapes heavily injured through a hole in the ground. The bad guy super soldier is maybe 2 seconds behind him and doesn't hunt him down by following him into the hole. Why? He is faster, younger and healthier, why not try to follow him? Surely Fury wouldn't have been able to outrun him if the Winter solider would have tried.<br/><br/>The big airships have a very important PC core.

While the main character has his moments and was actually almost convincing in his deadpan sincerity, the Black Widow girl seemed silly, with no subtlety at all - her facetious lines were bad instruments of girl power and didn't come across at all with almost no reaction from the audience. The super-bad guy has already been done in a recent Batman movie and came across as a very poor copy of Darth Vader (without any presence or enjoyable lines).

Shouldn't you see the whole picture instead of checking the actors for nose and ear hair? And what happened to the human factor? It's like they put together a ten minute script and then called 'Action!'. The fight scenes were too many and too exaggerated -- plus there are only about a dozen good people in the entire show. It's like Washington DC...everybody's a bad guy wanting to rule the world. I still enjoyed most of Steve and Natasha's exchanges and there was at least two emotional moments in the movie that were good...but they didn't save the story for us."

","Robert Redford is willing to sacrifice hundreds of millions for the lives of billions, the 'good guys' are willing to kill hundreds to save the lives of those hundreds of millions. Both are playing a numbers game, the only difference is that Redford's is on a bigger scale and isn't hypocritical, he acknowledges the human cost, the 'good guys' treat the hundreds of soldiers they kill (and the many civilian casualties resulting from their lavish tactics) simply as necessary to get the job done. This is a fight of visionaries against hypocrites, and hypocrites win. An awful message, an awful movie. It also has the standard 'just in the nick of time' tropes, ridiculous and impossible fight scenes, a frankly annoying score and the ever-loathable Samuel L Jackson."

","With apologies to the writers of one of George Costanza's more memorable tautologies, I can't think of a more apt description of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"".<br/><br/>The excessive gun violence in this movie - most of it without consequence - is disturbing. It makes ""Commando"" look like a public service announcement from the Brady Campaign. I'm all for 2nd Amendment rights. And the right to eat whatever you want too, but if a movie showed skinny supermodels binging on Pizza Hut, KFC, and Burger King for 2 hours and never gaining a pound, I'd find it similarly unbelievable and irresponsible. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier himself is, without exaggeration, the least inspired villain since The Phantom Menace. And it's much less excusable in this case, because I think just about everybody expects more from the pages of Marvel lore than they do from the creative mind of George Lucas (at least since the mid-1980s). Hey Marvel, if you're going to drop only the slightest of hints at a guy's origins or motivation, you might want to try making him interesting first. <br/><br/>Apart from a brief opening scene on a ship, and a pointless trip to a training ground in New Jersey, the movie was set entirely in and around Washington, DC. News flash: That may be one of the most boring (and phoniest) settings on the planet, even before you add CGI. The last movie that successfully pulled off an all-DC setting came out over 25 years ago (Kevin Costner's ""No Way Out"").<br/><br/>Yeah, I know that the trip to the training ground - during which a supercomputer, imbued with the personality of the nebbish from the first Cap'n America movie, attempted a murder-suicide - was supposed to provide vital plot exposition. But good ole Steve Rogers had already deduced all there was to know about the threadbare plot the minute he saw the new heli-carriers (*audible groan* ""Not heli-carriers again?"")<br/><br/>I guess I'll have to check the FAQs or the message board to figure out what's going on with Nick Fury. I must be too dense to have grasped it. Is he dead, alive, a clone, or what? I'll also have to check with the comic book fans to find out whether Falcon was as forced and unnecessary in the monthlies as he was in this movie.<br/><br/>As for Captain America, the whole series is kind of embarrassing. I mean, Chris Evans is a handsome guy, apparently very muscular now, and likable. But he's already played the Human Torch so why does he get to come back as a different Marvel Universe character just because the Fantastic Four movies sucked? What's next, Tobey Maguire as Mysterio? Then again, Jessica Alba as Spider-Woman would be OK, so never mind.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a good movie about heavily armed aerial urban pacification vehicles whose developers are secretly nefarious, watch ""Blue Thunder"" instead. You'll save 30 minutes that you can use to go out to Quiznos. I hear they have zero-calorie sandwiches now."

","The main thing I enjoyed about the first Captain America film was its period setting, so when it was obvious that future films wouldn't have this, I doubted I would like the Captain America sequel as much. Turns out, Captain America: The Winter Soldier isn't only better than the first movie, it rivals The Avengers.<br/><br/>Chris Evans is a great lead, and he builds on his role, the character has more personal conflicts than he did in his first solo film and The Avengers. Scarlett Johansson continues to improve on her role as Black Widow, she has a very good balance of intelligence, fighting ability, and emotion. She's also very attractive. Actually, scratch that. She's more like one of the closest people I can think of to being physically perfect. Nick Fury is given more to do this time around, a considerable improvement over his role in Iron Man 2 when the most memorable thing he did was telling Tony Stark to get off a donut. Anthony Mackie is also very good, and they make sure to establish him well before just putting him in the action.<br/><br/>Something that was lacking in Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World was the villains, and they're much better in this film. They're more interesting than the others villains of Marvel's Phase 2 so far, and there's a lot of cool twists revolving around them. The action sequences are terrific, using practical effects whenever the filmmakers are able to and using quality CGI at other times. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 was nothing more than decent, and Thor: The Dark World was a bit of an improvement. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is easily the best film of this phase yet, and if the films themselves along with Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Samuel L. Jackson's performances continue to get better as they have so far, Avengers: Age of Ultron is something I'm definitely looking forward to."

","Review: This theme was seen in M:I-4 and Skyfall, where the hero has to hide and use his brains. Now with Captain America, I thought the first movie was okay, one of the better Marvel movies, not great but OK, so I went along with my friend hoping for something better. It gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up. 3D technology appears to be very lacking for fast close action fighting sequences.<br/><br/>The biggest fault found in The Winter Soldier is that it does not address the whereabouts of other heroes or where we are in terms of the time line of the other movies. Scarlet isn't looking beautiful; the Hawk guy - where did he come from? Why can't Captain America call on Tony Stark to help him out or even Hawk-eye who is a member of Shiel himself?

"ironhorse_iv","8","9","16","5 April 2014"," O' Captain, My Captain. All Hail, the Captain! Captain America: Winter Soldier was pretty badass.
","From an optimistic WWII Pulp-inspired adventure movie to a morally ambiguous modern espionage thriller. While, Captain America: The Winter Soldier was indeed, a sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger, the movie is only somewhat similar to that. Rather than facing cookie cutter type evil villains like the Nazism Hydra. Captain America (Chris Evans) find himself, in a world where it's harder to find who the villains are, as everybody has a shade of grey becoming more and more disillusioned as members of S.H.I.E.L.D attacking him. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the movie deals with a 2002's Minority Report precognition type plot that somewhat mirrors a lot of the post-Watergate political fears of the government will create something that will preemptively eliminate any future threats to national security without fair trials or judgment. It's also is a metaphor for the actual surveillance crap done by the NSA & drones strikes that most Americans find disturbing. Another motif is the increasing security measures the United States government has done since 9/11. The movie also tend to want to bring up Hydra again into this, as I thought it didn't had to, as it kinda made the realistic political power structure more cartoony. The Hydra subplot is just as ridiculous as the real life belief of Illuminati taking over the government, but I guess it kinda make sense, as Operation Paperclip was indeed a real life event thing. Still, I doubt a bunch of Nazism are leading the country. I thought it would better suited for H.A.M.M.E.R or the Thunderbolts. Something new from the comics. Still, this movie truly respects the philosophy and moral aspect that Captain America as a character represents towards America's society. ""This isn't freedom. This is fear,"" -Captain America, he quotes about what's happening to the country. While, the movie is title, the Winter Soldier. Without spoiling who he is, he plays more like a henchman, than the leading villain. Adapted from the comic book, the origins of his past is way different here on the film as the movie blends elements from various sources and continuities. A good example of big change is key comic characters like Aleksander Lukin and Vasily Karpov are replaced. Still, the Winter Soldier isn't underplayed as he get a lot of scenes throughout the film. He is pretty awesome and match well to Captain America. Some of the hand to hand combat are just intense to watch. Most of the action scenes seem extremely realistic grounded and believable, even if it's bit over sci-fi and Captain America almost looks like God-like. I like how the action isn't all CGI orgy. The limit CGI in the film was used well in the last part of the film. The live action scenes get better with all the paranoia sub plot as you don't know, who is to be trusted and who isn't. Sadly, the movie is pretty predictable as who is the villains. The plot twists are not delivery correctly. I do find it, distracting that the movie makes up new or bring up new inventions on the spot, just for the villains or the heroes to escape. Too much deus ex machinas. Another thing, I dislike about the comic book movies is how often, they give us these 'fake' deaths, only to bring back the character later on the film, or in a sequel. If you going to kill a major character. People need to stay dead, or the film will lose a bit of sense of danger. There is a few shaky cam that hurt a little bit and some awful cuts. Another thing is while it's can be watch in 3D, there isn't much in the film that makes you want to. It's better off, if you watch the film in 2D. One last thing, there is a lot of nods to the first Captain film, 2012's Avengers, and even 2011's & 2013's Thor's movies as video clips, sight gags, or name references are throughout the film that pretty cool to see. It also felt like dumb recapping or exposition. Still, it was a bit odd to hear Dr. Strange. That would be interesting if he ever show up in a Marvel film. There are sight gags to other films like Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, War Games and others, worth watching out for. The acting in the film is pretty good. Falcon's (Anthony Mackie) presence is similarly unnecessary, but it's cool to have him around. He's pretty useful. Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) has nothing to do with his comic book counterpart, but he's just amazing. I love how Redford is hired for this film because of his work in previous political thrillers. I like how Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) opened up more in this movie. We got to see more of her vulnerable and human side, and her deeply hidden desire to connect with someone on a human level. A great female character for women. No, silly love story here. Still, how could she be a byproduct of the Cold War KGB if she was born 1983 and the Cold War ended in 1991? That doesn't make any sense. Also where is Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) in throughout the events of the film? I thought he was a top S.H.I.E.L.D agent and he doesn't shown up. Not even a cameo! Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) got a pretty good action sequence. Also looks out for other nameless cameos that you would play bigger parts in the next Captain America movie like Agent 13 (Emily VanCamp) & Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo). Without spoiling the ending, it's bittersweet. The monochrome, symbolism-packed closing credits are reminiscent of the credits for a spy thriller such as one of the James Bond films. There is two after credits scenes worth noting. One is hinting 2015's Avengers: Age of Ulton. The other one is more closure. Also look for the Stan Lee Cameo. Overall: A wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great film"

","It's only April and already this gets my vote for worst film of the year. The first scene is utterly cringe-worthy. Chris Evans and Anthony Mackie (like a young Will Smith) buddy up whilst jogging round a park in Washington DC. It's stilted and humourless. Chris Evans doesn't wear a mask all the time but he might as well for all the expression he puts into things. The film then elevates Samuel L. Jackson (with eye-patch) to centre-stage to good, adrenalin-fuelled effect but immediately kills him off as soon as he gets our sympathy. Robert Redford emerges a few seconds later, to fill the Alpha Daddy void, without hitherto being mentioned. His job is to pump up the film's credibility but the political plot stinks. I walked out the theatre at this point. What makes me most sad is that I really liked the first Captain America film, which is the reason I made the effort to see this one as soon as it came to town. I guess it must have been the interest of the 1950s setting which made it for me, as this sequel completely alienated me. Perhaps also, Chris Evans fitted the role as a squeaky-clean postwar guy. In the 21st century he's as much fun as watching paint dry."
"sunshinebeachcinema","8","6","10","20 April 2014"," A slick modern conspiracy thriller.
","There's no point in denying that the new Captain America movie is anything less than another instalment in the superhero saturation of the last ten years, but although the Captain himself has been considered the blandest of the bunch, at least as far as The Avengers (2012) is concerned. It's still a fantastic world of unbelievable stunts and perfectly timed one-liners, but the new film offers a lot more depth than some of the weaker superhero fare on offer.<br/><br/>In addition to the ambitious Marvel Cinematic Universe, the rich tapestry of interwoven stories that Disney's Marvel Studios has been crafting at the rate of about two blockbusters a year since 2008's Iron Man, we have seen everything from the unrelated narratives of Marvel's Spiderman and X-men series, to the gritty reboots of rival DC classics like Superman and Batman. The Marvel Universe alone is an unprecedented shared universe multimedia franchise, extending from the silver screen to various short films, television series and tie-in comic books.<br/><br/>Wanton American patriotism is far from internationally popular, and the challenge with Captain America as a character is to give this bastion of United States glory modern appeal. The first film took the character back to his roots, giving us a brilliant pulp action adventure, set during the character's 1940s heyday.<br/><br/>This was an easy place to be Captain America, but after being dragged into the twenty first century in time for The Avengers, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) must work out what America stands for today, and decide what he represents. The temporal displacement is a rich vein to be mined for soul searching and character interpretation.<br/><br/>As a pawn of SHIELD, the superhero intelligence organisation: our Nazi- punching hero has been reduced to a shady covert operative who is unsure if the missions he is sent on are aiding or abetting the forces of evil. This insecurity comes to a head when he learns of SHIELD's Project Insight, a sinister initiative which operates under the twin axes of surveillance and pre-emptive strikes, undeniably referencing drone controversy and the concerns over US internal surveillance. Thus The Winter Soldier is an espionage thriller, firmly rooted in modern day concerns, but with a style heavily influenced, according to the directors, by cold war conspiracy thrillers from the 1970s.<br/><br/>Events are still very much rooted in the events of the first film, mysterious forces have been working in the background since the end of the war, and the Captain finds himself battling enemies both old and new. Symbolically, he trades his brand new twenty first century black and navy blue uniform for his bright red, white and blue wartime clobber before the film is out.<br/><br/>As is the case with many comic book movies, I am impressed to learn that much which transpires on screen, no matter how incredible or brief, is in fact distilled from the original comics over their seventy year history. I'm certainly not the one to personally notice all this detail, but it's apparently crammed full of nods to various eras, arcs and character backgrounds.<br/><br/>To someone unfamiliar with the source material, the Icarus-like wingsuit/jetpack used by The Falcon struck me as a trifle ridiculous at first glance, at odds with the more serious tone of the film. I was quick to dismiss his presence as a poor substitute for the absent Iron Man, but The Falcon is a legitimate Marvel superhero.<br/><br/>Despite my misgivings, the characterisation of Falcon, real name Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), was strong. An Air Force veteran, he shares Rogers' military background and helps him adjust to the modern world. Later, he demonstrates his loyalty when he is called upon once the Captain becomes a fugitive.<br/><br/>Of course, the question having over every post-Avengers solo movie is why characters neglect to call in their superpowered chums to save the day in a fraction of the time. In whipping out his veritable army of automated armour suits at the end of Iron Man 3 (2013) Tony Stark proved that he didn't need to assemble the Avengers even to save the President.<br/><br/>There is a slight aversion in that Captain America does spend the whole film working closely with fellow Avenger Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who has been largely sidelined in her previous appearances. The truth is that having fewer lead characters mean more attention can be given to others, and Johansson is finally given some significant screen time. Black Widow's alluring presence is welcome throughout, her moral ambiguity and chequered past providing a stark contrast to the Captain's clear cut integrity.<br/><br/>Similarly, SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is much more important to the story than the cameo status he has held until now. By contrast, the eponymous Winter Soldier, a bionic badass bearing Soviet livery has little screen time, initially filling the role of unbeatable enforcer to the villains, and the only individual strong enough to challenge the Captain, but his tragic presence is vital to the overarching saga. Also noteworthy is Robert Redford's appearance as a sinister SHIELD executive.<br/><br/>Freedom, the most American of values, nevertheless carries a global relevance, and remains a major theme, but any overt patriotism is relatively, and wisely downplayed, despite the character's name and apparent raison d'être. What's left is a solid conspiracy blockbuster, with the superhero status incidental aside from enabling higher octane action sequences than a subtler spy movie."

","I have to admit that after the first Avengers film, I wondered where the franchise would go. With the five films that went before it, surely there was only so many ways we could see a superhero bash a bad-guy.<br/><br/>Well, after an impressive Iron Man 3 and Thor sequel, I can tell you that Captain America does not disappoint and things are all looking rather good for Disney/Marvel. In fact, it may well be the best of the '2nd phase' films, if not one of the best of the series!<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, this film feels like a genuine Marvel story. It has all the superhero ingredients, but mixed in with a good dose of conspiracy thriller. It feels tense and very real in places; probably more-so due to the off- world antics of Thor in the previous movie, this connects to the audience due to its 'real world' setting. Captain America is a hero but also not invincible, The Winter Soldier is a genuine nemesis, the Captains comrades (no spoilers), are all well written. Key to all of these modern Marvel films, is how to introduce the characters in modern films without them looking daft. And with this film a new Avenger is introduced, and it works 100%.<br/><br/>The CGI is kept to a necessary minimum, with lots of action feeling chunky & real, much like the Bourne films. And the 3D adverts that preceded the film: Spiderman2; X-Men; and Guardians of the Galaxy, all look to be cracking films in their own right.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is definitely worth a cinema viewing, with a big bag of popcorn.<br/><br/>The only grumble I have is that the 3D is rather redundant, compared to films like Gravity etc.<br/><br/>Make sure you stay to the very end of the credits, as there are two interesting scenes to be enjoyed, which leave threads open as usual."

","... is only one of the great many interesting and useful things I learned while watching this film. But my learning experience was, I think, secondary to that of the two-man writing team who, it appears, de-constructed Whedon's Avengers script line by line, and ultimately deduced the secret recipe for a top-level superhero film. Constant non-stop action. Great characters with great dialogue. Smart rejoinders. The occasional shot of estrogen to mix it up. Honor the ""origins"" and integrate the plot arc from the earlier entry. Constant non-stop action. A ""staggered"" story that keeps presenting ever-greater challenges to the hero. Surprises. More estrogen. More non-stop action. More witty dialogue. Mix well and bake for about 2 hours. The end result is so good you almost wonder aloud why all the ""other"" superhero movies you have seen in your lifetime were not this good. Makes THE DARK KNIGHT look like an afternoon TV soap. (And here is the ultimate IMDb review non-sequitur. """"Scarlett Johansson for President!"" This notion just popped into my head during the film and I simply have to share it.

","Marvel Studios continue their extravagant adventure in their 'Avengers Universe' with the second Captain America film, the third to feature the titular hero and the 9th to be set in this particular Marvel universe (until a future film merges all of them together). The material put forward by Marvel in the follow up of the Avengers film have been unfortunately a little stale, with Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World both coming off slightly dull in comparison to their previous amalgamation. Captain America has however struck a strong chord with some British cinema viewers as well as reviewers, others dispute the claims that this is 'the best Marvel film so far'.<br/><br/>The film is unchallenging in any degree. The formula of action set- pieces, cool quips and a quick dip in the pool of emotion rarely fails Marvel and is frequented in their films but after the extravagance of the Avengers the mark still has not quite been hit. The Winter Solider is indisputably the better of the post-Avengers films but still comes off fairly dull when mounted with the high expectations one has over Marvel films, an expectation slowly being shown the light of reality. The lack of many high-scope set pieces does allow some breathing room for the cast but the consistent running and gunning does water down any emotional bond toward the cast. The running and gunning however is done exceptionally well, Capt. himself ten times more active than in his previous run in and moves away from the star spangled banner into a tighter, more cutting edge stealth beating up machine. The large set pieces are great to watch when they do arrive, the slightly larger ones could benefit with a bit more 'realism' instead of looking like a port from a video game.<br/><br/>Though criticism can be subjective, none can ignore the matter of The Winter Soldier himself. Everyone knows who he really is, it's no disguise. But in the film he's barely a lead role, he's the equivalent of Oddjob to Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce (who does provide a good antithesis). The Winter Soldier however should have been the forefront of the film, instead what was displayed was a culturally relevant plot- line with a cool villain.<br/><br/>The plot-lines focus on pre-emptive justice and worldwide surveillance, peace through fear, is something of relevance in our era, especially during these post-Snowden months. The resulting story comes off with a moderate sigh, the aim too ridiculously imbalanced and no daringness in the continuity. And as aforementioned, where was The Winter Soldier. <br/><br/>A redeeming factor of the sub-titular character is however his music, the scream that plays when he enters a scene or commits an act really helps make the character seem darker. The end result ended up almost unnecessary for his involvement.<br/><br/>That being said it's a popcorn flick and it's entertaining whilst providing a dip into the Marvel universe again before Guardians of the Galaxy. If The Winter Soldier is anything to go on it will be explosions and quips. There's nothing wrong with this, James Bond did it for 40 years. It's keeping it fresh though and if Marvel want to continue their legacy they need to quicken their pace before the hype before the next sequel is equivalent to the visit from estranged family members you'd rather ignore.<br/><br/>Credit is due for being an entertaining film for the most part, as well as having a relevant plot-line. The Marvel universe needs an ounce of freshness however, perhaps a deviation from the ever repeating formula in favour of a more striking, surprising and emotionally engaging story."
"gerry_barnaby","10","8","15","26 March 2014"," Best sequel I've seen, fast action & good story-line
","Wow, probably the best sequel I've seen in a film, although the plot was a little weak as to carry on the hydra story-line which was OK not the best idea but the action is off the chart's which redeem's that side of the story it well balanced.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is the darkest story we've come to encounter, raising many deep-seated questions about government and soldiers of war while also taking Rogers on an emotional journey. It also has the best action choreography among all of the MCU movies thus far. Whedon's NYC battle in The Avengers is beautifully shot and written, but cannot compare to the hard-hitting set pieces found in The Winter Soldier, each building up to the bigger whole. The Russo brothers come from a background of directing television comedies such as Arrested Development and Community, and it's extraordinary how well they handle a big budget action blockbuster from cinematography to pacing. They do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than Stan Lee, functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story. Henry Jackman (Captain Phillips; Wreck-It Ralph; X-Men: First Class) also composes an adrenaline pumping score that sets the right mood every time. There is one faultier in this film tho that could of been in this film, Anthony Mackie as the falcon done a fantastic job in his role he looked amazing,Scarlett Johansson as black widow done brilliantly as well, but i felt like this film could of done with iron man or hawk eye to help captain America as well in this film as they were shield agents as well they were no where to be seen. I think marvel failed on that point despite this film be fantastic because i think they could of been called in to help as well, Good thing about the story-line as well is it revels what really happened to buck before he became the winter soldier i thought that was well put & clear to understand, also a good move was to bring back Hayley Atwell character Peggy carter i think that was a nice touch to the film slightly emotional as well. I never would of thought that you would get Samuel L. Jackson & Robert Redford in the same film together two brilliant actors that played there roles brilliant in this film,I don't know if it just me but the fight scene were mental & brutal just the way he throw he's shield with such force it make you cringe to think what that must be like to get hit with that force. This is a film well worth the money & film i recommend watch on the big screen which as always with marvel film's there is a scene mid credit that ties in with the Avengers 2 film which revels surprising character's if you have already know who they are & a scene at the end of the credit roll.This is a must see."

","Captain America: The Winter Soldier does not emphasize Captain America (Chris Evans) very much, it seems. The movie feels a bit like another mini-Avengers movie, bringing back Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and introducing a new character, Falcon (Anthony Mackie) to assist Captain America.<br/><br/>The plot, while intense, seemed a bit too intense. I found myself wondering at times during the movie why more of the other Avengers didn't help, as once again, the fate of the world (or at least the nation) is thrown into peril.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier, while an interesting villain to face off against Captain America, feels a little under-emphasized to be Captain America's nemesis in a feature movie. The plot and main action stifle a subplot that otherwise could have served as an interesting plot on its own for Captain America to navigate.<br/><br/>However, the acting is well-done, and Captain America does amazing feats as expected. The movie is filled with the visual spectacle of an Avengers movie. But the movie could have been better if it had more focus on a single clear struggle, such as the struggle between Captain America and the Winter Soldier, rather than get bogged down in a larger plot that could have been better suited to a multi-hero story. <br/><br/>Really, what Captain America: The Winter Soldier needed was more Captain America, and more Winter Soldier."

"eddie_baggins","5","4","6","20 August 2014"," The Captain needs more to stay relevant
","Captain America's first solo venture in Joe Johnston's 2011 film was met with a relative ho-hum reception and rightfully so thanks to a pedestrian like telling of an arguably far more interesting character, but due to 2012's mega hit The Avengers, Captain America found a whole new level of popularity and the prospect of seeing him defrosted into a modern day solo scenario all of a sudden became a much more appealing venture. With TV comedy mainstays the Russo Brothers behind the helm, hopes were high that the Captain would shun the mediocrity of the first instalment and deliver in what is really a cold war thriller masked in disguise as a superhero adventure, but finished results suggest that Captain America remains alongside the Hulk, the weakest of Marvel's solo journeys.<br/><br/>It's hard to pinpoint exactly what disallows Captain America to truly achieve its potential, yet despite this being far more polished than its World War 2 set predecessor this venture still feels frustratingly light on heart and soul and Rogers/Captain America as a character feels distant inducing cold when we really need him to be the beating heart centre of a pretty stock standard predictable heroes v villains tale. In saying this it's a nice change of pace that for much of this film you feel as though you're watching a thriller not an average CGI beat-em up that sadly feels undone by a more stock standard and overlong finale. It's almost as if Marvel didn't truly have the confidence in shunning their usual 3rd act shtick and it will be a joy to one day witness a less mundane us against the world last act. While what ends this blockbuster may be more typical, a major plus for Winter Soldier is what occurs sporadically throughout, thanks to the direction of the Russo Brothers.<br/><br/>The Russo Brothers bring a fresh perspective to many scenes throughout Winter Soldier, from an untypical car chase sequence involving Nick Fury early on, an elevator dust up that feels like something out of the Raid and a neat freeway showdown with the titular Winter Solider feeling like a Heat showdown, there are great moments in a film that seems torn between becoming something different yet playing to what the audience expects/wants. Humour littered amongst the film also at times strikes a nice rhythm, which is to be expected from the men who have crafted some of Arrested Development and Community's strongest episodes and the brothers draw out nice turns from Evans (despite not an overabundance of charm, which he is capable of) and Johansson, yet the supports don't achieve too much with Robert Redford wasted in his role as Alexander Pierce.<br/><br/>You get the feeling that there is room still to grow for the Captain America solo brand but you also can't shake the overwhelming sense that his best work will always be a part of the Avengers ensemble. A hard time seems to be had figuring out exactly how to portray the Captain and a hero that spends a majority of his time throwing a shield at bad guys can only really be taken so far. If Captain America really wants to take itself to new heights a throwing out of the rulebook must take place, an occurrence that happens mildly throughout this film only to be reigned back in again by the Marvel schoolmasters. Winter Solider isn't particularly bad, but it's also entirely forgettable and for superheros that is a mortal sin.<br/><br/>2 and a half convenient escape holes out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
"peakcrew","6","10","20","27 March 2014"," Good, but flawed
","I really wanted to like this movie, and in many ways I did. It is quite a taut thriller with action scenes done very well. Chris Evans makes Captain America into a likable hero that I could consider supporting if he actually existed. Most of the villains are such that I *really* wanted them to hurt - badly. However, one thing that annoyed me is that the character the movie is co-named for - The Winter Soldier - was nothing but just another cybernetic baddie with a bad haircut. There was nothing special about him to warrant a place in the title.<br/><br/>So, why am I so ambivalent about the whole thing? Well, viewed as ""James Bond with a shield"" (or ""with SHIELD""), this is a great movie. As a standalone movie within a franchise that does not have to relate back to any others, it would be 8 out of 10 with no difficulties. However, it isn't - this is set in a world where other SHIELD operatives exist. One of the constraints placed upon the writers by this is that you cannot just forget about them in order to develop the story of one in particular,and introduce another. Therefore, to ask the audience to believe that Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Thor, Hawkeye, Coulson etc *would not know* that Fury has been attacked, or that Washington is having strange things happen, is insulting. Not one of these characters is mentioned (oh, tell a lie - Tony Stark is mentioned in passing as having developed new engines for the heli-carriers). It is laziness in the extreme for the writers not to give some reason for the absence of characters we *know* would be there in minutes if they were able to. Such disrespect for the audience, many of whom are extremely knowledgeable about he world that has been created is completely unacceptable.<br/><br/>On a different note, I wonder if this film is going to become regarded as prescient for being essentially a modern Cold War movie?"
"danieldemir7","Null","7","13","9 August 2014"," Another soulless horrible Marvel Movie
","The dialogue is absolutely horrid, the acting uninspired and considering what they have to work with it's no wonder. The action scenes are made for 10 year old kids, it's embarrassing to watch.<br/><br/>There is absolutely zero tension, movies like this are supposed to have us on the edge of our seat. And on good old Cap himself, I just cringe hard, there is nothing captivating about him at all. Natasha's aura of fake is palpable. <br/><br/>I feel sorry for this generation and I pity those who watch this and think it's a fantastic movie.

","In an attempt to stop evil things from happening, Captain America teams up and fights the good fight. No, I'm not talking about the Howling Commandoes or the Avengers. It's Agent Hill, the Black Widow and Falcon he teams up with. One might call this a ""light version"" of the Avengers, but movie-wise it goes toe-to-toe with it and even stands a chance of winning.<br/><br/>For one; CA:TWS has a superior plot. Plotwise, the Avengers - a great movie in all respects – was basically a MacGuffin chase with a big random fight in the end. CA:TWS is a political thriller, a spy movie if you like. Choque full of intrigues. But with Super Heroes...<br/><br/>The characterization in this movie is pretty amazing. There is depth added to the already established characters of Cap, Fury and Widow. The relationship between Cap and Fury has obviously evolved since the last time we saw the two, as Cap is now on first name basis with Fury. On the other hand, the trust issues that are glimpsed at in The Avengers have grown to an extent of animosity. We also see Cap dealing with his new reality and seeking closure for his old one. Then, last but not least, the way Falcon is introduced is flat-out BEAUTIFUL.<br/><br/>As for the bad guys... it is pretty obvious to figure which is which. They do have a Deus Ex Machina on their side, namely the Winter Soldier – after which the movie was called. However, in the first two acts he remains rather side-casted; quite like Malekith in Thor: The Dark World. Towards the end, this little problem gets fixed more.<br/><br/>Then... o my... the cinematography. It is beautiful. The 3D works best in the quieter scenes, when you have time to take it all in. And thankfully, the movie has plenty of that. But it does not only have quieter scenes. The action scenes are equally beautiful. Although the movie is not completely free of shaky cam, it is not overused. Actually, the use of shaky cam is so fitting, you barely notice it's there. The effects are as much practical and as little digital as possible, giving the movie a feel of reality that is very rare these days.<br/><br/>If all of this isn't enough, the movie is superfluous in call-backs, tie-ins, references and easter eggs that give the movie so much for viewers who are familiar with the universe as established in earlier movies. Mentions of Iron Man, Bruce Banner, Stark Industries, and so forth. And also, we get the first mention of Dr. Strange. <br/><br/>This movie is the best phase 2 Marvel movie thus far."
"benjamin-ryan","9","7","13","9 April 2014"," Captain America The Winter Soldier Film Review
","Captain America The Winter Soldier is a thrilling throwback to 1970s spy thrillers and an excellent action adventure. Sprinkled with humour it does what every good sequel should do, surpass the first in every way possible. Twists and turns are aplenty and the 2 hour and 16 minute runtime moves at a swift pace and the viewer is never bored as there is such variety.<br/><br/>The film deals with the titular hero Captain America aka; Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), attempt at adapting to modern times. This notion was severely lacking in The Avengers and cut to help with the pacing of the movie. An emotional scene that was supposed to be in The Avengers, was when Steve Rogers met Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), after not seeing her for years. It evoked a sense of sadness as she was the last link to his past. Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) 'Falcon' is introduced and becomes Captain America's sidekick in the vein of Batman's, Robin. Captain America's mistrust of both Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and the organization Shield in general are another big focus in the movie.<br/><br/>The film does an excellent job at fleshing out the characters, particularly Steve Rogers, Black Widow and Nick Fury, and in doing so makes the viewer care about them in ways not seen before in any of the previous films. This is especially the case with the Black Widow, who we see more of and Nick Fury who tells about his grandfather who operated a elevator. The main villain of the movie alluded to in the movie title is The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who is one of the best villains in a Marvel movie, so much so that he could become a fan favourite, like Loki. The Winter Soldier is menacing, intimidating and an unstoppable force. He has an air about him similar to the Terminator and the fact that he can go toe to toe with Captain America and be a major threat to him throughout the whole movie, is something special compared to other villains in movies, who are all talk but can't back it up.<br/><br/>The fight choreography and action sequences were some of, if not the best, I've seen to date. The first battle between Captain America and The Winter Soldier on the highway is a clear highlight of the movie. The Winter Soldier gives Captain America a run for his money and was able to take on Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon at the same time without breaking a sweat. The same could be said for the CGI and effects which were stunning.<br/><br/>There was not much hype for Captain American - The Winter Soldier, yet ironically it is the best Marvel Studios film released, far surpassing The Avengers, which will surprise people who haven't seen this film. I highly recommend this movie. Although you can watch it without seeing the first Captain America – The First Avenger, or The Avengers for full appreciation of the series I recommend that you view these first as you will get so much more out of the movie. Make sure to stay until the end of the movie, as there are two post credit scenes, one of which helps lead into The Avengers 2."

","That's just about right, that should've been the title, honest.<br/><br/>I didn't have huge expectations when I went to see this film and I was right. The entire film is captured in the trailer and there is not much left to see on the big screen.<br/><br/>The plot: Captain Steve ""America"" Rogers played by Chris Evans returns for the second time to the save the world, and by world I mean America, from the faintly remembered HYDRA, the hi-tech Nazi Unit in Captain America 1. There are a lot of references to the first film, better watch it once to refresh your memory, if you can sit through that one again. The film entirely revolves around 3 characters, mainly Steve Rogers, Falcon and Black Widow and the occasional kick-ass appearance of The Winter Soldier. Kinda makes you wonder throughout the film where, at least one other Avengers member is. The film is littered with clichés, references and many highly obvious plot points that you could predict the story and leave the cinema 30 minutes into the film.<br/><br/>The movie is action packed and certainly better than it's predecessor. The Winter Soldier scenes are intense and the sequences are very precisely coordinated. Cinematography, directing are plus points and the occasional humor is appreciated in an otherwise blatant Avengers: The Age of Ultron set up.<br/><br/>One time watch, for Scarlett Johansson and The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>(Don't sit through the credits for the post credits scene, isn't worth the wait.)"
"RevRonster","10","7","13","5 April 2014"," Another great addition to the MCU...
","I'll just throw it out there: Ever since Marvel Studios put out ""Iron Man"" and started Phase One of their shared cinematic universe, I have loved every single second of every single movie they have produced. Currently in Phase Two that builds towards ""The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron,"" Marvel came out of the gate running with a more mature ""Iron Man 3,"" a vastly expansive but ultimately more personal ""Thor: The Dark World"" and now we have Captain America returning for a politically themed thriller/action drama in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and, not surprisingly, it is amazing! <br/><br/>The returning players like Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders once again prove why they were cast in their respective roles. Evans proves he's the man to throw the shield and it was excellent seeing more depth to Black Widow this time around. Additionally, adding Robert Redford to the cast was an amazing decision; for more reasons than just the fact the guy is a legend. Redford really captured the ambiguous, is he good/is he bad, mentality of senior S.H.I.E.L.D. executive Alexander Pierce. Furthermore, it was nice to see Sebastian Stan return as Bucky/The Winter Soldier, rather than just recast him with a more marketable name. Stan really delivered as this iconic Marvel character and was capable of being a terrific badass, an exceptional threat to Capt., and, as well as, a sympathetic character with a broken past.<br/><br/>Finally, I was very excited to see Falcon added to the story. I'm a fan of the character and he was brought to the screen very faithfully and played tremendously by Anthony Mackie.<br/><br/>Like all Marvel and superhero movies in general, ""The Winter Soldier"" delivered amazingly with the action—the fight scenes between Capt. and the Winter Soldier also entirely make the film because they are fast, hard-hitting and all kinds of exciting—but the added element of political and social commentary through the story and themes of paranoia, security and freedom in our post 9/11 society really made the film feel mature and an answer to the critics who think comic books are just cartoons.<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is just another win for Marvel and their epic cinematic universe. The story is great, the action is beyond satisfying and the drama and political intrigue fit in perfectly—not to mention the usual mid-credit sequence made me geek out like crazy! I have no complaints about this film and, once again, Marvel continues to prove they are making something incredible.<br/><br/>Hey there!

These warriors fight evil without the usual encumbrances of sci-fi thriller formulas. The film is a fine work of comic-book nostalgia and real-world sensibility. And it happens to be over two hours of fun as evidenced by the humor in the above quote.<br/><br/>When Captain America has to contend with a baddie played by the perpetual goodie, Robert Redford, you know this adventure is going to be a unique one. Alexander Pierce (Redford) plans to make the world a better place by eliminating 20 million rebels through an algorithm long ago created when Steve Rogers was a normal soldier. From there, you have to see the film to catch the sometimes creative but always entertaining screenplay.<br/><br/>This thriller pleases me because it is complex enough to keep me trying to fit all the puzzle pieces but humane enough to keep me engaged with the characters, whom I understand better than most in similar sci-fi outings.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a smart film with warmth and humor, a pleasant viewing experience at a poor time of year for seeing good movies. You know Captain America saves America, but that's not the point: If you're thrilled by special-effects action, including some real vehicles, and want to care about the characters and dislike the bad guys, then you're in for a sweet experience, saved, so to speak, from a dead-zone movie time of the year.<br/><br/>""Captain, in Order to build a better world, sometimes means turning the old one down...

","Action wise, this is a good movie, but the problems start here when you have e.g. three heli carriers going down directly in the city or exactly where they lifted of, respectively. Or the very unbelievable falcon. On the other side, you have ordinary gunfights, so this is quite far stretched. Then we have the story around Hydra, which is completely implausible, added by Caps old friend Bucky. Btw, the title of the movie ""The Winter Soldier"" is quite misleading, cause he is only a quite minor part of the story. So, regarding this, you get the usual Hollywood big style action and effects show, but way, way exaggerated, and a quite lame story. The interesting thing may be the underlying message, if there is really one. By this, I mean the fact that the whole Shield structure was undermined and by this doing the exact opposite of what if was intended to. If this is so, there could be hidden critics to US policy, but I wouldn't call this for sure. If so, Cap would have to fight the system itself in the next part. That would be something! Taken this aside, good, but predictable standard Hollywood action. Nothing to get too excited about. Which is sad, because in this Captain America incarnation Evans got better, the transition to the modern world worked out, the combination with Captain America has a lot of potential and you start to develop a relation to Cap because he is (almost) on his own, has to fight the odds and doesn't feel like a invincible guy, you can see that he is ""enhanced"", but still human. Especially the fight in the elevator is great and good old style action. Instead they focus again on high tech and simply go to far with all this heli carrier, falcon and ""kill them all"" thing. That's why it is a lost opportunity."

","has an all-star cast of Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansen and Robert Redford, just to name a few, all of whom gave stunning performances. The story itself is a bit more complex than most comic book movies, as for much of it, there are three loosely related plots unfolding simultaneously, not even considering any subplots or back-stories. There are repeated combat/action sequences, involving both astounding physical and firearms feats, which are engaging as well as memorable. There are a few plot twists, some more telegraphed than others, but all acceptable; except for one incident that was taken from 'The Avengers' and 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' series, which felt cheap and used. The biggest issue that I had was that very few conflicts were actually solved, while a plentiful bounty were presented. If you're after closure, Captain America ""2"" is not for you. On the other hand, if you were a fan of 'Lost's' seemingly endless array of revealed, yet abandoned situations, you might feel right at home here. A point most aptly stated by the not one, but two mid/post-credit teasers.

"Joejoesan","9","12","26","23 March 2014"," The best Marvel movie since Spider-Man 2 and X-Men 2
","If you've been watching the internet the last few weeks you may know that most journalists raved about Captain America : The Winter Soldier. And they were all right: the latest Captain America outing isn't only far better than part 1; I even dare to say that it's in the same league as Spider-Man 2 (2004) and X-Men 2 (2003). The Winter Soldier is spectacular in its action scenes and the chemistry between the hero (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is undeniable.<br/><br/>One of the strengths of Captain America part 1 was the atmosphere: I loved the fact that it took place during World War II and therefor had some historical and nostalgic flavor. However, after the events of The Avengers it was clear that the second movie would take place in modern day America. How could the makers maintain the same mood and spirit of The First Avenger?<br/><br/>Well, directors John and Anthony Russo both succeed in that. Without giving away too many spoilers you can say that The Winter Soldier uses a lot of the elements that was presented to us in the first movie. Hydra returns for example - and does that in a very big way. Another important character from part 1 comes back to haunt Steve Rogers. There are actually so many things from the first movie that I would recommend you'd watch that one first before you see this new movie.<br/><br/>The story of The Winter Soldier centers on SHIELD. Steve Rogers and Nick Fury discover that the organization is compromised and must find out who's behind all this. In the meantime Rogers meets the mysterious and powerful Winter Soldier, who not only kills one of his colleagues but also seems to have a familiar face. But who is he? Looks like the only one he can trust is Natasha Romanoff. Luckily he also befriends an ex-soldier called Sam Wilson (The Falcon), who turns out to be a big help.<br/><br/>From the first action scene involving a big ship to the last battle between Captain America and the Winter Soldier this movie will hold you in a tight grip. Some of the fight scenes even reminded me of The Raid – and yes, that's meant as a compliment. Can I give away one small spoiler or two? Two of the best scenes in the movie are Steve Rogers visiting an exhibition of himself (both funny and moving) and his meeting with his old love, Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell with lots of make-up). These scenes give this great action flick a true heart.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see Captain America: The Winter Soldier again! And oh yeah, this time there isn't just one but two after-credits scenes!<br/><br/>9/10"

","This is in the running for best of the recent Marvel movies. That's not saying much. But give Disney credit. They finally figured out how to make money off all the Marvel properties - target the 7-year-old kid. I think If I was 7 years old, I would totally be into it. But the fact is, I'm not seven anymore. I've seen enough large machines falling out of skies and exploding. I've seen enough people firing redundant waves of machine gun bullets and not hitting anything. I've seen enough double cross plots explained in the first 5 minutes. I've seen enough of all of these things for good. All these movies are exactly the same. They are filmed quick and dirty just like sit-com TV shows with the perfunctory special effects we have all seen before. Low and behold, Winter Solider is actually directed by TV directors too. <br/><br/>Sure Winter Solider is sorta making money, but it's a far cry of what movies consistently made 10 and 15 years ago. On the whole, the movie industry is evaporating and movies like this are the reason, Cyborg bad guy? Evil white suit running the show? Car wrecks? Slow motion? This is all seemingly off topic, but stuff like this movie aren't even worth writing a review for. What do you talk about really? Acting, plot or cinematography? Come on. I've seen this movie at least 10 times a year for the past 30 years, there will always be youngsters out there to see it for the first time, and good for them but for the rest of us all the good stuff is now on HBO, FX and AMC. It's a sad decline of the cinema experience, but I have a better time in front of my 65 inch TV and blu ray player at home.<br/><br/>If you really need to get out of the house and turn off, well this movie will do it. But I don't remember anything in there I saw other than all the explosions and gunfire we've seen millions of times before -literally. <br/><br/>I guess you could do worse, but pay for McDonalds and don't expect real food."

The original was OK but with so many comic book hero movie releases I thought this would just be another instalment of, keep the characters in public consciousness until we finally created a great movie ( latest wolverine an example of this).<br/><br/>This film re-writes the genre and takes cinema to a new level. Absolutely stunning visuals, compelling script and great performances especially from Redford - screen stealer every time.<br/><br/>I will not divulge the story because many reviews do this aptly so no need for me.<br/><br/>I was absolutely blown away and remember thinking throughout the film - i want more of this - up until the end when I was generally sorry to be leaving the cinema.

"seoeramz","4","21","52","24 March 2014"," The reason the Marvel cinematic Universe manages to stay fresh
","The reason the Marvel cinematic Universe manages to stay fresh, exciting and surprising is that each hero finds his own sub genre of movies. While Cap's first adventure was a WW2-based origin story, the Russo brothers, directors of shows like Arrested Development and Community, open up an entirely new box in this collection of superhero films: the paranoia thriller.<br/><br/>The film ends up being really convincing in a genre most prominent in the 1970s, where people are shot through apartment walls shortly before revealing the traitor and everyone starts mistrusting anyone else. At the same time, it is still delivering over the top superhero action and funny one-liners, while the ultimate revelation is nothing less than Marvel's biggest game changer to date. Especially the TV show Agents of SHIELD, that found its footing in recent weeks, will most certainly have to react to the puzzling and breathtaking events unveiled here. It would go too far to call this film realistic, especially if you consider the way Cap takes down a jet all by himself, but the underlying message is based on current world events much more than before: don't take away my freedom in favor of a false sense of security."
"pillowtrot","5","6","11","5 August 2014"," Amazing action, silly political statement
","I understand that the whole Captain America concept arises from a jingoistic WWII political milieu. Having him cryo-frozen and resurrected in the modern age was a clever strategy on Marvel's part. However, the writers chose to use Captain America as a way to smack the viewer in the face repeatedly with a political message that really didn't do anything to advance the plot or make the movie more compelling. It was insulting, really, especially when it was done in such a ham-fisted manner. Surely Robert Redford has enough clout (and common sense, despite his own political leanings) as one of this generation's most revered actors to refuse in good conscience to have his character utter the cheesy ""Hail Hydra"" in his dying breath.<br/><br/>In addition to the non-stop, in-your-face preachiness, the film suffers from absolutely silly plot devices. For instance, there's a Nazi scientist whose brain lives in a computer system... in case you didn't get it that the computer has a Teutonic soul, its synthesized voice has a ridiculous German accent. And Captain America's boyhood pal is resurrected as his arch enemy, fifty years later. It just doesn't get any goofier than this.<br/><br/>If you can ignore all that's wrong with the movie and focus only on the action, there's plenty of that to keep a viewer interested. Despite wanting to leave ten minutes into the film, I sat through the entire thing just to watch the badass fight scenes."

Captain America pretty much destroys everyone who stands in his path. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is absolutely incredible as well, she needs her own movie! <br/><br/>I can't recommend this highly enough. I think even those who are not fans of this genre may like it purely for the action.

","The wait is over Captain America: The Winter Soldier is finally here. This movie blew my mind! It had me on the edge of my seat and my heart racing right up until the very last scene. I even stayed to watch the credits.<br/><br/>It begins with Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, (Chris Evans) still struggling to adapt to the 21st century and his work with S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division). With each clandestine mission his doubts grow of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s integrity and honesty. His doubt is confirmed during a hostage rescue, when he catches Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson)(WARNING: SPOILER ALERT) performing a mission outside the defined parameters of the mission. Captain America become suspicious of S.H.I.E.L.D., it's mission and everyone in it.<br/><br/>The score I would give this movie is about 9/10. I'm still working on whether it's better than The Avengers, it's a toss up.

"Palidan400","9","6","11","6 April 2014"," The Amazing ""Winter Soldier""
","Simply fantastic. Any doubts gathered from the first Captain America film wash away completely as ""The Winter Soldier"" brings the story back full circle while advancing the narrative of the Avengers. Following more of Captain Rogers assimilation back into society after the events at NY, the movie gives a fleshed out look at the person under the costume. Finally, after often being tossed aside as a minor Avenger, people can see so much more of who this leader is. <br/><br/>Humor and action start off the film, and the intense drive continues throughout the rest non-stop. The introduction of Sam Wilson at the start, and the conversations the two soldiers hold as they share their experiences, provide a much needed outlet for the Captain. We see his character develop greatly as he struggles to cope with the past that he's left behind and the future ahead of him. Chris Evans once again gives such a fitting and enthusiastic performance as the troubled Captain America, followed by a large and great supporting cast as many old and new characters come in.<br/><br/>Even with so many things going on, the story progresses quite smoothly. And while it ties in to the Avengers, the characters and the plot hold for themselves so well, the film is an action-thriller that could essentially stand on its own. Ignoring the superhero aspect, it conveys modern day concerns and themes about government and privacy in society. It holds many elements of a classic spy and espionage film and does not fail to entertain. Add in the superb fighting, explosive sequences, powerful sound design, emotional weight from the already established characters, and you get one intense ride.<br/><br/>The characters, plot lines and melodrama can seem a bit cookie-cutter at times but within the realm of an individual ""Captain America"" film, it's acceptable and works well. With ""The Winter Soldier"", Marvel has created another great addition to their movieverse. It's both captivating and sad to see Rogers deal with his life now, and the film does a flawless job of letting people learn more about him. Simultaneously, there are plenty of references of what's to come. As always, there are the post- credit scenes from Marvel that are very exciting, so make sure to stay past the film's end."
"ayushman98","9","6","11","3 April 2014"," The definition of a masterpiece!
","Whoa, this movie is undoubtedly spectacular! A must watch for all Marvel fans! Anthony and Joe Russo have done a really decent job in making this movie. The apparently considered good guys in the beginning of this movie eventually turned out to be the bad guys! Well at least I didn't have to hate them, for they were like the bad good guys! Also, this movie reminds us of many incidents that occurred in Captain America: The First Avenger, the first movie headlining Captain America. So this way, we get back on track and don't literally associate this movie with The Avengers, expect maybe when it comes to Project Insight. Well, as of my opinion, both The Avengers and Captain America; The Winter Soldier are equally awesome! This movie was perhaps the best thing that ever happened after The Avengers. The ending was sensational and logical! The whole cast was entertaining. Plus, the theme song literally rocks to the core! Moreover, the action was unquestionably one of a kind! Even if you don't like the story, there's a hell of a lot more to enjoy!"
"The_Joker_1997","2","8","16","3 May 2016"," Overrated movie.
","A fine mediocre movie. Not too good, not too bad. It is so overrated. Bad action scenes with shaky cams and tons of cuts. The story is OK. The villain is really good. Had charisma and charm throughout the movie. The movie was boring throughout with some cool scenes in it. The character development for Falcon is poor. He is not given any origin story. No flashbacks yet he is the main sidekick of Captain America. The ending was cheesy. You might not like it. The CGI in the movie was noticeable and seemed fake. Fairly, this movie is one-time watch only. This movie was maybe one of the finest Marvel movie but it is not the best. This movie is overrated among fans."
"derekblake","4","8","16","9 September 2014"," Not the Best
","Personally I was not impressed with this movie, certainly not as good as the first movie, but then squeals that are as good or better than the original are rare. I found the storyline quite weak and the dialogue hard to hear over the too loud mood music, editors never seem to learn this fact. The SFX were OK but nothing breath-taking, and the acting was lack-lustre. In saying all this I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it as a easy-to-watch piece of entertainment, with a bucket of popcorn a cup of coke/coffee and your Kindle to read to stop you getting bored. Someone to wake you up for the exciting bits would also be an advantage."

Hey, Cap jumps around with no mask, a pair of chinos and Harrington like jacket.....the kind of clothes you would wear going shopping....but not whilst fighting major baddies with Alice Cooper type hairdos and ""school's out"" attitude. Okay, Okay, i know the story gets updated, hey, i read Brubaker, but this film, in my opinion, like the last Iron Man film,is an example of Marvel's arrogance in thinking they can approve crap movies. Conclusion? Overlong and very boring....Robert Redford is like a ""cardboard gangster"", unconvincing. The ""diehard Cap fans"" may say this is great, but deep down,may think different. Disappointing"
"Valeri0706","9","8","16","28 March 2014"," The best MCU solo movie yet. Terrific!
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is all you would want from a Marvel film. It has plenty of action, great CGI, decent character development and a cool villain, which in my opinion was lacking in the Marvel films until now (maybe except Loki).<br/><br/>Chris Evans nails it as Cap again and here they show us how he is struggling with his adjustment to the modern world and his mistrust in SHIELD's actions. Jackson also does it again as Fury and fans of the character will be happy, since he has more screen time in this one. The real show-stealer, however, is Sebastian Stan/The Winter Soldier. He is just awesome and there are couple of surprises regarding him here and there.<br/><br/>The CGI is really good, shown especially in the final battle. There is a bit of shaky cam in certain places, but it is not distracting and you will be able to clearly follow the action. Regarding the 3D - I didn't find it disturbing, although I will enjoy my second watch in 2D.<br/><br/>Regarding story and character development, there is a lot of attention paid to the first film. The film also makes you care about the characters and creates the feeling that they really are in danger in certain moments.<br/><br/>There are couple of twists, but I found most interesting the main plot twist, which will make you look to the previous Marvel movies with a different eye and wonder how will this affect the future installments.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, stay after the credits. The film has one of the best after-credit scenes, which will make you desire a certain future Marvel film even more.<br/><br/>Overally I gave the film 9/10. I found both IM3 and Thor:TDW enjoyable, but this is a big step above both of them, on par with the first Iron Man, and maybe only below The Avengers. It is really entertaining and I recommend it to all Marvel fans out there."
"edwardanthony9","9","8","16","28 March 2014"," The best film in the MCU, besides The Avengers...
","Putting The Avengers (which is an entirely different level of cinematic entertainment) aside, The Winter Soldier ranks as the best among the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. With great action sequences, suspenseful moments, and emotional unravelling flow of events, this film strengthens Marvel Studios' status as not just giving quality entertainment, but also giving fans & audiences the thrill of cinematic experience, while also adding new dimensions to the easily predictable superhero genre.<br/><br/>The film starts a bit slowly by re-accounting viewers with Captain America and his story, so it sets up the situation & emotion for the main plot. The first half an hour felt rather boring & casual, but it didn't really matter when the remaining one and a half hour is full blast entertainment filled with action, drama & suspense. The action sequences are great, despite being less superhero-ish, employing hand- to-hand combats, gunfires, and shield bashing. So, after a specific event happening in about the half hour mark, the movie takes a turn, and suddenly Cap finds himself surrounded by enemies & shrouded by trust issues, and the suspense takes over.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of this film is the unfolding plot. Now, Marvel being Marvel means there will be twists & reveals in between. For the sake of this review, I'm going to throw a bone and divide it into the little twist and the big twist. The little twist (comic book fans will know) is what accounts for the existence of drama, striking hard into the personal life of Steve Rogers himself. Meanwhile, the big twist is a game changer. It changes a big part of what we know in the universe, and brings in a bigger threat in place, thus changing the future of the cinematic universe.<br/><br/>On the little pieces, this film (as compared to others in the MCU) is the one which has the most connection to the other films, both past and upcoming. This film has drama flowing through in the personal life of Steve Rogers, and one good thing is that it didn't follow Thor: The Dark World's sense of humour (otherwise it would be a permanent identity of the franchise) but still manages to give audiences the laugh. And yes, this film has mid-credits scene and post-credits scene, and they are the best yet, so I highly recommend you to stay back until the very end.<br/><br/>On a side note, SHIELD being a major part of the film, introduces the sense of a political thriller and the vague concept of intelligence, which is what I previously mentioned as the extra dimension in this film. The soundtrack plays a part too. While not every minute of it is great, but when it needs to, it brings added suspense & thrill to the action. And with the help of it, the Winter Soldier's presence on screen is chilling and worthy of a mysterious yet ruthless villain. The fight sequences between Cap & Winter felt awesome, both physically & emotionally.<br/><br/>Note 1: I will be writing a spoiler-filled discussion in two weeks time.<br/><br/>Note 2: My claim is fixed: The Winter Soldier is now my favourite character in the Marvel Universe.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>Good: Great action sequences, Full of thrill & suspense, Brilliant unfolding plots, Decent soundtrack, New dimensions to the genre<br/><br/>Bad: Slow start<br/><br/>SCORE: 9.0<br/><br/>(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)"
"foowombats","9","8","16","25 March 2014"," The Winter Soldier is the best Superhero movie I have ever seen.
","Its more real/gritty but by no means too real world tone fit beyond perfectly with the political action thriller style to which the film aimed for. But don't go thinking that made it lose the campy awesomeness of the Avengers Universe. It was still a superhero movie! It was still bad-ass!<br/><br/>Speaking of bad-ass. The Winter Soldier himself is incredible. An interesting backstory, that Comic fans will already know. He wasn't quite unstoppable but was close to. But that 'not quite', is crucial because it made him feel real. And that realism made him feel even more dangerous. And The Captain, Wow! For all you saying he's pretty useless compared to the likes of Stark, Banner and Thor. NO LONGER! Oh my, there is so much ass kicking done with that shield. And more importantly so much relatable personality. Fury was amazing as always! Falcon was incredible and hilarious, a great new character! And Black Widow...give her, her own movie now!!! I will write it for you if you want Marvel! Just Please!<br/><br/>The final act was incredible, the acting was fantastic and there was some beautiful quieter scenes. The writing overall really knew exactly when and where to focus. There is a twist for the whole Avengers universe at the end, and a very intriguing mid Credits scene, that's all I'm saying.<br/><br/>Flaws? There was a few things in the plot that didn't make the greatest sense. But its very hard to notice this. There was a couple of points I felt giddy the camera work was so fast and energetic. That might be because Grand Budapest was the last film I saw, but some longer shots and less cuts would have been appreciated sometimes.<br/><br/>Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier knew exactly what it needed to be. And it executed that perfectly, creating one of the most entertaining films, I have ever seen. 9/10"
"privid","1","9","19","27 May 2016"," A dreadful movie of prosaisms and bland characterization.
","Certainly the worst movie I've watched so far this year. I frankly don't understand why critics or audiences rave about it. The plot is absurdly and comically formulaic, characters are completely undeveloped and bland, and they enter the story pretty much at random. While the basic premise of Captain America intrigued me, especially in its original 50s environment, the potential goes mostly unused in these movies. They are melodramatic, and reach way too deep into pseudo-sociological commentary for their own good. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier seems to be sort of responding to the NSA polemic, but it does so tastelessly and without any intelligence. In fact, I'd say this is exactly the kind of movie organizations like the Hydra it so demonizes would want us to watch: a dumb blockbuster designed to numb people while the powers that be plot their machinations. I suppose I could say the CGI was decent, but it's wasted on a dreadful script that can't even do action scenes right (you can literally predict every scene before it even begins, not because the movie thoughtfully sets you up, but because you've already seen it in a slightly different disguise someplace else).<br/><br/>All in all, worth watching as a disposable movie, but don't expect anything more edible than cold fries."

","I just came from seeing this movie, and as I was wondering with my friend: how is possible to be rated 8+ on IMDb.<br/><br/>I can only have one explanation, big production companies got here also.<br/><br/>This movie is decent. Good CGI, fights ... o man, Chris Evans is looking damn good. I wish I was him. Maybe in another life. IMAX 3D is worth every penny. Also, kind of lost my appetite for Scarlett Johansson, in 3D she has a so big forehead that is a turn off But seriously, this movie begins by cracking skulls and goes like this for 2 hours. Beside rudimentary feelings like look how gorgeous is that one, or not, there isn't anything else. No idea. The spirit of SF was to explore new possibilities, ""what if's"", make your mind think in awe! But no, it goes like crack crack crack for 2 hours.<br/><br/>Two more weird things to add in a see of strange: <br/><br/>One, I can't understand what Winter Soldier has to with Russians. He has a red star on his shoulder, he speaks Russian and is using Russian ammunition, but was made and is working for Hydra, which is of German origin. <br/><br/>Second, the Captain at some point is shackled with a magnetic thing to an elevator and has a hard time breaking free. Few seconds later he goes on rampage breaking by hand a plane ... right.<br/><br/>I wish Evans will not become too entangled in this franchise because when you look like him, he's like your buddy.<br/><br/>Hey buddy, cheers from Romania.<br/><br/>I will rate 5 to overcompensate for the inflated rating. In true, the movie is worth 6.5 Bye"

","So arrives yet another much anticipated Marvel movie, the surprising thing is that most of these movies actually manage to live up to the hype. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is no exception.<br/><br/>To give away anything is to risk spoiling the experience for you, so I must tread carefully.<br/><br/>Winter Soldier is more a sequel to the original rather than to the Avengers but if you haven't seen the original there is still plenty to enjoy here.<br/><br/>Set in the modern day, Cap is now part of a SHIELD covert ops team which includes Black Widow, all under the helm of Nick Fury. A nice intro sets the scene as a reminder that Cap is pretty badass. However, things turn very sour soon after returning to base leaving Cap seemingly alone to save the day and not knowing who he can trust. <br/><br/>Action set pieces are tight and well choreographed and although it never approaches the spectacle of Avengers, Iron Man or Thor, the stakes are seemingly much higher and it is made clear from the outset that no one is safe, these are characters that can bleed and die!<br/><br/>The bad guys have their own super soldier dubbed the Winter Soldier who is seemingly stronger, faster and more badass than Cap. Can Cap win this one? Watch to find out!<br/><br/>This is a solid action thriller. The 2 hour plus run time goes past fast and the action scenes are nicely interspersed with interesting espionage twists and turns that stop you from disconnecting from the movie or feeling bored. There is a satisfying finale which leaves the future for Cap and his team surprisingly open ended. It will be interesting to see where things go from here for Cap 3.<br/><br/>Seeing Cap in action is really cool, regardless of whether he's taking down people stealth style in near silence or whether he's taking down huge fighter jets single handedly. For once it's actually believable that someone can be a one man army!<br/><br/>Black Widow is even more impressive this time round and there is an undeniable chemistry between the two which helps to really engage the audience. She has quite a few action scenes of her own and Johansson is now clearly far more comfortable in the role than she ever was before. Black Widow was a mediocre side character in Iron Man 2, pretty damn cool in Avengers and now an essential character frequently stealing the lime light from our protagonist.<br/><br/>I know I have kept this review pretty vague but rest assured this is a pretty awesome movie and a worthy addition to Marvel's movie catalogue. <br/><br/>Check it out and don't forget to stay behind for TWO, yes like Thor: The Dark World there are TWO post-credit scenes!!!<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>Rating 9 out of 10<br/><br/>FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET"

It's riveting from start to finish. Both old and new characters alike are woven perfectly into the film, some we never even considered twice. There's just the right amount of dialogue between action scenes to entice you, but not bore you. And fear not, the action is plentiful, exciting, and executed wonderfully. Very satisfying. <br/><br/>I wish I had to more to say about this, but I really don't what else TO say other than that this movie is fabulous. And in my opinion, this is the sexiest and most bad-ass Scarlett Johansson has been in any of the Marvel movies. I thought she was trying a bit too hard in the other ones to be mysterious but knowledgeable while still trying to be sexy, but couldn't quite get it and came off a bit dull and uninteresting. But as far as Winter Soldier goes, Natasha Romanoff definitely just became my woman crush. This movie is a must see, if not a must own."

"filmfanperspective","9","5","9","5 May 2015"," Marvel's best film is also their most daring (****1/2)
","Until now, Marvel's high-water mark had been 2012's ""The Avengers"", a slick, brilliant achievement in movie-making that actually lived up to the hype. Since then, this universe (groundbreaking as it may be) has been uninspiring. The mild amusement of ""Iron Man 3â€³ coupled with the sub par ""Thor: The Dark World"" led me to wonder if the franchise had lost its' mojo. Considering the lackluster ratings for the tie-in TV show 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.', it wasn't hard for me to suspect that the best this group had to offer might be behind us.<br/><br/>Fortunately, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" Marvel's best offering. It deserves praise as an excellent film as well, reinvigorating the entire 'Avengers' universe. To paraphrase the Captain himself, take away the suits from this film, and what do we have? A fantastical surprise- a spy thriller, a political potboiler of a story (in the vein of a '70s paranoia film), and a topical, dark, cautionary tale. Oh yeah, and a glorious action spectacle. <br/><br/>When we left Steve Rogers (Evans), he had just finished leading a motley crew of heroes to victory in New York over an army of aliens, then closing a portal to another dimension. One can imagine that any subsequent mission might seem mundane, but the mundane is what the Captain prefers- he just happens to be inundated with super soldier serum. The Captain has settled into his role as Nick Fury's (Jackson) lead dog, but he has grown weary of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s increase in power, and weary of Fury's excuses for having said power. The two have mutual respect for each other as soldiers, but sit on different ends of the ideological spectrum. Fury's distrust of people has brought him success; Captain America's distrust in those who distrust people has brought him a modicum of the same. Fury believes people might just need to be protected from themselves, whereas the Captain stands firm on the idea that any sacrifice of freedom is not right.<br/><br/>The film allows their conflict to spill out on-screen, as the two career soldiers are forced to test their beliefs when a mysterious assassin targets S.H.I.E.L.D. and its' agents. As Black Widow (Johansson) explains, this ghost of a bad guy is the stuff of legend. This legend is responsible for many of the world's top 'hits' over the past 50 years, and she should know- Natasha did, after all, tell us that she has red on her ledger. The question, of course, is who this emo-cyborg is that keeps showing up to bring the pain, and how much this 'Winter Soldier' might mean to Captain America. While not a groundbreaking comic film antagonist, the Winter Soldier is given a fine arc, bolstered with an effective flashback scene, further enriching our understanding of their special bond. He's a righteous opponent for Captain America- both a physical equal and an emotional test.<br/><br/>The assassin's appearance actually sparks the arrival of a greater evil, the onus for the film's ever-present tension. Nick Fury sensed this through his prescient understanding of the world's rhythms; well, as Gloria Estefan warned us, the rhythm is gonna get you. Fury is pursued in a scene that rivals the greatest street fights and car chases in film history, and sparks the plot. The resulting chaos forces our heroes to become fugitives, hunted from every angle by those they worked alongside and trusted until they learn of the real plan. Without revealing anything crucial, I can say that the script provides appropriate reasons for the treachery, and when viewed as an entire story, brings the 'Avengers' arc to a precipitous and revelatory head. It's a risky, game-changing decision, bold enough to earn my highest marks, in that it 1) makes sense, and 2) provides real danger to all our heroes- even the ones not in this film.<br/><br/>I imagine it's also apropos to mention that the good Captain (and Chris Evans) finally gets a chance to stretch his legs as a character here. His 'power' seems more tangible here, and he gets the chance to actually portray some depth, and (gasp) maybe even find a date. He does end up finding a trusted friend and worthy peer in Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), a former paratrooper who now spends his time counseling vets dealing with post-war stress. Sure, the plot needs him, but it was easy to buy Wilson as a peer, for he appears to be much like the Captain- just short of superhero abilities, in which the film finds comedy. Wilson is an important character in comics- not simply because of his abilities, but because his alter ego 'Falcon' (adapted well here to fit a modern context) turned out to be the first African-American superhero in major comics. The script gives this character a sensible role in this universe, one that is likely to expand. The film even allows for Black Widow to aspire for more than simply a super-spy; she's vulnerable, clearly shaken by the film's events, and we discover the odd understanding from opposite ends of the spectrum between herself and the Captain.<br/><br/>When comic books are at their best, the story reflects our society in a specific way, channeling the zeitgeist. Sure, the artwork is wonderful and occasionally iconic, but it is the topical, relevant, and reflective nature of the stories that people remember most. This film resembles the best of those comics, in that it brings some rather obvious real-world issues to the forefront. Think about it- do we expect comic films to touch on the idea of sacrificing freedom for protection, and then have characters figure out that morality on- screen (with respects to ""The Dark Knight"")? What about the manipulation of our personal data into future projections of ability? The brainwashing and torture of POWs? See what I mean? This is no Saturday morning cartoon."
"seaview1","9","5","9","17 April 2014"," Captain America : The Winter Soldier and the Paranoia of Fear
","Directed with the sure hands of brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (TV's Community) from an excellent screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is easily the best of the stand alone Marvel films and a thrilling action film full of big surprises and twists with far reaching consequences. A superior sequel like X Men 2 and The Dark Knight, it raises the stakes of good story telling and intricate plotting of comic book adaptations in the guise of a political thriller.<br/><br/>Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans) continues his adjustment to 21st century life after his thaw from the deep freeze (in Captain America: The First Avenger) and befriends a fellow veteran, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie). On a typical mission for S.H.I.E.L.D., Cap and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) lead a team of agents to rescue a pirated ship which turns up an interesting bit of information. Meanwhile, as S.H.I.E.L.D. readies the major launch of a defense system in Washington, D.C., there are growing concerns expressed by boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to his superior, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). As suspicions multiply, all hell breaks loose when there is an assassination attempt on one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s own. The conspiracy leads Captain America to a confrontation with a mysterious, formidable figure, The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), whose strength and skills are extraordinary. With only a small circle of comrades, everything Cap has come to value comes crashing down. Loyalties are tested and just who will survive a major shift in the world order is just the beginning of an insidious plot.<br/><br/>For fans of Cap, these are grand times as the filmmakers have chosen a major story arc (The Winter Soldier) from his comic annals and incorporated Silver Age characters, e.g. The Falcon (Mackie) and Batroc. Recently, super hero films have chosen to bend the rules and take chances with tradition. This film goes much further than any previous Marvel adaptation. It features a good mystery, topical subject matter on individual privacy, and significant plot twists so much so that it is essential for the viewer to watch them unfold without any spoilers. The smart script contains witty lines amid a pervasive feeling of mistrust and paranoia. When Cap responds to Fury's state of the art weaponry to combat threats and says, ""This isn't freedom. This is fear,"" it sums up the theme of the story. Think of this as homage to 1970s conspiracy classics like Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man. The film also employs moments that references Mission Impossible, The X Files, RoboCop, and 24.<br/><br/>Acting is uniformly strong as some old, familiar faces return, and a few new ones get introduced. By now Evans has become the embodiment of the iconic hero, retaining his sense of justice, duty, and morals, virtues which are downright refreshing in a post 9/11 world. Rogers is a Rip Van Winkle out of his time and still learning to assimilate the world changes and cultural references with amusing results. Evans' chemistry with Johansson is believable yet ironic since their two characters have vastly different backgrounds. In a costarring role, Johansson's Black Widow is resourceful, smart, and deadly as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative whose history is only beginning to be scratched. Perhaps Black Widow should have her own film! Jackson's Fury has an expanded role and reveals more facets of his mysterious background. Robert Redford (All the President's Men) has a significant, atypical role as a high level official, and he is outstanding. His presence alone adds legitimacy and authority to the film. Mackie (The Hurt Locker) is an ideal buddy in arms to Evans. Emily VanCamp makes a good first impression as a young agent, and Cobie Smulders (returning as Agent Maria Hill) provides solid backup.<br/><br/>The many impressive action sequences are noteworthy for their ferocity and meticulous detail, but the standouts are a mad, opening car chase through the streets of D.C., and a remarkable fight in a glass elevator that surpasses the gem in Die Hard: With a Vengeance. There are moments of intense hand to hand combat that recall the best moments of the Bourne films on steroids. You've also got to love that shield; the film wisely displays all the creative ways Cap's shield is employed in combat. The violence here is realistically depicted and not cartoonish which pushes its PG-13 rating. Extensive use of hand-held cameras and more live action special effects than CGI lend a stronger sense of realism. D.C. locations make a splendid backdrop for much of the film.<br/><br/>Taking super hero filmmaking to new heights, Captain America: The Winter Soldier successfully interconnects what we know from previous films and effectively challenges you to reevaluate everything in the Marvel Universe. It certainly helps to have seen the previous films, but there is sufficient background and context that a casual outsider would still enjoy it. (Fans of TV's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will have a field day as the events tie directly with the show.) Though the film ends with open ended story threads that beg for another sequel, consider this as The Empire Strikes Back of Captain America. That's not such a bad place to be.<br/><br/>(As usual, don't forget two post credit scenes which are significant.)"
"ayoreinf","9","5","9","8 April 2014"," A good balance of characters and plot
","In recent years it seemed to me all too often that action movies directors and script writers felt like they had to choose between characters development and a coherent plot, this one strike the balance as close to perfection as I've seen in a very long while. It does help the actors (as I've said more than once - good actors can work wonders when they have properly written characters to work with), and even more important as far as I'm concerned, it helps in examining the moral core of the whole sci-fi comics concept. The inherent fascist undercurrents of the entire super hero idea. This concept has been dealt with by all the real good comics adaptations, both on screen and on print.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's a fun ride with added value to boot, if you like sci-fi comics adaptations, this one is a must see."

","Captain America - The Winter Soldier Review I missed out watching the First Avenger in theater when it got released. Well, Captain America will always remain as an the sanest/sensible one among all the other heroes of the Marvel Universe in the Avenger Lineup. The promos of the movie already gave the viewers a peek over the neck and neck dual between the Winter Soldier and the Cap. Now for the movie, it carries a good pace with itself and the story-line brings the gap closer to Avengers : Age of the Ultron. Chris Evans as Cap Am, gained some extra pounds and is well toned to look more huge, especially in 3D . Chris Evans have come a long way from playing a goofy Pyro in Fantastic Four. Good to see him back donning the American Colors. His action execution has improved, thanks to the wonderfully choreographed stunts and possible competition from Seb Stan. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow continues her role with a mysterious past and an aging future. She looks terribly old in certain parts of the movie. In other areas, she performs her stunts with ease and shares a good rapport with Cap Am. Anthony Mackie as Falcon, in his debut ""superhero"" movie dons the Stark Industries powered Wings and assists them in the final stages of the movie. I personally think he deserved some more fire power as he looks a bit vulnerable in that part. Tony... Could you help him with that ? Sam J as Nick Fury. There is nothing to describe his character. We all know how Sam J takes any role and how easily he fits into a character like Nick Fury. Robert Redford as Pierce. Good to see Redford back again in the universe. Even if it was only for one movie I guess Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier. Perfect match for the Cap's moves. A level higher than the Super-soldier sometimes. Playing a villain to a superhero is not easy especially when its in the ratio of 3:1. Would love to see what the future holds for him. Also the future of Rumlov's. Good to see the Russo brothers keep the continuity of the Captain America adventure. Let's hope they do continue as they are raising the bar for themselves. Stunt Directors and VFX : You guys are the unsung hero of almost every movie in 4. It is high time people start taking you seriously. Hats Off. Do no forget to sit through the end credits. They are 2 of them. PS : Also watch out for Stan Lee Now, for Guardians of Galaxy... Ooga Chaaka Ookha Ookha !!! Rating : 9/10"

","It's rare that we get a serious Marvel movie these days since the first Iron Man but this was totally mind blowing. Captain America: The Winter Soldier too a risk and it worked. This was more of a thriller than just your ordinary super hero movie. This is the Dark Knight of Marvel. The story unfolded and a steady pace and for once no loop holes. Well written. This film dealt with real life government issues such as how far should the government go to keep us safe. The fight choreography leaves Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America in the Avengers by a gap. I have never seen so much character development in a Marvel movie as much as Captain America. In this movie we really get to see Steve Rogers flesh out his abilities. I am usually against Marvel movies so for me to incredible compliment this film is saying something. This is a must watch. Do watch it in cinemas. Truth is Captain America: The Winter Soldier beats The Avengers, Thor: The Dark Under World and Iron Man 3 by a gap."
"sacflyzone","10","5","9","31 March 2014"," This movie really takes the comic book genre to the highest level.
","You can rest assured that Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an absolutely amazing movie and YES it's even better than the first. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. The critics all agree (as if that matters) and Cap may very well be their best effort yet! <br/><br/>This movie really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. It reinvents epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Never has this been more true than with The Winter Soldier. Anything added or amended from the print storyline was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. The directors pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them. Like the great films of the past, they ground the action and the concept of ""super soldiers"" in firm reality. They add some old school intrigue and political thriller elements. <br/><br/>I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Captain America: The Winter Soldier delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2014, quite possibly the number one film."
"TheMovieVlog","9","5","9","26 March 2014"," The Best Marvel Movie To Date!
","A wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great film. The ninth installment in the Marvel cinematic universe, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is also perhaps its most intricately crafted. The set-up is straightforward enough: Cap and Black Widow are working for/with Nick Fury when S.H.I.E.L.D. comes under attack. Unsure of whom, if anyone, to trust, they must uncover a hidden threat before it destroys them all. The film not only serves as a strong follow-up to Cap's first outing, Captain America: The First Avenger, and Joss Whedon's ensemble juggernaut The Avengers, it also has the strongest ties to and most profound impact on the Marvel Cinematic Universe at large. The repercussions of the events of this film will reverberate throughout all of Marvel's properties.This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Well acted, well directed and well written. I cant wait to see it again. By the way YES! you guessed it there is a mid credit scene then end credit scene so make sure stay until the very end."
"superneil-71625","1","8","17","29 May 2016"," Boring turd of a film.
","Two and a half hours of predictability and blandness. The Marvel brand is really going down the pan if they think this is worthy of watching by anyone other than an explosion happy 8 year old... anyone that can meet it's PG-13 rating must surely be too old for this rubbish. I used to love the Marvel brand in it's earlier days, but this is just another example of them releasing turd after turd in quick succession while the brand is still popular. Bland, predictable and boring is all I can say about this film. All three of the major plot surprises are, actually, not surprising. You KNOW Fury isn't dead even as they pronounce him dead... BORING, you KNOW Bucky Barnes is the bad guy even before you meet him... BORING and you know the guy in the stiff suit is the puppet master as soon as he meets good ol' cap... BORING! So the plot is predictable and the action is predictable too. Not one surprise in the whole film... BORING. Never has two and a half hours felt so much like five. Following hot on the heels of Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy, I feel I've got to be more choosy with Marvel now. Maybe Marvel should change their name to Disney, as they are aiming squarely at children now."
"AvBaur","9","8","17","27 March 2014"," Marvel does it again
","While I'm really enjoying these Marvel movies and I'm looking forward to every one of them, I was a bit sceptical when I heard that they wanted to make this a ""70s paranoid thriller."" Could they really pull it off to make a 1970s-style spy movie that also works as a big modern superhero blockbuster? The answer, of course, is yes. Whenever we're not in the middle of one of the many massively spectacular action setpieces, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" feels very much like a film in the vein of ""Three Days of the Condor,"" helped of course by the presence of Robert Redford.<br/><br/>One of Marvel's best decisions was, rather than making this purely another Cap solo picture, to team him up with Black Widow and, to a lesser degree, Anthony Mackie's Falcon. While Chris Evans is strong in the role and certainly capable of carrying a movie on his own, the addition of Scarlett Johannson is very welcome. She puts in her best performance in the role here and their interplay and teamwork are one of the coolest aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>With some of the ""Phase 1"" Marvel movies, there were often complaints that they felt like stepping stones to ""The Avengers"" rather than stand-alone movies. But whereas ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is even more closely connected to the Avengers movies, it felt to me almost like a full-fledged sequel to The Avengers that can absolutely stand on its own (while also being very much a sequel to the first CA movie). Or maybe it's just that I'm much more invested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe at this point and the connective tissue thus feels like a bonus rather than a distraction.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is immensely entertaining, both as a big superhero action movie and as a 70s-style spy thriller. Definitely up there with the very best of the Marvel movies. Oh, and don't leave the theater too early: like Thor 2, this one has mid-credits AND post-credits scenes."

"friendly_poison","10","6","12","10 April 2014"," The greatest comic book film so far
","On a personal note, after Batman Begins, after The Avengers and after the evolution of the comic book movie from a cult audience pleaser to an award winning blockbuster, I thought to myself. Well where could it go from here.<br/><br/>The answer is, here.<br/><br/>From the first moment to the last breath, this film totally blew me away on a level I couldn't predict. With Iron Man and The Avengers itself getting most of the critical praise and fan support it was clear to me that Chris Evan's, Steve Rogers was in need of a boost, many fans also argued that ol' Cap got the least amount of treatment out of the Avengers. If this is so then I chock it up to him being the proverbial 'fish out of water' for that film.<br/><br/>From that last statement I can go on to say that the 'fish out of water' thing is a central thing to this film as Steve Rogers fights to face his new place in the world, having been thrust from WWII into present day in the span of a heartbeat. And Chris Evans handles this pressure with excellence, Evans is loaded with a powerhouse performance throughout and aided by a stellar supporting cast including Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson, Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury, Cobie Smulder's Maria Hill, Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce, Frank Grillo's Brock Rumlow and Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>In stark contrast to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) films we have seen so far, this film can be truly accessible for 'semi' intense comic fans as well as the die hard as the films genre feels more along the lines of an epic action/political thriller than the spandex laden days of old.<br/><br/>Trust me, you need to see this film man. The Russo Brothers have created the MCU equivalent of 'The Empire Strikes Back' here and it does not disappoint.<br/><br/>If The Avengers left you on the edge of your seat, then The Winter Soldier will leave you hovering in the aisle!<br/><br/>FP"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","6","12","5 April 2014"," Return of the non-jerky Avenger...
","The first Captain America movie, like Thor, was one of the better introduction movies. Both had a unique feel about them that set them apart from the yawn-inducing (at least for me) Iron Man movies. I enjoyed Cap 1 being set in the past and felt its ending - which set Cap up for The Avengers - came at the expense of the film. It wasn't given its own proper ending. Maybe it's because I enjoyed the first film SO much, that this new one didn't feel like it quite lived up to it. That's not to say Captain America: The Winter Soldier is *bad* in any way (it's still better than snarky Iron Man), but while the first kept me glued to the screen throughout, I felt there was some slow stretches this time around. <br/><br/>As with Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans continues to be very likable as Steve Rogers/Cap (unlike certain other Avengers). He was very noble in the first film, living up to his 'Boy Scout' rep, and still manages to keep the character's best qualities here. Little references to how old he is/what time period he grew up in were highly welcome and provided some nice subtle humour (see? We don't require Tony's ""witty"" one-liners all the time. One doesn't have to be Tony Snark to bring the funny). Cap also shows how skilled he is at not only Frisbee-ing his shield everywhere, but also hand-to-hand combat, as we see him take down almost a whole ship's crew single-handedly. Also, costume-wise, after finding his costume change in The Avengers to be a step down from his original outfit, it was a welcome surprise to see him back in it near the end of this film (as the one he sports for the majority is rather colourless/only blue & silver). Hayley Atwell, as Peggy Carter in the first film, was one of the best Marvel ""love interests"", and it's nice to see her share a scene with Steve here. The effects used to age her are some of the best in the film. Truly some of the most convincing aging up ever done in movies (though I'm glad we also got a scene of Peggy as her young self too). Atwell and Evans are a perfect match, and it's a shame they can never regain the romance between them that was unfairly cut short in the first film. Cap also has a nice rapport with Natasha/Black Widow, and anything more than friendship between them is only used as a 'cover'. They make a good team. ScarJo is decent here, though was better in The Avengers (which could be attributed to Whedon bringing it out of her). Also...she should've kept her Avengers hair (which was quite flattering/suited her), as it's SO straight/boring/lifeless in this film. <br/><br/>Anthony Mackie is a welcome addition as the Falcon. His introduction scene and subsequent scenes with Steve make it believable that they grow a fast friendship and loyalty to each other. Revenge's Emily VanCamp does the most with what she's given as Agent 13/Kate (we later learn her real name). She makes her character mysterious, kick-arse and shows chemistry with Evans in a small amount of screen time. Hoping for more of her next time around. Someone I'm hoping for LESS of is Samuel L. Jackson. He already took over the RoboCop remake, and he comes dangerously close to doing the same here. For a while it feels like HE'S the main action star of the film, especially in a chase scene involving him and his talking SUV. And in any scene that *doesn't* feature Nick Fury? They sure talk about him a hell of a lot. Like with Thor in Thor 2, sometimes it doesn't feel like Cap is the focus of his own film here. And really, is the Fury reveal towards the end a surprise to ANYONE? The most interesting thing with him is we finally get to see his bad eye. Least Cobie Smulders gets to be awesome as Maria Hill. More of her, please.<br/><br/>Robert Redford as Pierce was a rather dull villain, I thought. His long talky scene with Cap kinda bored me (and I usually don't mind talky scenes). That's the same with a lot of similar moments in this film. I wasn't bored for a second with Cap 1, but here I felt my mind wandering at times. Sebastian Stan's more effective as an antagonist for Cap. While the first Thor had Loki, a more personal villain for the hero to fight, the sequel didn't. It's the reverse here, with the Cap sequel having the Winter Soldier being Bucky, Steve's close buddy. It makes you invest in them when they're fighting one another. Stan does a lot with a little, and although most probably predicted his reveal, it's still very emotional seeing Steve's reactions to him. The after credits scene promises more of him to come.<br/><br/>There are some ridiculous moments in the film (the mind of Red Skull's henchman, Zola, inside decades-old supercomputers at the secret site of the old army camp, to name just one), but these Marvel films gave up any sense of 'realism' long ago, so it's a moot point. On that subject, at least the mid-credits scene here is thankfully a bit less WTF than Thor 2's, and promises a couple of interesting new characters for Avengers 2. Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch particularly grabbed my attention. The action, although a bit too shaky, is up there on the scale of money well-spent sequences and the art style used for the first part of the end credits sticks with the interesting art style of Thor 2's. I wasn't as into the story of this film like I was the first's, and we were sadly lacking as amazing a sequence as the Star Spangled Man scene from Cap 1, but I did think this was a fairly worthy sequel. I still like Thor 2 better, though."

","To add something different, the psychological punches this film delivers are exceptional. Watching the trailers someone is being asked to save the world one more time--well it turns out it's not Cap being asked to do it! That is electrifying when you find out who is being asked to ""save the world,"" and under which eye's view. Awesome psyche effect. Another is pitting old against new--Cap's old costume, Falcon's old suit against mega machines--are all ways to underscore old values winning out over big gun technology. This film keeps you guessing who is on which side, and you never know, until the chips are down. A question for all is, if you were the tech being commanded to pull the switch, what would your choice be? The movie invites these questions boldly to your mind, as you are put in the place of any of the individuals. The villain scenes are great in how calculated some are, and how blindly following others are. It's just as terrifying how politicos murder their everyday workers as it is how a super weapon takes a mouth bit in without question. The information age plays an important part in exposing evil as it does the weaknesses and threats any individual could be to the powers that be. No one is immune to the character assessments the characters can at any time choose to be true to or go against when the time is right. Awesome!!!"

","Marvel Comics have been having a dream run with their comics - turned to superhero flicks breaking box office records in the last few years and also have gained a worldwide fan foundation for the same. Captain America: Winter Soldier is the latest offering from them which is a sequel to Captain America: First Avenger which released in 2011. Now many might have an opinion that this might just be like the first part which was indeed termed as ""An Ordinary Superhero Movie"" and Captain America was also framed as the dullest character in the franchise that just came along with Tony Stark and Bruce Banners in The Avengers (2012) in a normal sidekick role. Well everyone, this movie has broken those jinxes and has re-incarnated Captain America in a very audacious and engaging way portraying the character's charisma in a radiant style.<br/><br/>The movie opens 2 years after the events of The Avengers and we are shown that Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) and Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are working for S.H.I.E.L.D under the supervision of Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson). During the mission of saving S.H.I.E.L.D agents in a boat captured by pirates, Steve Rogers comes to know that the mission had some other motive in it about which he had not been informed. Suspicion gets rooted in him and he suspects that something else might be going big without the knowledge of S.H.I.E.L.D. The events turn Topsy turvy when Nick Fury faces life threat as group of assassins disguised as cops lead by powerful assassin known as the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) attack him while the blame for the same falls on the Captain America. Now we are introduced to Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), a senior member of the S.H.I.E.L.D who had earlier worked along with Nick Fury who meets Captain America in private and in turn frames him as fugitive responsible for things going wide of the mark. From here the story kicks off into an action thriller with Captain America running for his life and also in search for the reasons for him being deceived. Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) joins with Captain America to bring out the truth behind the conspiracy which may become lethal for the world.<br/><br/>The movie works well from start to finish with everything rightly placed and paced with the correct momentum. Be it the conspire getting developed, the well cinematographic action/combat sequences and the twists in the plot, directors Anthony and Joe Russo along with screenplay writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have done a estimable work in keeping things intact which unfold at the right time keeping the audience hooked till the end.<br/><br/>Some of the most very attention-grabbing scenes in the movie would be the hand-to-hand combat clash between Captain America and Winter Soldier, The Elevator mash up and the well shot climax action sequences which paves way for each character in the movie to save and give their best for the last. The characters in the movie have been well designed and portrayed on the screen with everyone given equal importance in story and screenplay.<br/><br/>The movie has lots of surprises in it and sure to leave the viewer with a smile and anticipation for what is to come forth in the next sequel and furthermore if you haven't seen Captain America: First Avenger even once means please make sure that you are updated of its events and happening since both movies are interconnected else you may feel that this movie going out of league into another horizon. For fans of Marvel Universe, Superhero Action Flicks and most of all Avengers Franchise, this movie worth watching for its neat and best work and do stay till the final end credits."
"saytosandeep","8","6","12","4 April 2014"," MY REVIEW: Captain Leading from the Front!!
","Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. Sometime it does not matter much if your leading superhero is not throwing one liners one after another like Iron Man or has enormous amount of power like Thor or has delicious anger issues like Hulk, because Captain America is our pure old school hero who will talk no non sense and won't accept lies and at the same time he is irresistibly good looking and carries his shield like a medal for himself. All this provide Captain America a distinct identity in Marvel Cinematic Universe. To balance the fun, beautiful Scarlett Johnson playing agent Natasha, her boss Nick Fury played enjoyably by Samuel L. Jackson and loyal sidekick to captain played by charming Anthony Mackie provide enough jokes. To complete the story, we have a ruthless mercenary The Winter Soldier who is amazing with the mask but surprisingly average without the mask. Movie takes its own sweet time before starting the action in full blow when Nick Fury is attacked by the evils. Action scenes are full of well edited man to man fights and climax is overblown much in the lines of The Avengers. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It is a blast for MCU fans and must try for superhero lovers."

","This review is purposefully vague to avoid spoiling any major details, and that is going to be extremely difficult mainly because almost everything that happens in this film is plot important. So, let's just go with the barebones.<br/><br/>The performances given by Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and especially Samuel L. Jackson are damn near perfect.<br/><br/>What else is damn near perfect is the way the film is structured. This is not a superhero movie. It is a SPY THRILLER with superheroes in it. Yes you read right. This is a conspiracy flick, and directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo do not let the big name superheroes get in the way of the plot. The script is fantastic and... well... I actually can't find anything wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>This has become one of my favorite marvel films. and it holds the potential to be yours too. I implore you to see this movie."
"didonatope","10","6","12","4 April 2014"," One of The Best
","For more reviews, visit cinegrade.org<br/><br/>In the past few months there have been many reasons to be excited for the sequel to 2011's ""Captain America: The First Avenger."" From Black Widow's promised prominence in the plot to the intrigue of how Captain America himself will adjust to the modern world, the hype for this movie has been overwhelming to say the least. On top of that were the glowing early reviews, some of which saying that ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is even better than ""The Avengers."" I'm sure the question on everyone's minds is: ""does this live up to the hype?"" You bet.<br/><br/>The sheer amount of suspense and political intrigue in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" would make it a fine sequel on its own. However, not only does this film manage to surpass the excellent first installment, but in some ways surpass ""The Avengers.""<br/><br/>Taking place after the events of 2012's ""The Avengers,"" Captain Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans reprising his role) struggles to adapt to a world shrouded in fear and obsessed with security. Now working for the government organization S.H.I.E.L.D, Rogers faces the conflict of being ill-informed of his recruiters' ulterior motives and hidden agendas. The retro, simplistic era of the 1940s is far behind him, and Rogers must use his skills and wits to take down a possible conspiracy inside of S.H.I.E.L.D. Coming along for the ride are Black Widow (played reliably well by Scarlett Johansson) and newcomer The Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie of ""Pain and Gain""). Together they must take down a force none of them expected to face.<br/><br/>Unlike previous Marvel films like ""The Avengers,"" and ""Thor,"" the plot of this movie is much more down-to-Earth. In today's world of NSA controversy and outright paranoia, many plot elements in this film give it a very modern and relevant feel. In many ways, this is a stark contrast to the retro, swashbuckling feel that the first ""Captain America"" gave off. This is a perfect way to tell the Captain's story; Steve Rogers has been thrust into the modern day against his will, and after the fantastical events of ""The Avengers,"" he is just now starting to be affected by today's mentality of security. It's indeed very interesting plot foundation for a superhero film.<br/><br/>As well as being a fine continuation of the first film's story, the new elements that this film brings to the ""Captain America"" series are quite good enough for the film to stand on its own. Even those who didn't care for the first movie could get a kick out of them. Among the new characters is The Hawk, an ex-military superhero introduced in this film. This character is immensely likable, partly because of Anthony Mackie's fine performance, but mostly because they introduce him from the very beginning and flesh out his character.<br/><br/>Also joining the cast is veteran actor Robert Redford as the sinister Alexander Pierce. Redford is the type of villain that is rather refreshing to see in a superhero film: villains unaided by superpowers or violence and who carry the story with wits and malice alone. He doesn't need a mech-suit or psychic abilities, but he is a fine menace for the First Avenger to go up against.<br/><br/>In addition to the fine new characters, every action set piece in this movie is both exhilarating and an absolute thrill to watch. What makes them even better is that they are accompanies by a gripping story with plenty of shocking and even emotional twists and turns. Even after seeing aliens invade New York in ""The Avengers,"" this movie's more grounded approach to storytelling gives a sense that the stakes are higher than ever in the Marvel Universe. Fear not though, this movie is far from a dark one, and there is plenty of that good ole' Marvel humor to give some levity. I'm pretty sure that audiences won't be prepared for how intense the story alone is.<br/><br/>It's not very common that audiences get an April movie that's not only great, but exceptional. ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" is indeed a masterpiece, and as much of a bold statement as it seems, it is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. The amount of sheer quality it possesses makes it an absolute must-see."
"tehkao","9","6","12","4 April 2014"," Best action scenes ever filmed
","There has been amazing fight/action scenes in previous superhero movies but the ones in this film just bring them to another level. Also the fact that Cap has no real super powers and has to fight everyone hand to hand just adds more realism to the fight/action scenes. <br/><br/>IF there can be any complaint it's that it almost doesn't feel like a ""real"" super hero movie. I mean Cap doesn't have a secret identity, he has no real powers, and the enemies he face don't have real ""powers"" either. So everything feels very grounded and realistic. So the movie ends up having a very different feel from the Avengers/Thor, or even Iron Man. It feels more like a Bourne style movie where it's more like a political thriller (with incredible action scenes)."
"sujanfaster","9","6","12","4 April 2014"," Blown Away
","Well you probably don't need a review to go watch a MARVEL movie these days. They are just shifting gears of awesomeness. I am writing one just for my satisfaction.<br/><br/>Captain America The Winter Soldier is another shift in this Avenger's gear but with full throttle. This film is much more grittier than the 1st one yet manages to deliver the Marvel brand humor too. The story is about Captain America taking on the hostile organization inside S.H.I.E.L.D who has the Winter Soldier at their disposal. This movie has non stop action, probably the most in The Avenger's franchise, yet it never bores you or tires you. <br/><br/>Chris Evans cakewalks through his role. Antony Mackie has done really well too. This time we see a different Nick Fury in this film with Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johannsen as black widow delivers a compelling performance. Special mention to Sebastian Stan for the cold faced Winter Soldier. Do wait and watch the post credit scenes as they leave us wanting for more.<br/><br/>I don't have to specifically tell everyone to watch this movie. I know you will be. But do watch as soon as I can and enjoy this one hell of a ride!"

","As a distinguished Marvel fan( DC as well), I have found problems in adaptations that feature my favorite Marvel characters. I have criticized 20th Century Fox and how they deal with the X-Men Franchise. Recently, I have been proud of Sony in their dealing with the Spider-Man Franchise. However, No other studio has devout attention to their characters than Marvel Studios. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is Marvel Studios's finest film to date( possibly even better than The Avengers). This movie excels in every way possible. The story, script, and characters have to applauded in this movie. This movie deals with themes of Government Espionage, Conspiracies, and The true cost of Freedom which i found surprising while viewing this movie. The Biggest Shocker of the movie was *SPOILERS* when Cap and Widow find out that HYDRA has been secretly working among SHIELD in order to achieve their greatest goal: ORDER among society by using PROJECT INSIGHT: a SHIELD sort of satellite that eliminates threats to SHIELD. HYDRA uses this advantage to wipe out their threats to society in which they think will allow safety all over the world . The movie has a fair number of twists as you see SHIELD agents actually revealing their identity as HYDRA agents (Jasper Sitwell and Alexander Pierce). I was very much surprised to see this. *END OF SPOILERS* Christopher Markus and Stephen McFreely has done a great job in writing this movie. The directors: Joe and Anthony Russo has also done a great job in their direction of this movie. I had a few concerns with the 1st act due to the action and how they rushed events that were crucial to the story. The Winter Soldier was a great opponent To Cap. He had this menacing stature which i found good. *SPOIlERS* But, the true villain is Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. His performance was good. I would loved to see Pierce's involvement with HYDRA more though. Chris Evans as Cap. did a great job and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had a great character development in which alludes to her past ( I hope to see this element explored in Avengers: Age of Ultron). *END OF SPOILERS* Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier deserves my ""GREAT JOB"" seal of approval. 9/10."

","Well there it is, the second wave. I'll start off by saying that the Cap is by far and away my favorite superhero. I had such high expectations, such high hopes for this film. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint. Not in the slightest. Also, it is without a shadow of a doubt better than Thor: The Dark World and Iron Man 3, the other fellow prologues to the upcoming The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Dare I say, on par with The Avengers and The Dark Knight?<br/><br/>Moving on, a bit about the film. We find our protagonist continuing to attempt to adapt to the modern world. Find his way, find things that he can relate to. He struggles, he continues to live in the past and constantly thinks about his war-mates, and about Peggy Carter, whom he meets up with and has a heart-wrenching moment with. <br/><br/>Steve is reminded that he cannot trust anyone, including SHIELD themselves. He must face a familiar foe, confront old friends, and with the help of the Black Widow and new friendly, Falcon, face countless enemies and countless friends turned foes. <br/><br/>If Captain America: The Winter Soldier is any indication of how the upcoming Avengers film will turn out to be, then sign me right up on the hype train. An absolute incredible, moving and inspiring film. Captain America: TWS gives us its take on ""cape films"", and sets an all new standard."
"SforSmile","7","6","12","2 April 2014"," A Captain to Die for!
","Captain America's second strike most of all impresses with hand-to-hand martial art fights, almost too fast for the 3D Camera to capture, and well-timed, old school handmade action scenes such as car chases, machine gun shootings on open streets, and spectacular explosions, using less computer generated special effects than other comic adaptations and refreshingly getting along without a Tesseract or similar plot devices to bring the story forward because this time we are presented with a kind of happy-go-lightly mixture of a classical espionage thriller a la ""Bourne Supremacy"", a touch of ""Die Hard""-one-against-them-all scenario, a little bit of ""Terminator""-menace, and of course the usual ""Avengers"" references like bombastic airship battles that all in all make ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" a quite entertaining and light movie experience. <br/><br/>The characters are very likable especially the supporting cast with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Samual L. Jackson as Nick Fury who all together upstage the main hero Chris Evans as the ""Cap."" who begins to thaw only towards the end from his long winter sleep by showing some hidden emotions that seemed to had been frozen inside of him which gave that melancholic touch to his character making him sometimes appear rather pale although it at least prevents him from being a silly chatterbox like some other heroes. In contrast to that lies Black Widow's mysterious aura and sex appeal; an ice-cold femme fatal who is good at fighting and who also has a very human, if not fragile side which makes her approachable and even more charming; she would have deserved an own movie franchise because it's about time for female hero's to be in the front line. <br/><br/>Robert Redford as a kind of dubious head of S.H.I.E.L.D is unfortunately visibly unchallenged by his role, his motivations are rather caricatural.<br/><br/>A definite plus is the main villain, the titular Winter Soldier who is physically equal to ""The Cap."". He reminded me of the evil cyborg in ""Terminator 2"" with his robotic arm and his threatening charisma. They both do not talk very much and whenever the Winter Soldier appears, he seems to trigger his own gravitational field as the camera seems to revolve around him like a satellite giving his character this sense of heaviness which even more underlines his dangerousness and yet there is a secret human core that makes him more ambiguous than which is the case with most of the usual cyborgs. Plotwisely ""CA: TWS"" surprises not with the rather predictive twists but with a rather naive, but nevertheless charming comment on the current issues with data abuse by intelligence agencies and the question of how far a society is willing to give up their freedom for the sake of security in the face of a potential terrorist attack, and thus it is probably the most socially critical release of Marvel so far. <br/><br/>It may lack of the necessary psychological as well as artistic depth and edginess of a ""Dark Knight"" that would have left a deeper reverberation with the viewer, it is also not as unique in terms of style as the first part, however, it is good enough to be recommendable, especially to Marvel fans."
"jaredpahl","3","4","7","25 June 2019"," A Grey, Bland, Dud. In Other Words, ""An Exemplary MCU Masterpiece""
","MCU fans will tell you, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is great. Better than great. The internet is clogged with reviews from endless Youtube pseudo-critics and Marvel shills whose entire cinematic knowledge stems from Breaking Bad and The Dark Knight, calling The Winter Soldier a game-changing masterwork. It is not. It's every bit as dull and uninteresting as every other ephemeral episode of The Marvel Cinematic Money-printing Machine. And it's aggressive mediocrity is yet another piece of evidence in my continuing theory on MCU apologists; they're idiots.<br/><br/>That's harsh, I know. Some fans out there are perfectly content admitting that a movie like The Winter Soldier offers only disposable pulp thrills. However, it's the people claiming The Winter Soldier as 'innovative', or 'revolutionary' that really irk me. The chief reason given by these idiots is that Captain America: Winter Soldier is a superhero movie that is also a ""70s political espionage thriller"". Let's break it down. Yes, Captain America 2 contains elements of political espionage. The storyline involves two political organizations, S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra, a covert assassin (The Winter Soldier, Sebastian Stan), and Robert Redford (He's from the 70s). This is called window dressing. Surface decorations that evoke the feeling of a conspiracy thriller. What The Winter Soldier does not have is the actual structure of a political thriller. It's an efficiently made, TV-style superhero flick. The good guys punch the bad guys, the cars crash into each other, and the big CGI heli-carriers crumble like peanut brittle.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with a superhero movie that only does these things. A schlocky action movie can be very enjoyable on that basic level, but only if the film embraces its core identity. When a movie like this fails, it does so because it wastes energy trying to be something else. Captain America: The Winter Soldier pretends to deal with issues. It pretends to be about real figures. But it's pretend. S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra are made-up, and as much as directors Anthony and Joseph Russo want you to recognize these things as analogous to our real institutions, you can't when it's all connected to a silly comic book world where a guy named Falcon flies around blasting machine guns at faceless goons.<br/><br/>The cost of this focus on being a half-prestige picture is that nothing is allowed to go over the top. Want more proof that this film's champions are idiots? Look at the fight scenes that they praise as masterclasses in filmmaking. A fist fight in an elevator. Revolutionary! Look at those punches and kicks! It's unlike any other film I've ever seen! A fist fight on a highway. Brilliant! Hand to hand combat! Never before has a hero used his fist to punch another man! #Masterpiece! I can't be living on the same planet as these people. The action in Captain America 2 is not only not revolutionary (That is extremely obvious), it's flat-out bad. Hand to hand fist fights are usually boring by nature. It takes a real master of film craft to overcome the blandness inherent in such a scene. Cameron can do it, Raimi can do it, The Russo Brothers can't come close. There is absolutely no sense of invention in the action. No passion. No ideas at all. Just punches, filmed with detached digital murkiness.<br/><br/>I can't think of a better way to describe Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The whole thing is detached. It's a filler TV episode. Efficiently produced, with the façade of something meaningful, but completely uninterested in personality, life, or genuine fun/excitement/thrills. It's boring, transient garbage that managed to fool stupid people into thinking it was great. Well idiots, you get what you deserve.<br/><br/>31/100"
"joshua-303-92778","5","4","7","1 August 2014"," Totally average ""superhero"" movie
","I'm a bit baffled by all the glowing reviews for Captain America 2. I could hazard a guess that these are all young people, who have literally been raised on Hollywood sawdust and can't even tell a good movie from a bad one.<br/><br/>This film boasts a bunch of big actors, but no big acting. The dialogue is wooden, as usual. The plot follows an incredibly stereotypical screenplay arc. In other words, it's exactly like every other blockbuster nowadays.<br/><br/>Product placement is very liberally added. The soundtrack is uninspired and aims to propel the movie along with thumping. Plot elements from the last movie are introduced but do not enhance the story at all.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansen is particularly bad in this role. She is in the movie to lure female moviegoers but her delivery is cringeworthy.<br/><br/>Finally, the film aims to appeal to paranoid, Ed Snowden types who believe the government is spying on them. (Which is actually a narcissistic belief).<br/><br/>This is not a good film at all. And I'm starting to doubt there will ever be a good superhero movie again."
"heidee7","8","4","7","2 June 2014"," Another Marvellous Marvel Movie
","I am a huge fan of Marvel movies, so I wasn't about to let this one slip by. As expected, it did not disappoint. It is being touted as the best movie Marvel has ever made. Personally, I can't be sure about that because it's hard to choose, but I can say this with certainty: it is my favourite movie this year so far.<br/><br/>It has all the following elements that I love in a Marvel movie:<br/><br/>* Amazing action scenes * Awesome special effects * Good plot * Suspense (it had me biting my freshly manicured nails and I had to stop myself) * Twists (I can think of 3 major ones that had me go ""whoa."") * Hot actors (the Cap, Chris Evans, is sooo handsome! And those shoulders, wow!) * Humor (though this is more serious than the other Avenger movies) * Heart * Romance (just slight. There was more bromance, though, I think.)<br/><br/>It's the kind of movie that both men and women would like. And kids, too. <br/><br/>When I saw Captain America part 1, I thought Captain America is the most ""heroic"" of all the heroes because he is very noble. This movie further cements that belief. Steve Rogers has the heart of a hero. (And the face of a god.)<br/><br/>Just like in the first Captain America movie, I was in awe of all the amazing things he can do with that shield of his, which he uses not just for defense, which is what shields are for, but offense as well. I told my seat mate, ""That is not a shield, but an all in one gadget - weapon, vehicle, umbrella!""<br/><br/>Also as always, the ending is set up for a sequel, and there are a couple of scenes after the credits, so make sure to stay for them. (We missed the second one again, dammit, Marvel.) And I'm getting quite good at spotting Stan Lee's cameo appearances in all the Marvel movies.<br/><br/>I am purposely not discussing the story because I went in with zero idea on what it was going to be about, and that made the surprises more pleasant for me."
"JPfanatic93","8","4","7","7 April 2014"," Cap on the run from America
","For those of you who were wondering when Marvel would finally more aptly acknowledge its roots in our contemporary world politics, this sequel does just that, offering a serious social commentary about the status of that wonderful thing called 'freedom' in modern (American) society. Without sacrificing the quality mix of catchy humour and solid action that characterizes all of the Marvel movies thus far, Captain America: The Winter Soldier proves there is room for contextual exploration of the modern zeitgeist on the big screen as much as there is on the pages of its comic books. Forget Iron Man battling terrorists in Afghanistan, there's deeper threats to be found on the homefront.<br/><br/>The first thing this movie does is re-establish the Star Spangled Avenger as a man out of time, providing character exposition that was lacking in The Avengers, since that film's alien invasion didn't allow much time for additional subplots. His homeland has changed much since the Forties and poor Steve Rogers ponders if he still fits in these more cynical times. Everyone he knew is dead or dying, as illustrated by a heartbreaking scene where he visits his former love Peggy, who has become a frail old woman suffering from degenerative diseases. Equally deteriorating seem to be his cherished notions on freedom. Civil liberties have been sacrificed to ensure national security and his employer, the ""peacekeeping"" organisation S.H.I.E.L.D., is keeping too close an eye on everybody's private affairs to his taste. Comparisons to the N.S.A.'s shenanigans are easily drawn, but in the tradition of the spy thrillers of the Seventies (from which this movie takes its fair share of notes thematically and stylistically), Cap 2 suggests the people have traded in their freedom, conditioned by growing fear the government was sowing in their minds of losing it. Naturally it's not wholly the fault of the executive power, as the movie identifies the Captain's principal enemy to be at the heart of this matter. The former Nazi science department HYDRA has made the transition to the 21st Century more smoothly than the Sentinel of Liberty himself, embedding itself firmly in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s upper echelons. Steve must find a way to root out America's hidden adversaries and end their collective mindcontrol dominating his country, all whilst on the run, accused of treason.<br/><br/>Enter his assorted allies. His gruff chief, Nick Fury, reluctantly starts asking questions when he tells Steve of a black ops project, designed to patrol the world neutralizing threats in their infancy, which Cap finds a revolting concept. It makes Fury a target for assassination, after which Cap teams up with Black Widow to find out who killed his guardian. Evans and Johansson make quite an enjoyable pair with great rapport, both having served as agents of the same secret organization, but carrying different views of their job and its methods; a relic of a more innocent time, Cap dislikes Widow's end-justify-the-means approach to things that the Cold War has taught her, causing the necessary verbal fireworks between the two that both provide character development and witty dialogue galore. Less compelling proves Cap's relationship with Sam Wilson, an army veteran who is more in line with his black and white line of thinking. Since an ordinary human being would be too dull at his side, Wilson soon dons a pair of mechanical wings, convenient leftovers of a secret military project. Comic connoisseurs will remember Wilson's alter ego the Falcon well before the appearance of this apparatus, which only feels a forced addition to the movie's progression.<br/><br/>Equally contrived an inclusion to the plot is the Winter Soldier himself. Serving as the ultimate assassin, a cyborg killer whose mind is wiped after every assignment so as to keep his human tendencies from compromising his ruthless efficiency, this man harbours a dark past and personal connection with his new target. Considering his limited screen time, this relationship, which turns out to be crucial at the film's conclusion, is not given its due to ensure the desired emotional impact, and feels largely as a set-up for a third movie. Nevertheless, the Winter Soldier proves quite a match for Cap and makes for a formidable foe to behold. The same can be said for Alexander Pierce, who fulfills a similar role except on a less physical level, serving as the movie's evil mastermind: an apt choice, considering the various political thrillers on Redford's resumé.<br/><br/>In terms of visual spectacle and explosive action, The Winter Soldier surpasses The First Avenger, trading in the predecessor's delightfully retro WW II style for a more intimidating modern look. Drones and missiles are all part of the package to give this movie a contemporary feel, but in typical Marvel fashion the movie tops this with even bigger guns and gadgets, the most exciting aspect three giant gunships hovering above the American capitol as they threaten to hold the nation hostage, at its own behest via security over freedom. Spectacular aerial battles are the result, while the movie also contains its fair share of hand-to-hand combat scenes, car chases and gun fights. Not to mention an ample dose of links to the larger Marvel Universe. You have to give kudos to Marvel's continuous method of seamlessly creating a larger whole out of separate pieces, without harming the content in said standalone stories.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a sequel superior to its predecessor. It couples valid, well-timed social anxieties to a good political thriller plot, while never ignoring the fun that is to be expected from a Marvel flick. Granted, not all characters come across as intriguing or convincing as ought to have been the case. This second Cap movie successfully introduces its protagonist to the new world he inhabits and the change in concept of the virtues he has always extolled, making this overly patriotic character much easier to digest for non American audiences, while giving domestic spectators an added value in having their nation's superhero redefine their mores for them."

","Many good words are said about actors play, action and visuals in this movie, so I will not repeat other reviewers. What I want to say is why I think this one is special, different from other superhero movies. Behind the face of action and special effects the movie carries deep messages. <br/><br/>First is personality and character of the main hero. Despite being myself Russian and grown in atmosphere of Cold War and competition with US I really like the character of Captain Rogers. For me he is Captain Real Man. I will choose this movie to watch together with my sons, when they grow up. So after it's finished I can say ""if you want to be a superhero - this is a fine example"". He had a dream. He worked hard and took risks to reach it. He stands for what he believes is right and is ready to give himself for his ideals. <br/><br/>The second message I noticed is Hydra. Ever-knowing and over-powerful threat. Their biggest weapon is personal information on people collected from internet plus ability to deliver death in any place any moment they want. And... this is not a fiction. It's very sad but I think it's already happened. There are databases on most of the people and there are silent hovering drones with guns patrolling sky. It happened already. The movie just surprisingly close shows it to us."

","I went and saw 'Captain America' at the cinema today. An early screening at 9am, reason being it was the only session showing 2d, not a fan of 3d. I was a huge fan of 'Captain America: The First Avenger', unlike most. Therefore I may be biased in my review, but i think Winter Solider is the best Marvel/Comic movie period , well apart from 'The Avengers' & The Dark Knight'. I know that's a bold statement, but its my opinion and i stand by it. I mentioned before, that I didn't enjoy 'Iron Man' 2 or 3 and especially 'Thor 2' and hated 'Man of Steel' with a passion. I can say its the first time in a very long time, that i walked out of a movie, totally satisfied in every way, when it comes to a popcorn flick, it ticked all the boxes. The theme has an uneasy mood of a 1970s paranoia thriller, which i loved,chock-full of the breathless cliffhangers dictated by the genre, but equally rich in the quiet, tender character moments that made the first film unique among recent Marvel fare. The title along is misleading, firstly Winter Solider only makes a cameo and Captain America's is def the straight man in this flick, surrounded by such a diverse ensemble cast in the same vain as 'The Avengers'. With Nick Fury, Black Widow and others characters getting their fair share of screen time. It should have been rather be called 'S.H.I.E.L.D: Retaliation'. Its like them calling the 'The Avengers' movie, 'Iron Man: Avengers Assemble', as Tony Stark kind of played the central role in it. But we mustn't forget it was an ensemble cast, just as much as Captain America: Winter Solider is. Watch it for yourself and enjoy."

","I thought Captain America: The Winter Soldier was superb. I think it's 10 times better than the first Captain America and I really liked the 1st film. The action, suspense, epic scale, its fast-pace, the twists and turns and just the sheer entertainment value of this film was brilliant to me. This is some of the best action Marvel has ever made in my opinion.<br/><br/>In my view, this is the best Marvel film released to date; even better than The Avengers. I was really impressed by it. <br/><br/>Obviously, I don't want you all to be disappointed after what I said, but I really do have a strong feeling most of you will really enjoy this film once you get around to it.<br/><br/>I would give it a 9.5/10."
"alucard_castlevania86","10","7","15","27 March 2014"," Better Than The Avengers
","This movie exceeded my expectations in a lot of ways. The plot was very interesting. I never would have guessed that the story turned out the way it did and thought that it was nothing more than just a Captain America v.s Winter Soldier battle. It definitely will make you question yourself about certain things in life such as friendship, loyalty and patriotism. <br/><br/>The actors all were well cast too and got more screen time in this movie than they had in the Avengers which is a good thing. Chris Evans cements his his as title lead character Steve Rogers. He displays his tough brute strength and integrity here perfectly. Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow was great here in her own way but I just couldn't see her and Cap as a couple here. Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury was the surprise one here for me since I never expected him to do some serious action in the film. Anthony Mackie's Falcon and Cobie Smulder's Maria Hills was a little letdown for me here (again) since I expected them have a bigger impact role in the film but they still managed to do their parts perfectly.Its been a while since I've seen Robert Redford on screen and his Alexander Pierce's character was also great to watch. A surprising entry for me would have to Emily Van Camp's Sharon Carter/Agent 13 character. I never expected her to have an impact to the film and she never really looked like it at first either. However, I really would have preferred her and Rogers to have more screen time together instead but she still did a solid job but the biggest performance for me would have to be Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier. The guy was an absolute terrifying and menacing opponent for Captain Rogers and really gave him a hard time. The shield was like nothing to him and if the fight between him and Rogers went on a little longer, I have a feeling that Rogers would definitely lose the fight <br/><br/>Most of the their fight's choreography were neatly well done. Kudos to that and the part where he grabbed the shield with one hand after Cap threw it at him was personally one of my favorite moments in the movie. The sub-plot between them was really good and and heart warming to watch. I was relief by how it ended between them but it did leave me asking what would have it been like if things had ended differently<br/><br/>The combination of CGI and special effects techniques were verygood and the amount of action was just awesome and more entertaining to watch than The Avengers. There are also a lot of great lines in the film that and moments in the film and the friendship moments between Cap and Winter Soldier in was very heartwarming but also made me sad. You somehow want to feel sorry for Bucky since he doesn't know why he does the things that he does because its all about orders. This movie also had some of the best lines and some enjoyable but not too over the top humor in it. The OST was really patriotic, memorable and darkish to listen too but I liked it verymuch<br/><br/>All in all, congrats Marvel. This movie deserves my perfect score rating. It slightly surpasses The Avengers but definitely way better than Iron Man 3 for me. Can't wait for Captain America 3. Lets hope they will bring in Baron Zemo next"
"grumpy-3","5","9","21","3 April 2014"," sorry nowhere near as good as the first one
","was so looking forward to this, as i thought the first one was great better than the iron man movies, but it was a let down, a very generic plot, you knew who the main baddie was from the start, could have made more of the winter soldier, action scenes were very good and them exposition scenes of utter tediousness and boredom, Redford looked like he wanted to be somewhere else, Evans and Scarlett were good as usual i just wish they had come up with a less predictable plot and some better dialogue, also could have done with a bit more humour, they have to get the captain to lighten up a bit, he and thor are always so solemn, this lacked the originality of the first film, and the inventiveness that it had."
"bhgyfr","10","5","10","20 July 2014"," Best Comic Movie Ever
","I would like to start off this review by quickly speaking about a 2012, masterpiece film, Marvel's Avengers Assemble. It was HUGE! There isn't any film that I can think of that would be as big as it, excluding it's next two sequels. But Captain America: The Winter Soldier, although not being as big as the Avengers, in all honesty was better. Sure, you can ultimately disagree. Feel free to and do all you can to try and persuade me into changing my mind, and eventually saying ""Wait! Yeah, I was wrong, Avengers is still better, and I was stupid to think otherwise..."" - ain't happening. Captain America: The Winter Soldier, although not being as hyped up for, and as big as the Avengers, in my opinion, was slightly better, if not quite a far bit better. It's by far my favourite Marvel film so far (alongside X-Men: First Class). <br/><br/>Let me tell you this- genuinely, it's more interesting to watch, has better action-scenes, has better dialogue all-round, has better weaponry, has better characters (and they're developed quite beautifully may I add), and above all else, has better directing. <br/><br/>Chris Evans returning in his recurring role as Captain. Steven Grant Rogers, the ultimate super-soldier who is upfront against James ""Bucky"" Barnes (a former friend of his who becomes a super-assassin and hardly even recognises or acknowledges Steve for who he is). <br/><br/>The film is literally full of action-packed, thrilling scenes, intense scenes, incredible visual effects, superb and interesting dialogue and much more. Seriously, this is the Captain America film, and more importantly, Marvel film you've all been waiting for. It really, really is. Recommended to all fans who have yet to make their minds up whether they wish to see it or not."
"jfgibson73","7","5","10","1 June 2014"," Incredibly High Level of Achievement
","It was striking how well made Winter Soldier is. I was really impressed with how much work went into this movie. The story plays out like a spy thriller, in a similar vein to Manchurian Candidate, but also fits in as much action as any movie could hope for. It's very well balanced, and includes the character development and smart writing that have made the Marvel movies so enjoyable. Captain America goes rogue when he is a suspect in the shooting of Nick Fury and has to unravel who has infiltrated S.H.E.I.L.D. Black Widow and Falcon help him out, and they are both made to be very resourceful on their own. I like Johansson here better than the Avengers--she seems to be putting more into the performance. I noticed that Captain America doesn't really use stealth in combat--when he fights, he goes through the threat in spite of what he's up against. There's a scene when a jet is trying to stop him while riding a motorcycle. Instead of jumping the bike to somewhere the jet can't follow, he engages and disables it. The Winter Soldier villain does this also, taking out Nick Fury in spite of his training, not going around any defenses. All the fights were lightning fast and had a level of interest to them where so many other action movies are full of scenes that never make us care. This isn't my favorite action movie, not even my favorite Avengers movie, but it was one of the times I've most been impressed by an action film."

"bluesman-20","10","5","10","21 April 2014"," Captain America VS S.H.I.E.L.D.
","Captain America:The Winter Soldier starts the new marvel era off with a lot of action. Winter Soldier takes the classic Nick Fury VS S.H.I.E.L.D story from the 80's and gives it a good sharp twist and makes it a Captain America Story. But one that travels the Marvel universe. S.H.I.E.L.D has been infiltrated by HYDRA. the entire organization has been taken over and on the eve of SHIELD'S biggest plan for world security . they plan to launch three helicarrier drones. Each Drone has the firepower to decimate a country. When a tense conversation with Captain America leaves Nick Fury thinking he tries to go into his files to find out more. Only to find out someone has blocked all access. Fury is targeted for termination. When he very narrowly escapes an attempt on his life he goes to the apartment of Steve Rogers. And asks for Captain America'a help. Fury is attacked in cap's apartment by a shadowy assassin called the Winter Soldier. He's as fast as Captain America and as strong with one cybernetic arm. And the Soldier is totally ruthless. As Fury lies dying in Cap's apartment he gives him a flash drive containing all of SHIELD'S secrets and tells him to trust no one. Cap takes Fury to the Hospital and contacts the Black Widow who was close to Fury. As the two heroes watch over Fury. Cap is ordered to SHIELD just as Fury dies. Steve hides the flash drive and goes over to see SHIELD'S Director Alexander Pierce. It is here Steve learns of how far Hydra's reach is. Steve is questioned by Pierce. When Pierce isn't satisfied with the answers to His questions he orders Steve Rogers killed.. Steve fights his way out of SHIELD. With only the Widow for help Steve must find out the answer to what Hydra is up to And to stop it. He also must confront the Winter Soldier again. Steve and the Widow recruit Sam Wilson a highly skilled former soldier code named the Falcon for good reasons. As Cap gets closer to the truth. And as he assembles his allies to take out SHIELD. He finds out the sinister truth about Who the Winter Soldier is.<br/><br/>CAPTAIN America : THE WINTER SOLDIER . is a fine action story that puts super heroes into a world best occupied by James Bond. and makes it work. Stay for the after credit scenes. And you'll find out just how far the ripples of this film go. A high degree of writing and skillful direction moves this film above the rest of the marvel films. Add in some fine acting and you got a great popcorn film. the Only Drawback to me was Robert Redford. While Redford is great as Pierce. It seems as if they ran out of things for him to do in this film. which is a shame. Redford adds a lot of class to this production. And he underacts to his credit which gives his scenes with Samuel L. Jackson's Fury a bigger and better dimension. After All His Pierce isn't a screaming Villain from the old cliffhangers who rub their hands and cackle in evil delight. He's a man of this age and this century who knows how to do things skillfully and hide them in plain view. All in All Winter Soldier is the best Marvel film released thus far. And that's saying something."
"Big_D_Box_Office_Score","9","5","10","4 April 2014"," Marvel's best stand-alone film yet
","It's been mentioned several times before, but Marvel is steam-rolling through box-office numbers with movies that seem to get better with every release, and their key to success has been making great genre films that just so happens to have their superheroes in them. Winter Soldier follows the blueprint - you can now check ""espionage-political thriller"" off of Marvel's do-to list. And they do it RIGHT. (I'm looking at you, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.)<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is, hands down, Marvel's best stand- alone film to date. Let's go through the rundown <br/><br/><ul><li>The main cast does an A+ job. Chris Evans shines, Samuel L. Jackson does Nick Fury justice, Anthony Mackie makes us care about Falcon, Sebastian Stan as The Winter Soldier is just right, and an especially great job by Scarlett Johansson, who really gets to cut loose with Black Widow this time around. ROBERT REDFORÐ as Alexander Pierce is a great fit, UFC star Georges St-Pierre as Batroc was terrific, and even many of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s lesser agents get some time to shine. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If you're following the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s TV show (and you should be, the 2nd half of this season has been TERRIFIC), then you'll be treated to a few bonus nuggets here and there. It's as if the show was slowing biding its time until Winter Soldier, as S.H.I.E.L.D. is a central focus of the movie, and will undoubtedly have massive effects on the show going forward. (This week's episode should be insane )</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If you're a Marvel fan (of course you are) with some knowledge of where the movie universe is heading in the next few years, then there's a few Easter Eggs sprinkled in to get you excited as well. Pay attention, because they're quick </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We opted for 2D this time around, but the movie was still visually beautiful. I wouldn't call 3D necessary, but I'm sure it would look great if you wanted to go that route. (If you see it in 3D, please let me know your opinion.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Where this movie absolutely shines is in its story. Winter Soldier will keep you guessing and hit you with at least 1 or 2 more twists than you were expecting. Seriously, Jack Ryan take notes. - The final battle is EPIC.</li></ul><br/><br/>The action is top-notch, but if there's one knock on Winter Soldier, it's that some of the action scenes suffer from that dreaded ""shaky- cam"", which is just a terrible thing to do when you've got so much great combat going on. It's not throughout the whole movie, but it's enough to notice.<br/><br/>The million dollar question: Is Winter Soldier better than Avengers? I say no but its 2nd only to Avengers as Marvel's best movie. And if you like espionage and internal politics in your action, then you might think differently.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier scores a 4.5 out of 5 on the ‪#‎BDBOS‬. Go see it. NOW.<br/><br/>Do I have to remind you to STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS? Two bonus scenes: one midway, another at the end. One of them will get you very excited <br/><br/>(Hey everyone, thanks for checking out my review.

Not that I loved the first movie, I was waiting for this movie to be released and just watched and I loved it. Visual treat as well as story are well framed and flawless. The winter soldier is portrayed very nicely. A whole lot of techs and thrills are filled from the beginning to the end of the movie. As a personal opinion, the black widow from Iron Man and avengers looks better than in this one. The movie is filled with humours which being an action movie, I had a lot of reasons to smile. Anyways, a must watch to all marvel lovers and DON'T MISS THE END.... u know what mean :)"

","This film tells how Captain America saves the world from evil despite being almost 100 years old.<br/><br/>I am thrilled to report that ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is way better than the first ""Captain America"". This time round, there is a great plot that cuts to the chase right from the start. It spends no time fluffing around, and there is action and adventure all the way through. Many scenes left me astounded, such as the extended battle scene involving Fury and the police cars, and the scene involving disaster on the 41st floor. The special effects are very impressive, but the 3D is very underwhelming. Most of the time I don't even notice the 3D.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" a lot. It is a great blockbuster!"
"griffolyon12","10","5","10","4 April 2014"," Cap is Back!
","Captain America is finally back in the most awesome Marvel film since The Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is everything that a fan could have hoped for with Marvel tackling this source material, and yet it is so different than any of the other films that Marvel has ever made. There is a more down to Earth, realistic aesthetic to this film. While there is still tons of sci-fi/fantasy concepts on display here, they're done in a nice real world way that keeps the film grounded in its political thriller aspirations. However, where this film really manages to distinguish itself is in the fact that this might be the most intimate Marvel film made thus far.<br/><br/>Set almost entirely in Washington D.C. this go around, the film picks up roughly a year after the events of The Avengers. Still a man out of time, Cap finds himself working for SHIELD, doing special ops missions with Black Widow, all the while finding it harder and harder to distinguish the right from the wrong in today's morally neutral society. Of course, Cap's moral compass puts him at odds with some of SHIELD's more gray area ideas, but when a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier arrives and starts wreaking havoc, a whole big conspiracy involving SHIELD, and just about everything else in Cap's world, starts to unravel.<br/><br/>When I mentioned earlier how intimate this film feels, it's because it truly is a character piece and is more about Steve Rogers' action/reaction to all of the events that unfold in this film. While there is a large spanning conspiracy that unfurls and bucket-loads of action that represent Captain America in a far more acrobatic way than we've ever seen him before, everything that occurs in this film, occurs not because they wanted action or explosions, but because it is driven by the characters' actions.<br/><br/>Once again, Chris Evans proves he's the right man to wield Cap's shield, with Scarlett Johansson really starting to make the Black Widow more and more her own. Originally just a piece of eye candy in Iron Man 2, Black Widow's character evolved in The Avengers, and here in The Winter Soldier, Johansson and the folks at Marvel finally deliver the Black Widow of the comics. There is a cold, cerebral quality to her that contrasts with her desire to do good and to be more human. Sure, she doesn't have a Russian accent, but who cares when the core personality of the character is there. Rounding out the superb cast is Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, aka the Falcon, and the gravitas-lending Robert Redford as a mysterious government man who helps run SHIELD, to say anymore might give away a few good surprises for moviegoers.<br/><br/>That is really the most exciting thing about this film, it's that there are constantly twists and turns, and you never really know where the film is heading next. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo really surprise here with a very taut directorial style that still manages to have life seeping through the cracks due to their natural affinity for comedy, injecting a nice sense of humor into some very dark moments to keep the ten year old boys relaxed and still having fun even when some intense stuff is happening. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is a villain to be reckoned with and is almost like Jaws in the way that whenever he is on screen, he is wreaking as much havoc and destruction as possible. You never quite know when the Winter Soldier will show up, and there is something so mysterious about the way he's represented that makes him genuinely terrifying whenever he comes out of nowhere. However, when more and more is revealed about the Winter Soldier and his origins, just like everything else in the movie for Captain America, things aren't so right and wrong and Cap must fight in that gray area himself in an emotionally powerful final fist fight with his enemy.<br/><br/>Overall, Marvel has delivered one of their finest films with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It is intense, funny, emotional, and gives your brain a nice workout because it's also very smart and full of nice twists and turns. Not to mention, it's an action movie, things go boom, punches are thrown, and people fly and shoot stuff. The fact that there's an emotionally charged story underneath all of the awesome action is merely icing on the cake. <br/><br/>Marvel fanboys are going to love this one, with Marvel fitting in more villains and characters from the comics into this one film than perhaps any other superhero film before it, and it all works organically, these additional characters only show up when it is required to tell the story and not just to be a fan service. Bottom line is, just buckle up and enjoy the ride of this one. It's rare to get a film like this in April, so definitely relish in its awesomeness, and also, as always with Marvel, stay till the very tail end of the credits if you want the whole experience that this film has to offer.<br/><br/>I give Captain America: The Winter Soldier a 10 out of 10!"
"agblum","9","5","10","4 April 2014"," Trust in Capt. America for an Entertaining Ride
","As one person I heard who had seen it before me said, the movie does play like a Tom Clancy and or Old Spy Novel.<br/><br/>The movie does a good job of clashing Capt. Rogers's 1940's clear sensibility of right and wrong, to the Modern Day Nick Fury's view of taking the World as it is, not how we would like it to be. The whole movie plays on that issue, and ""who do you trust?"" in today's complicated world.<br/><br/>For the most part, the acting is very good. Chris Evans plays Capt.Well again, as do Samuel L. Jackson as Fury, and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff– ""Black Widow"". Anthony Mackie is an outstanding addition as Sam Wilson – ""The Falcon"". He is instantly likable.<br/><br/>The one major knock I would give it, comes mostly in the 1st portion of the movie,where the fights are moving so fast, sometimes they are hard to enjoy. I think slowing it down a bit would have made it better.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's still a Very Good Movie.<br/><br/>For us fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Concluding Act changes things in a major way going forward for the coming films, and no doubt for TV's ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.LD"". And as in all MCU Movies – Stick around - 2 Post Credit Scenes.<br/><br/>While I didn't hate either Iron Man 3 or Thor: The Dark World at all, I definitely rank this one above those 2. Where I rank it compared to rest – I'll save that ranking after seeing it more.<br/><br/>3 1/2 out of 4 Stars, 9 out of 10"

","When an adversary, long thought to be dead, crops back and takes complete control of SHIELD, Captain becomes the mole and finds himself at the receiving end of a manhunt. Captain digs deeper to find out that there is more to SHIELD than meets the eye.<br/><br/>""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" is a fully packed explosive, much similar to those that go blazing on screen, that ignites at the start and keeps blasting its way until the end. The movie has all the proper ingredients for a full on entertainer (nefarious villain, evil plot, hero who rises, couple of sidekicks and finally the CG to help things up).<br/><br/>Chris Evans, as the misplaced-in-time superhero, is slowly getting accustomed to the new world (he watches SAW, Rocky) and finds new friends who later lend a helping hand. But the righteousness still prevails inside him that makes him pop out of the crowd like a 3D screen. One of the downfalls is to have not kissed since 1940s.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is the red-haired sidekick who kicks and fires in the meanest way possible in some not very nice places and keeps the action sequences alive.<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson goes easy on the swearing but no so on the bad guys and maintains his macho status that the character deserves. Anthony Mackie does his part and so does Robert Redford (he was almost unrecognizable without the glasses).<br/><br/>Like every other Marvel movie this one is no short for witty one-liners. A sample below:<br/><br/>In the middle of an ambush scene, Computer voice: Window Integrity failing ;Fury : Restart the car; Computer voice: Propulsion system offline; Fury : Switch to flight mode ; Computer voice: Flight sensors damaged ; Fury : Then what's not damaged? ; Computer voice: Air Conditioning is fully operational.<br/><br/>A word of Caution: If you are the kind that finds the artistic movies entertaining then please avoid this one. This is for the people who enjoy action movies and seek entertainment by neglecting a few logical flaws.<br/><br/>Captain America: Winter Soldier, will withstand the ""summer""."
"Alise_shenle","10","5","10","4 April 2014"," Captain America Is My New Hero
","When I first saw the first Captain America movie on DVD, I thought it was OK, slightly boring with the over-the-top Hugo Weaving as Hydra and the mad scientist. Only the last scene had me in tears. So when I said I wanted to watch this movie, many of my friends said it was quite boring, comparing it to Man of Steel. But I was glad that I watched it, because I think it's comparable to Avengers! First of all, the acting. All the good guys can act, Samuel L Jackson (How can he even emote with 1 eye? Marvelous), Sam, Chris Evans, Agent Hill etc. I liked how that the women were given more prominent roles, with Black Widow being the brains of the operation. Although she did have to be romantic with Steve and keep on talking about dates. Luckily, Steve kind of rejected that. He is just the type to love one woman forever! I think that kind of devotion is really the norm back in the 40s, and that is so rare, nowadays movies have a lot of kisses and hugs, more doesn't mean that it is meaningful. Another thing I really like about the movie is how Steve showed us to be true to ourselves. Just because he is a soldier doesn't mean he had to follow orders. It's what we do that matters, not who we are. Lastly, I am so shipping Captain America and Winter Soldier. Well, at the end Steve face a dilemma, whether to kill his friend or be killed. If it were me, I think I'd just save myself. But that is not his style. He just has so much faith in everyone that it just blows me away. He values teamwork and is a really transformational leader. Talking about the movie, it was really funny and the action scenes were great. The plot was really complicated for a superhero movie, but just stick it out and it pays off."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","10","4 April 2014"," Among the best
","The second installment of Captain America counts among the best offered by Hollywood to-date in this genre, for good reasons. If you think of all the class ""A"" action movies you have seen, be it crime or superhero, you may notice that they can all fit into one of the four or five main plot set ups. Among those, the best (and probably most used) is arguably the top agent turned fugitive, hunted by all the might and power of the organization that have been loyally serving. Obviously, this works best in getting audience identification with the hero. ""Winter Soldier"" is a good case of successful employment of this plot category.<br/><br/>Among all the superheros in the two major franchises (DC and Marvel), Steve Rogers has the optimum level of ""superpower"" for fueling the most exciting type of action sequences – good old fashion melee and shooting. Again, ""Winter Soldier"" takes good advantage of this, providing scene after scene of superbly well crafted sequences that you never get tired of watching.<br/><br/>Mandatory yet necessary are funny or witty gags which are sprinkled here at just about the right proportion. Example: Nick Fury, working furiously to survive a crushing ambush, gets progressively annoyed when one after another of the sophisticated combat/defense systems in his ultra state-of-the-art vehicle fail, as reported by the coolly impersonal voice of the computer. When utterly frustrated, he hurls an rhetorical question ""Is anything not broken down?"", the same impersonal voice replied ""the air condition is fully operational"".<br/><br/>Despite my somewhat brief account, I don't think the plot or the action sequence needs any further elaboration, which may even turn out to be detrimental to the audience's pleasure of discovery while enjoying the movie. A few brief words, therefore, on the cast.<br/><br/>Chris Evans has done a great job in wiping out the persona of flippant Human Torch Johnny Storm and successfully reinforced from the first ""Captain America"" the image of a traditional Gary Cooper or John Wayne type of hero from almost a century ago (Steve Rogers is ninety-something years old, remember?) A delightful surprise is Scarlett Johansson who the cheesy poster may lead to to think that is no more than punching and kicking eye candy in this movie. It is therefore quite a joy to see her as almost a co-lead, managing colorful KGB-turned-US-agent with an excellent balance of charisma and reserve. Seeing her usually as an icon, one sometimes forgets the broad dimension she commands, sometimes even playing a very ordinary girl-next-door as she did in Woody Allen's minor but quite delightful work ""Scoop"" (2006).<br/><br/>Those of us who grew up with Robert Redford take great pleasure in seeing how he enjoyed this casting-against-type role here. Over the years he has done so much, in every respect, that he deserves having some fun. The rest of the support cast have all turned in respectable performances. Samuel L. Jackson does what is expected of him. So do Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan. Stan Lee obviously has fun with his cameo (watch for him when Steve Roger is trying to find a Captain America ""uniform"" for the grand finale). Talking about cameos, I have to mention Hayley Atwell who really impressed me in ""Bridehead revisited"" (2008). Here, in additional to her performance in this brief cameo, special tribute should be paid to the makeup people."

It has all of the elements that made The First Avenger a great film, adapts them and then adds upon them to make a film that's unique and yet fits the Marvel style perfectly.<br/><br/>While the run time may seem a tad excessive, it is necessary to cram in all of the action of this film.

","Why this film is so great...<br/><br/>The main relationship centers on Cap's internal struggles, though Cap's relationships with Sam Wilson/Falcon and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow are also important. Cap and Fury's relationship is as tense as it was at the end of The Avengers. <br/><br/>A core theme surrounding Cap is the idea that he once used to represent America and has now become alien to modern thoughts and values due to the passage of time.<br/><br/>The camaraderie between the Falcon and Captain America is built on a shared military experience.<br/><br/>This movie stands on its own, but it certainly respects its roots in the origin film.<br/><br/>The film is really grounded in a believable world that supports the political thriller aspect, and it's helped by the caliber of the cast involved.<br/><br/>Seeing this level of emotional stakes of this hero's journey is rare.<br/><br/>The fighting is very visceral and believable.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is a negative image of Steve Rogers.<br/><br/>I like that he wears his heart on his sleeve. I find it endearing especially in today's world to have a character who doesn't hide anything and tells the truth and sees truth as an important component to being a human being.

","I heard there was a comic book where Captain America is a soldier working with another super hero before he turned into a super human and all. I expected movie to be like that but I was brutally wrong. ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" is a cool movie many Marvel fans would enjoy. <br/><br/>This film has a good amount to offer for all fans. This blockbuster includes action, romance, conspiracy, adventure, comedy, thrill and, of course, super heroes. <br/><br/>The story starts when Captain America is doing his thing saving everyone. Soon, however Shield starts to act more privately and a new project is being formed. Something is going on that that worries Captain America. What is it? And how does he fix it? To find the answer to these questions you must watch the movie. <br/><br/>This movie has a great cast and a great concept. However, because we all know how amazing this super hero is, the ending is somewhat predictable. Some moments drag a bit but the special effects are completely off the charts. The story line is nice. However, I would have liked this movie more if it wasn't told from Captain America's point of view. I think this film would be fantastic if it was told from Nick Fury's point of view. Some camera shots are so fast that they are a bit difficult to follow but overall, the special effects are spectacular! The technology alone in this movie will satisfy even the most discerning sci-fi fans. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Captain America is in an elevator and all kinds of people equipped with weapons enter on different floors. This is when Captain America realizes for the first time that something is not right. Finally, Captain America asks, ""Does anybody want to get off before we start this?"" Then, all people in the elevator attack him. It's an amazing action scene. I don't think this has ever been done before - such a complex fight scene in the tight space inside an elevator. The director and editors make the whole movie not only very engaging but very funny too with a great mix of emotions. <br/><br/>This film has tons of action, gunplay, death and some intense violence, so I recommend it for ages 9 to 18 and I would rank it 4 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>Reviewed by KIDS FIRST Film Critic Gerry O.

There simply wasn't enough story for one movie over 2 hours long.

I am a huge Avengers fan, I love the character of Captain America, I loved the Iron Man movies, the Thor movies etc, but somehow the Captain America movies just fall short. Now, this movie has great acting, it has relatively good dialogue. It introduces a new character right at the beginning, and he has some great charisma and he's very likable. But the plot to this movie is as the title of my review says, clichéd. Every action performed in the film is predictable. I got so bored while watching it, I was almost constantly checking my phone, and they could have made it a lot shorter than it was. There were so many unnecessary scenes and dialogue that did not improve the movie in any way. The ""major"" plot twists barely had an impact on me. All in all, good acting but poorly executed."

"B-R-M","5","3","5","30 March 2019"," Review: Captain America: The Winter Soldier
","First, the sequel to our American cap is just one thing.
Questionable.
Apart from having a heavy and slow pace, and having an antagonist out of nowhere, Captain America, the Winter Soldier lacks the narrative established in the first film of the CAP, the script is mediocre, I mean, if they were going to make the cap doing winter acrobatics of the Macho hard hit, minimal would have done something more or less similar to Iron Man 2, but there is nothing here.
The CGI while it's good, well, the characters and the script stop to want, likewise, the sequences where buildings are destroyed (for example, in the Falcon scene) is re forced and nothing exciting, the final battle of Cap and Bucky does not have the taste of fresh air as It was with the Red Skull, nor if Bucky is explored well, it feels forced that only why your friend in quotes abandoned you because of you is very foolish, or if you have a good background to make the character interesting, the action sequence is still had Endo the CGI, the narrative blur of the characters, and the script, leaves the movie very bad, not counting that is boring both objectively and personally, there is almost nothing interesting, the final battle is not exciting and less interesting than with the Red Skull with the first, the script is badly exploited knowing, that the sequels of Marvel are between good and decent, is boring and, no matter how much CGI has the movie (whether it is good or bad) if you do not have a good script and a good narrative of the per Characters, will be very bad, but unlike other sequels, this came out mediocre. 2.5/5."
"nmahoney2006","4","3","5","26 December 2014"," Formulaic
","Formulaic, boring. I wasn't compelled to care about the characters or the story. Interesting moral dilemmas always ended in the clichéd sentimental choice. For example, the climax, Capt throwing away his shield and most probably his life for his ""friendship."" I would expect Capt America to be intensely responsible for his life, for he has the potential to save millions or billions of people many times over. His choice was illogical and irresponsible to the larger context of his life and humanity. The way his character is morally structured, it didn't make sense.<br/><br/>I'm always baffled by these superheroes/saviors/good guys who are chased around and have no problem causing mass destruction and loss of life. Unless their mindset is to survive for the good of the many vs the few, although that mindset doesn't see coherence through the movie. Just another stupid movie, in my opinion."
"Eric_Cubed","6","3","5","20 September 2014"," Good but not Great
","I can't understand the lack of imagination in so many comic book movies. While this movie is put together well, and the acting is great, it lacks the vision and humanness that compelled the actual comic books to be so enjoyable. Kids and teens read comic books because they speak universal, mythological truths' in the language of unconscious energies. This is also known as religion. Deep down everyone understands powerlessness, inferiority and immortality within the framework of one's personal history, time period and culture. Given we grow up in families, these issues are all the more important to kids and teens, especially issues of power and growing pains inherent in the developmental stages. Captain America personifies the sensitive and vulnerable person who is transformed into a superhero with superhuman abilities in the blink of an eye. Add patriotism and unquestionable evil (Hitler and Nazism) and the formula for a great character is born. He represents the fears and potentials we all hope for but cannot achieve due to our animal, mortal nature. One reason why Star Wars was so successful was because it understood that myths are alive and well in the modern age (though obscured by Rationalism and Science) and it transferred this psychological need onto celluloid. Movies are no different than superstitions; we just don't believe them as such. But they are still private dreams in the public domain, and because of this it feels dishonest and mindlessly inauthentic to gloss this value over with endless CGI action, lack of depth, and most of all characters who are so one dimensional and simplistic they could not have come from anywhere but a derivative formula. A convenient villain with a metal arm forged in the same time crucible as Steve Rogers who looks like one of the werewolves (in human form) from Twilight and is so totally devoid of imagination the viewer is easily distracted by the most mundane of distractions. How about this for a villain: Deep in the depths of lunatic asylum, festering and wasting away in a cell of powerful medications and medical experiments, the villain one day begins to hoard his meds and slowly remember who he is and where he is from—a Nazi experiment that used the same technology as that which was used on Rogers. And instead of a lame metal arm, when he is consumed with hatred and revenge his superpowers become more powerful, more diabolical and more fascinating whatever they may be. I'm not saying I know the political and financial ins and outs of making a great movie. But come on."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","5","3","5","7 August 2014"," No rhythm.
","I said I was done after The Avengers. I kind of wish I stuck to my word. I kind of like Captain America, at least I like him most out of the gang because I like Chris Evans a lot, but his movies have been mediocre at best. I thought the guise of 70s political thrillers would make a difference for The Winter Soldier until I remembered that I don't actually like many 70s political thrillers that much. The biggest problem with the film is that it has no rhythm. It has quiet talking-loud action syndrome with uninspired set pieces, unpolished effects, melodramatic dialogue and unconvincing fight scenes. It tries to have atmosphere but it feels more cobbled together than anything. Now I kind of like its idea, the idea that Captain America is unfamiliar and anxious about the surveillance of our modern world, but it feels blown out of proportion in a way that's illogical and needlessly convoluted. It can be mildly entertaining at times with witty one liners and clever action (Scarlett Johansson excluded) but its biggest crime is it drags. It makes me wonder if kids really enjoy this. The Russo brothers should stick to comedy, clearly they were swamped with notes from execs. It's not a bad film but it's barely average. I'll see Guardians of the Galaxy eventually but hopefully I won't be duped twice. I'm out, Marvel.<br/><br/>5/10"
"TheMarwood","5","3","5","7 August 2014"," Right off the assembly line
","Straight off the Marvel assembly line, Captain America: Winter Soldier has a convoluted plot about S.H.I.E.L.D being compromised and a mysterious villainous soldier who has a link to Rogers' past. A half assed attempt at subversive material about surveillance, is a couple of throwaway lines of dialogue. A sequence showing a Captain America exhibit at a museum, is a poor expository recap of parts of the first film and why Rogers would show up to an exhibit of himself so he can be reminded of his own past is forced and silly. Who needs memories when you have a narrator and museum artifacts to remind yourself what your purpose is. The new addition to this material is Anthony Mackie who is forced into this story like a jagged puzzle piece. In typical Marvel fashion, the third act is generic action that takes over the narrative. Very little of it is exciting or practically staged - it's mostly animation and feels pre-visualized by committee filmmaking and has no real vision. A soul deadening scene at an Apple store add to the assembly line feel. This is featherweight stuff that's easy enough to sit through, but it feels more like a product than a film and takes absolutely no chances."
"kyle-domination","8","3","5","27 May 2014"," An exceptional return to form from Marvel. A superior superhero thriller.
","Well, despite how ""average"" the first one was, I went to see the second. And oh boy I am glad I did (you can already tell this is a positive review). More to the point, the film is one of, if not the strongest individual Marvel installments to date. One part spy thriller, one part character journey, one part action movie, and one part straight-up superhero adventure film, The Winter Soldier hits all of the right notes and serves as an example of the very best of what comic book movies have to offer. I was extremely surprised at how much I enjoyed the film in the first place. The beginning of the movie is a sort of message from the directors, ""Welcome Back to the Marvel Universe"". In The Avengers, Captain America acted like just a normal soldier who can jump high and punch hard but in The Winter Soldier, his powers really do shine. His superhuman strength and agility is shown perfectly, like the comics, and this is one of the main improvements from the first film and The Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier benefits from a great story, solid actors, realistic CGI, action and also a mysterious, haunting villain, The Winter Soldier. Character isn't sacrificed for the sake of plot, though. The Winter Soldier is a well-balanced film that involves comedy, drama, and action. The big and small moments are equally thick with tension and there is some powerful development in this film. In fact, Chris Evans' Steve Rogers / Captain America in some ways becomes the most relatable of the Marvel heroes in this film, which is, of course, a bit odd, given his origin.<br/><br/>Story: Post-Avengers, Rogers is a useful asset for superspy organisation S.H.I.E.L.D., but also a pain in the backside. During a great opening set-piece in which Rogers, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and a squad of S.H.I.E.L.D. goons take out a crew of pirates, our hero complains of being forced to play ""Fury's caretaker"". This is not what he signed up for. This is not what America should be doing. History has seen the nation gradually diminished from world's saviour, to world's policeman, to a ""caretaker"" over the course of decades. For Rogers the moral decline appears instant, and it rankles intensely. Then, the viewers are warned, that there is a mole inside S.H.I.E.L.D and Cap needs to find who it is and from then on...disaster strikes. The Winter Soldier makes his appearance and Cap has his most challenging enemy. The story has an old-school thriller vibe and is certainly Marvel's most mature film even though there are pretty much no explicit scenes. It's a sort of action epic conspiracy thriller mystery all in one. And the filmmakers, Anthony and Joe Russo, nail it all. The Winter Soldier doesn't fall in the cliché pit like it's Iron Man brothers and therefore makes it one of Marvel's most enjoyable movies. 8/10<br/><br/>Action and Acting: The Winter Soldier's action is one of the most surprisingly visceral of all and The Russo Brothers definitely show how powerful Cap is. From punching baddies to throwing his SHIELD (haha) against packs of goons, knocking the living daylights out of them. It's brutal and is actually really cool to watch. Agent Romanoff's agility is unmatchable and The Winter Soldier's power is underestimated. There is much more to admire and The Winter Soldier has plenty of epic action scenes hidden up it's sleeve. The Acting in The Winter Soldier is also great as you expect from a Marvel film so there is nothing to judge about. 9/10<br/><br/>The ending may be a bit negatively unorthodox but the film Marvel is made is one of the best they have ever made. A perfectly enjoyable thriller epic that hits all the right boxes. Go and see it. I rate it 8.7 out of 10."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","8","3","5","9 April 2014"," A spectacular and unique Marvel movie for both fans and non-fans
","After watching Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, I wasn't very optimistic about the the MCU franchise especially since I am not really a Marvel fan because of the repetitive trend with their characters. But after watching The Winter Soldier I see that Marvel has finally achieved in taking their big- name characters more seriously but still retain the stylistic humour without over doing it this time. The film is a tremendous leap forward from where the character Steve Rogers started in The First Avenger. The sequel has better action sequences, humour, and most importantly, character development.<br/><br/>The action is the best I have ever seen in a superhero movie since 2008's The Dark Knight. The Russo brother truly did a great job of directing the action sequences by putting restraint on the cgi when they could and have actual car chases and practical gun fight effects. Despite the film having two super-human characters, Captain America and the Winter Soldier, the hand-to-hand combat with the two is so well choreographed and feels almost real.<br/><br/>Another problem on the Marvel films I have had is the overuse of humour where it didn't need to be. Too many of them relied on useless comic relief that became more annoying then fun. With the Russo brothers having experience in directing comedy like Arrested Development and Community, they have better handle on the humour. While there is no comic relief in this, pretty much most of the characters, especially the dialogue between Captain America and Black Widow, deliver humour that is witty and smart while not feeling forced.<br/><br/>And finally the most important thing in the film is having the characters evolve. By using major political themes and issues that are relevant today, it allows us to see Captain America struggle with whether he is stilling fighting for freedom or the sacrifice of freedom for global security. And this theme is something that allows to see more depth with characters like Nick Fury and Black Widow. And at times, makes the audience, like myself, question where global security stands today.<br/><br/>Overall, regardless if you are or not a fan of the MCU franchise, The Winter Soldier is a great character-driven thriller with strong political themes that is definitely worth seeing."
"fvhimawan","8","3","5","7 April 2014"," Love it....
","I always love superhero movies... I don't read the comic, but from the 1st and the 2nd movie, one thing that surely being the character is that Steve Rogers always have different way of thinking which emphasize many values of humanity and not just derived by being ""true"" or being ""wrong"".<br/><br/>In this sequel, one thing that I didn't get the point was why should Captain America steal his old uniform from the museum ? I thought it was to help Bucky gain his memory back, but what I saw is that was just to create some humor.<br/><br/>When Nick Fury presumed dead, I was 100% sure that he was not, so, I think such trick has been used million times in movies and it will be a lot better if the scenario didn't put such plot."
"ivo-cobra8","10","4","8","24 October 2015"," The best Marvel comic book superhero movie of 2014 so far!
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is the best Marvel comic book Action Superhero movie and one of my favorite films of The Avengers! Big, busy and action-packed - like the first movie, but with better pacing. It is a huge improvement over Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) I am sorry but I don't think Joe Johnston is making a good films. He even screwed up my favorite film Jurassic Park III. Great movie! I didn't like the first Captain America but I LOVE this one. Great acting, great story, great action, great EVERYTHING. Marvel Studios continues to improve upon and expand this superhero universe and it shows with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The action is turned up, the performances are top notch, plus with the addition of Robert Redford raises the bar yet again. Chris Evans certainly owns this role know just as Downey owns Tony Stark. <br/><br/>I LOVE LOVE LOVED the Iron Man trilogy. There are lots of great intrigue moments, though I think some of the biggest ""plot points"" on this one were spoiled thanks to the marketing and broader fan base knowledge of the whole ""Winter Soldier"" subplot in the comics. Regardless, it was a fun ride, albeit predictable as far as the internal politics end goes. The themes in this one are far more ""mature"" for a comic book movie, too--it almost felt more like a political action thriller à la Jack Ryan rather than a comic book based film, which made me love it even more. Phenomenal cast (the returns were fantastic as always, but the new characters also really did great work!), great music, the action sequences in this are SO awesome and generally I left this movie feeling very satisfied. I'm definitely going to see this more than once. It also makes me want to watch Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., which I haven't actually seen yet, but apparently there were plenty of references!<br/><br/>Overall, this was a huge improvement on the first Captain America movie, which I actually didn't liked that much but it was a good movie. I'd venture to say I liked it more than The Avengers. D: Chris Evens gave us a wonderful performance as Captain America, it was the most Action comic book film I have ever seen! This film has a heart, it is Entertained, fast paced, filled with full of actions. Samuel L. Jackson did a wonderful job as Nick Fury, finally his character did something to do in this film, like fighting with assassins and so on. I loved him in this film much better than I did in Avengers : Age of Ultron (2015)in this film he has everything in it. Scarlet Johansson did a good job a supporting cast as Natasha Romanoff she wasn't annoying in here, she was a good supporter to cap. I hated her in Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron, but in this film I like her and I have enjoyed watching her in this film screen. This is the most wildest, most colorful team of superheroes ever brought to life on the big screen, is a massive success, a fan favorite and a critical darling. Winter Soldier, a tense, dramatic conspiracy thriller that somehow makes its strangest comic book elements work wonders, is a masterfully conceived and executed sequel that takes Captain America -- and, along with Guardians, the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe -- in a bold, exciting direction. Both are outstanding films. Both boast astonishing confidence, production design, action and visual effects. Both are terrific fun. Both represent a brave new world for comic book movies. And each one for completely different reasons. <br/><br/>Which is Marvel's crowning achievement? How do you even compare the two? Answer: you don't. Other than ranking the films by personal preference, it's a fool's errand to pit Cap, Black Widow and Falcon against Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot. You sit back, think to yourself it's good to be a geek, soak it all in, and wait for the inevitable Avengers crossover. Love 'em both. Watch both of 'em over and over and over again. Enjoy each one on its own terms. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) was probably my second favorite Marvel film of 2014 but this one Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a kick ass best film ever! This film kick's Joss Whedon's Failure Avengers Age of Ultron in to the ground! This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth.<br/><br/>As Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with another super soldier, the Black Widow, to battle a new threat from history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier. I love this movie and I don't care what anyone say! It Is my favorite best Marvel film of 2014!<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a 2014 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.

","If I had to use one word to describe this movie it would be thrilling: it just keeps going on a on without ever slowing down and it is constantly involving, I was genuinely on th edge of my seat for most of the movie. All the cast is doing a great job: highlights apart form Chris Evans for me would be Scarlett Joansson and Sebasian Stan, giving a great presence by using just the eyes. The set-pieces are breathtaking and they are used for great action scenes which always carry on the storytelling with them, never did they feel useless. The story is very intricated yet it never confuses you or takes you out of it, but there is some great stuff left there for multiple viewings that I loved. Special effects are flawless as always from Marvel Studios and the character design for the winter soldier was wonderful. I do think that the first action sequence is very messy and has some poor cinematography, all around the first five to ten minutes of the movie didn't feel like the best opening but anyways it picked up quickly after. I do think the story takes a couple of minor shortcuts that bothered me, but in the end the plot was very well thought out and the storytelling was most definitely successful. I will have to see this movie another one or two times to fully enjoy it and I mean that in a positive way. As comic book geek I cannot thanks Marvel enough for all of the fan service there was in this movie, these are the things that make me happily freak out and that make comic book movies great for me. Post credit scene was good enough but not the best I have ever seen."

","Freedom is something that we all want; the freedom to work, freedom to play and freedom to live life. But now that the NSA has been exposed to having been tracking your social media pages, email, and phone, there has been a split debate over whether we still have personal immunity. Some say that they don't mind the extra eyes as long as there being used to catch potential bad guys. But a lot claim that if we're being spied all the time, then doesn't that defeat the purpose of having private lives? How can we sleep knowing that the government could be looking at you or me as a threat to the country?<br/><br/>I've always felt fine with the extra security as I have nothing to hide, but I can understand why others could feel compromised by their computer trails being tracked. They could hit the wrong link and that web history would forever be imprinted on you; maybe not on a computer, but in some possible super computer hidden is a military/government building. It's only conspiracy theory, but it's reasonable theory. The Marvel studios decided to take a stab at the whole government surveillance controversy in its latest superhero story, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>Like the previous sequels of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, we see where Steve Rogers ""Captain America"" (played by Chris Evans) is after the events of The Avengers. He's currently residing in Washington D.C. where he works for S.H.I.E.L.D. as he struggles to adapt to a modern society. His latest mission has him, agent Natasha Romanoff ""The Black Widow"" (played by Scarlett Johansson), and other S.H.I.E.L.D. representatives to save one of their ships from Algerian pirates. The assignment proves successful, though the Captain finds Romanoff extracting information from a computer. He was not reminded of this objective and he starts to question the purpose of the mission.<br/><br/>Top agent and leader of the avengers Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is ambushed by assailants as led by the mysterious Winter Soldier. Fury's seamless death leads the Captain to be question by senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce (played by Robert Redford). This causes the Captain to become a fugitive target from the agency he swore to help. He escapes from the headquarters to meet with Romanoff. They use information from a USB drive given to the Captain from Fury to lead them to an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D facility that reveals that Hydra, the evil organization from the first Captain America movie is alive within S.H.I.E.L.D., secretly operating within the ranks to take over the world.<br/><br/>When you really look at Captain America compared to the other heroes, all he really does is lead the others that have real super powers. The Captain only has enhanced strength, which made me question whether his films could work on their own. Captain America: The Winter Soldier crushed those assumptions by proving that the Captain just may be the most interesting avenger of all. He may be a strong fighter, but he's still scared and out of place within the modern world.<br/><br/>Chris Evans proves again that he is the Captain; patriotic but never over the top and conservative, but open to letting people making an impression on him. Scarlet Johansson and Samuel Jackson deliver their promised performances with fun and chemistry. Redford takes a great turn in character that I can't give away. Unlike the first movie that was a nostalgia trip of WWII movies, here we have more of a modern espionage thriller turned blockbuster with a hint of political commentary.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier took more chances with it's scenarios then the previous film, making this one much superior. It also delivers on the action, giving incredible fighting sequences that's more then shield throwing; it's good old-fashioned blunt fighting and martial arts. It goes with what it knows and finds ways to make them better. Get ready for two amazing sequences that are on par with The Avengers.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten winter soldiers out of ten. Marvel and Disney continue to prove that they know their comic boo movies and I'll be ready to be watch the next one, Guardians of the Galaxy, on the opening night."
"nbalive_fanatic","8","4","8","5 April 2014"," Marvel gets mature
","Where do I start? Well, I'll begin by stating I would easily put this amongst the best comic book/superhero sequels ever made. I also feel it's the best of the MCU films released post Avengers. It's fast and furious, but certainly has enough story and character development to balance things out. At just a little over two hours, it never feels bloated or overlong and there's enough going on to keep you on the edge of your seat until the final credits roll. <br/><br/>I had a feeling going in that the action would be the highlight, but here was the surprise...Marvel Studios offers up their grittiest and most adult-friendly film yet. Sure, it's bombastic, but the plot fashions itself more as a geopolitical spy thriller than a superhero epic. Think Jack Ryan or James Bond with an indestructible shield. The combat is very grounded and practical. Lots of hand to hand, probably the most gun play (sans Punisher) I've seen in a Marvel movie and outside of the finale, fights that take place on the streets. There's also some social commentary that plays alongside the story concerning the level of privacy this country has. Heck, the world even. We can all linked by technology through a few clicks of a button, which is as amazing as it can be terrifying. On top of that, someone is always watching. What are the powers that be doing with what they find from said watching? The film touches on such matters, adding a little wrinkle of legitimacy. Yea, there's a McGuffin that would help the villains achieve world domination, (big surprise, right?) but it's built upon some real world ideas and fears. <br/><br/>To wrap it up, this movie does for Marvel what The Dark Knight did for DC. It forces you to take the source seriously. Captain America: The First Avenger (underrated in its own right, I think) was a fun romp. A throwback superhero flick that let you escape and flip your brain off for two hours. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. The Winter Soldier is an entirely different beast. This time around, there are shades of gray. There are statements made about jaded idealism and blind loyalty. There is fun to be had, but it's not the pure sugar rush The Avengers was. It's got a great mix of action, drama and intrigue. Plus, there are a few laughs peppered to keep things loose. Go see it whether you're a comic book fan or not. It delivers on nearly all fronts."
"kevbowdc","8","4","8","4 April 2014"," Captain of the Marvel Sequels
","So, let me start out by saying that I walked into this movie with the lowest of expectations. After the credits, I walked to the nearest Bakery and purchased the biggest slice of humble pie. This movie exceeded every expectation and was well worth the wait. After the okay sequel of Thor, I expected the same for captain America. Not only was this a great movie, but the best sequel from the Marvel franchise.<br/><br/>So just a quick synopsis: ""Captain America"" struggles to embrace his role in the modern world and battles a new threat from old history: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier. Captain America delivers! His action was subtle in the first movie but they took it up quite a few notches in this one. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. And I am so proud of Chris Evans who successfully transitioned from a comedic to a more serious actor. His performance didn't blow me away but he fits well into his CA role. He doesn't take it too seriously but gives a performance that's efficient for the role. <br/><br/>You can tell that not much CGI was used in this film compared to the other Marvel films... but that's what makes it so great! It all felt so real that it could be too real at times. Especially the non-stop action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. If only I could rewind some parts of the movie to review the fighting sequences because they were exceptional. <br/><br/>The acting: All around well done. Scarlett is awesome black widow and Samuel L Jackson delivers what you expect. But I must point out the newcomer Anthony Mackie who deserves a spin-off as the falcon. I've always been a fan of his and it is about time that he is being shown in a huge blockbuster. He rocked as the falcon and I see great potential in his character. Finally, the Winter Soldier was an exceptional villain. He was a bad-ass, very-well constructed and well written. He was a formidable foe against CA and the audience will be pleased with what they see. <br/><br/>In conclusion: go and see this movie. It was money very well spent and it gives the marvel franchise justice. My only issue with the movie was with the 3D. I really do not think that it was needed. Some of the shots were dark and with the glasses made it darker and harder to see. The movie is just as great without them. I hope that Marvel continues to deliver good films like this one because I can now say that Captain America is my new favorite character."

","The sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger, 'Captain America: The Winter Solider' is good fun, but only till it lasts. If you are willing to let go off clichés & a sluggish pace, then the Captain is all you want this weekend! <br/><br/>'Captain America: The Winter Solider' Synopsis: Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world and battles a new threat from old history: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is been-there-seen-that, as far as the Script is concerned. What I was particularly disappointed by, was its sluggish pacing. The pace is still considerably tight in the first-hour, but is loose & dreary in the latter-hour. <br/><br/>Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely's Screenplay hardly offers anything new, but to what it sticks too, which is quintessential super-hero mode, it does justice to it. Anthony & Joe Russo's Direction is epically mounted. Cinematography is top-class. Editing is dull. Special Effects are awesome. The Action Set-Pieces are expertly executed. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Chris Evans as Captain America, is pimping hot. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, does fairly well. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon, is alright. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, enacts the bad-guy, effortlessly. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, looks least interested. Sebastian Stan as James ""Bucky"" Barnes / Winter Soldier, leaves a strong impact.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is passable, good-looking entertainment."
"rumasuk","8","4","8","30 March 2014"," great stuff
","i loved the film, it was awesome. <br/><br/>The story is about events of the political direction of shield, but its really a simple story, kind of dumb actually like any other marvel movie, but the theme of the movie is kind of relevant in our current lives and that kinda makes this movie really bold, it even has a point of view!. the winter soldier will be there kicking ass, and let me tell you he is awesome, a freaking delight to watch, and they give you many action scenes with him involved, but the movie is not really about him, its about shield, winter soldier will start his story here, but any development of the character will be made in sequels. also black widow who was on cap's side all the movie and falcon, the team 's Milhouse were really cool specially widow, who is kinda more interesting, and for some reason her relation with cap was my favorite thing in the movie.<br/><br/>The action was class A material, super soldier serum awesomeness, cap falls 20 stories, breaks walls, kicks ass, and the winter soldier does the same but on the opposite side, the coolest thing is that his metal arm is kind of a reversal to cap's shield in some ways. There's is just enough action here. The acting was great as always (thank you marvel studios) Evans is cap, and widow feels kind of right this time by being the same but more developed (not sure if it makes sense). The directing of the Russo brothers was top notch, great cinematography, choreographed scenes, a couple of dumb moments but overall, a major step up from the first film, this movie really kicked ass.<br/><br/>what i liked most is that is kind of a bromance movie, but between cap and widow, you feel they are really bonding, in a bro way, some sexual tension yes, but mostly good awesome fun multi gender friendship, the writers really made widow cap's current best friend and both together were really fun to watch, you can see they're having fun with each other.<br/><br/>spoiler talk!!! Crossbones is born at the end of the movie, winter soldier is free looking for answers, and shield is down!, I'm really curious on what they'll do next but I'm freaking excited for the 1st after credits scene, the twins are ready, and judging by the Italy shoot, the first mission in movie 2 will be in baron Von Strucker's castle, fighting the kids."

","I watched the first 'Captain America' film around 3 years ago in the cinema and I have to say, it was awful. Without a doubt the worst superhero film I've ever seen. So when I heard that 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' was coming out, I thought it wouldn't be any different. I only went to see this film because I am a huge superhero movie fanatic and by the end of the film, my jaw dropped. I was so wrong about this film.<br/><br/>Chris Evans displays an incredible performance right from the very start. The story line was amazing gripping me all the way through the film. When the Captain removed the 'Winter Soldier's' mask from his face, I did not expect it to be Bucky in all my life. I would never have guessed that. Although it was pretty obvious that Nick Fury wouldn't die and it was very predictable, this was one of the best Marvel films I have ever seen, And I really hope they continue this series"
"caseymoviemania","9","4","8","29 March 2014"," A taut and engaging sequel that cleverly mixes comic-book sensibility with political-thriller undertones.
","When news broke out that 2011's CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER director Joe Johnston did not return for the sequel and replaced by Anthony and Joe Russo instead, I felt skeptical at first. After all, we are talking about these directors whose previous directing experiences consisted of *gulp* comedies including 2002's WELCOME TO COLLINWOOD, 2006's YOU, ME AND DUPREE and TV's Community. It's definitely a very odd choice to choose such filmmakers for tackling a blockbuster movie that is seemingly out of their leagues. But upon finally watching the sequel in the cinema, I was really surprised that the Russo brothers are unexpectedly the right choice for CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER. Better yet, this sequel is noticeably more improved than the first movie.<br/><br/>WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?<br/><br/>In this sequel, Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) continues his duty as a S.H.I.E.L.D. team leader who engages on counter-terrorism missions under the direct order of S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). At the beginning of the movie, Rogers and his fellow team members, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) are assigned to rescue the hostages on a S.H.I.E.L.D. ship hijacked by pirates. However, the mission proves to be more than just a mere assignment when Rogers find out that Fury and Romanoff are keeping a secret. Things get worse when there's an assassination attempt against Fury that leads to a wide conspiracy theory involving S.H.I.E.L.D. as well as the mysterious appearance of an unstoppable ruthless killer nicknamed The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan).<br/><br/>THE GOOD STUFF<br/><br/>For first-timers who exposed to big-scale action movie like CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER, directors Anthony and Joe Russo does a tremendous job like seasoned pros. Surprisingly enough, most of the action sequences are top notch which has that sense of urgency to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>But the real deal here is the way Anthony and Joe Russo made a lot of efforts to distinguish CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER from your average Marvel movie. Working on a tense script from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, it's a refreshing change of pace to see a comic-book movie is fueled with political intrigue. Apart from that, Anthony and Joe Russo also make good use of their comedy background to come up a couple of witty one-liners as well as snappy verbal exchanges along the way.<br/><br/>As Steve Rogers/Captain America, Chris Evans fares better than he did in the first movie as well as THE AVENGERS. This is because his character is finally given a chance to evolve more than just a strictly by-the-book superhero who follow orders. Not only that, he also improved a lot in terms of fighting scenes as well as his excellent use of shield. And despite this is a solo movie, Anthony and Joe Russo ensure that most of the supporting actors here are given a fair share of limelight. As Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Scarlett Johansson is as stunning as ever. Anthony Mackie acquits his role well as Steve Rogers' sidekick, Sam Wilson/The Falcon while Samuel L. Jackson is blessed with a bigger and important role this time around as Nick Fury. Finally, there's Robert Redford, who gives a solid performance as the mysterious S.H.I.E.L.D. senior leader, Alexander Pierce.<br/><br/>MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)<br/><br/>Marvel fans rejoice! There are plenty of memorable moments throughout the movie and here goes: the intense car chase scene between Nick Fury and the police that ends with a showdown against the Winter Soldier; the claustrophobic fight scene in an elevator where Steve Rogers takes down a couple of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents; the exciting scene where Steve Rogers jumps off from his motorcycle while throwing his shield to take down a S.H.I.E.L.D.'s jet (Quinjet); the explosive battle scene at the highway that ends with an one-on-one fight between Steve Rogers and the Winter Soldier; and the extended climactic finale involving the helicarriers.<br/><br/>THE BAD STUFF<br/><br/>At 136 minutes (which makes this as Marvel's second longest movie after 2012's THE AVENGERS), there are times the plot feels a bit heavy-handed. And for a CAPTAIN America movie subtitled as THE WINTER SOLDIER, it's rather surprising that Sebastian Stan's character as The Winter Soldier himself is sadly underwritten (although he looks good during the action sequences).<br/><br/>While there are plenty of praises to be had for the action sequences, I just couldn't help it but feel some of Anthony and Joe Russo's camera-work is inconsistent. For instance, most of the opening set-piece on a ship is hard to tell what's really going on because the way they utilize too many tight close-ups and whip pans.<br/><br/>FINAL WORDS<br/><br/>CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER may have its fair share of flaws, but this sequel remains engaging enough to qualify as one of the best Marvel movies ever made. Likewise, don't leave your seat once the end credits rolls. And just so you know (especially for fans), there are two teasers at the middle and another one at the conclusion."
"abouhelier-r","10","4","8","29 March 2014"," Captain America: The Winter Soldier
","As Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world and battles an old threat from his own past: Hydra. A new enemy appears: the Soviet agent known as The Winter Soldier. <br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier trailer looked so good when it came out almost a year ago. We know that it's a Marvel movie, there's a lot of money behind it. And it's obviously a new super hero movie. The question back then was how does the story look? It's spy-espionage related around a larger than life super hero. And it's working pretty well. Writers took a comic book film very seriously, as a crime story which is a great way to approach this type of material. A little bit like Nolans did for The Dark Knight. And as usual settings look very fun. Furry get his ass kicked, which is great because it takes a character that have been a kind of invincible awesomely cool guy, and show his human side, his vulnerability. Plus, Robert Redford (Alexander Pierce) add some serious actor credibility to the movie. My favourite scene is the ""elevator"" one. Rogers appears almost naive. But here he proves that he may be idealistic but he's certainly not stupid. At the end of the fight, he kicks that thing up like it's Marty McFly's skateboard but it's cap shield, so cool. The Winter Soldier is some sort of anti-hero, not really a villain, but a very bad ass soldier on his own way. I believe that other than Loki he's the most successful villain character. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the strongest instalment of the individual productions. It's operating on several level with a sharp script and displaying several level of actions such as: gun fight, handsome hand-to-hand combat, and really well executed car chases. Marvel is offering a very good piece of entertainment. I feel like they've taken every lessons they've learn from every previous films and it's right there on the screen. With those events, they can't come back. It can potentially reverberate into every single other Marvel property *NO SPOILER* but I can't wait to see how it will go. <br/><br/>If you thought The Avengers was Marvels best action movie wait until you see this one!"
"eskerjim-960-6869","9","4","8","28 March 2014"," Stunning
","I just finished watching the new ""Captain America""; and, I have to say, I was stunned! <br/><br/>I mean, yes, I kind of thought I would like it a little bit. It is a Marvel Comics/Disney production, and they have been making some incredible special effects movies lately; but the previews in no way prepared me for what I was about to see. They said they were going to take the ""tough guy"" image up a notch, but I think it was more like three. If you are an action fan, you will enjoy this movie. I would describe it as kind of a ""Bruce Lee meets Iron Man"" movie. As a martial artist, I rarely see choreography that good (outside Lee, perhaps Steven Seagal or Matt Damon in the Bourne series). <br/><br/>It is very Hollywood after all, so some of it is way over the top; but, again I say, I was stunned! The amount of talent that God has given is simply awesome."
"goldencenturian","10","4","8","28 March 2014"," Action, explosions and conspiracy.
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>We have been on a very exciting journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe over the past 6 years and with phase 2 being over half way through, we are blessed with another film in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The end of Thor: The Dark World really left the door open for Guardians of the Galalxy (Phase 2) and Avengers 3 (Phase 3) with no real clues into Avengers: Age of Ultron, so this is the last film building up to the eagerly anticipated Avengers sequel.<br/><br/>Marvel really did it again. My expectations were stacked pretty high for this film after their track record, with Captain America The First Avenger being such an excellent film. I get mixed feelings from people when it comes to Captain America, some say they can't relate to him being ""too patriotic"" and others like me appreciate everything he brings to the Marvel universe. He really defines super hero being more than just a costume and a shield; Steve Rodgers has shown commitment and determination to benefit others and this is never forgotten throughout these films.<br/><br/>It was always going to be interesting to see how Steve adapts to the 21st century after being frozen for so long only getting a glimpse of that in the Avengers. This was one of the most intriguing aspects of the film as we visit his past memories on numerous occasions, allowing us to fill in the gaps. Chris Evans is a very convincing Steve Rodgers bringing a lot to the character keeping up his brave, intelligent soldier role and making it very consistent.<br/><br/>Each character had the chance to really develop in this film: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is a fine example of this, there is a lot more to her than meets the eye and this film really reveals more of her espionage ways. It would be great to see her in a solo movie revealing more of her past, but this may be on hold for now if it was ever in the pipeline. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) also really comes to life in this film, we have only met the tip of the ice burg with him so far and there's more to him than meets the eye(patch). The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) plays a very interesting role and was always going to do with his former life as Buck Barnes. The Marvel universe is forever expanding and the introduction of new characters just means more excellence. Samuel Wilson (The Falcon) (Anthony Mackie)was a very clever addition to the film, he had cap's back and brought something extra. I am all for expanding the Avengers roster and seeing the characters come to life in the MCU.<br/><br/>Secrecy plays a massive role in this film and all is unravelled, leaving a lot to be answered. There is so much to be expanded upon and there are plenty of moments for die hard fans to get excited about. Don't let your guard down if you want to absorb everything or just enjoy it and watching again, and again and again, because you will want to.<br/><br/>Full of action, explosions and conspiracy, this was an excellent film. Expectations are always high when it comes to Marvel films and they never fail to be blown out of the water, words don't really do this film justice. A MUST SEE!<br/><br/>P.s. Don't forget to watch the mid and end credit scenes!!!<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://wp.me/p3pevh-Lx"
"Al1899","10","4","8","27 March 2014"," Adventure. Conspiracy. Thriller. WONDERFUL!
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is simply BRILLIANT and exceptional in every way as it delivers the best, grittiest action I have seen so far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Marvel sure know how to deliver their films and please their audiences!!!!!!<br/><br/>I have been waiting for this film since July 2011 and I am happy to say that my money was well spent! Leaving university after 4 hours of revision, I reached the cinema at 12:45pm and I was blown from the start when I seen that Chris Evans was jogging in Washington DC past the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial - my two favourite tourist destinations - before being sped away by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson! The action scenes and the stunts made this film stand out from the previous films of MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) as they relied on CGI, but this film is a winner!<br/><br/>* I'm glad Marvel chose Chris Evans to lead the character of Captain America as he is doing a fantastic job bringing the character to life with his talent. <br/><br/>* Scarlett Johansson steals the movie as the stunning, yet deadly Black Widow. Along with her beauty, talent and training, she mesmerises the audience with her characters finesse and serious attitude. <br/><br/>* A shocking turn of events occurs when S.H.I.E.L.D is compromised by a past organization who threaten to complete their 70 year old ultimate sanction.<br/><br/>* 2 reunions and 1 is a complete shocker for The Captain!<br/><br/>* The speech by Captain America is truly a defining moment for him as it shows that he is ready to die for his country again and in my honest opinion, moments like that define what a true hero is meant to be. <br/><br/>The climax is excellent as it is almost on the same level as The Avengers climax BUT more emotional as his best friend rescues him after the Captain reminds him of a quote decades earlier. FANTASTIC!!!!<br/><br/>Seriously I recommend this movie 100%. My fellow students, this movie is really worth the £6.45 I paid to see. At 136 minutes there isn't a single moment where you feel bored. As for the ending of the movie...it makes you want more.<br/><br/>PS: Batman V Superman? Lol DC sure have their work cut out!!!!! They have got a lot of work to do if they are to replicate the success of Marvel!!!!<br/><br/>BRING IT!"
"moviexclusive","8","4","8","26 March 2014"," Rich in conspiracy and brimming with gripping action, this sequel takes the franchise - and the entire Marvel universe - in an exciting new direction
","Compared to his Marvel stablemates Tony Stark/ Iron Man and Thor, Captain America was always on the surface a duller superhero, devoid of the personality that drives our iron-clad man in a suit or the sibling rivalry that afflicts our hammer-wielding Norse god. Put it simply, Captain Steve Rogers was as straightforward a hero as you could get - there was little that was complicated about his retro red-white-and-blue patriotism, nor for that matter his stout-hearted courage and sweet sincere decency.<br/><br/>Joe Johnston's origin story 'Captain America: The First Avenger' played smartly to these traits, emphasising the uncomplicated heroism of our square-jawed strapping spandexed protagonist as he fought against a band of power-mad Nazis known as Hydra at the height of World War II. Contrast that to the modern-day setting of this sequel from returning writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and you'll see why it's an entirely different kind of film altogether. Yes, this is a film built on Captain America's anachronism, one that emphasises just how out of place his old fashioned virtues seem to be against the realities of this modern age.<br/><br/>It isn't quite the fact that Steve doesn't have much a social life yet, which is the reason why his fellow SHIELD operative Natasha Romanoff or Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is constantly suggesting cute girls they know whom he could ask out; it isn't even the pop-culture of Steve Jobs, Marvin Gaye and Star Wars/Trek that he needs to catch up on. Rather, Steve's real displacement lies in his beliefs and values about authority and control. Indeed, when he learns from SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) about the organisation's plans to develop a new fleet of massive helicarriers whose long-range weaponry can neutralize threats from way up in the atmosphere, he chillingly opines ""This isn't freedom. This is fear"".<br/><br/>If that fusion of mass surveillance and drone warfare seems to bear some form of real-world relevance, know that it is entirely deliberate. The past few Marvel movies have built SHIELD into an almighty organisation at the reins of a security council with no democratic oversight, tasked with the mission of protecting the peoples of the world against threats of a superhuman nature at all costs. And so, it is only befitting that the entire enterprise is now called into question, as Nick begins to suspect that there are much more sinister forces at work within SHIELD that may or may not have to do with his boss Alexander Pierce (played by none other than Hollywood legend Robert Redford).<br/><br/>Now Redford isn't the kind of actor who would readily take up such a role in a blockbuster franchise, so there must have been something which he saw in this that went beyond just another superhero action movie. As it turns out, he was right. Taking over the directorial reins from Johnston, co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo (best known for their work on TV's 'Community' and 'Arrested Development') pack their film with elements straight out of a 1970s conspiracy thriller, complete with Redford playing a familiar liberal crusader type that is slowly and surely turned entirely on its head.<br/><br/>To reveal anything more about the similarities between SHIELD and Hydra would be spoiling the satisfaction you'll get discovering their parallels, but suffice to say that it all points back to the Nazi organisation which Steve had thought was quashed by the end of the last movie. The relation between the two also explains the identity of his titular nemesis The Winter Soldier, whom Marvel fans will know is in fact the reincarnation of Steve's closest wartime buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and whose inevitable confrontations with Steve acquire some unexpected poignancy in the busy action-packed finale.<br/><br/>Lest it may seem that the geopolitical commentary has overshadowed the meat and potatoes of a Marvel product, we can reassure you that Joe and Anthony Russo can handle big-scale action sequences just as deftly. The opening mission in which Captain America leads an elite strike team to liberate a supposed SHIELD boat seized by pirates is stunning to say the least, as our hero turns out to be a lean mean fighting machine in addition to his superhuman strength, going at his opponents in never seen before bone-crunching goodness. A thrilling vehicular chase sequence involving Colonel Fury further confirms that the Russos' penchant for shooting action in hand-held for maximum gritty realism - and even though there is plenty of intrigue within the yarn, the action is pretty much relentless as well, with more than enough spectacle for good popcorn entertainment.<br/><br/>His third time in the role, Chris Evans proves to be more and more an absolute fit for the character. More so than before, Evans' disillusionment adds shades of complexity to what used to be simply a straight-up hero, notwithstanding the fact that his good looks and winning appeal are still more than enough to win over the female members of his audience. Johansson is an excellent foil to Evans, her sass and cynicism in nice complement to Evans' (perhaps naive) positivity. They make a great pair, and you'll quickly find yourself rooting for them to be a couple. In supporting parts, Anthony Mackie turns up now and then as a paratrooper veteran Steve turns to for assistance; but there is no doubt the scene-stealer here is Redford, who brings understated menace to a whole new level.<br/><br/>And so, instead of being content as a straightforward sequel, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' takes the franchise and even the entire Marvel universe in a wholly different direction. There is still good and bad, heroes and villains, but what is clearer here is that the best of intentions could manifest itself as quite something else altogether. Action, intrigue, humour and even as political commentary, this sequel packs it all and is quite simply one of the best Marvel films to date."
"OlieRendch","10","4","8","26 March 2014"," Wow, now that's a game-changer.
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier, film number 9 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a most relevant one at that. The directors, producers and writers all said it was the one that followed most closely to The Avengers and would go almost directly into Avengers: Age of Ultron and all-in-all a big game-changer; they weren't kidding. The movie is unlike the rest, it doesn't quite seem like a Marvel movie most of the way through but rather a really unique spy movie, which it is. The plot is extremely well done, I loved it from beginning to end, very good points that flowed the story and even some twists that pleasantly surprised me. The new characters they brought in were fantastic, the Falcon I especially enjoyed, his character was cool, comedic, and just an enjoyable person to watch; Robert Redford's political character was also on top form although the characters' traits and ambitions I have seen in other movies. Now talking of characters, the movie's subtitle the Winter Soldier was a fantastic, unique character who's life was deep and interesting to watch, the majority may know of his true identity already as Marvel haven't really done anything to cover it up as it is obvious from about 5 mins of casting research, but I felt the character wasn't used as much as I thought; his name is in the title but his story isn't the main arc, he was in less scenes than I expected. Another disappointer for me was that the climax seemed to have a lot more violence than previous ones, not as graphic as Thor: TDW, but certainly quite strong, almost distracting - although that may have been the cinema experience. In the end I thought Captain America: The Winter Soldier was one of the best of the MCU, and even Marvel movies in general."
"ohbaby150","Null","4","8","25 March 2014"," True Character Depth And Truly A Great Film!
","The first film was about giving Steve the opportunity to be the hero he was born to be. The Avengers gave him the chance to matter in the modern era. In this movie, we get true character depth and turmoil that we never saw in those first two installments. Both were great in their own way but this is the depth we needed to see now.<br/><br/>It was easier in the 1940's to judge right and wrong. Now, it's more difficult to gage how to combat the hidden evil that has taken root in the modern era. Threats are different now, and the debate on how to handle them seems ripped right out of today's headlines. How far to take precautionary measures? For a man who fought to serve with all his being, how much is too much? Steve is stoic and doesn't want to burden anyone with his struggles. It's exactly what a man from that era would do. Yet, that turmoil and moral self independence mixed with a ""never give up"" attitude is what makes the character so dynamic and interesting. He does struggle and he does connect with people and show vulnerability, which is tough for him to do. This does ground him and it certainly makes him more interesting.<br/><br/>All the characters used in this film work amazingly well. The ones we've seen before are fleshed out more. I love the Black Widow here, this is her best on screen stuff yet. Her morality is basically for sale and Steve's morality is set in stone. It's more than interesting what they find in each other. The new characters just shine. The Falcon is an absolute ace. Sam seeks out a friendship and then later that friendship proves to be invaluable. The bad guys are probably the best in any Marvel film to date. Let me say that again ANY Marvel film to date. One thing is for sure here, authority figures are not to be trusted and shades of gray permeate the plot's moral landscape.<br/><br/>I really loved the hard-edged, physical action. No wire-fu or even noticeable CGI. I know it was used in the fight scenes but you'd never know it. It exactly what this character should always be depicted doing. The action in Thor or Iron Man films is different because of the nature of their powers. Here, it's all brutal yet graceful and everything works tremendously well. Cap isn't just a guy who was given the ability of speed and enhanced strength. He's been training and his enhanced mind makes him just as dangerous as his muscles. His training and ability make him VERY dangerous and the movie shows that and then some. The fights in this movie are the most impactful that I've seen in years.<br/><br/>Overall, a great sequel that follows in the footsteps of things like Spider-Man 2 and X2 and that's a movie that's clearly better than an already good first entry."
"blufrog49","5","6","14","15 April 2014"," Thin Plot, Lots of Action
","About a third of the way through this movie (a bit confusing if you're new to the intersecting story lines), after THOUSANDS of rounds of ammo had been used by supposed expert marksmen, with little or no injuries, I began to wonder--is this part of the mindset of those people, mostly young ones, who wreak havoc on our schools, a shopping mall, a Jewish Community Center? I don't want to use this as a forum to be preachy, but I go to movies to be entertained and/or educated, and the amount of mayhem in this movie is disturbing, especially given such a thin plot. There are a few twists and more than one time I was jolted by a sudden visual effect, but after a while it becomes tiresome--ran about 30 minutes too long. Even the man sitting a few seats away from me, who was obviously delighted with the first few battles, apparently became weary of the incessant fight scenes.<br/><br/>I am SO surprised Robert Redford agreed to do this, and we all know that while Samuel L. Jackson is a fine actor, he will do just about anything for a buck. No one is going to get any acting nods for this. Keep that in mind if you go, and be prepared for a LOT of violence."
"noromgorom","10","2","3","29 April 2020"," Is this the best MCU movie? YES
","It's 2020. I'm rewatching MCU movies while in quarantine. Endgame came out last year. And it did everything we fans wanted. It's the highest grossing film right now. But even with all the fan services Endgame (& other MCU movies) gave us along with big cgi battles in 4 Avengers movies and all the colorful Guardians movies + Ragnarok, Winter Soldier still is the best thing MCU delivered us. Rather than being a fun, colorful hero vs villain fight Winter Soldier gives us something else. It's suspenseful, it's thrilling, it's badass. The action scenes are so well done especially that Cap vs Bucky (that knife flip is too good). Also the elevator scene, Cap's monologue, Falcon, Black Widow, the first action sequence everything is just perfect. My favorite thing about this movie is that it starts the journey of badass Steve Rogers (before we get started, does anyone wanna....) instead of just a guy on steroids talking about patriotism. Also the Winter Soldier is still the coolest villain (Taskmaster might change that).<br/><br/>I normally don't write reviews. Not even on MCU movies. But I need the world to know that this right here is the best MCU movie. Even after the biggies like Infinity War & Endgame (I love those movies btw) this simple political thriller stands at the no. 1 posting of MCU. Russo Brothers didn't only delivered their first MCU film they also delivered their best MCU film."

"nhatnguyen-21160","9","2","3","12 December 2019"," An Amazing Film That Cements Itself In This Crazy Universe
","This film might be my top three films that Marvel has ever produced, even after Endgame. I might even go as far and say that it's my number one favorite movie from Marvel. Some people might call me crazy, naming Winter Soldier my number one film when Infinity War and Endgame exists, but let me explain why this film might be my favorite film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>This film calls back to The First Avenger. A movie set in the 1940's in which we see Steve Rogers become Captain America for the first time. With many references to the First Avenger's love interest, his enemies, and friend-turned-foe, we continue to see Steve Rogers re-evaluating what he thought he once knew. From the 1940's to 2010's, Steve Rogers is truly ""a man out of time"". This modern age of espionage that he is living in gives up privacy and a right to a fair judgement in turn for complete safety throughout the nation. Despite finding out that S.H.I.E.L.D. has the ability to eliminate anyone they see as a threat before they can actual become a threat, as the righteous man he is, he stays true to his core belief, because the way he sees it, ""that's not freedom, it's fear."" We see his internal struggle with his morality and what the modern age of espionage has become and is simply trying to find his place in a world that was once so much simpler than now.<br/><br/>Things get even more complicated when a person from his past returns in the present. Surprised by this turn of events, he can't help but wonder if he could've done anything to prevent things from turning out the way they did. He blames himself for the creation of the Winter Soldier, but blames himself even more that he can't seem to pull the Winter Soldier from the brink of darkness. It creates an interesting dilemma that ponders the question, ""What happens if you put someone who won't give up fighting for his friend against someone who won't stop until he finishes his mission?""<br/><br/>The spy genre really works well with the Captain America series. It's interesting take on a Marvel character who normally goes up against global threats in a red, white and blue costume. By putting him in this espionage setting, with a darker uniform, and obstacles that have him reaffirm his morals, and opting out of the big CGI spectacular of villains, it makes the film a lot more grounded and real. It poses questions that are relevant in today's society about government interference in the nation's freedom.<br/><br/>The choreography in this film is just truly spectacular. The stunts, the fights, the shots. They all are visually appealing. Not only that, but because of the groundedness of the film, it allows us to appreciate the more intricate parts of the fights. Every time Captain America and Winter Soldier go toe-to-toe, you can't not be amazed at how well done the fight scenes are.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier takes a character from the past who generally is a hopeful and morally righteous person and places him in darker, modern day society, working for an agency which has him question his beliefs. This spy genre is certainly something that isn't new, but this film does a great job in combining the spy genre with the superhero genre. And what is created is something that will leave you in awe the first time you see it, and in disbelief the subsequent times you see it, because how can a movie be THIS good?"
"coasterdude44","8","2","3","11 December 2019"," Best of the Captain America MCU Trilogy, A thrilling action blockbuster
","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It's one of the finest superhero movies ever made, it really made me feel satisfied and really blew me away on just how sharply shot the action was in this movie. It's at this point in time where the action directing in the MCU franchise really started to rise up dramatically and the action scenes in this movie are shot with clarity and prescision. The Winter Soldier is a great villan and really was the best villan in the MCU at that point. His design is slick and very modern looking and looks intimidating aswell which is exactly what you want from a superhero villan.<br/><br/>Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers is also great in the movie as his character has grown stronger and is now living comfortably in 2010s America. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is back aswell and is awesome as always. The story has upped it's game and has become more emotional with some truly heart wrenching scenes aswell as some really good tension aswell when the characters clash against one another<br/><br/>Overall a crisp, thrilling and just plain fun MCU movie with the best shot action at the time for a Marvel movie. It was my favourite Action movie of 2014 and my personal favourite in the Captain America MCU trilogy"
"davidmvining","8","2","3","25 November 2019"," The best MCU movie
","The first twenty minutes or so of this movie establish so much so well, it feels like the Marvel franchise has finally grown up.<br/><br/>The opening scene takes place around the Mall in Washington D.C. as Captain Rogers takes in his morning run, lapping a young ex-soldier several times. When the two finally speak, there's a grounded sense of community between the two stemming from their dual tours of duty in wars separated by decades. It's the physical detail that Sam brings up about the over-softness of mattresses contrasted against the reality of their sleeping arrangements in the theaters of war that sells it so well. Rogers and Sam have this immediate connection because of that shared experience that makes Rogers showing up to a group therapy session for veterans instantly believable. He's not showing up because he's Captain America and it's what Captain America would do. He's showing up because he's got his own scars and wonders if spending time with others who have similar experiences could help.<br/><br/>That's the kind of grounded reality that storytelling should reach for. It's not about being grounded in a recognizable physical reality but in a recognizable emotional and human reality. The movie around that emotional core is still ridiculous with a super soldier created by a magic blue serum, another soldier with a metal arm that's been repeatedly frozen over the decades, flying aircraft carriers, and a suit with jets and wings, but because it pays attention to the human element so well that crazy stuff gains a more entertaining dimension because it's at service to an actual story dealing with characters that feel real.<br/><br/>What's most interesting about the film's construction is that it uses the human element so well in a paranoid thriller context. The presence of Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce is no accident. His presence calls to mind Three Days of the Condor and All the President's Men.<br/><br/>Captain America is sent on a mission into the middle of the ocean to rescue some SHIELD operative on a boat that's been taken over by French-Algerian pirates. Cap succeeds, of course, and his partner Natasha (Black Widow) is there with a secondary purpose, to steal information from the ship. Rogers rankles at this undermining of his authority over the mission and confronts SHIELD director Nick Fury about it. Fury insists that secrets are necessary in order for him to effectively lead the organization and that Rogers is going to have to get used to compartmentalization in the modern world. After Fury brings some concerns to Pierce, a member of SHIELD's governing body the Council, Fury gets attacked on the streets of D.C. He escapes to Rogers' apartment, gets shot through a wall, and Rogers gives chase to the assailant, The Winter Soldier, who is actually Bucky Barnes, Rogers' best friend from childhood who had been brainwashed into being a killing machine.<br/><br/>Rogers and Natasha begin to suspect that SHIELD has been compromised and after a couple of instances of SHIELD proving that beyond a reasonable doubt, the two go on the run. They essentially go back in time in finding the original bunker that SHIELD operated out of, inhabited by the computerized brain of Dr. Zola, the Swiss scientist who had helped Hydra in the first Captain America movie. Hydra, he reveals, had infiltrated SHIELD decades before, sowing chaos around the world and taking control of the organization as a whole.<br/><br/>This is one of the only times Marvel dealt with geopolitical issues in any meaningful way. The idea that an intelligence apparatus that nominally represents the will of the people is actually deeply rooted in its own version of state interests feels almost ripped from the headlines. The idea of outsourcing killing decisions to a program and using drones feels just the same. And yet, the movie never gets bogged down with it. It takes a side against these things and plows forward, understanding that it is more action movie than political treatise. What this does is create an interesting canvas on which to tell this story, lending credence to the emotions that Rogers is going through as he sees an organization that had earned his trust fall before his eyes.<br/><br/>Of course, Rogers decides to fight it out, and he recruits Sam, the Falcon, as well as Natasha. We get a great extended action sequence across three helicarriers as they rise against a ticking clock that the heroes are fighting to beat. It really comes to a head on the third ship when the Winter Soldier and Captain America face off. These aren't just two people on the opposite sides of good and bad at the dictates of a screenwriter, these are people with pasts and ideals that throw them in conflict. But, instead of wanting to see Rogers simply win against Bucky, Rogers needs to save Bucky from the fate he's found himself in. It's a non-traditional way to end a large action sequence, and it works really well because of the emotional work done early. It all fits as well because of the thematic underpinnings. Rogers is haunted by his past and worried about his future. Bucky is a physical manifestation of that worry and concern. He was the friend he lost in battle, but he also represents a more hopeful future if Rogers can reach him.<br/><br/>Action scenes overall range from being filmed too close to coherent within that shaky-cam box. They're edited really well, but I just wish the Russo's has pulled the camera back a bit more and kept it a bit more still from time to time. There's a visual thing that feeds into everything as well. Captain America begins the movie in blue suit (as he's doing SHIELD's dirty work without realizing it), but when he decides to fight SHIELD in order to reclaim his own ideals, he grabs the World War II era suit in the Smithsonian, fighting his final battle in the good ole red, white, and blue.<br/><br/>It's intelligently assembled, emotionally assured, and overall a very good time at the movies."

","As I'm not from US and have never read a comic book unless you count TIN-TIN, I didn't grow up with the DC\MCU characters.Though i've watched superhero movies only spider-man interested me.So I went to the theater to watch captain America winter soldier with almost a clean-slate where Captain America is concerned. I actually only watched the first movie few days before watching the second when i heard it was coming to the theaters. The movie surprised me so much it made the top three of my favorite action movies of all time within the first half hour. I was so impressed with Russo brothers work. The movie was a skillfully molded masterpiece from the first second to the last credit scene. The scene where Bucky looking at his information in Smithsonian gave me the chills. Sebastian Stan's character in the first movie had the same importance and the influence in developing Steve Rogers character as Peter Parker's uncle. He is the one who influenced and drove him to push his limits and use his new found powers for good. And Bucky's untimely death gave him the ultimatum in his fight against HYDRA, go big or go home. <br/><br/>And finding that his lifelong friend had survived and put under so much pain and torture and forced to do unspeakable things. As well as learning the war between good and bad is not as black and white as it used to be during world war 11 makes him question his loyalties. Who in this gray-scale world can be called good or bad? Is SHIELD any different from HYDRA if they are the two sides of the same coin? Something else i like about this particular movie is that the mostly focused relationship is the brotherly bond between Steve and Bucky not the overused love story of superhero and his love interest. The way Steve's words managed to go through decades of brainwashing and memory deleting? was heartbreaking. And it's not like Bucky suddenly remembers everything and fight the bad guys with Steve but that simple line manages to make a crack in the shield. Enough to make Bucky question his life and his handlers. All in all the best superhero movie I've watched in a long long while."

In the second half, the visual effect of a large movie was produced to climax before the original was restored."

","The start of the Russo Era. This movie is highly ranked among MCU fans(mostly No.1), yes I do agree it is the best made MCU film, its just isn't my favourite.<br/><br/>The action is spectacular, the hand to hand combat between Steve and Bucky was top notch choreography. They kept wide shots and less cuts, and in day light, we can clearly see all their moves. Action wise, this is the best in MCU but personally I don't weight action as much as I wait other factors.<br/><br/>The story is also great, nazi-hyder still lying around in Shield was a great twist. Hyder never leaves Captain America. The Bucky twist also feels natural, brings a relationship element with the main villain. The flashbacks and past film does the job to set it up.<br/><br/>Russo's got Natasha so right, she shined throughout the film, her action sequence were the most bad-ass female fight I have ever seen (right below Kill-Bill). She actually felt like a former deadly assassin of KGB, Scarlet Johansson played her well.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson completely solds Nick Fury, his car sequence was great. His with his classic wits are spinkled all over the film. But his return from death was a let down. I hate when characters come back from death.
His lines 'Last Time I trusted someone, I lost an eye' , ' You need to keep both eyes open' were fantastic but sadly Captain Marvel happened.<br/><br/>Addition of Sam Wilson was great, he brings the more organic feel to the film. His running gag of 'On your left' got better with Endgame. He isn't a perfect soldier but a good man, deserves the Captain America Mantle.<br/><br/>Chris Evans sells as the patriot Steve Rogers, his characters arc progresses and we see him getting more further away from patriotism, doubting the government and agency (Shield/Hyder). ' This isn't freedom', and his speech at the end in Shield Headquarters was inspiring.<br/><br/>I will never forget the lift scene, the comedy is more subtle and feels more mature. The movie could be called a political thriller. But this also has a very cliché ( most clichést thing in my book), saving brainwashed friend by reminding him of past greatness. The final action sequence was good but getting chips into ships to disarm them, felt cheap in relation to other great bits. Hyder killing all people just like any other villain would, isn't something new, the movie spent good quality time to connect the villain's tyreny to heros' in humane level but failed to connect why Hyder will go this big now. The movie's third act could have stayed more grounded just like the rest to the film.<br/><br/>I highly respect the script and direction of the film, I just haven't seen it 50 times to love this film as much as I love the other once."

","This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well...<br/><br/>What I love about the character is that Steve Rogers has ""I'm-a-man-out- of-time issues"" but he's comfortable with the chaos that it brings. In acclimating himself to this century he is at his best. Yes, most people would be overwhelmed but because of who he is and where he's from, he's able to cope and adapt. The serum that gives him his physical edge also gives him a mental boost. It's his emotions that are raw and unaided. Time has passed since Avengers so we don't get to see his day to day amazement and adjustment. I'm glad they skipped that stuff. What we do see is the man who once represented America and has become alien to America and it's slanted values. The passage of time. Add those struggles to a full blown conspiracy film and what results might just be the best film released all year long.<br/><br/>Steve Rogers is basically a John Wayne American. The world shifts to him and it's his job to tell everybody ""Here's they way things should be done."" We saw that in Avengers and even the first film after he gathered his Howling Commandos. Now, the powers that be are a lot more flexible in terms of loyalties and how they're going to get certain jobs done. How he handles this century's gray morality is at the heart of the film.<br/><br/>Like most men from the 1940's, Steve keeps things to himself and keeps his emotions bottled up. (EX: the first film when he mentions his mother dying of TB and he was even embarrassed when Peggy found him mourning alone for Bucky) So, bringing The Black Widow in to this film gives him someone who is going to draw out his story, because he's never going to offer it up of his own accord. Natasha learns from him. Fury learns from him. Sam Wilson learns from him. Yet, they all give him something in return. Every character used is utilized perfectly and smartly. Falcon for example, is not in awe of the legend of Captain America. This is exactly what Steve wants in a friend and in a fellow soldier, to not have to be Captain America. Everyone fits perfectly in to the plot and allows access to different beats, tones and emotional depth. Yes, conspiracy thrillers need depth and this one has it.<br/><br/>Captain America is probably the only superhero left in this world of the reboot who is singularly heroic. He doesn't have this dark existential quandary like other reinventions. Plugging that resolute goodness into a morally complex story means he doesn't question what he believes, but he questions whether anybody else does anymore. He doesn't question his foundation but he questions where he has ended up and what his role must now be. The conspiracy element and structure of this story helps in that Captain America is not up on a pedestal being self righteous, he's in a corner and that makes you want to root for the guy. He believes in what he's doing and the viewer is along for a great ride sharing that belief.<br/><br/>Marvel movies usually establish character early. This one starts out fast but it's got a lot of character in it. The first act packs a punch but does it laying the groundwork for a remarkable third act. They take time showing the issues and you immediately empathize with Steve. Giving us good character depth means the action delivers more punch. And the action here is beyond great. This movie absolutely punches you in the face in the best way possible. The action has advanced a lot from the first film. How he now operates in the world and kicks butt is all very impressive.<br/><br/>So, this is probably Marvel's grittiest movie and it's also their best sequel to date. There's a dash of humor but there's mostly a wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film."

It appears that HYDRA has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D and are hatching a plan that will end up killing millions. It's up to Captain America (Chris Evans) and some other to prevent this, however, they have to get through The Winter Soldier first.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
The Russo's are here! It's actually crazy how much of a step forward this film is from every film is before it. The technical aspects of this film are spot on. The choreography of this film was so far ahead and above any of the MCU films before it. The directing style is on another level and I don't know how the Russo's do it. They take a relatively mediocre plot and a not very interesting character like ""The Winter Soldier"" and make it one of the most interesting films and one of the most badass villains in the entire MCU. You feel every punch and kick. Finally, a normal human goes flying when being kicked in the chest by a superhuman Chris Evans. Then you have the plot twist when you find out who The Winter Soldier is and that entire aspect was very interesting and a ""holy s***"" moment. This film literally has Robert Redford! Like, come on! One issue I had with the film was at the end when someone doesn't die that should very clearly been dead. Like there's no way any regular human ever lives from it. I won't go further in the small chance someone who hasn't seen the film is reading this. In conclusion, this is one of the best films in the entire MCU and I can't wait to see it again. 8.9/10."

","The first time I watched this movie I didn't pay attention to all the amazing things it has, but I decided to watch again, and I have realized that it is the best movie of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is the ninth film produced by Marvel studios and it was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. It is a direct sequel of Captain America: The first avenger, so we follow the adventure of Captain America/Steve Rogers(Chris Evans) Black widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) and Falcon/ Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) against an occulted enemy, a corporation named Hydra which is hidden inside the most powerful government agency: SHIELD. Hydra controls the best friend of Steve rogers, Bucky Barnes called as the Winter soldier (Sebastian stand), so Captain America wants to save him. Other important characters are Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the main enemy, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford).
This Movie has an excellent storytelling, you always are excited about what could happen. It is not only a Superheroes movie, it has many characteristics of spy movies, It has a real breath-taking plot which affects all the MCU; And also is a critic of American way of life, what if the government could know (or believe) what crimes will happen before they actually happen? Is it right to punish the people who haven't done anything bad...yet? The Captain America don't think so, there's a moral dilemma. That's why this movie goes much far that any Marvel's movies.
The effects are spectacular, the movie has the perfect mix between practical effects and CGI, so every scene looks amazing, specifically the melee fights and the helicarriers destruction. The music is not the best, but it is okay, it gives tension and emotion when the movie needs. Another point I think is cool is that there aren't too much jokes as almost all Marvel's movies.
It is amazing, but not everything is good, there are many things that have no sense, for example, how Nick Fury could scape from the Winter soldier when his car crashed? It was a big coincidence that there was an sever just where the car stopped . And there are things about this movie that other Marvel's movies don't take care about , for example how Fury lost his eye, in Captain Marvel a cat scratched him in his eye... but in the winter soldier Nick Says "" The last time I trusted I lost an eye"" It was so stupid! Another at the end of the movie, Nick burned his patch but in avengers: Age of Ultron he has it again. It is so sad that not everything has connection between movies.
So, it is amazing, everyone who likes action, suspense, and thought-provoking movies should watch Captain America: The winter Soldier."
"cruise01","9","1","1","6 May 2020"," Awesome.
","(4.5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Great action. Love the second movie. It does have a political thriller feel with the movie which had an uneven pacing. The cast is great. The action sequences are awesome. The winter soldier was an awesome villain. This movie was an improvement over the last."
"kuangzao","8","1","1","28 April 2020"," Easily one of the best entries in the Marvel cinematic universe
","Easily one of the best entries in the Marvel cinematic universe, The Winter Soldier is as much of a top-notch action thriller as it is a superhero blockbuster. It has a compelling premise, engaging story, and exciting action set pieces. If there are any real complaints, it's with the climax, where the action begins to go a little too over-the-top.
However, even at its most bombastic, the Russo's always manage to keep the action in service to the story."
"benjaminpiche","8","1","1","23 April 2020"," An Action-Packed MCU Thriller
","What's not to like about this movie? It tells a very personal story for Steve Rogers, one that explains where he stands later on in the Civil War. It is much more grounded than the first one, which is also a nice change of pace after watching some of the previous movies in the MCU. I love when the series goes in that direction, which is why this one is right up there with Iron Man in my current ranking.<br/><br/>I still have to rank this one slightly below the MCU's first film, simply because I just have more fun when watching Tony Stark's origin story. However, it's my third favorite so far, and I am pretty sure that it will end up in my top ten."

"jaovitu","10","1","1","5 April 2020"," Action, social-political critique and Marvel Comics' screenplay: the consolidation
","The sequence of Captain America delivers a great mix of entertainment, social-political critique and action. It is enriched with a elaborated plot, great characters construction and development, and an impeccable cinematography.
The high point of the movies it i its plot. I guess the adaptation of the Marvel Comics of Simon and Kirby gave Markus and McFeely an logical, consistent, coherent and visionary base for the screenplay. Furthermore, the could develop a solid critique about national security, confidence, loyalty and ideology. All of this with a frenetic action rhythm that evolves with the main plot, a spicy taste of entertainment in the movie.
The characters are well constructed based on the screenplay and also thanks to the awesome acting. None of the actors stood out, because they all made a amazing set.
The Russo Brother got a perfect action and well-adapted screenplay and used all of their experience to create a cinematographic environment that could consolidated the Marvel Universe, action, entertainment and critique, without loosing rhythm and missing spots."
"tashlast","10","1","1","4 April 2020"," Still one of the best MCU movies to date.
","Honestly. Where to begin? Look, I adore Tony Stark. A personal favorite character in the entirety of all MCU, but I gotta say, Captain America always busted out the best titular solo films in MCU and this movie is proof of why Captain America has the best movies.<br/><br/>Just everything. EVERYTHING about this movie was just so amazing. Couldn't live with watching it only once, so I went back to watch it 4 more times and it was still great. You got direct reccuring conflict from the first Captain America movie. Bringing back old foes and having them conspiring underneath the good guys noses and exposing S.H.I.E.L.D for its own corruption by its own commanding Nick Fury. Just to show you even the 'good guys' get their hands dirty too for selfish reasons when they feel they have to.<br/><br/>You get a building companionship between two of the core Avengers that DID NOT end in a romance. Which was surprising to me that this movie didn't just go for the classic guy and girl work together and eventually fall in love trope that Hollywood uses so often. And the best part was that Johansson and Evans lovingly sold the chemistry, and it almost lead me to believe that they're characters would begin a relationship. And despite everything those characters went through together, the bond between them stayed professional and comforting in the end. How very well played Marvel. Very mature.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes is still one of the most intimidating and most formidable villains in the MCU of all time. He still beats Thanos. Every time he showed up on or before he showed up, you could always feel a lingering sensation of eerie dread for what's about to come next. It's thrilling and terrifying. The Winter Soldier is the epitome of 'Silent but deadly.' Sebastian Stan was just outstanding as the Winter Soldier. Easily one of the strongest performances in the film. He nailed that deadly assassin with no remorse or second thoughts and also nailed the confused and lost feeling of not knowing where to find the true Bucky he was. Sebastian had to play two completely different sides to one character and nearly made me cry in his final moments with Cap. Also, not only was The Winter Soldier a great character, but it was smart that they reintroduced this semi-minor sidekick friend character from the first Captain America movie who we all thought was dead, dug him out of his 'grave' and turned him into a shadowy deadly villain who struggles to break from the mind control that's forcing him to become a soldier of death. The strongest aspect of the film.<br/><br/>Also loved how this movie gace screen time to Natasha and Nick Fury to really show off their skills in espionage more so than the other movies they were featured in. It did right by both of the characters by giving some levity to them and established them way more. Especially Natasha because we are only told of her skills and shown that she's capable of weaponry, but we didn't really see a lot of her espionage to use. We got a bit of it in Iron Man 2, but this movie highlighted her for who she is. Also, even though we know what kind of a character Nick Fury is, it showed us how capable, strong and manipulative he really is. I just loved seeing him during the Car scene assassination attempt on his life. Samuel L Jackson always knows how to give a performance.<br/><br/>I'll just say it again, EVERYONE gave a delightful performance. Evans, Johansson, Jackson, Stan, Mackie, Redford, and everyone else brought their A-Game. Great acting, realistic conversations, and epic lines that are just so fitting to the characters they portray. The emotional sentiment in some scenes was just right on the money.<br/><br/>Ok now. Now, we're talking fight choreography. My heart could give out, but whoever choreographed those fight scenes needs more than just an Oscar. I cannot reiterate how and why the fight choreography in this movie is the best in all MCU. Maybe Civil War comes close, but this movie has some of the most bone-chilling fights I've ever seen in any action film. Just...that highway fight between Cap and The Winter Soldier terrified me with glee if you can understand. Some of the most intricate fight I've seen. The way the shield and knife were handled was just above and beyond. As much as I adore the elevator fight in this movie, the highway was better.<br/><br/>Music was chilling and emotional too. Nothing more can be said. I just love how the composer was so dark on incorporating Bucky's scream from when he 'died' in The First Avenger and mechanalized it into the theme for the Winter Soldier. How eerie and devastating. Just love it.<br/><br/>Gosh, what a movie. Best MCU movie ever. Even after Endgame and Infinity War, still the best movie ever. The only movie that could possibly beat this would have to be Civil War. That being said, as far as a spy-action thriller, it was just right about everything. Still incorporating that nice humor for a darker toned movie like all Marvel does. The best understanding of these characters since Iron Man and The Avengers.<br/><br/>Just brilliant.<br/><br/>10.3/10"

A really well presented superhero blockbuster in the modern world with a real stoic protagonist from the treacherous World War II eras.

In this movie he speaks softly and carries a big stick. Chris Evans (easily Marvel's best characterisation) plays a wholesome, troubled heartthrob of a superhero. He's a very watchable actor, making this film look easy.<br/><br/>Yes, it does suffer from some overstuffed and CGI reliant third act claptrap, but even though I could see the twists a mile off, my girlfriend didn't, reminding me that these movies aren't just for comic aficionados.<br/><br/>Being a child of so many world, it's a miracle that Winter Soldier comes out as successful and revitalising as it does.

"bankofmarquis","9","1","1","5 May 2018"," The ""culmination"" of the last 10 years works very well.
","AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR is the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Said to be the culmination of 10 years worth of Marvel films - and Marvel heroes - INFINITY WAR lives up to it's bill, bringing all the Marvel Universe heroes together to fight a ""big bad"" that is worthy of this sort of thing - THANOS. <br/><br/>Voiced by Josh Brolin, the CGI Thanos is powerful, destructive, razor-focused on his one purpose with moments of ""humanity"" that makes him an interesting villain. The filmmakers kept his motivation and machinations simple so you are never confused by this bad guy or what he is trying to do. What surprised me is that the filmmakers added another layer to this character that was a nice layer that really added to the character, his motivations and his personality.<br/><br/>As for the band of heroes brought together for this film, it works well. The criticisms I have heard is that no ONE hero stands out, so EVERY hero is in the background. I couldn't disagree more. I thought the evenness of the ""screen time"" was one of the strengths of this film, not focusing too much on one hero (or heroes), giving all time to shine - and focus on what they do best. There were moments of humor, drama, action and heroism sprinkled across all. But what really thrilled me was the different combinations that were put together, for these heroes all had different missions and assignments and some odd and interesting cross-film dynamics took shape. I won't give any of these away, but I thought they ALL dynamics blended together nicely.<br/><br/>This is definitely a ""fan-boy"" film, giving service to fans of all these films, characters - and comics and credit for that should go to filmmakers Anthony and Joe Russo (Directors of the previously best film in this series - CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) who kept the action moving, the motivations of the participants simple and the effects dazzling.<br/><br/>One final note - this is the first part of a two part film, so it does end in a cliffhanger, one that works effectively well. As always with the Marvel films - but especially in this one - stay through to the end of the credits, the scene at the end of the credits sets up Part 2.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this film and can't wait to see the next one.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"hakrames","9","1","1","26 March 2018"," A sequel that ups its predecessor in every way
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the sequel to the first Captain America Movie and follows the events of The Avengers with expanding on the corporate SHIELD and the secrets they've been hiding in it for decades. And this movie is a huge improvement on the first film. The story is one of the freshest stories have come up with to date with its gritty fight sequences and twists no one can expect at all in this film, all thanks to the Russo Brothers. <br/><br/>With the strong direction by the Russo brothers this film gets a face lift from the first and brings the film to a modern age that it needed. Getting away from the '40's and showing a more modern Cap that's still trying to adjust to the new world he has missed since being frozen adds a lot of funny sequences and great one lines that are executed perfectly in this film. My favorite part of this film though is the fights, each scene for them feels brand new and not one feels like a copycat or a recreation of the first movie or anywhere else. And that's one of the best things with this film is the originality that the Russo brothers put into this film. And now with them directing Civil War and Infinity War. They have made a mark in Marvel as being one of the best directors yet. <br/><br/>The writing done by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely did a fantastic job on this script. The dialogue feels so real and fits each and every cast member perfectly with its fast jokes and memorable lines throughout. Even the minor characters that we've gotten sneak peaks at in The Avengers have made memorable parts in this film playing key points in the overall story telling. Even Chris Evan and Scarlett Johansson writing the dialogue for the scenes between them feels so natural and adds a huge comedy piece as they try to get Steve a date with anyone in his life. <br/><br/>The acting is once again amazing by its key cast (Evans, Johansson, Jackson) with the new faces as well killing each and every role. Especially the broken and confused Bucky/Winter Soldier played by Stan and the quick witted and perfect partner to Steve, Sam Wilson played by Anthony Mackie. And of course my favorite new performance in the film is done by the legendary Robert Redford with his offputting look and twisting dialogue that's shown throughout. <br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a fantastic film with a single plot hole that, yes, was explained in a deleted scene but never put into the final product is why did he go and get his old suit when he had a modern day battle ready one that was perfectly fine? <br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier gets a 9.5/10"

He may be pretty old but he just oozes class. Marvel always seem to go for high calibre actors. No exception here.<br/><br/>The plot of course concerns Cap investigating a conspiracy within SHIELD, abetted by Black Widow with a first appearance from The Falcon. They made a great team - a sort of mini-Avengers.<br/><br/>Sam Jackson gets a bit more to do - hurrah - and if you missed the quote on the tombstone, have another look. Fantastic little in-joke. Seb Stan is great as the tormented Soldier, putting the lie to the claim that Marvel villains are all generic.<br/><br/>Cap's fight in the elevator is superb - as are all the fight scenes, and if one or two plot points are a bit far fetched I can forgive that easily. Doc Zola's algorithm which predicts future threats to HYDRA so they can be assassinated is a case in point.<br/><br/>Great CBM, then. Civil War is almost as good."

","Just rewatched Winter Soldier for the fifth or sixth time, and I still can't think of any other one of the MCU movies that works so well (at least for me), not only as a superhero movie, but as a film in general. Apart from the amazing action and great fight scenes, there's a lot of emphasis on character, personal drama and it's got just enough humour. The villains (Robert Redford's character and the Winter Soldier) are also very well written and fleshed out, and the CGI is pretty good too. The stunt work is outstanding! This is a comic book movie that not only entertains you with its cool- looking characters and spectacular action scenes, but makes you feel for the heroes (Cap, Natasha, Fury, Falcon, etc.), and keeps you on the edge of your street with the tension and the twists and turns of the story."
"Movies3149","Null","1","1","22 August 2014"," Waste of Resources
","They should concentrate on Iron Man or the Avengers. Special effects are OK. There is action, whereas one would have thought that the one top Hydra soldier (Brock Rumlow) would find his end by the hands of the Falcon aka Sam Wilson but no, he just disappears in the falling building when one of the Heli-carriers crashes into it. Shame. But there was some glimmer of hope although a very short one when Stan Lee entered the stage and realized that 'Captain Americas' uniform was gone (museum exhibit). For me the best scene in the movie. So have a look at 1:33:51 in the movie. At least this time he had a short but popper scene. Otherwise everything was done very well but that money could have easily been spread between the other bigger parts of the franchise."
"agmoldham","5","5","12","20 April 2014"," Too much action?
","There is a lot to like about captain America. Unlike most of the other superheroes Captain America seems very beatable. His superpower shield isn't in the same league as some of the other marvel superpowers. This makes it a lot easier to relate to CA.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier starts with fears that SHIELD has been infiltrated by unknown enemies. Captain America must act alone and cannot trust anyone which obviously leads to troubles. The film is very well acted with Scarlett Johansson being particularly good. The plot is OK and there's only one real gripe I've got with the film. During the action sequences it is very difficult to keep up with who's who. There are a lot of action sequences as well. Think I would have liked the film more if a few of the action sequences were cut and the film had a running time 30 minutes shorter. I'm quite sure that people who like Marvel superheroes/action films will love this though."

People who can be beaten to a pulp and walk away like they have been for tea with their mum, yes loads of that. Lack of any sort of comprehensible plot, yep loads of that too. I wasn't expecting much as the day of any sort of reality in these films went out of the window with Iron Man 2. But really? Can't the American dream factory come up with anything better? If you think that this level of violence is not having an effect on kids you should step outside and see what it is doing to kids younger than 10 who I have seen stamp on their fellow children and think its funny.

","While working for them, Steve starts to think that SHIELD is not what they say they are. So, the captain America movie, I can definitely say, its better than the avengers age of ulton movie. But not as good as the first one. Yet it holds that charm that made the first one a hit. Yes, we are now in the 21st century and not back in the Second World War, but still, the action scenes are good, Luke Evans really pulls it of, as do Scarlett Johansson and Sebastian Stan. The SHIELD gone rogue stuff were a little confusing for me, and the whole Nick Fury story was a little offsetting, as you want to watch a movie for Captain America concentrating on him and not his boss. But Fury only takes on the first part of the film and the second part is the best anyway, with the action scenes, the revelation, the master plan and everything. So 5 out of 10 for the second Captain America."

","After the bitterly disappointing mashed-potato-like-dross that was Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, I felt compelled to come on here and write a fantastic review - just to remove the rancid taste of disappointment from my mouth. <br/><br/>I watched Captain America 2 ages ago - but forgot to leave a review.<br/><br/>Thankfully, The Winter Soldier is EVERYTHING The Age of Ultron is NOT! Fantastic script. Great character development. Just the right equilibrium between drama and humour. And beautifully set action pieces. <br/><br/>Sam Jackson was fantastic in the stunning opening sequence. The legendary Robert Redford was utterly superb but let's face it: He's never let a viewer down yet. Chris Evans - dependable as always - carried the film on his broad shoulders effortlessly (and that perfectly conveys just how much work MUST have gone in to the film to make it all look so seamless and organic); the secondary villain was threatening yet 3 dimensional in that you felt sympathy towards him; and Anthony Mackie as The Falcon rocked it! Again, his action set-pieces were well thought out and utterly exhilarating in their execution. <br/><br/>In summary: One of the BEST Marvel films ever. <br/><br/>In a word: FANTASTIC!"

","After watching Captain America: The First Avenger, I wasn't sure where Marvel would take the character after that, well, sure enough, I sat down to watch Captain America: The Winter Solider and it didn't let me down one bit. Everything in this movie from the action to the characters to the story is so much better than the first one and rarely does that happen in a sequel.<br/><br/>After the event of the Avengers, Steve Rogers has been living in Washington D.C., working for S.H.I.E.L.D. While on a counter-terrorism strike mission, Rogers sees Natasha Romanoff obtaining information from the ship's computers for director Nick Fury. Steve meets with Fury and is told about S.H.I.E.L.D's new project: three Helicarriers that are networked to satellites and are designed to destroy any threat to S.H.I.E.L.D. Turns out all is not what it seems at S.H.I.E.L.D and it's up to Captain America and Black Widow to fix things. Along the way, Rogers must face an old friend turned foe from the past.<br/><br/>While Joe Johnson did a fantastic job directing the first Captain America, Anthony and Joe Russo do a much better job on this movie and while the movie might not be the complex movie ever made, it expends on the characters and gives them more depth especially with Steve Rogers where in the first one and in the Avengers, he is a John Wayne-type American telling people how things are done, while here he's in a ethical gray area and how he deals with it is the heart of the story. Working this development into a honorably complex movie means that Rogers never inquires what he believes nor does he challenge his basis, but he does challenge where he is and what his role must be. While the movie might out be the most innovative movie ever made, it certainly ups the ante with a darker tone which hearkens back to many 70s political thrillers and it's a very welcoming change that makes this movie stand apart from other superhero movies. There are several powerful scenes concerning paranoia, government control and information handling, echoing how our world has changed following 9/11 and yet it never feels overstuffed or intimidating.<br/><br/>The action is incredible and is a step up from some of the other MCU films, from Cap's shield being used in all its splendor to the cinematography which is diverse and quick without having to resort to quick cuts and shaky cam while the phenomenal elevator fight are just some of the exceptional action set pieces and the action scenes with the Winter Solider always feel exciting and chilling at the same time. Throughout the movie, the action keeps changing from stealth operations, to car pursuits, to gun battles to hand to hand fights. Having the characters use their gifts as well as guns is a smart move as opposed to having them use their bran in every scene. Easily some of the best action I've ever seen in a comic book movie. The visual effects are also impressive, the musical score by Henry Jackson is effective and serves it's purpose and the script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is tightly written and has a little humor mixed in.<br/><br/>Once again, the cast in Captain America: The Winter Solider is stellar in every way. Chris Evans once again nails it as Captain America, playing him with the utmost sincerity while also maintaining his nationalistic ideals even when he is left questioning where he stands in world, while still being a bad-ass when it comes the fights. Scarlett Johansson further develops the charm and character of Black Widow and shows us that she is capable of kicking major ass in the movie, while bringing a superb and active balance to the upfront and narrow mindset of Rogers even showing a bit of love for him but they still rely on each other. Samuel Jackson returns as Nick Fury and carries the role wonderfully while showing a more accessible and human side to himself. Frank Grillo brings Brock Rumlow to life in a believable way. Cobie Smulders is wonderful as always as Maria Hill. Emily Vancamp completely rocks as Agent 13. Robert Redford is a powerhouse as Alexander Peirce, portraying the prefect kind of villain that has plenty of satire and apathy that make him more than a match for our heroes while never venturing too far from the film's political themes but also doesn't come across as over-the-top makes for an incredibly memorable villain. Anthony Mackie is a welcome addition as Sam Wilson/Falcon, playing him much like a war vet and it's great to see him be used as a supporting character or unwanted comic relief. Sebastian Stan is truly terrifying as The Winter Solider/Bucky Barnes and he does an amazing job maintaining his own against his victims and those who stand in his way and his presence in any scene will send chills running down your spine. The relationship between him and Steve is handled brilliantly, showing how much Rogers still cares for Bucky and yet, he must stop him in order to save the world recalling the relationship between Anakin Skywaker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in Revenge of The Sith.<br/><br/>I really don't have anything negative to say about this movie. It's engaging, fast-paced, has tons of action and great acting and has a nice mid-credits scene that sets up the next MCU movie. While Spider-Man 2 and X-men: Days of Future Past are now my favorite Marvel movies, Captain America: The Winter Solider is still one of my favorite Marvel comic book movies. Go watch Captain America: The Winter Solider if you haven't already. It's an awesome movie and should be viewed by anyone who is a comic book movie fan."

","This contains spoilers.<br/><br/>I did watch this film late in 2014, but once I did, I instantly fell in love with it. I re-watched this film many times.<br/><br/>First off, Captain America returns, working under S.H.I.E.L.D. After the unexpected ""death"" of Nick Fury, Rogers finds himself a fugitive of S.H.I.E.L.D. He and Black Widow soon realize that S.H.I.E.L.D was actually taken over by Hydra, and are determined to stop them from controlling the world.<br/><br/>This film exceeded expectations and easily was better than Captain America: The First Avenger. With the return of his best friend, Bucky Barnes, as the Winter Soldier, this film was certainly amazing.<br/><br/>The soundtracks matched perfectly in the film, especially when Cap was taking down the Quinjet.<br/><br/>The introduction of Falcon, in this film, was also pretty interesting. Falcon has a suit which allows him to fly (no, not an Iron Man type of suit, instead a suit with wings). This helped Cap a lot, since Cap can't exactly fly.<br/><br/>This film might be one of the best movies in the Marvel MCU yet. At least, it is to me. 10/10"
"tkbludis","10","3","6","19 June 2019"," One of the best movies in the MCU!
","Captain America The Winter Soldier is a fantastic MCU film and a fantastic film in general. I love how the Russo brothers made this movie a dark and gritty political thriller. The story is amazing, the characters are well written, and the winter soldier is one of the great conflicted types of villains. The fighting choreography is flawless, and this film can really tug on your heartstrings at times as well. The Winter soldier is one of the best movies in the MCU!"

","Stonking! Now this is more like it, after the disappointments that have been Iron Man 2 and Thor 2, Captain America gets a sequel of substance and sparks. It manages to blend everything required to make a great superhero film, lashings of derring-do heroics, action bonanza, adventure, some sexy sizzle and of course the key, a story with brains and mystery elements.<br/><br/>True enough to say that the considerable contributions of Black Widow and Falcon (and Nick Fury of course) keeps this as a lively Avengers spin-off movie, which is no bad thing at all, but it's still the Captain who dominates things, marking himself out as a viable main man. In fact the whole film has the old school comic book feel, yes there's the grandiose pyrotechnics - unsurprisingly amped up for the big finale, but there's an adherence to serial thriller conventions that is, well, rather warm and comforting.<br/><br/>With the Captain getting some surprising amount of emotional depth and humanity courtesy of the perfectly cast Chris Evans, the viewers have much to care about. Themes of Bondian world domination and global security crisis keep things nice and fanciful, while the unheralded work by the effects guys is modern cinematic art. There's some adherence to genre formula, and a bit of Marvel universe copy-catting going on, but this is one of the best films from the Marvel stable. A rich sequel indeed - more Captain America please. 9/10"
"drawlife","9","3","6","1 August 2014"," Best of Phase 2, a real smart superhero film.
","Lets get this out of the way, this is by far, the best Marvel Phase 2 film, and the best solo film all around since the first Iron Man(2008). <br/><br/>I had my slight skepticism from Joe and Anthony Russo, but these guys totally nailed it as did the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. <br/><br/>The cast is all around great. The heart and soul of this movie is on the shoulders of Chris Evans and he carries it so strongly, as Captain America would. He owns this role and captures his struggles to adjust in the modern world very well. Scarlett Johansson is great as ever as Black Widow. Anthony Mackie is so charismatic as Sam Wilson aka the Falcon adding subtle comedy in the film, but not overdoing it. He and Cap show a nice banter as they are both soldiers and have things in common to a certain degree. Sam Jackson and Robert Redford provide excellent supporting roles. Cobie Smulders has a little more to do in this film than she did in The Avengers. Sebastian Stan is actually pretty terrifying as the Winter Soldier, though he does not have a big amount of screen time and is least developed, but his presence is strong and he makes his mark every time he's on screen. <br/><br/>The story is compelling and hooks you in from the start. Compared to other Phase 2 films, this film doesn't feel like ""another"" movie. It's interconnected and serves and actual plot for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Again give credit to the writers. There are also neat twists and turns for those who haven't read the comics, but for those who did, it'll just leave you with anticipation to see where the story progresses. <br/><br/>The action here is amazing. It's so well coordinated and intense. There's lots of gritty hand to hand fighting. I'd say I liked the action sequences in this film more than The Avengers. If anyone doubts the Russo brothers shooting action, well go see this film. It's action packed. The car chase sequences are top notch and the climax of this film is filled with adrenaline. A highpoint is the use of the Falcon wings. They worked so well on screen and it didn't feel ridiculous. The Winter Soldier has an awesome look and his arm is so cool. Looked amazing and sounded amazing. <br/><br/>I compare this film to Alien and Aliens. There is a tonal tone difference between the first film and this film and it works so well. Better action and engaging story. <br/><br/>A lot of groundwork is laid for the Avengers sequel and possibly the third Cap film, especially for characters portrayed by Frank Grillo(Rumlow) and Emily Van Camp(Sharon Carter). <br/><br/>As always with any Marvel movie, stay after the credits, there are two scenes, you'll definitely want too. The ""Age of Miracles."" Oh man..super pumped. <br/><br/>9.2/10"

","Having found the first Captain America incredibly underwhelming and by far the weakest of the initial Marvel Avengers films I went into the film with low expectations... but WOW! I was blown away. <br/><br/>An outstanding film across the board!<br/><br/>The special effects were just as brilliant as they were for other Marvel films and added completely to the whole immersive feel of the film. <br/><br/>The Storyline was for me the best part of the film. A MASSIVE improvement on the first Captain America and really drew you in. A story that completely drew you in, taking you on an emotional roller coaster with some shocking twists and turns throughout. The plot wasn't just an explosive action thriller but quite a good political thriller too making you question who's the good guys and who's the bad ones.<br/><br/>The ending was superb too and the cast were brilliant! Excellent support cast.<br/><br/>An overall excellent film and one of the best stand alone Marvel films yet. 10/10 and I would definitely recommend."

","""The Winter Soldier"" plays the old game of making the former buddy the bad guy, in this case because the Nazi organization that was supposedly defeated in the first film infiltrates the very substance of SHIELD, the organization that should keep such things in check. Predictably, the buddy-turned-evil pawn redeems himself at the end by saving Captain America.<br/><br/>On the scale of such action flicks, this film is competently executed, and has some nice set pieces, such as the intelligent armored SUV that saves Sam Jackson's character. Others are underutilized, such as the 70s technology incarnation of the dead Nazi mastermind as an artificial intelligence data bank. He dies a couple of minutes after his resurrection. And Sam Jackson is predictably resurrected a couple of minutes after his death.<br/><br/>Robert Redford is entertaining as the evil head honcho with a plan to kills a few 1000 people to bring order and peace to the world. These plots always make me wonder. Millions of people that die of hunger or war, due to bad but entirely avoidable political and religious policies, could perhaps be saved by knocking off just the right set of bad leaders. Perhaps this would be more ethical in the long run, a la Vulcan philosophy of ""the good of the many outweighs the good of the few..."" (Or wait, did that come first in Bentham's philosophical treatise, or in the Bible, or even earlier?)<br/><br/>The fact that one can ask such questions after seeing the film is a good sign, but the film remains full of wooden acting, improbable plot elements, lukewarm musical score, etc. It's smarter than most of the superhero flicks, but still solidly in B-movie territory. Definitely worth a single watch, though, and the 3D was not overdone."
"jdkraus","8","3","6","10 May 2014"," Stands on its own with merit
","Spring is the best season for movies. The romantic comedies and popcorn loving, super hero action flicks flood the theaters. Many times they succeed at the box office. The question for the millions of viewers that flock to these movies though is whether if they are any good--or rather are they worth the price of admission. ""Captain America 2: The Winter's Soldier"" is without a doubt a fun, enjoyable movie that takes us deeper into the character of Captain America. It also introduces us to new villains and threats that the hero must overcome. Rather than the cut and dry plot line used in the first ""Captain America,"" this one is a mostly well thought out flick. <br/><br/>As Captain America achieves greatness in stopping terrorists and more or less bringing world peace, he faces a new challenge that is more subtle and sophisticated. This grows more dire as the head of the organization S.H.I.E.L.D is killed and Captain America himself becomes a target of the organization that he once thought was a friend. Forming an alliance with Black Widow from The Avengers, both seek out the reasoning for this betrayal and who has compromised the organization. Adding additional problems, both are tracked by the deadliest assassinÂ…The Winter's Soldier. The movie makes twists and turns, creating a feeling in the viewer that anything can happen to these characters. They are vulnerable and are pitted against odds that would put Iron Man and Thor in a world of hurt. <br/><br/>While the film writers of the Marvel Comics Universe do a good job in making an interesting story, they once again have the tenacity of giving us some information and then throwing more questions at the audience. Without giving anything away, more factors are unresolved than completed. This grows very annoying. The biggest problem though is the lack of connection to the other Marvel Comics characters. I understand that each Marvel Super hero requires their own storyline, but that does not mean disregarding the whereabouts of the other characters. I half anticipated Hawkeye and The Hulk to appear as supporting heroes. But no, Captain America and Black Widow are left alone to fight these problems. This is something that I feel needs to be addressed in further Marvel Universe movies. It is unfair to the hero and the lovers of the comics.<br/><br/>That all aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this addition to the Marvel Comics Universe. Chris Evans is once again effective as the main protagonist and Scarlett Johansen is sexier than ever as Black Widow. The presence of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is always an amusement and adding Anthony Mackie as Falcon is a smart plus. Robert Redford takes the mantle as the main villain, which almost seems out of character given his past work. He is more comical than evil. In one scene, where he is disturbed by his housekeeper, he casually tells her that she should have knocked before entering and then kills her. Though intended to be an example of sadism, the delivery of the scene is tongue and cheek. From his deadpan, condescending tone, it is hard to take him seriously. Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier, however, stands as a menacing, calculated bad-ass. He slaughters anyone who gets in his way without a blink of an eye. He is the Terminator meets Darth Vader. His character is much more plausible than Redford. <br/><br/>The choreography of the fight scenes are very impressive and do not feel unrealistic or dull. The hand-held camera adds to the chaos of the action, but it grows a bit overburdening on occasion. In the back of my mind, I couldn't wonder if this was an attempt to conceal Chris Evans's stunt doubles. The visual effects are very well done, removing the obvious hints of actors running around on a green screen. Henry Jackman's score is adrenaline pumping and epic. His mentor Hans Zimmer would be proud. ""Captain America 2"" may not hold up to the grandeur of The Avengers, but it stands on its own as a decent part of the super hero franchise."
"ThatDoesntMatter","Null","3","6","26 April 2014"," Sadly underwhelming
","The film was merely entertaining, nothing more.<br/><br/>(In my IMDb evaluations, a 7 is 'entertained' - if possible, I would downgrade this film to a 6.5 because it could have been, should have been, more).<br/><br/>I wasn't gripped at all, I did not really care.<br/><br/>I watched a generic bad vs good action flick, with a mediocre script, at least performed by good actors (minus Scarlett Johansson, who, in my view, is utterly talentless and whose acting abilities compass two main expressions: Pout (in a variety of versions) and lascivious smile, and always that monotonous, expressionless voice that apparently some label husky and sexy. Well I don't. Every film she is in automatically becomes downgraded in my book, though she was used according to her abilities here and did not offend too much ^^ SJ is not to blame for the silliness of the plot...)<br/><br/>The plot. Oh my. Hydra. Geez. Recorded Nazi minds. Ouch. I did not dislike the idea behind the algorithm or the means to carry out the 'cleansing', just coupling it with Naziism and 'Hail Hydra' felt so lame and made me cringe. Arrive in the 21st century, Cap. Scriptwriters/producers: reboot the Cap!<br/><br/>And Robert Redford was, while at first glance a nice choice for the role of villain, in an interesting, unusual, this could be fun kind of way, so unconvincing in the role - due to the script but also, I must say, because his acting just did not match up. It felt like HE was not convinced of being a bad guy, because it is just so not him...^^ When Tom Hiddleston plays Loki, I find myself rooting for him, feeling his dilemmas, understanding his rage. Okay, maybe bad example (he is the master :-)), I just wanted to point out how a baddie can be fascinating and involving and fooling you - and still have you rooting for him (or her). Doc Ock worked in Spidey1 (original), as did The Joker (oh, let's take Jack Nicholson AND Heath Ledger as examples - both worked better than Redford), or Justin Hammer - okay, I love Sam Rockwell, so whatever he does is genius in my eyes.<br/><br/>Anyway, Redford was a disappointment beyond the script.<br/><br/>Then, the superfluous characters. I even go so far as to say the Winter Soldier himself was superfluous. The idea of linking the film to the first Captain America film was nice, but visiting Peggy Carter and the museum should have sufficed, or write a different story around it. As it were, the film titled after the Winter Soldier had very little of him in it, a scrap of backstory, a hairstyle that made me think (hope/wish...) 'he' could have been Ms Romanoff, and such a lazy, unexplained, unexplored change of mind at the end that it was insulting. The rogue soldier was superfluous, as was Jasper Sitwell (though I liked him - and his name for some reason, haha - there was just too little of him to be of importance), and the neighbour agent. None of them important or essential.<br/><br/>Now to my major problem with the film: Lack of conflict. The story began with at least some conflict established - CA weary of Nick Fury's mode of command, doubting, questioning - I thought, nice, this could be going somewhere interesting. Finding a friend in someone who left the army, also struggling with loss - the beginning let me think the film might have depth.<br/><br/>Well all this was abandoned for 'The bad guys are the ones shooting at you'. Hmph. Nice quip, but also back to simplistic black-and-white for Captain America, who somehow forgot about his doubts etc. because everybody (EVERYBODY!) was after him, haha. That got the action going but a good storyline was sadly lost. But by then I had long lost hope for anything better anyway, because the Transformers-shooting sequences had wearied my interest.<br/><br/>Alone the Fury car-scene was neat, and the visuals in general, I especially liked the half-distance and behind-the-shoulder camera positions, they worked really nice in 3D. (The make-up throughout was horrible by the way)<br/><br/>The film was not as offensive to me, or as bad, as Man Of Steel, but it was extremely unfulfilling nonetheless. I had hoped for more.<br/><br/>So, in the end, an action flick with some laughs, boring and uninspired twists, a mixed-together, unconvincing plot, nice visuals, nice acting - not a complete loss, but somehow the disappointment follows me days after watching it."
"scotco","8","3","6","21 April 2014"," Lots of action, go see it!
","This was probably one of the best super hero movies to come out recently. There was action on top of action. Not a lot of lulls to make you bored.<br/><br/>The plot was gripping, very cloak and dagger (the genre not the superheros). It kept me on the edge of my seat not knowing who to trust in the S.H.I.L.D. organization. This made it tense throughout.<br/><br/>The character on screen chemistry was also well done. <br/><br/>The only issue I had is why the Winter Soldier would willingly go and have his memory erased time after time. It's possible he is programmed to obey, but still, he didn't even pause or question it. <br/><br/>They tried to limit the CGI and it showed. This made it much more engaging. At times in some other movies, as soon as the CGI kicked in, my eyes would glaze over. When they blend too much CGI and live actors in one scene your brain can tell and it takes you out of the movie. Obviously the heli-carrier scene at the end was mostly CGI, but even that was done well."
"PartialMovieViewer","10","3","6","21 April 2014"," The Captain Kicks Butt...AGAIN
","A movie that is well paced, enjoyable and full of talent. The director and production staff reached into that big Marvel 'bag-of-tricks,' and voilà. This flick has good guys overcoming insurmountable oddsat-the-very-last minute; bad guys turning into good guysat-the-very-last minute; good guys coming to the rescue at-the-very-last minute; the world being saved at-the-very-last minute and – last but not least – Samuel L. Jackson brought back from the dead – YES – at-the-very-last minute. It all sounds like a formula designed for comic book successgood whoops bad – all in the nick-of-time. What spectacular plot-candy and all these are complements of Marvel Comics. I know there are those out there who prefer the more dismal, and almost macabre superheroes, which are churned out by, 'those other guys' – I like them too. They are a very different breed, they almost paint themselves as victims or societal outcasts – well cry me a river. I don't care if the other guys churn out more thoughtful superheroes – they are comic book characters toolighten up. Besides, you make too deep of a character, you may find acting is required. Meh – acting is over-rated. Who needs acting? Come on, this is a story from a comic bookabout comic book characters. Now don't get me wrong, there is good acting in the movie. Samuel L. Jackson IS Nick Fury, no denying that and it was time for him to get a bigger part. Now Robert Redford, as THE villain - that was a bit of a surprise. He played his part so convincingly. Alexander Pierce's collectivist crimson hue fit Mr. Redford so well the studio probably had him believing his character WAS the hero. Scarlett Johansson looked comfortable in spandex and did a fine job kicking and punching and shooting all those nasty evildoers. OH – and I really like Anthony Mackie as, 'Falcon.' The guy is a great actor, but I must admit that I can't help that every time I look at his face, I weep a little and want to yell, 'We Are Falcon!' Anyways – go see this movie. You will 'Marvel' at the action and fast pace."

"DareDevilKid","10","3","6","18 April 2014"," Heart-Pounding Action Fare
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.5/5 stars<br/><br/>It really looks like Marvel Studios can do no wrong (let's just chuck the deplorable ""Iron Man 3"" as an aberration). Their movies oscillate between just two categories - very good and amazing. The great news is that ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" fits easily into the latter category. Not only is this arguably the best Marvel film since ""The Avengers"" film (Yes, I liked it even better than the first ""Thor"" and ""Iron Man"" movies - both mighty good films in their own right, which speaks volumes about how well this film's been assembled.), it's also one of the finest big-ticket, action-adventure movies in recent times.<br/><br/>The plot deals with Steve Rogers (Cap) struggling to embrace his role in the modern world while battling a new threat: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier. He's also warned by Nick Fury that SHIELD has been infiltrated by its enemies. When Rogers acts on Fury's warning to trust no one at SHIELD, he is branded as a traitor by the organization. Now a fugitive, Captain America must get to the bottom of this deadly mystery with the help of Black Widow and a Falcon (making his first cinematic experience). However, the battle will be costly for the morals and ideas of freedom and liberty – core ideals SHIELD is founded on – with Rogers finding enemies where he least expects them. He also begins to suspect that the Winter Soldier bears a disturbingly familiar appearance to a ghost from his past.<br/><br/>While the action scenes are top notch (but then again, that's expected from a Marvel movie), they also merge seamlessly with a well-scripted plot, which is brilliantly intertwined with some smartly conceived twists and turns. In fact, three quarters of the film plays out like a neat suspenseful thriller that keeps audiences at the edge of their seats with its unpredictability and mystery. However, there's no shortage of action, albeit whenever it's required. The action thankfully occurs to take the story forward and not just to fill up gaps in the narrative, something most Marvel films have displayed a flair for.<br/><br/>As expected, the cinematography, production design, special effects, and CGI effects are of the highest quality. Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Redford, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, and Frank Grillo all complement each other effortlessly and are easy on the eye. The film opens up new and sumptuous horizons for the Avengers and SHIELD universe, and is sure to have a major impact in subsequent Marvel film ventures, especially those involving the honorable Captain America.<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is certain to go down as one of the finest superhero film as well as action-adventure movies of all time. And, it would be prudent not to leave the theater once the credits start rolling, as the usual mid-credits bonus feature - an added staple attraction from Marvel Studios - is surprisingly elongated and one of the most delectable ones yet, leaving the door open for some really exciting possibilities. Regular comic book fans will immediately identify these teasing prospects with vigor and a smile etched across their visage. ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a fine example of how to please hardcore comic book fans, standard action movie fans, and impartial moviegoers alike."
"Cs_The_Moment","10","3","6","9 April 2014"," Marvel At Its Best
","The Winter Soldier follows on from the first Captain America pretty seamlessly (although there are tiny moments throughout that won't quite be understood if you haven't kept up with The Avengers (2012) and Thor: The Dark World (2013), as in typical Marvel fashion everything links back to previous stories). This time we catch up with Captain America as he struggles to integrate into modern life and find his place within S.H.I.E.L.D, facing new enemies with plenty of twists and turns along the way.<br/><br/>I reviewed the first Captain America film and described it as ""action- packed family adventure"", and The Winter Soldier surpasses that description right from the beginning. Matching the tougher, more advanced modern world, the Captain has developed accordingly, shedding his more innocent superhero image from the previous film in favour of a rougher, more masculine warrior who goes in all guns blazing. This film is even more action-packed than its predecessor, full of gunfights and car chases; and the budget was well-spent on a huge array of visually impressive special effects. The story was one of the best Marvel has produced: dark and secretive, constantly changing and developing, keeping you guessing right to the last moment. Eagle-eyed viewers (like me) may pick up on the hints dropped throughout as to the true identity of the Winter Soldier, but regardless of whether or not you work it out before the end, it still makes for a thrilling finale.<br/><br/>Chris Evans once again provides charm and like-ability as the ever-moral and slightly vulnerable Captain America, and there is a surprisingly big role for Scarlett Johansson's Agent Romanoff (those who have seen The Avengers (2013) will be familiar with this character), who works well as a contrast to her fellow avenger. Samuel L Jackson reprises his role as Nick Fury and brings a refreshingly comic performance to the character which is greatly enjoyable and helps to ease some of the tension and darker moments within the film. Like with the other Marvel films there are many smaller characters that add to the overall enjoyment of the story; and of course it wouldn't be a superhero film without an enemy, coming in many and varied forms, the Winter Soldier not being the most surprising.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier has a firmly modern feel, dealing with the ever-prominent theme of conspiracy and secrets in a way that is surprisingly adult for a Marvel film. With plenty of action and excitement, this film holds your attention firmly throughout, keeps you guessing, and makes you want more. It is darker and more dangerous, making it every bit as thrilling as you could want from an action film, and it is Marvel at its best: you won't be disappointed."

","After I felt somewhat underwhelmed by the two post-Avengers movies (more so from Iron Man 3 than Thor: The Dark World), Captain America: The Winter Soldier served as the movie that made me love Marvel all over again.<br/><br/>This movie features several plots woven into a gratuitous scenario which will please even the pickiest of Marvel fans, such as myself; literally, the only reason I extracted half a star is that I didn't get to see the Winter Soldier as much as I wanted.<br/><br/>Do not let the title fool you, this movie is way more than the former Soviet Union's greatest assassin. Questioning the political, and human, right of the privacy of people's personal identities, and the reasons behind the surveillance we live through under a government's watchful eye, we start to wonder who are the heroes and who the enemies. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a man who has still not acclimatised to the gray areas this world has delved into, be it the right to punish people before they even act on a crime or to question the orders someone receives from above, is caught into a chaotic war between foes from his past and newfound evil from this time. He does so with the help of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and new member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sam Wilson aka The Falcon (Anthony Mackey). But when the Captain is faced with the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), he will be forced to choose between saving the world, or sacrificing himself to, as Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) said in the movie, to built a better world on the wreckage of the old one.<br/><br/>One thing that blew me away in the movie were the fighting scenes. Superb choreography, not the one that will get you dizzy with fast paced cameras, but the one that holds you on the edge of your seat. Lacking the excessive use of CGI upon the request of the directors, you'll marvel at the simplest throw of the Captain's shield, when it crashes straight upon its target seemingly with ease.<br/><br/>Every actor delivered, and more so Anthony Mackey, who beautifully balances humour and seriousness, and stars in some really nice shots of him flying through the air as he tries to disengage a whole aircraft on his own whilst avoiding shots from every side. Yeah, he is really badass.<br/><br/>I also loved Sebastian Stan, even though I think we could have seen more of him and his backstory. He does not talk much, but when he does, his emotion-filled expressions make you actually sympathise with his predicament. Especially, the last fighting scene he shares with Captain America is exceptionally played, filled to the brim with flowing emotion and the struggle both characters feel when faced with each other.<br/><br/>I don't know if Joss Whedon wrote any of the script, but you can feel his influence on it, especially when not one, but three women (plus one from the past) manage to hold their own to the story, and help the plot move on evenly. Not to mention that they actually save Captain America a couple of times.<br/><br/>I loved the music, as well. The score is action packed itself, with wonderful eerie pieces here and there, which fit perfectly to the tone of The Winter Soldier and the darker parts of the movie. Make no mistake, it may be rated PG-13, but I felt it was much more adult themed than the rating suggests.<br/><br/>All in all, a strong, beautifully written, excellently directed sequel, and a scrumptious add to Marvel's growing list of superhero blockbusters. It does what the two previous movies didn't do (weave with the Avengers), and basically gives you what Captain America: The First Avenger did not. This one's a film I will certainly watch again, and again."

","Captain America:The Winter Soldier,most awaited movie of 2014.Screenplay is outstanding but the story is only good because at some point movie is boring and so much talkative.This time it is full of secrets and nicely connected with the first one.The suspense about the villain is superb. Set is amazingly created and makes you speechless.Climax and ending are awesome.The second scene after credits is worth watching. Every characters have done superb and remarkable job.Movie has so many high points but in other side it has low points too.The suspense of old S.H.I.E.L.D. and death of Fury and HYDRA are good.<br/><br/>Overall,this one is technically amazing than first one but good in story than first one.Still it is worth watching.Totally recommended !"
"Andrewtw93","10","3","6","5 April 2014"," The Best?
","Wow. I am not one to write a review for a film, but I couldn't resist it this time around. I was one of those ""weirdo's"" who was not a huge fan of the first Captain film. I wanted to and have tried desperately to love it because of its cool WW2 concept. It seemed like such a cool concept that had not been done, and while I loved the first half, the second half lost me completely. It suffered from wanting to get to the Avengers too fast and forgot to tell its story along the way.<br/><br/>Here in The Winter's Soldier - That problem has been remedied. The film gives us yet another concept for Super Hero flicks, political conspiracy. It was one of the most original hero story flicks I have had the experience of seeing. Plus some top-notch acting to boot.<br/><br/>Out of all the Marvel films, none have been able to show Johansson's and Jackson's characters like this one has. They both play perfectly their characters and show some new aspects of their character's we had not yet seen. Plus the new addition of Mackie and Redford were awesome. I was scared Mackie would play the typical cheesy sidekick (as was seen in The First Avenger), but Mackie played it so well it was very enjoyable. Redford and Stan do very well as the villains, my only regret was that Stan did not have as big of a character as I hoped. All in all, the supporting cast was fantastic and had a fantastic story to work with. Many feared was that their new big roles would down play Cap's...Not the case. While others do shine in this film, it is Cap front and center that takes the bacon. Evens gives his best performance so far in the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>In the end, I am left to wonder if I really just witnessed the best Marvel film thus far. I have enjoyed literally everyone of them, which makes it hard to say, But I am not sure that any of the other films have displayed better action, suspense, and of course, a better story. I believe Captain America The Winter Soldier is Marvel's best, and you should check it out."

","In the present, Steve and Natasha and some special SHIELD unit are sent to rescue a ship and hostages. Lots of violent fights ensue. Natasha disobeys Steve's orders and instead downloads some information. Fury can't access the drive's data which makes him suspicious. He introduces Steve to a secret SHIELD project called Insight. It includes overly armed hellicarriers that can will orbit earth 24/7 and eliminate future threats before they happen thanks to having all data on everyone. Fury meets with some SHIELD higher up and gets him to delay the launch of the project.<br/><br/>As he leaves the meeting, Fury is attacked by police and some mean guy with a bionic arm--the Winter Soldier. He makes it to Steve's apartment but is again shot and dies. He warns Steve in time that SHIELD is compromised and to trust no one. When Steve refuses to tell the higherup what Fury revealed to him he becomes enemy #1. Now all of SHIELD is after Steve, Natasha, and an army guy Steve has befriended. Natasha and Steve discover where the information on the drive was created. They travel to a bunker and find some very old technology there and discover project Hydra which is basically a rogue division of SHIELD which brought about Insight and aims to restore world order by sacrificing liberty. They now have to stop project Insight from launching by replacing 3 PC boards on the carriers. Of course they'll have to face the Winter Soldier. And the higherup too is revealed to be up to no good. In the end we get a couple of surprises among lots of fighting and carnage. And as always some connection with the other Marvel stories and an ending that sets up things for yet another movie.<br/><br/>After the poor Captain America I and the disappointing Thor II, I wasn't very optimistic about this one, considering that like Thor II it's directed by people with no movie experience. But this one is better than both of those movies. The action is excellent, the effects impressive. Acting isn't all that great, especially Johannson doesn't give it her best. The movie is a bit too long. But best of all is the story and how relevant it's for today's situation. I'm glad Hollywood is finally addressing the issues and not ignoring them for political ideology. Does keeping tabs on all citizens, storing all their personal information, monitoring their communications, using fear to limit liberties, and going after people for crimes they allegedly may commit sound familiar? It should. That's what is also at stake in this movie. Redford character's gives a grotesque calculus- he thinks he can keep 7 billion people ""safe"" by killing 20 million. I'm glad this Captain America is a defender of liberty first and foremost."
"estebangonzalez10","8","3","6","5 April 2014"," The best Marvel film of Phase Two
","""Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists. The ones that do call him the Winter Soldier. He's a ghost, you'll never find him.""<br/><br/>The film opens with an action sequence in a freighter that made me worry I was going to be let down as I was with the first Captain America. Out of all the Marvel films the first Captain America film was my least favorite. This sequel opened with some shaky camera work and quick editing cuts, but once the story began to get going I was pleasantly surprised. This is very different from the rest of the Marvel films that relied heavily on CGI and light storytelling, The Winter Soldier is a bit more serious and tells an interesting story. At times you forget you are watching a superhero movie and it turns into an interesting espionage thriller. Even Captain America became much more interesting in this film and I'm sure fans will appreciate this sequel directed by Joe and Anthony Russo (You, Me and Dupree) much more than they did the first. Not only is this the best Captain America film, it also is the best film of Phase 2 (post The Avengers) for Marvel. The story is really entertaining and gripping, the film also looks really good considering it has much more live action scenes than CGI. After the disappointing opening sequence, the rest of the action scenes completely worked and they managed to keep me invested in what was going on. Sure the twists were a bit predictable, but the story was really well developed and the framework for the next sequel has been set. The new characters in this film also added a lot more to this franchise and I really enjoyed the pacing of this movie. This sequel delivered thanks to a gripping and suspenseful story and well developed characters.<br/><br/>Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely teamed up again for the adaptation of this sequel which takes place some time after the events of The Avengers. Captain America (Chris Evans) is now in Washington DC as he continues struggling to adjust to the present while working for SHIELD under the guidance of Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson). It's a different world now and Captain America realizes that there are enemies disguised as friends even inside SHIELD headquarters. With very few people he can trust, Captain America teams up with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to try to expose the conspiracy and traitors in the department before the world is attacked yet again. As they begin to dig deeper, a professional assassin known as the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is sent to stop them. Knowing that they can't expose the conspiracy on their own, Captain America finds an ally in Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), a veteran who knows where Steve is coming from. He becomes the Falcon and together they begin to expose the corruption in SHIELD.<br/><br/>Chris Evans is comfortable yet again playing one of the most beloved comic book superheroes. Captain America might be the simplest of the heroes from the Marvel films, but he doesn't negotiate his values and is true to his word. Someone with his morals is hard to come across with in the present and that is why he finds it so difficult to establish meaningful relationships. Scarlett Johansson is great once again as the Black Widow and it's always great to see her fighting off the bad guys. As for the new characters I really enjoyed Anthony Mackie's performance as the Falcon. He really has great chemistry with Chris Evans and both their characters have similar values. Mackie also delivers some of the funniest lines in the movie in an otherwise pretty serious thriller. Sebastian Stan is also impressive as the Winter Soldier. His character is very interesting although I think he did try a little to hard at times to look cool. His posture and attitude reminded me of a rock star, but I still enjoyed his character very much and though he was a great addition to this film. Like the other Marvel films, you should stay for the credits as there are two short but interesting scenes. This was a huge upgrade for Captain America and it is my favorite film of 2014 so far. The climax is formulaic and we know what we are going to get, but the journey getting there is what made this film such a wonderful experience for me. This film actually had some interesting character development and it wasn't just an excuse to run from one incoherent and noisy action scene to the next like some other recent superhero films."
"johnathan-bracey","9","3","6","5 April 2014"," Captain America Winter Soldier is the best Marvel film of 2014
","Captain America has to be the best movie of all the Marvel Movies for Phase 2. Way better than Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 I'll say. Compare to the other Marvel movies this one has a darker tone compare the recent Marvel movies we've seen own by Disney. The Plot: Captain America in our era not just have to deal about the changing times in America but also our government as well.In this film S.H.I.E.L.D becomes too protected and Nick Fury played by actor Samuel L Jackson becomes paranoid by outside supernatural, super powered threats and even people that work inside his work force. Among the others that work for S.H.I.E.L.D, Captain America sees what's the moral issue with Nick Fury's security plan.You can really understand Captain America's disagreement to Nick Fury how the world should be protected. Captain America Winter Soldier is not just a Captain America film or a superhero film its political thriller. <br/><br/>The action in this movie is outstanding and fights are better than any Marvel movie I've seen so far. Black Window played by Scarlett Johansson has to be one of the best characters in movie next to Anthony Mackie who played the Falcon. The mysterious Antagonist the ""Winter Soldier"" has barley in dialogue in the film but even with small lines actor Sebastian Stan is able to make his character feel so epic and intense. Robert Redford who plays the character Alexandra Pierce is know to be in major serious roles in films, plays an aging head of S.H.I.E.L.D agent that shares a strong relationship with both Nick Fury and The Winter Soldier. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is the best Marvel I've seen so far and I encourage everyone to watch it even if your a Marvel fan, DC fan or not even a comic book fan at all."

"mayerdude","8","3","6","5 April 2014"," Possibly Marvel's Best
","You know how everyone says that sequels are rarely as good as the original? Captain America: The Winter Soldier takes that idea and rips it to shreds. Where the first film had promise but ultimately failed to deliver a truly great movie experience, The Winter Soldier exceeds expectations sets a high standard for every Marvel film that will follow.<br/><br/>Where to begin? Let's start with the story. I'll make sure to avoid too much detail so that you can experience the story spoiler-free. The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo of Community and Arrested Development fame, really understand what needs to come first in a film: characters and story. This is no simple mindless action film to tide comic book lovers over. This is a character-driven political espionage thriller that, in Joe Russo's words, is ""masquerading as a big superhero movie"". The film examines the price of freedom, the use of fear as a weapon, and asks the viewer to question the ethical nature of preemptive actions.<br/><br/>With regards to characters, we get the most character-centered Marvel film since the first Iron Man. Captain America (Chris Evans) himself feels more fleshed out this time around. We see that while he is adjusting well to living in the modern era, he feels direction-less. He finds a kindred spirit in Sam Wilson(Anthony Mackie), a fellow veteran. While on the job with SHIELD, Cap tends to find himself at odds with the values of Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) and Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson). Carrying over with a story arc that began in The Avengers, Cap feels that SHIELD is over-extending its reach into fighting evil and states that it is now violating every individual's right to freedom.<br/><br/>What follows is an unrelenting and thrilling story involving corruption within the government. After Fury discovers that there may be dark conspiracy looming around him, he is attacked by the Winter Soldier(Sebastian Stan), and everything becomes complicated for our heroes. The rest of the story is very exciting to see unfold, so I won't discuss the story any further.<br/><br/>Special recognition should be given to the directors and the stunt coordinators. The action scenes here are by far the best in a Marvel film to date. While watching the movie, I was reminded of the Bourne films. There's no fantasy violence here, just bone-crunching martial arts action.<br/><br/>The performances were surprising as well. Chris Evans feels much more confident as Captain America than he has in any other Marvel film. He brings much-needed moral fiber and a hopeful demeanor to what is ostensibly a dark, realistic political thriller. Scarlett Johansson gets a very intriguing plot line where she's forced to re-examine her values. She's easily the strongest female protagonist Marvel has right now, and it's great to see her further developed. Perhaps the most shocking character development comes in the form of Nick Fury. In most of his previous appearances, he's simply given orders and hasn't done much or been given a meaningful character arc. However, he makes some difficult and surprising decisions over the course of the movie and feels like a real person. Robert Redford's character brings the kind of intelligence and gravitas that the actor is so well-known for. His role in the film is incredibly important and his actions will surely entertain movie-goers and comic book fans. Anthony Mackie's performance is fantastic and brings a certain warmth to the screen that's a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Let's not forget to talk about the Winter Soldier himself. Sebastian Stan somehow makes you feel for a cold, emotionless killer, despite having fewer lines than many of the other characters. His back story is tragic and interesting, and his scenes with Captain America are emotionally-charged and painful to watch. Oh, and he's essentially the Predator of the Marvel villains.<br/><br/>Overall, the actors all deal flawlessly with each other.<br/><br/>Joe and Anthony Russo are possibly the best directors that Marvel has hired thus far. What they've given us is a polished, sharp script and an effective, thrilling film. They smartly avoid constantly referencing the rest of the Marvel universe. The references that are included make sense within the context of previous and upcoming films. They should also be lauded with praise for using relatively little CGI in the film. Most of the movie was filmed on physical sets, so as not to distract the audience with computer imagery.<br/><br/>Oh, and as with every Marvel movie, stay after the credits. Trust me, the easter eggs here are much better than the sorry Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World after-credits scenes. Unlike those films, Cap 2's post-credits stinger introduces characters and concepts that will be very important in upcoming Marvel movies."
"TheConnoisseurReviews","8","3","6","5 April 2014"," ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" Review
","""Captain America:The Winter Soldier"" is a really good movie that is leagues better than the initial first film, which I was not a fan of. This new story of The Cap is brought into the modern world and it's fun seeing him deal with how much the world has changed, but at the same time how much it has stayed the same. The script is well written. It is filled with great relevant social commentary about our government and major organizations and how they preserve freedom by reistricting it. However, while the script is fairly heavy, it does manage to have enough fun Marvel humor that we've all come to love.<br/><br/>One thing in particular that I love about this movie is that it gives a lot of respect to its characters. The Captain himself is show to be more than just a leader. He can hold his own, but is also a great human being. Chris Evans has finally owned the character and it's hard seeing anyone else play him. We also get more backstory to Natasha a.k.a Black Widow. It allows the audience to connect with her on an emotional level. Same goes for Nick Fury. The Winter Soldier is a pretty awesome villain, who I believe to be the best villain from the Marvel Cinematic universe only behind Loki.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Captain America:The Winter Soldier"" is a fairly entertaining and surprisingly thought provoking movie that is stepping up the quality of the modern superhero movie genre. It has everything from great characters, to an engaging and honest story, to some of the best action we'll get this year. My only gripe with the film would be the heavy use of shaky cam during the action sequences. Other than that, it is a a movie that you go and see in theaters today. Also, stay after the credits there is a big reveal that will surely get everyone excited for The Avengers 2. I give 4/5"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","3","6","5 April 2014"," Possibly the closest approximation of what a thoughtful superhero movie might look like, at least out of this series.
","I'll be honest, I haven't always been kind to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that opened with with 2008's Iron Man. Save for the original Iron Man and Captain America: The First Avenger, the films in this series have been, for me, a case of noisy fan gratification, with more posturing then pondering. Don't get me wrong, I welcome this series, but amid the eye candy of flashy costumes and crashing metal I find myself wishing for something for the grey matter.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that this is the case with Captain America: The Winter Soldier possibly the closest approximation of what a thoughtful superhero movie might look like, at least out of this series. While it isn't deeply psychological like The Dark Knight, nor as rock star epic as Iron Man, this second adventure for Cap does something refreshing – it actually tells a compelling story. More than that, it plays like the great espionage thrillers of the 1970s like The Parallax View or Three Days of the Condor or Marathon Man, back in the days before movies go lazy and replaced brain power and good writing with shaky-cam and kickboxing.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier builds its story almost from nothing. It begins without ominous foreshadowing and allows the clouds to form. It builds slowly, slowly, step by step so that we only understand the story as our beloved Captain America (aka Steve Rogers) does. In other words, it has the patients to tell the story as it unfolds, and not just creating a predictable straight line from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>The story: someone has compromised S.H.E.I.L.D., and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) appears to be a suspect in a plot that leaves Steve on the run with no one to trust. not even at headquarters. In the elevator, on the way down, he quickly surmises that the ten ordinary-looking men who have joined him in the elevator aren't just along for the ride.<br/><br/>On the run with Agent Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) aka Black Widow, the two quickly discover that they have no place to hide. There is literally no one they can trust. Quietly Steve becomes so paranoid that, for a while, he even keeps an emotional distance even from Natasha. What serves the story best as character drama is Steve's disorientation of the digital age. Smart and tough as he is, he's still a kid from the 40s who has woken up in the present after 70-years in hibernation. He needs friends at his side, and with the dark forces closing in, he draws closer to Natasha despite his misgivings. He also draws faith in his closest buddy, a PTSD counselor named Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) who's other identity will not be spoiled here.<br/><br/>What he and Natasha and Sam uncover is something that has festered within S.H.E.I.L.D. since the days when Steve was still busting Der Fuehrer's Face. Trust me, I've given nothing away. Actually, the most potent secret has been given away by the film's title. Yes, there is such a thing as The Winter Soldier and he is impressive. He's a ninja-like assassin with a metal arm and a Hannibal Lector-style face mask who has a connection to Steve that leaves him trying to figure out how to deal with him in some way other than putting out his lights.<br/><br/>What is also new is Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a better investment of the characters. Steve is still a kid of the 1940s, and in this adventure he finds that while he can trust no one, that means he must draw closer to those next to him. He and Natasha and Sam have a curious and touching rapport. You can note the intimate bond of friendship that exists between them in the quiet, thoughtful moments when they are simply think and talk.<br/><br/>The economy of characters even extends – refreshingly – to Samuel L. Jackson, who's Nick Fury has thus far remained a minor supporting player. Up till now he has walked on, given a short quip and then left the rest to the costumed heroes. This time he gets intimately involved in the plot as (if you saw this week's ""Agents of S.H.E.I.L.D."") he finds himself under attack from whoever. A lot of Jackson's dialogue is flat, boilerplate speech to further the plot along. The gift of Sam Jackson is his ability to elevate even the driest of line readings into something that makes you giggle with delight. Note a scene midway through the film when he utters a boring line like ""it's about damned time"" and makes it a quietly funny comic quip.<br/><br/>Of the films in this series, Captain America is now two for two in my book. I liked the first Iron Man but felt let down by the sequels. Hulk is interesting, but has stumbled twice as a solo feature. And Thor, for all his defenders, is a character whose appeal escapes me. I thought the first Thor was boring and the second, just plain silly – he's a character that I am not sure that the screenwriters really know what to do with either.<br/><br/>I'm an outsider to this genre. I am more familiar with The Muppets then I am with The Avengers, and so my view of this series is a bit narrow. I'm looking for something that elevates these multi-million dollar comic books into something more than just noise and crashing metal. I sense that there is something more to these characters than just thrashing about. They've been around for 70s years, so I have to assume that their appeal is more than skin deep."
"kaylenns","9","3","6","5 April 2014"," Well-balanced between action and thought
","It's well-paced, well-acted, well-written, intelligent, action-packed, emotionally moving, visually gripping, painful, funny, sad, true, real, heightened-beyond-reality, and then brought back down to earth again. The moral weight of Captain America's position has always been one of his strengths and they make excellent use of it here, juxtaposing it very effectively with his sense of being uncertain in his personal life. The villains' position is tempting...and yet still morally wrong. There were some really nice touches with ""average"" people doing heroic things, too. I didn't expect this movie to be a game-changer in the Avengers universe, but just one more installment in Steve Rogers's tale. Instead, it came away having fundamentally changed the basic assumptions about the world and its structure and it leaves the door open for who-knows-what in the future. Excellent writing and I look forward to where Marvel goes next with this massive (and largely well-executed!) story."
"g-leno","9","3","6","5 April 2014"," Winter soldier, best movie this spring!
","I was so very happy with this movie, I walked out of the cinema feeling that it was probably the best way I could have spent my evening.<br/><br/>Chris Evans has hit his stride in the role of Captain America. Every time he plays Steve Rogers, he gets better at it. The first avenger was a shaky start, with many characters being introduced and never being given any more to do or say in the film. In the Avengers, he comes forward as the tactical mind of the team, but is overshadowed by the ego of the powerhouse characters. This film however gives him the full attention while still managing to develop Black Widow, Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D., and do a more than decent job of introducing Mackie's Falcon.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the way that the plot moves and shifts, making this so much different from many other comic book movies. The focus is on plot, characters and back-stories as much as the action, although there is still plenty of action too. Well choreographed fights, excellent visual effects and innovative ideas for gadgets and missions in the film make for a thrilling ride of a movie I hope that this level of quality continues to come from Marvel Studios, and as long as it does they will have the monopoly on the summer blockbusters for the foreseeable future. Bring on Guardians of the Galaxy!"
"stevendbeard","9","3","6","4 April 2014"," Great Story with Mind-numbing Super Heroics
","I saw ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", starring Chris Evans-The Avengers_2012, Cellular; Scarlett Johansson-The Avengers_2012, Home Alone 3; Anthony Mackie-Pain & Gain, The Hurt Locker, Sebastian Stan- Captain America: The First Avenger, The Covenant and Robert Redford- Lions For Lambs, The Horse Whisperer. <br/><br/>This is the second Captain America movie-with a third in the planning- but it more closely follows the Avengers movie-with a second & a third in the planning. This is a great sequel because most of the back story has already been established and they can just get down to it. This one also has a good story, as well as the mind-numbing super heroics going for it. Chris returns as Captain America, a time misplaced soldier trying to understand the world he is now living in. He has problems with deciding on who to trust after disagreeing with the way things are done. Scarlett returns as the Black Widow, a former Soviet spy that is now a top field agent for S.H.I.E.L.D., the international peace-keeping organization. Anthony joins the cast as Sam Wilson, aka the Falcon, Chris' new side-kick. Sebastian plays the Winter Soldier-if you are familiar with the comics, you know who he is-and Robert plays a bureaucrat that runs the World Security Council, who gives S.H.I.E.L.D. their orders. FYI: If you are a MMA fan, Georges St-Pierre has a good cameo as Batroc the Leaper. Stan Lee also has his usual cameo. There are two scenes at the end; one as the end credits start and one after they are over, so do not leave early. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the violence and gun play and has a running time of 2 hours & 16 minutes. I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"blueyedragon019","10","3","6","4 April 2014"," easily the BEST sequel in the franchise!!
","I just got back from seeing the new Captain America movie (alone (-_-) but It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. You know for once I'm glad I didn't have a date to the movies or otherwise I would have missed all the awesomeness of this movie.<br/><br/>I went in with low expectations because I didn't like the first one. This not only trumps the first one, but it trumps ALL the other sequels including Thor 2 and Iron Man 2 & 3 easily..it's in the same league as The Avengers. the storyline was awesome, you can tell the writers that were hired for this movie were top of the line. The screenplay was really great. I loved all the dialogue and references made in the movie.<br/><br/>My favorite references was one between agent 13 and the Captain and one scene with Black Widow and a computer..I'm not gonna spoil it but it is hilarious and epic. Never SAW that coming. ;) The Black Widow is as fineee as ever & is the definition of ""a badass bitch"" The dialogue between Captain America and her were freakin hilarious. Fury is also one cool ass *beep* were a few epic scenes with him.<br/><br/>The story is really crazy, you go through the movie with capital WTF and no way, this *beep* is nuts! it had a lot of really intense, epic scenes. The fight scenes were so sikkkk, the elevator scene is one of my favorite scenes from the entire movie. The after credit scenes were intensee and really exciting. I can't wait to see WTH happens in Avengers 2.<br/><br/>Overall I give this movie two thumbs way up, 👍👍.. I felt like a kid, in my head I was like ""I wanna be Captain America!"" Lol I highly recommend it GET YOUR LAZY ASS OUT YOUR HOUSE AND SEE IT!! This movie reminded me of why I want to work in the movie industry."

","S.H.I.E.L.D. has been compromised. And by compromised I don't mean your grandfather's compromised. It's up to Cap, Black Widow and their new buddy the Falcon to address these startling developments. As usual, Marvel is right on with its casting for the main characters, the new Falcon is great and very well played; Evans and Johannsen need no further comment. Two complaints and two complaints only - 1) as with most modern CGI the sequences are herky jerky and played so fast that half the time you can't figure out what's going on; and 2) the movie is about 15-20 minutes too long. Other than that, the story frequently changes pace but moves at a good clip to a fitting apocalyptic climax, my favorite sequence being when the bad guys bother Mr. Fury. Marvel continues to amaze, this is (again) a sequel better than the original movie, a real rarity in modern cinema. As always, make sure to stay all the way through the credits."

","To say captain America was not better than the avengers is an understatement. This is wayyyy better than the avengers and may I say the best marvel movie thus far. It tapped into our world as we know it with all the conspiracy like NSA the illuminati and more captain America is really my favorite avenger now he kicks so much ass in this movie and the winter soldier even though he isn't in it as much as I wanted him to be in it he was awesome he did some serious damage. The entire cast was great black widow had a much better roll this time around and from this point on everything has changed and I like how this movie sets up the avengers and they have so many Easter eggs to other avengers and upcoming ones that have magic powers and is a Doctor. This movie tops everything as to great action great script and you don't have to see the first cap movie but at the same time you do to understand some other major plot points actually the actual plot point to the movie in general. But this movie has you to think is stuff like this really going on. To answer that question is yes if you watch conspiracy videos most of this stuff is happening and captain America shows that in order to stop the corruption in this world you have to be heroic even though cap is a Boy Scout it should make us all want to be hero's like him. To put it all in a nutshell Captain America should be on everyone's top superhero movie list now. And even though I loved man of steel so much I hope and pray DC gets there stuff together and please don't put batman vs superman out on the same day as Captain America 3"
"ThomasDrufke","10","3","6","3 April 2014"," Best Marvel Solo Film (Cap is B.A)
","This is exactly how Captain America should be portrayed. A complete bad-a** is what he is in this movie. This is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with my opinion one of its non-interesting characters. I say that but really after watching this movie, he is in my top 3 favorite Marvel characters now. Chris Evans is brilliant in this role, hats off to him. I sure hope he keeps playing Cap even after his current contract is up. The man brought a great amount of charisma to screen that I didn't see in the first Captain America movie. The same goes for Scarlett Johansson, who formed a great new team up in this movie with Cap, another team up/duo in Cap 3 perhaps? This film will grip you from the beginning to end, as it is as much a political thriller as it is an action-spy thriller.<br/><br/>There is so much to like in this movie I don't know how to fit it all in one review. Ill start with the actors. Chris Evans as I said is perfect for Cap and so is Scarlett Johansson for Black Widow. I liked her small role in Iron Man 2 and she was great in a tad bigger role in Avengers. But she shows everything off in this movie. She brings so much to like with the sexiness and totally sells me on the kick-butt aspect. She has some of the best stunts of the movie and she makes it totally believable its her. Sebastian Stan returns in an actually smaller role than expected but no less important. He is truly terrifying as The Winter Soldier. And I can say that he is easily the best villain Marvel's Cinematic Universe has to offer, besides Loki of course. Sam Jackson is always great and I thought Redford pulled off the villain quite well. The newcomer Anothony Mackie was hilarious and his dynamic with Cap is as good if not better than the Stark-Rhodey banters. The action is beautifully shot and choreographed. Probably the best action in a superhero movie i've seen, and most believable. I also liked the callbacks to the first movie and the amount of name-drops to the other Avengers.<br/><br/>The only complaints I have are that I wanted MORE Cap. There's a part of the movie that actually limits Cap's screen time and gets away for a bit, but of course comes back. There were parts near the end that did feel a little bit cheesy, but that's all. I also wonder what does the destruction of Shield mean for the Agents of Shield T.V. show? BTW...Did anybody really think Nick Fury would die? I would be wrong not to mention the directors. These guys came from doing just television shows, and now this huge movie? Talk about change of scope! I can trust them with any big time blockbuster now. Matter of fact, send them over to DC and get their movies going! And if they directed that first after credits scene props to them. That was quite the tease of the twins that will return in Age of Ultron. SCARLET WITCH! BRING JOE AND ANTHONY RUSSO BACK FOR CAP 3.<br/><br/>Overall, there are too many good things about this movie to count, nearly perfect. Almost as good as the Avengers and really puts the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a new place (good place I may add) for upcoming movies.<br/><br/>10/10"
"MatthewTodd1","9","3","6","31 March 2014"," Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Movie Review
","A stripped-down, more dogged entry in the ever-expanding crushing force that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Unwilling to rest on their laurels, Marvel with Captain America: The Winter Solider wisely swerves the increasingly flagging formulaic characteristics of the generic superhero blockbuster and explores more grown up, mature themes with its instilled political connotations of conspiracy, trusted intelligence agency infiltration and high-stakes espionage in a delectably self-assured way. The intimate close quarters, stealth driven combat scenes are akin to those of confident military actioners as opposed to Marvel's usual elaborate hulking action sequences; a refreshing deviation, although normal big-budget battling service is resumed in the latter parts of proceedings. Furthermore, new character introductions felt purposeful and detrimental to the plot and the antagonists served as believable threats not just role-fillers. Likewise, every twist was meaningful and intrinsically forced the audience to question the intentions and integrity of the characters we have come to know and invest in. With the past coming back to haunt Cap and his crew it really added weight to the ensuing events and now knowing history could come back to bite at anytime supplies food for thought to it's sister instalments still to come. Not knowing whom to trust, Capt. America felt like a real superhero in this movie, rather than just Steve Rogers, the superhuman that can run fast and jump high posing as the patriotic front of The Avengers.<br/><br/>Chris Evans reprising his role as the cryogenically preserved, genetically optimized and physically superior World War II veteran, Steve Rogers/Captain America, affords a much-improved performance from his previous outing in The Avengers where there was too much fish-out-of- water emphasis placed on the first Avengers escapades. Evans comes on leaps and bounds as Captain America, especially when his backs against a wall and when the proverbial fate of the innocent really does rest solely on his shoulders. His already established humanistic elements were joined by some welcomed larger-than-life superhero characteristics rendering him more viable and believable as a gallant heroic saviour rather than just an impressive mortal being; more Captain America than Steve Rogers, which was a noteworthy plus point. In addition, his scenes with the foreboding Winter Soldier played by a striking Sebastian Stan were some of shining high points of the movie. Also reprising her role and armed with considerable screen time, Scarlett Johansson as the expertly trained sultry S.H.I.E.L.D. spy Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff delivers a tantalizing performance with an air of vulnerability in her narrative bolstering Johansson's Black Widow portrayal. Samuel L. Jackson as the all-knowing S.H.I.E.L.D. director, Nick Fury is at his derisive best. Nonetheless, Robert Redford is responsible for the standout performance in The Winter Soldier. His shifty Alexander Pierce is marvellous, and Redford's skillful way of developing a consistent aura that he has an ulterior motive throughout the film is testament to him as an actor. Amongst other character renderings, the Introduction of ex-military paratrooper Sam Wilson/Falcon enacted by Anthony Mackie was fine, was not overplayed and the character fitted seamlessly into the plot.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is a markedly more sober and stark instalment when compared to its sister entries. Grounded on a solid premise, co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo take the niftily penned Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely script, and translate it onto the big screen as a strong, lean, grittily toned espionage action-thriller flick, chock-full of double-crosses together with political undertones and lofty ramifications worthy of interest. Apt character progression and expertly shot, mood-setting combat scenes served as the catalyst for success here. Also revealing the significance of past goings-on further validates the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole. Quite possibly the next best entry only to The Avengers itself, Captain America: The Winter Solider has loaded yet another genre front running bullet into the Marvel gun. They will persist to make boatloads of money despite themselves but when they can still find ways to continue to deliver fresh-feeling movies, nine instalments down the line, it only bodes well for the future of the franchise. Here's hoping Marvel continues to throw spanners in the works and vary the story arcs up from film to film as they have successfully done here with The Winter Solider."

Definitely a film of two halves, the first highlighting Captain America's insecurities, and finding his place within SHIELD as the plot twists and turns and the treachery unravels. The second half of the film is where all the cool action happens and it was some pretty good action too.

","I enjoyed the first Cap movie, even if critics didn't. However, I never expected this. <br/><br/>TWS is the serious CBM I wanted with comic book elements. It had it's great moments, comedic moments were great, not forced, and well placed. The chemistry between all the actors is great. I loved all the villains in this movie, which from Marvel, is saying something. Crossbones, TWS, Pierce, and even Batroc. All amazingly done.<br/><br/>Chris Evans does an amazing job in this movie, as do Scarlett Jo and the guy who plays Falcon (Anthony Mackie, I think his name is?). Anyways, I enjoyed all of it.<br/><br/>In phase 1, I hated SHIELD. It felt forced, annoying, and Coulson felt like he had a stick inside him. I'm glad SHIELD went down, but I'm even more happy about how much impact this had on the MCU. SHIELD is down, and HYDRA is out there. <br/><br/>I'd put this a little below The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight's themes, and its ability to make almost every scene controversial barely beat out TWS, which had great fight scenes (better than Daredevil, it felt like a kicking contest) and beautiful chemistry. Can't wait to see something like this again."

I watched Winter Soldier because i love Scarlett Johannson and wanted to see more of Black Widow but after watching, i am now very much intrigued by the Captain America storyline. The action was much better, the story was still good and developed as expected for a sequel and there were even some surprises to keep you drawn in just a little bit more. <br/><br/>Overall i find Captain America: The Winter Solider a great movie and i am glad i took the time to give Captain America a chance...not that Chris Evans was hard to look at in the first movie. The sequel is a bigger thrill ride with a few loops along the way so be patient after the first movie and watch Winter Soldier."
"Robert_duder","8","3","7","20 April 2014"," Marvel continues to create a world so depthy they may not like hitting bottom
","My title might sound ambiguous as to whether I enjoyed this film or not well let me assure you that I did. I have such a great amount of respect for Marvel/Disney and what they've done with this Superhero Universe. It is so diverse and instead of bottoming out with each film they release they seem to continue to set the bar and open up new avenues in this world. Captain America: Winter Soldier serves to do exactly that...add layers and layers to the Avengers world. This is both its success and its curse. At times Captain America: Winter Soldier feels like an epilogue unlike Thor 2 which stood firmly on its own two feet. It does attempt to create its own story while making sure to fast track the Avengers storyline but even the main story is really just more for The Avengers to cover in Age of Ultron. This isn't a bad thing, it just means that Captain America: Winter Soldier doesn't stand out very well on its own. There is a myriad of terrific action scenes, apparently done with minimal CGI and I LOVE that!! The hand to hand combat scenes are plentiful and really well choreographed. Then there is a ton of story development, thrills and twists and turns (some are a little obvious I think) but the comparisons to the spy/thriller genre are apparent. This, again, is both its curse and success. Sometimes it felt like it dragged just a little bit and when you go into Captain America you aren't necessarily prepared to see a thriller with a lot of story. Its all very well done, please don't get me wrong, it just is a little off-putting after seeing the non-stop thrill ride that was Thor 2.<br/><br/>I have always liked Chris Evans but I wasn't he would make the right Captain America. I was completely wrong and he proves it again for a third go around. He embodies the innocence and morality and yet is tough as nails as a soldier. Evans actually gets to demonstrate a lot of depth for an action hero and he does so well. He is perfect in the role and it would be hard for anyone to take that role from him. Scarlett Johansson returns as everyone's favourite gorgeous Russian spy. Johansson really gets a significant role for the first time is basically a co-star to the story. Her chemistry with Evans is near perfect and their potential romance is well dealt with without getting in the way. I was never sure I was a huge fan of Black Widow in these films but she really won me over in this. The supporting cast in this film was what really won me over. There were some truly great characters and performances. Of course you have Samuel L. Jackson playing a significant role as Nick Fury and he's good in the role but man are we finally being over saturated with Jackson? He does so much and his twist in the film I could have seen from a mile away. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce is a subtle performance and he does seem to be showing his age but this guy is Hollywood royalty in my books and he instantly adds to any scene he is in and he fits the cast very well. Anthony Mackie is a great addition to the cast if not slightly underused but I would hazard to guess they are establishing a character for future films. Same for Emily VanCamp who has a good role and I love her as an actress but she is underdeveloped in this film but establishes her for future films. In my opinion the films biggest flaw is its villain. The entire concept of this movie should be ""The Winter Soldier"" played by Sebastian Stan. His origin is not really a surprise but they do their best to make it seem that way. Stan is a decent villain with some good scenes but just when he's getting his bad-ass vibe in check he vanishes and you're left feeling underwhelmed by the villain. It plays into the fact that Captain America: Winter Soldier is more of a bridge between Avengers films than its own entity.<br/><br/>I'm more than surprised that Marvel and/or Disney turned to the Russo brothers for direction. I don't mean to imply they did a bad job, this is a very good movie but the Marvel bar is so high with Iron Man 1 and 2, The Avengers and Thor 2 (I left out Iron Man 3 because it, like this, felt just a little underwhelming.) Anything less than a 9 to me has to be dissected when it comes to Marvel films. The Russo brothers have a long history of experience in Television and when you're making a film like this it needs to be self-contained while still propelling the Marvel Universe. All that aside you won't be disappointed. The film absolutely has a different vibe which they were aiming for and they throw around ""70's thriller"" a lot and I can see that homage to it and bravo to them for that. It properly captures Captain America and what he stands for. Everyone is raving and it will make a ton of money and for good reason. It isn't perfect nor is it high on the list of what they've produced thus far but it is a great start to the blockbuster season and a fun time at the movies. 8/10"
"toqtaqiya2","8","3","7","19 April 2014"," A superior sequel that, at the very least, stands shoulder-to-shoulder with its whizbang predecessor.
","The Winter Soldier is another solid entry in Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's just as good and, in my opinion, even better than The First Avenger (2011). It's become the norm now that Marvel Studios films are some of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year. All of them have been good. Some people who've seen the film in the theaters have said that The Winter Soldier is the best of the bunch. I think that The Avengers (2012) remains the best Marvel film so far, though The Winter Soldier comes close. One often remembers the exciting action scenes when praising this film. There's a number of action scenes, and all of them are quite memorable. The neat thing about them is that they're as realistic as possible. In my view the film is simply a technological thriller that's meant to be both modern and realistic. Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo gave this sequel a hi-tech sheen that's different from the steampunk visual approach of Joe Johnston for The First Avenger. The realism is largely due to Captain America himself and his comic book stories. He doesn't possess spectacular powers like the other avengers, so screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely constructed a plot that rotates around politics and characters. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow has her biggest role yet in this film and so does Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury. Actually, the entire film is about S.H.I.E.L.D. and what happens to it. Chris Evans' Steve Rogers plays an important part in what's going on, but it's still only a part. When it comes to Rogers it's mostly the continuation of his adjustment to the modern world. This, however, isn't really interesting because there's not much to it. It is the focus of the film's humor however. Unlike Iron Man 3 (2013) and Thor: The Dark World (2013), The Winter Soldier contains little comedy. It suffers as a result because the political intrigue is, for the most part, not that interesting (at least for me) for a summer blockbuster. Still, thanks to Robert Redford playing the part of Alexander Pierce, this is made bearable. Rogers goes through a believable struggle in the course of the film, and Evans manages to appear vulnerable despite Rogers' strength and skills. The introductions of Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier and Anthony Mackie as Falcon are exciting bits that reinforce the film's themes of trust and friendship. Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014) and Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015) will follow The Winter Soldier, yet it already feels like plenty has happened in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This film is a fairly impressive feat. I can argue that the action and the characterization can be improved, but it's still a smart balance of story and action. Like the big majority of blockbusters of recent years it follows the movie formula of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). I also noticed parts of it that are influenced by Come And See (1985), which is one of my favorite films. The Winter Soldier already earned a lot of money at the box office. I'd recommend it but you've probably already seen it."
"rocky-m","7","3","7","15 April 2014"," Missed opportunity
","Compared to other MCU movies this one feels a bit bland and emotionless. While I liked the characters themselves, on their own, their interaction leaves a lot to be desired. Only sometimes it feels that some characters have real chemistry between them and I would say that uneasy romance between Scarlett's and Chris' characters - Black Widow and C'pt America was one of the rare examples of that - which I find surprising considering how the Black Widow was one-dimensional in previous movies. From the emotional stand point Chris Evans did not have much what he could do.<br/><br/>The main emotional stand-off should have been the one between Captain America and The Winter Soldier, but as it turned out eventually, they only exchanged few lines of the dialog and many, many more punches. On the good side of things, the pacing is really good, the action is enjoyable, but still - this feels like and forgettable experience, which is kind of shame considering the talent and the possibilities of the cast."
"jadepietro","6","3","7","13 April 2014"," Captain Crunch
","This film is mildly recommended. <br/><br/>Wham! Bam! Pow! Like a Lichtenstein print, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is standard pop entertainment. This sequel unwisely underplays the standard fish-out-of- water scenario that gave its first installment some distinction and comic flair. In this version, humor is scant and the story is still rather predictably bland, but as for superhero thrills and action sequences, those are in abundance. The film may be slightly improved in its second go-round due to some strong CGI and well staged set pieces, but whenever the action lulls, so does its enjoyment. ￼ <br/><br/>The wobbly plot goes something like this: Our hero, Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America must again fight the forces of evil, this time in the form of a Soviet assassin named the Winter Soldier. There is treachery and disloyalty within the SHIELD agency that can compromise national security as Captain America tries to unravel the mystery and save the day.<br/><br/>￼I have to confess most of the Marvel comic book heroes are usually a boring lot, but the franchise certainly knows how to cast its actors in those coveted roles: Robert Downey, Jr. as Ironman, High Jackman as Wolverine, Andrew Garfield as Spiderman, and Chris Evans in this titled role. Evans more than looks the part, especially out of his costume, and the actor brings to his part a sweet charm and quiet strength. His interplay with his co-star, Scarlett Johansson, as Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow, make the film and its characters all the more interesting. Samuel L. Jackson, Anthony Mackie, and Sebastian Stan are fine in their colorful supporting roles, and it is an added pleasure seeing Robert Redford chewing up the scenery in his pivotal role.<br/><br/>￼But the film's plot lacks cohesiveness. It continually tries to explain itself and the characters' actions in clunky dialog and heavy-handed exposition in between all the crash-and-boom, shoot-em-up scenes. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo certainly know how to stage the film's many action shots. Along with the strong visual effects, the stunt-work is top notch and extremely well choreographed. But the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely disappoints. Characters are in need of more depth and the plot mechanics never flow or connect with the action. <br/><br/>￼Captain America: The Winter Soldier abruptly stops and starts. The film clumsily lurches from one scene to the next. One can readily say that the film's pacing stops on a quarter. This comic book superhero movie takes itself way too seriously and should have used its super powers to have a lot more fun with its source. Captain America: The Winter Soldier just left me a tad cold. GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","When I walked into the theater to see this movie, I had no idea of what to expect. But what I was treated to was a very strange plot involving a new world order and something called Hydra. This movie started off with a very strange scene involving Captain America jumping out of an airplane with no parachute. This movie had a decent cast but each actor essentially played themselves. Robert Redford was very miscast in this mess of a movie. They didn't let the winter soldier have enough screen time and they certainly didn't ask for that. What happened is that the Winter Soldier was never fully explained and he never really spoke. He said a line or two in what sounded like Russian and then a few other lines. I was very disappointed in Samuel L Jackson's lackluster performance as Nick Fury. He was also very irritating when they brought out the character he once played in that movie called Pulp Fiction. Did this movie have a beginning, middle and end? I would not call the END a true ending. Also, I am getting sick and tired of Stan Lee's cameos. The special effects are over the top in this movie to the point of making me sick. The CG effects are all very OBVIOUS. I was not happy with the way just about everything was CG. And what's the deal with Nick Fury in that car chase? He could have done better in that chase but he didn't."

","Well. Everyone knows that Marvel just keeps getting more+more confident with each outing, growing, as it were, and expecting the audiences to keep up, albeit in a friendly, safe manner. This will make big bucks, and is a worthy addition to the franchise that spawns 'Avengers' as well. <br/><br/>The action sequences are great, and are very engrossing. Almost hypnotically so. It was not the same in the first part. This one has more of an 'Avengers' feel to the action, esp. with all the intensity inherent. Joss Whedon has done something right, by inspiring the rest to follow suit, the way it should be.<br/><br/>They said its mostly actual action and stunt work, with as minimal CGI as possible, and I believe that. That's what augments most of the action sequences and makes them as intense as they are. The Falcon's a welcome addition to the team, and acquits himself well, with Mackie bringing his brand of charm to the role.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the best example of a movie where converted 3D looks absolutely fantastic, and enhances the movie-going experience. I still am a fan of movie being shot in native 3D, but hell, this one comes close.<br/><br/>The Easter eggs were great, though too few and far between. Do stay for the end of both the main credits as well as all credits. The main credit payoff is...interesting. <br/><br/>I do have grouses though, and this is a big, big realm for some major spoilers, so beware: The point of bring a character back from the dead has never seemed this dull. No arc, no twist, and no payoff. The one who does have a major arc is Cap, and everything else seemed shoehorned in around him, not necessarily a bad thing. Hawkeye is majorly conspicuous by his absence. They should have cast a different actor if Renner didn't wanna do it. <br/><br/>I do wonder how this ties in to the TV show that's ongoing. A major character in there, resurrected, is conspicuous by his/her complete absence. Another aspect I wanna call bullshit on.<br/><br/>The bad guys are not evil enough, or menacing enough, and all the talk about 70s crime thriller feel to this is just that, talk. Redford brings his usual gravitas to his role, but he's done far, far better. A lot of the plot that happens in the first hour doesn't stand up to the usual critical autopsy one does after watching something popular, and that's disappointing, because this could've been truly great.<br/><br/>Gonna watch it on IMAX tomorrow, and I'm lookin' fwd to it."
"Clockwork-Avacado","9","3","7","28 March 2014"," ""The Twenty-First Century is a digital book, and HYDRA has learned how to read it""
","In that dark limbo between ""The Avengers"" and ""The Avengers 2"", known tentatively as ""Phase two"" of the MCU, the bar has been consistently lowered. It's safe to say that, as a Marvel fan, both Iron Man 3, and Thor 2 were unadulterated garbage, of the most cynical, mindless, crowd-pleasing nature. The Avengers was good, but not great. It was fun. It was silly It was kind of cool, because it was something that had never been done before, as well as having Joss Whedon onboard, who helped it from plunging it the depths of mainstream, American trash, like the Iron Man trilogy. But now, just as we were prepared to consign MArvel films to the doldrums of consumerist mass production, along comes a hero. A real hero. Because basically, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is the first great Marvel film ever made, the only one to stand up to any scrutiny, the only one with an intelligent plot, which emphasises character, storyline and intrigue, rather than one-liner after one-liner, rubbish CGI action scene after rubbish CGI action scene. And, most importantly of all, it's a film which has a lot of balls, which, coming from a corporate giant like Marvel, makes it especially remarkable.<br/><br/>""The Winter Soldier"" is not a typical Marvel movie by any means, and that is the highest praise that you can give it. Oh sure, it surrenders to a couple of gung-ho action scenes, car chases and shoot-outs, but generally, these are in pursuit of the plot, not as a means of defining it. Things happen for a reason, even if they do happen a little too frequently. But don't despair. Seeing this film, was like a godsend. It made me realise just how genuinely sub-standard every previous effort from Marvel has been. This feels like the first great film they've ever done. It's an adult, intelligent, respectable film, which also has some of the most purely exciting action scenes of the last few decades, fuelled by a tense score, and capable direction. (Although, it does descend into shaky-cam a bit: Think ""Arrow""'s fight scenes on a larger budget, and with a more heightened, super power level. ) Basically, it's Captain America's humanity which makes this film such a hit, both in terms of personality, and in the level of his fight scenes. He's not a CGI-powered God, or a flashy narcissist in a tin suit: He's a super soldier, and, for once, he actually seems it. The opening action scene, a hostage rescue mission on board a ship (brief appearance from a real world version of Cap foe, Batroc), is one of the best things in years, where super-heroics have never looked quite so super, and fight scenes have never been shown in such great detail. No CGI here.<br/><br/>The plot itself, is reminiscent - as the directors have often said - of a 70s espionage thriller, mainly ""Three Days of The Condor"", with SHIELD being compromised, and political power plays going on, which cover up one of the most chilling villain schemes in years. It may still be a little simplistic, but for once, we have a threat which does not feel stupid and cartoonish: Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce is a screen-stealing political villain, and it's a credit to Chris Evans assured, quiet charm and confidence, that he can hold his own in a scene with this cinematic legend. For once, Sam Jackson's Nick Fury is relevant, and well used, not just a cool guy in a leather jacket. One of the best things, is that this movie takes all the pieces already on the board, and crafts a brilliant piece of work that is dynamic, thought-provoking and rewarding. Has Marvel started making movies for grown-ups for a change? I will say, though, that if you thought Anne Hathaway was out of place in TDKR, then you'll probably hate Scarlett Johanssen in this. Her character's sarcastic brand of humour, and inability to gel with the seriousness of the plot in 80% of her scenes does rather take away from things. I'd have definitely cut a few of these quips out, but then, maybe Marvel just wasn't ready to go totally cold turkey yet.<br/><br/>Is this the shape of things to come? I doubt it. ""The winter soldier"" is fantastic entertainment, but on a far less ephemeral nature than most super hero films. It's not afraid to highlight the evils of America, of our society today, and of what we're becoming. It dares to have a message to put across, and, hopefully, it will not be absorbed by the (admittedly very proficient) action scenes. Do not expect all Marvel films to be this good, because they never, ever will be. Just savour this gem, far and away, the best film ever made of a Marvel character. You will feel everything you used to feel when you were younger, and enjoyed superheroes because of their blend of action packed heroics - and, like a lot of comic character these days, Cap is unashamedly heroic; an idealist without any shades of grey, worthy of the original Superman - but also, you'll feel that, as an adult, the sheer joy of seeing a super character standing up to the evil and corruption; A crusader for the rights of humanity, finally striking out where he needs to be striking. So, if you've ever felt that Marvel has turned out a stream of rubbish, yet you 've always wished for one decent, grown up movie, then look no farther. Captain America, has saved the Marvel Cinematic Universe"

","I do not know what it is about films in the Marvel franchise, but more than often, they can manage to exceed our already high expectations of their films. Just when you thought that ""The Avengers"" was already a pinnacle of superhero action film perfection, along comes another one that challenges that position.<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is more than just an excellent action-packed superhero film. Aside from those big fist fights, gun fights, car chases, it also has piracy on the high seas and gigantic aircraft of mass destruction to add to the mayhem. All of these action scenes were executed perfectly - the stunts, the CG effects, the editing, the set-ups -- no loose ends. Those who found the sound levels of ""The Avengers"" too much would find the quality of sound here just right. The directors Anthony and Joe hit all the right notes in their execution of a complex film. We do not feel the two-hour plus running time pass us by.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely was able to smoothly tell us about the Cap and the people he loved, along with the history of SHIELD, the history of HYDRA, the history of Black Widow, the history of the Falcon, all on top of a solid politically-charged thriller of a main story. Again, all these multi-layered details were all tucked in neatly, with no significant plot holes to ponder. <br/><br/>Chris Evans gets more and more comfortable in playing this good-natured All-American hero. His physical aptitude is of no question in all those high-energy action scenes. More than just his chiseled face and physique though, he also proves he has the acting chops for those unexpectedly emotional dramatic scenes in the film. There was a charming one set in a museum, and another one in a hospital bedside, featuring a surprise guest cameo.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is bad-ass and kick-ass as the Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff. She had a lot more complex stunts to do here over those that wowed us in The Avengers. We also get to know Natasha a little better - - her background, her work ethic, her skills -- but just enough to whet our interest even more about her mysterious character.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson reprises his recurrent role as Nick Fury. Again we get to see Nick Fury more in action here as ever. There was a particularly exciting sequence where Nick's car was ambushed in the middle of city traffic that was jaw-dropping in its execution.<br/><br/>It was really good to see Robert Redford back in a big role in a mainstream film. He plays Secretary Alexander Price who oversaw SHIELD for the US government, the man who picked Nick Fury to head SHIELD. Redford still had that cool and collected touch of class that made him a big box-office star in the early 1970s.<br/><br/>There will be new characters introduced. Anthony Mackie gets to be introduced as ex-soldier Sam Wilson, who will later don those awesome metal wings as Falcon. The beautiful Emily VanCamp is first introduced to us as Steve's next door neighbor, the shy nurse Sharon Carter, but she will also have surprises up her sleeve later. <br/><br/>I am not really sure if there is still any surprise about the identity of The Winter Soldier, but I will just leave that for you to find out when you watch this film. You should really do so."
"blackwidowis7cool","10","2","4","10 November 2019"," My top fav MCU movie that I've seen so far
","As the title of this review states (if the rating I gave it wasn't hint enough) I absolutely adore this addition to the MCU. Perfectly cast, top-notch acting and stellar script, The Winter Soldier takes the series a whole new direction. It is filled with intrigue and nothing is as it seems. There are so many twists and turns and to quote Rotten Tomato critics it's ""politically astute"". Awesome, awesome movie. Captain America is now my top favourite Avenger alongside Black Widow.
It's quite brutal and violent, but not overly graphic. It's themes are entertaining and the emotions hit hard, which along earns this movie a high rating.
I can't stress it enough - if you haven't yet seen this Marvel movie, then sit down and watch it!!! You won't regret it"

They knew what they were doing when they casted Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes because he's phenomenal as The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>He doesn't even speak a full 2 sentences in the entire movie and yet, he's the one that makes this movie work. His eyes are hauntingly beautiful and the way he carries himself as the the programmed Winter Soldier who is at war with the man who was Steve Roger's best friend, Bucky Barnes is nothing short of an Oscar nomination. He's one of the best actors in the industry right now.<br/><br/>I rewatch this movie once every few months because it really is THAT good."

The super-duo, the rising heroine, Emily VanCamp, and their cast of protagonists won with surprisingly little fire power. Ninja like moves from these Avengers adequately compensated for the arsenal of the heavily armed corruption infecting SHIELD. This world's most powerful defense faced falling to the irony of betrayal and the genocide of millions.

","I'm not a huge comic book movie fan, but I have liked the past few comic book movies I've seen (Deadpool, Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy...), and I just so happened to find yet another one that I like. Personally, I'm getting ready for Civil War next month by watching The Winter Soldier, and if the next Captain American movie is as good as this one, there's nothing to worry about. In The Winter Soldier, Steve Rodgers is trying to adjust to the modern world until a conspiracy involving SHIELD comes to light, but Cap also has to team up with Black Widow to battle another threat: The Winter Soldier. To me, Captain America has always been the most interesting Avenger because of how he was forced to leave behind his old life and friends, especially his old lover Peggy Carter, and adjust to life in the 21st century. It allows him to be more than just a roided-up superhero with a cool shield, and his struggle with readjustment is explored well in this movie. He also has to deal with a myriad of other significant issues like SHIELD and the Winter Soldier. The political conspiracy plot in particular adds a lot of suspense and twists to the story to make it consistently thrilling while the Winter Soldier provides a lot of great action sequences. His character is mysterious throughout the film, and he's definitely one of the better Marvel movie villains. Captain America: The Winter Soldier should certainly please even the most casual comic book movie viewer with its intense action, great plot and witty writing. I think I might need to binge watch all the MCU movies before Infinity War comes out next year."

"pete-man-u","10","2","4","23 April 2014"," The Winter Soldier story,action,character and overall Review
","The marvel universe phase 2, saving the best for last<br/><br/>Captain America the winter solder this is caps first solo movie where he is alone in modern times. I was looking forward to seeing Cap in our time, I wanted to see how Cap deals with modern times doing his thing and how being alone would effect him. Taking place After the avengers, Cap is now working with S.H.I.E.L.D, and that is a big part of the movie. This is the guy they send in to deal with the REAL bad guys.<br/><br/>The opening part of the movie, CAPs on a mission leading a small crew of soldiers. We see him running and jumping taking out bad guys, and I'm thinking this guy is a bad-ass. he is throwing that shield in impossible ways, watching the shield bounce around the room and always back to Caps hand. But its so cool to see. you don't think of it, that this is impossible, you won't try break it apart and nitpick it. You just think, I want that shield. It's heavily used in this movie and Its amazing to watch. This is one of the coolest weapons in the Marvel universe movies. He has lost everything after being frozen, he is trying to catch up in modern times, and adapting to this new world. We see Cap and S.H.I.E.L.D how they really have conflicting ideologies, with how things should be done and with secrets and hidden agendas. And its great to see how Captain America deals with S.H.I.E.L.D on it, and seeing Captain Americas personality and it's what makes this movie so great. There is so much in this movie that makes it so great. Falcon makes his appearance in this movie, he is a military guy to, and is great seeing him and Cap bond and watch him become Caps first friend in modern time. Falcon played by Anthony Mackie has some big parts in the movie as a friend and in battle, and with every scene being enjoyable to watch. The Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson, makes her appearance after her stint with Iron Man and the Avengers, we get to see a lot more of The Black Widow then we have in any of the other Marvel movies. And she holds every scene well, and in battle she can hold her own. There is so much to this character and seeing her with more screen time I can see her in her own Marvel movie. The Winter Soldier makes his appearance at random points throughout the movie, his screen time is more limited. As the movie is played out we see, He is part of the picture but not the bigger picture, I don't think it was warranted to name the movie after him but I think they went with it because it sounded cool.<br/><br/>The story is great, we can relate to it more in real life then any of the other Marvel movies. We see plot twists, and cover ups and government leaks. after the Edward Snowden leaks The Winter Soldier story of cover ups and secrets felt more real. I like how they played on the past and cults and tied everything together. The story worked so well and every second is enjoyable to watch. I couldn't find anything negative. You do have to watch The First Avenger to understand some parts of the movie, there are some flash backs here and there to help new people to the Captain America world, plus the flashbacks also serves to show what the character is going through and feeling.<br/><br/>We get to see S.H.I.E.L.D agents who where in the Avengers movie, they carry on there acting styles from what they did in the Avengers<br/><br/>Finally a true Captain America movie. This is Cap from the comics. He is fast, he is strong, a super soldier and they show this off throughout every battle. The first avenger we saw small parts of Cap in action and other parts in cut scenes. In the Avengers movie, Cap had a back seat, next to Iron Man, The Hulk and Thor. I felt Hulk, Thor and Iron Man where team A and Captain America, Black Widow and hawkeye where the weaker B team. I felt Caps ability wasn't utilized correctly. It is great to finally see the real Cap, able to take punishment nonstop, able to jump down from up high and land without needing a parachute, watching him run through office walls or doors with easy truly made me feel I was watching the real Cap. His agility and speed and movement was so cool to watch and felt right. In the Avengers movie Cap and Iron Man threaten to fight, I was thinking, Cap would easily lose. Now I'm thinking Captain America would hold his own and could win that battle, me giving it a 55 45% on who would win. Chris Evans is Captain America I couldn't see anyone else playing him after this movie.<br/><br/>This is one of the best Marvel movies right up there with Iron Man and the Avengers. If not my favorite superhero movie ever made, and I can't wait to watch this again. Those who don't really like Captain America I recommend you see this movie it is really that good. I give this movie a must see and must own when it is finally released to buy"

","This was an action film that delivered on ""all"" levels. We also got an even closer look at the main characters (namely Steve Rogers, and Nick Fury). The action and fight sequences were even more breath-taking than those of both the first Capt.

Mackie looked well suited for the role, and put in a great performance as an authentic action hero.<br/><br/>This film was well written, well designed, well directed, and well executed. It's amazing to see how far Marvel Studios have gone from where they started as a small film company. It's also quite obvious that with great writing, casting, and great directorship a small film company can compete and out shine many of the major entities.<br/><br/>The story line of the film is one that not only connected to the first movie, but also effectively introduced new extensions which should lead to a 3rd edition as well.<br/><br/>Captain America II is a story of patriotism, honor, sacrifice, and friendship.

I liked the repartee between Chris Evans and Scarlet Johansson. She delivers a lot of her lines almost with a knowing wink. But there's a genuine relationship between Cap and Falcon (someone who's introduced as an actual fleshed-out character). And I do love that this is a '70s political thriller masquerading as a comic book movie. Secrets govern everything, D.C. is choked up with sleeper agents and the mistrust runs deep.<br/><br/>As a sequel, it's self-assured and a great Captain America story. And with another Avengers movie on the horizon, it's not a glorified commercial, which is saying something.<br/><br/>7/10"

"sohansurag","8","2","4","18 April 2014"," You can't give this a miss!
","It has been 6 years since Iron Man hit the screens and since then Marvel Studios has been building one of the richest universes in movie history. The movies are well planned and the characters gets processed through their cycles, from cameos to full fledged roles in succeeding movies. It has worked out well for them as well as the audiences as there was not one movie unworthy of mention. They've also made it so that its impossible to skip one movie outta the franchise. While some of the standalone movies did have its flaws it was could be easily overlooked as it contributed to the Phase One finale, The Avengers. While I wasn't a huge fan of Captain America The First Avenger, I still thought it was a well made movie having done the origins story right. Obviously second to Iron Man and a notch above Thor, Captain America being set in the early 40s told the story of Steve Rogers, a petite kid to came to be the first Avenger, Captain America.<br/><br/>Marvel had been churning out good to mediocre standalone movies for its Phase 2, be it Iron Man 3 or Thor The Dark World, it could never be considered something as brilliant as its prequels and almost felt like it was made just for the sake of it. But Captain America The Winter Soldier is by far the best standalone Marvel movie and it has definitely upped the ante. It promises a ton of action, a brilliant script and a wonderful sense of humor. Greeted to a well choreographed, action packed hostage rescue mission set on a ship, Captain America The Winter Soldier never misses a beat. Steve Rogers, himself is done with the fish outta water sequences and trying earnestly to keep up with a world 95 years from his time. He definitely misses the world he was in and it was evident from his frequent visits to the Smithsonian museum reliving his 107th Battalion days. There was this particular sequence with Peggy Carter which was a tearjerker.<br/><br/>Captain America The Winter Soldier takes on a political thriller approach and it works so well that it carves a niche of its own in the Marvel Universe ""Good luck topping that Marvel!"" The stakes are definitely high this time and the Cap is on a run, with everything including SHIELD turned against him. Exhilarating could be an understatement. The plot's got some smart twists to offer and it never goes OTT.<br/><br/>Chris Evans has come far from his Not Another Teen Movie days and he plays Steve Rogers/Captain America with utmost sincerity, flair and a calm demeanor that it brings a quality of an unruffled leader. While he was good as the Human Torch infusing enough comedy in the role, it seems the Captain America suit best befitted him. Scarlett Johansson still livens up the screen with more than just her raw sex appeal and makes me want a standalone Black Widow movie than ever. Cap and Natasha makes for a splendid duo bringing out a chemistry we've rarely seen in the previous Marvel movies. Nick Fury played by Samuel L Jackson, need I say more? Its impossible to think of another actor in Nick's shoes the same way I can't imagine anybody other than Robert Downey Jr playing Tony Stark. Another good mention would be Anthony Mackie playing Sam Wilson aka Falcon and he does the job well. Amazing, Ace, Terrific are some of the words that rhymes with Robert Redford. I love Robert Redford from his Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid days and ever since I've been an ardent fan. Even in his 70s he packs the same flamboyance, the same charisma thats just unsurpassable and he carries the same here as Alexander Pierce, a senior member of SHIELD who had recruit Nick Fury into SHIELD.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier, whose identity I shall not reveal here, makes for a compelling antagonist and you would be wrong if you thought the movie's all about Cap going head to head with him. But when it does, its just epic. The Winter Soldier is plain relentless in beating Cap and you can feel Cap's will and strength crumbling in each of the encounters. A lot of additions has been made to the cast including Frank Grillo and Emily VanCamp and I am definitely sure that the characters introduced in this movie will grow onto the next marvel movie. Makes me think of amazing planning and coordination that went into the movie. Agent coulson, though, was sorely missed.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier's score composed by Henry Jackman would live upto his own compositions for X-Men First Class or Kick-Ass 2. Taking a Stand, Time To Suit Up and The Winter Soldier are some of the remarkable tracks that stands out from the OST assured to give you goosebumps. To top it all off Marvin Gaye's Trouble Man made me smile.<br/><br/>The twist was something that hit hard and will create some major ripples in the Marvel movies. Thats what makes it tick, the events from Captain America The Winter Soldier will have its repercussions on upcoming movies as well and who knows what'll happen to Agents of SHIELD. Words just fail me to express how awesome Captain America The Winter Soldier turned out to be, I went in to watch another mediocre Marvel standalone movie and I was blown out of my wits. Yes it's slightly less grander than The Avengers but while The Avengers had a bunch of superheroes working together and Captain America The Winter Soldier had just one keeping you on the edge of your seats. Its a must watch for any Marvel fan and could be considered the smartest Marvel movie till date.<br/><br/>And lastly do I even need to mention ""Shawarma""? Wait for the credit rolls and I promise it'll be worth your time."
"kunalkhandwala","9","2","4","18 April 2014"," Cap faces several enemies in this exciting political thriller
","Marvel is clearly shifting its gears to make each installment of its superhero fare darker, grittier and even contemporary. After the mediocrity of Captain America: First Avenger, our 95 year old super soldier must now face several challenges and rise as a truly capable hero whose superpower isn't just his shield but his dedication to good and of course, his enhanced physical prowess. Television directors Joe and Anthony Russo (Arrested Development, Community) bring a lot more action, cheekiness and character depth to convert even the Marvel fan into its worshipper. We see a lot more of our beloved characters through various challenges that unfold in seamless commonality with profound implications on the future. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is easily the studio's biggest production second only to The Avengers with an elaborate plot that connects the Cap's WWII history, today's security issues and a subtle lead up to the next Avengers. <br/><br/>Two years since the battle of New York, a nostalgic Steve Rogers looks back at his regrets and losses and at the same time, makes sincere attempts to catch up with American pop-culture of the past decades that he has missed. Now, as Captain America, his mission is to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D vessel from pirates along with the very attractive and capable Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) who retrieves secretive data onto a flash drive as the Cap battled the mercenaries on deck. Upon their return to the Triskelion, director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) introduces the Cap to 'Project Insight', the agency's big public surveillance plan which involves fully weaponized Helicarriers that can preemptively eliminate threats while they monitor every human on the planet. But Fury's inability to decrypt the retrieved drive makes him suspicious of the project's real intent. After evading an engaging assault on him involving a car chase, Fury is shot by a new mercenary from whose clutches he had narrowly escaped. In his last minutes, the director had warned Captain to not trust anyone in S.H.I.E.L.D. After an immediate pursuit of the assailant, Cap loses track of this ghostly villain whom Natasha knows as The Winter Soldier. Scientifically enhanced powers enable him to match Cap's abilities and his true identity will draw demons out of Cap's past. Unable to cooperate with S.H.I.E.L.D., Cap is now branded a fugitive by Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) and is being hunted by the very agency that revived him. But an even bigger threat for the Cap is the level at which S.H.I.E.L.D has been compromised with a terror organization that he knows only too well. Thus, the Project Insight now has devastating implications in the wrong hands and Cap will need the help from agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) to prevent the Helicarriers from taking flight and targeting millions of innocent lives. <br/><br/>The lines of good and evil that the Captain once knew are now blurry and will soon disappear completely. In all this, the action is a combination of raw force from our hero, who uses his exceptional physical capability and fluid choreography, that enhances the effect by making it realistic. Action merely supports the elaborate storyline and not the other way around. Every sub-plot has a thrilling action sequence starting with the hostage rescue, Fury's furious car chase, the heroic combat in the Triskelion elevator, Falcon's aerial dog fight against S.H.I.E.L.D machinery and the epic explosions along the Potomac river. The 'Cobra' type infiltration is delightfully evil within the agency and its connectivity even impacts the 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' <br/><br/>All the excitement and intrigue can be attributed to the exemplary screenplay by Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely who co-wrote the Narnia movies and more recently, 'Thor: The Dark World'. The story behaves as a grown-up political conspiracy thriller and also lends suspense, twists and character insights that make the Marvel world even more interesting. Chris Evans overcomes any shortfall and showcases better physical might to prove that he is more than a shield. He has convincingly established himself as the most capable leader of the Avengers with this installment. The stunning Scarlett Johansson gets more screen time than all her Black Widow appearances put together. Her cheekiness is well balanced with her serious kick-ass ability to fight and she establishes herself as a worthy Avenger. Samuel L. Jackson too enjoys more screen time and has some fun action sequences as well. Robert Redford plays the wrong man in the top league brilliantly while Anthony Mackie as Falcon proves to be the Cap's comic aide who can stand his ground when needed. The gorgeous Cobie Smulders gets elevated in the ranks of what remains in S.H.I.E.L.D and we sure hope to see more of her in future Marvel films. Stan Lee's cameo is hilarious.<br/><br/>The Russo brothers have adroitly pulled off an ambitious project that will propel the Captain America franchise to the successes of Ironman and Thor. Chris Evans has proved that he is a capable superhero and with such a contemporary take on infiltration by evil forces, he can leave the battling of Asgardian forces and comic book villains to his fellow Avengers. This soldier will not let decision makers trade in freedom for security and it is this righteous principle that makes him a super soldier. He is more than the serum that made him. He is more than his invincible shield. He is now more than just an Avenger. <br/><br/><ul><li>9.223 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","The Marvel Cinematic universe prides itself on the fact that none of the movies in the cannon are 'bad' movies. I have liked quite a few, but the only ones I would put above OK are The Avengers, Iron Man 1, and Captain America 1. The Winter Solider is the first sequel in the cannon that does what a sequel should do: Do not make the same movie again, but up the stakes and the ante. <br/><br/>The movie uses its new characters and plot ideas in great different places. The Winter Solider is an amazing new addition to the series and he gets just as much screen time as he needs to not be overbearing. This is not to say that the old characters are not used to the fullest. Captain America is still amazingly acted by Chris Evans who just fits and Black Widow is still an awesome character. Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson you feel cool just watching him. Robert Redford is a new addition here and he just plays Robert Redford, which is not a bad thing. Still good. <br/><br/>That's pretty much all I can say without giving away any spoilers, so there you go. If you liked the other films in the cannon, you'll love this. One of the better ones in the cannon."

","In my opinion, too many films are described as 'action packed'. I think a good action film has to have action scenes (duh!), a bit of mystery so the viewer is holding onto something, tense scenes where we are left to think about the events and consume what information we are being given now, and something cool, whatever it is, that makes the character or person (or laboratory experiment!) appeal to the viewer.<br/><br/>This film has exactly that. The portrayal of Captain America, which was done perfectly by Chris Evans, is brilliant. The good in him is exemplified in this film because of his plans for Shield.... and from what we are told he believes in, which is doing the right thing. Undoubtedly, he is cool. His shield, we know, is very cool, but I thought he was a lot more acrobatic and doing cool flips and turns in this film compared to in the Avengers where he was more like a soldier. On top of that, the Falcons wicked gear is a very neat addition to the film which was presented by Anthony Mackie very well.<br/><br/>What made the movie stand out was the mysterious twists and turn until the last frame of the film which kept me at the edge of my seat. Also, the way the viewers were hooked to the film but we were also fed important information (into the Black Widow's and Nick Fury's characters) was on the dot. The character of the Black Widow was ambiguous yet I wasn't bored or anything during the film (not to forget to mention the Winter Soldier....).<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best example of an action packed film which I would recommend to viewers of all ages."
"Troy_Campbell","8","2","4","13 April 2014"," Keeps the Marvel bar high.
","Of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films – ie, any that relate to The Avengers – the first Captain America is my least favourite. In fact, I think it's a very ordinary movie that can't even match the other subpar MCU entry, The Incredible Hulk. This follow-up however, now set in present day rather than during WWII, is extremely well executed and enormously enjoyable. Taking Joe Johnston's place behind the camera, the Russo brothers inject the action with a ferocity lacking in Cap 1 and deliver on numerous set pieces both big and small; a slick and stealthy raid on a ship kicks things off, whilst a gigantic battle on, in, over, around and through a trio of heli-carriers offers a breathtaking denouement. The screenplay and characters are also better served in round 2. The plot throws more curveballs than any other MCU instalment and, tantalisingly, directly influences and shapes the path of the upcoming Avengers sequel. At the same time, the eponymous hero, who in previous outings has been righteous and morally steadfast to the point of boredom, is given room to evolve from boy scout symbol of all that is right in America, to a more charismatic, but no less incorruptible, defender of liberties that has his own shades of grey to contend with. Chris Evans has worked his way into the role wonderfully over three movies and now embodies Steve Rogers with ease, although he arguably loses the limelight to Scarlett Johannson who turns in her best Black Widow performance to date. Either way, the repartee shared between the two is electric and almost rivals Thor / Loki in the witty back-and-forth dialogue department. Anthony Mackie is likable as Cap's new pal Sam (alter ego Falcon), Frank Grillo is solid as hard arse special ops leader Brock Rumlow and Sebastian Stan's indefatigable assassin the Winter Soldier is a superb matchup for our super soldier hero. This blockbuster is not without its faults though; there are occasional narrative contrivances to deal with, a rather silly exposition scene at the midway point involving an underground computer hub, a wasted Robert Redford as SHIELD executive Alexander Pierce and the franchise-wide plot issue concerning the whereabouts of other Avengers during these times of woe. Gripes aside, this is still a fantastic popcorn flick that keeps the Marvel bar high."

","I'm one of the few that don't like superhero movies, except for maybe the darker, more serious ones like the Dark Knight. Although the world seemed to think that the Avengers was top Blockbuster worthy, I found it to be no different than the slew of over-the-top superhero movies before it like Iron Man and Thor. It did not do anything for me.<br/><br/>But Captain America: the Winter Soldier is legit. There were no bad guys from another planet with supernatural powers and such, there were just bad guys who were tough to beat. And the fight sequences in this movie, in my opinion, is setting a new bar for the best fight choreography so far. Amazing fight scenes, amazing stunts, and amazing visuals. All the characters were great and believable, and the acting was top notch(considering it's not so much a script movie as it is an action movie). Have to say, love the bad guys in this one. Go see it, you'll have a great time!"

","Marvel just keeps getting better and better, and with their seemingly endless releases and sequels, the bar gets raised higher every time. Out of all the Avengers, Captain America is one of my favourites. He has 50's charm and naivety with an astonishing amount of brawn and bravery. <br/><br/>This film is fast paced, will have you jumping out your seat and for serious Marvel fans, will tug at your heart strings. The plot is extremely well developed, filled with surprises and plot twists that reflects the inner turmoil that Captain America is faced with as he struggles to figure out what exactly he is fighting for, and what is the true meaning of freedom. <br/><br/>Special effects and fight scenes are mind-blowing. And as always, stick around for the end credits for a sneak preview of the next Marvel adventure... it's going to be a good one."
"CreatorElite","10","2","4","12 April 2014"," Best Marvel Film To Date!
","Two 95 year olds beating the snot out each other sounds like a terrible attraction, but this movie did not disappoint. In the modern world of cinema, most films are faced with the burden that between the first film and it's sequel, the first film being ""The First Avenger: Captain America"", should have been a lot more successful. Surely that was not the case when it came to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. There were so many moments through-out the movie that not only made Chris Evans' shine better as the iconic hero, but it was definitely a Captain America the world needed to see. The movie cleverly and hilariously starts off with Cap(Chris Evans) meeting Sam Wilson(Anthony Mackie) A.K.A. The Falcon for the first time. The scene seemed very important and just by that alone, you knew the character had something more to the story throughout. So quickly we get welcomed into a lengthy action sequence that was probably the best I've seen in any Marvel film. Cap taking out the guards with no effort was hilarious as it was astounding. You really got to see how his character's skills evolved from the Avengers to now, especially as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. The first one on one fight scene between Cap and Georges Batroc(George ST Pierre) was beautifully a shining example of flawless fight choreography and that was only the first to what was to come. It was great to see the beautiful Scarlett Johansson return as Natasha Romanoff. In this movie, you really get to see her character open up a lot more emotionally on screen. She doesn't serve that well as eye candy, even though she is running around in a tight body suit majority of the time, highlighting her assets but she makes up for that with heart stopping fight scenes that are just as fast as Cap's. It's great to see Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. I love how the movie told us that even the SHIELD director would get into trouble in the film in that was indeed the case. The ""Pulp Fiction"" reference near the end was definitely a laugh for me. I'll let you figure that one out. I think the straight out best performance had to be Sebastion Stan, returning to the universe as The Winter Soldier A.K.A. Bucky Barnes, Cap's childhood friend. In the beginning of the film, they do give a small summary of Cap and Bucky's relationship(which slightly helps for those who refused to watch the first film) and it helps give an emotional set back to Cap's battles with The Winter Soldier. Barnes though makes well as a menacing villain. He pretty much acts as a nemesis to Cap, matching his strength and speed, and even surpassing him; catching cap's shield a few times. As the movies goes on, you see the more human side to this villain and you realize that there is some higher power leading The Winter Soldier. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce gave us a villain we truly wanted to hate. You think he's good and you think he's trying to do right with the good guys but then you realize he's behind the menace. It was good to see Cobie Smulders come back as Agent Maria Hill. I think many were handed that character in the Avengers very quickly in the Avengers and it would have been pretty bad to just abandoned such a leading lady. I mean we didn't want Black Widow being the only beauty on screen. Anthony Mackie as Falcon had to be my favorite and I'm sure many would say that too. Not only was he simply just cool, but for a guy that just got out of fighting wars, and just meeting Cap; he seemed very loyal to the whole ""save the world"" cause. He also displayed that he could hold his own through-out the movie. So now the post credits scene. This was the best post credit scene since IronMan. The characters they revealed were very pivotal and I loved how they used the word ""miracles"" to signify that these aren't regular people, like Stark, Romanoff and Hawkeye. They reveal that ""The Twins"", QuickSilver(Aaron Taylor Johnson) and Scarlett Witch(Elizabeth Olsen) are being held captive as test subjects. A major foreshadowing, leading to The Avengers: Age Of Ultron. The second scene(Stay after all of the credits) shows Bucky Barnes inside of the Smithsonian Museum learning about himself from the Captain America and Bucky Barnes exhibits inside the museum. This tells you clearly, that we haven't scene the last of Barnes. All in all, this movie was perfect and Marvel Comics fan or not, you're going to seriously love this movie. Fantastic movie! I would watch this over and over!"
"Jtmats","9","2","4","12 April 2014"," Captain America: More than just a ""Shield""
","Captain America: Winter Solider goes way beyond my expectations! This movie is all about Captain America aka Steve Rogers fitting into the ""new world"". There is a reason why the Captain is the first Avenger. Even with incredible technological advances in the modern world, we find that the ""outdated"" Rogers is still the best soldier and leader. Although there is no doubt about his fighting prowess, there is the simple problem of living day to day. He is a soldier and what should a solider do when the war is over? We soon find threats are all around and he must decide who he can trust.<br/><br/>I believe this is one of the best Marvel movies because of the story. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time! There was the mystery with the Winter Soldier and you really didn't know what to expect. Of course there was plenty of action, but there was also a sincere depth we have not seen in other Marvel movies. <br/><br/>We discover more of who Captain America is beyond patriotic, loyal, and good morals. I loved hearing about his past. Black Widow and Falcon play fantastic roles in helping us understand Rogers. Each bring their own story which allows Steve to open up. I loved the script and never felt at any time during the movie that it was slow or dull. The only issue I have is the lack of the winter soldier. I wish he would've played a bigger role besides crashing the party during action scenes. The main conflict is dealing with future threats which mean less freedom. I see the conversation between Nick Fury and Captain summing up perfectly:<br/><br/>Nick Fury: ""We're gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.""<br/><br/>Captain America: ""I thought the punishment usually came after the crime.""<br/><br/>The setting is Washington D.C. with city landscapes and underground facilities. The costumes were awesome! You can completely tell characters apart by their apparel. Captain America has a new darker uniform making him look modern, Black Widow is well... all in black, and of course we have Falcon who is very fly. Let us not forget Nick Fury with the pirate patch. Of course it is easy to talk about the good guys, but the Winter Solider I believe takes 1st place for bringing chaos and grit to this movie. A guy with a metal arm seems like Captain America finally has a formidable enemy. <br/><br/>I loved the action scenes mainly becomes the camera angles. They were very close up and made the action seem that much faster. The music matched each scene wonderfully. Most of these scenes take place during the day so lighting was well done. I cannot wait for future Marvel films."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","4","11 April 2014"," In ""Winter Soldier,"" Marvel plays with the goodwill it's built up to do something extraordinary
","If you've ever wondered how cool it would be if a superhero movie was combined with an espionage thriller, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a dream come true. It's as much ""The Rogers Ultimatum"" as it is an irresistibly cool blockbuster, and though a totally different film than the quality origin story of ""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" it's an even better one.<br/><br/>If you didn't think Marvel Studios' cinematic universe (now loving referred to by most as ""the MCU"") could get any more complicated, guess again. ""Winter Soldier"" turns the entire thing on its head, with major implications for future Marvel films as well as the Marvel TV show ""Agents of SHIELD."" Without spoiling anything, the premise is that there's some deception going on within the ranks of the Marvel world's most powerful organization.<br/><br/>In response to the Chitauri invasion in ""The Avengers,"" SHIELD has moved full speed ahead with Project Insight, a plan to launch of series of satellite-controlled helicarriers capable of instantly eliminating major threats anywhere in the world. This much power, however, doesn't gel with Captain America's beliefs, and he and SHIELD are a little at odds with each other.<br/><br/>Keeping Captain America's second solo adventure conjoined with SHIELD's narrative and characters such as Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) gives this film more weight, as though it's a sequel to ""The Avengers"" as much as it's a sequel to ""First Avenger."" It makes sense too, as the context of Captain America (Chris Evans) finding his place and his role in a modern world necessitates SHIELD's involvement, as Cap is a ""man out of time"" with no public persona in the modern day. As much as the script dives head first into a thriller, it never loses sight of Rogers' personal journey, which is an impressive feat.<br/><br/>Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who crafted ""First Avenger,"" were handed this totally different concept and yet make it work so well on so many fronts. It's the best screenplay in terms of plot that Marvel Studios has put together in its brief but impressive six-year history.<br/><br/>Behind the camera, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo prove Marvel Studios knows exactly how to scout directing talent, putting its faith in the directors of TV comedies ""Community"" and ""Happy Endings"" to make an action-packed, violent, high-stakes superhero film without a shred of doubt. The Russos' eye for stylish, wow-moment action shots exceeds their sense of humor to the point you'd hardly believe their own credentials. The film surprises constantly with how many ways an indestructible shield can be used as a weapon, and Anthony Mackie's Falcon puts other Marvel sidekicks to shame (looking at you, War Machine).<br/><br/>Mackie makes an instantly likable addition to the cast, so much so it's almost a shame he didn't get his own headlining hero, such as Marvel's Black Panther. Something similar could be said for Frank Grillo as Rumlow. Robert Redford's added gravitas as SHIELD bigwig Alexander Pierce will still be a pleasant surprise even after the movie is over.<br/><br/>The complexity of ""Winter Soldier"" is pretty astounding, especially because it works. Part of it is a sequel to ""First Avenger,"" part of it is a SHIELD move, part of it is an ""Avengers"" follow-up, etc. ""Winter Soldier"" succeeds in all of those roles and in incorporating so many elements, from character development to big-time action to big twists and turns. That level of ambition generally results in generic praises of ""highly entertaining"" mixed with ""messy"" or ""convoluted."" This film blends them together with few visible seams.<br/><br/>""Winter Soldier"" is probably a better film than ""The Avengers,"" but the giddy factor of having all those main characters in one movie is hard to make up for under even the best of circumstances. A more worthy discussion for this movie is just how well the previous Marvel films set the tone for this one to do something bigger and bolder.<br/><br/>We're familiar with the characters, with SHIELD, with the Marvel universe, so much so that Marvel Studios recognizes we already are bringing a lot to the viewing experience before the film ever begins, so it can bend the rules a bit. Courteously, it does not do so in an exclusive way. Even if you haven't seen ""First Avenger,"" this film catches you up to speed; it's the additional layers of enjoyment for fans of different engagement levels that makes the franchise work so well. ""Winter Soldier"" would still be wildly entertaining without it, but it wouldn't fire so impressively on all its cylinders.<br/><br/>If the film itself weren't enough, it leaves a distinct imprint on the rest of the MCU and makes the possibility of ""Captain America 3"" all the more exciting.<br/><br/>~Steven C Thanks for reading!

"fung0","8","2","4","9 April 2014"," Worthy Continuation of the Captain America Legend
","First, the short version: this is a very good action film, in the finest tradition of the Marvel machine. It hits all the right notes, from human drama to street-level action to full-on CG extravaganza. If you enjoyed any of the other Marvel films, you'll love this one.<br/><br/>Now the longer version. There were two things I really liked about this installment.<br/><br/>First, the storyline, which seems to have been instantaneously rewritten to reflect this past year's revelations about secretive governmental agencies. This movie is actually about something. I'm absolutely blown away that Marvel was willing to make such a strong, even controversial, political statement in what you might expect to be a 'throwaway' action flick.<br/><br/>The second thing I liked was how Captain America himself has been evolved, in light of the very topical storyline. This is Steve Rogers, archetypal All-American Boy, attempting to grow beyond jingoist gun-battles with caricatures of evil. The previous movies have shown Rogers as being naive even for the 1940s. In Winter Soldier, we see Rogers holding up a perfect mirror to a 21st Century public. What does true patriotism consist of? Are we thinking through our decisions, balancing legitimate fears against the truly noble ideologies we profess?<br/><br/>Deep stuff for a mere comic-book. The Winter Soldier marks Marvel's maturing in the medium of film, as it once did in the medium of printed comics. At some level, this is the superhero as an art form.<br/><br/>Is it *good* art? The Winter Soldier does serve up a big helping of large-scale action in its final act, perhaps at the expense of character development, or plot. This is very much in keeping with the conventions of the genre, so it's hard to call it a flaw. But I was hoping that the lower-key approach of the first half of Winter Soldier might have extended just a bit further into the climax. Captain America is really at his best in the early fight against Batroc.<br/><br/>But that's a very minor quibble. The Winter Soldier is an excellent action film, with more than enough substance to keep your brain from atrophying.<br/><br/>Best of all, it's a really powerful, evocative cinematic rendering of one of the great comic-book heroes. I can't help wondering how Jack Kirby would have felt, seeing his patriotic creation of the 1940s brought spectacularly to life in a 9-figure 21st-Century production. I think, at the very least, he'd have been touched both by how faithfully his vision had been captured - and how admirably it had been progressed."
"ersinkdotcom","8","2","4","9 April 2014"," Captain America Returns to Face His Past and Take on the Winter Soldier
","Of all the mainstream Marvel super heroes, Captain America is my most cherished. His first adventure was hands down my favorite of the Phase 1 films. The classic WWII setting and epic feel is what captured my fancy. It was like an Indiana Jones movie blended together with the comic book world. It makes perfect sense, as it was directed by a guy who cut his teeth working with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Although it doesn't have the same historic flavor as its predecessor, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" still succeeds at being the second-best of all the Marvel movies up to now.<br/><br/>Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) have continued to work for Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of ""The Avengers."" When it's discovered that the evil organization Hydra is still running strong and has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., Cap and Widow go rogue to help discover who the enemy plants are. They team up with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and find themselves confronting a powerful assassin named the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) as they embark on their mission.<br/><br/>Everything about ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" contrasts the hero's first movie. It takes place in the present day instead of the 1930s and 1940s. Cap has to deal with advanced technology versus the tanks and simple guns of the past. He's also immersed in a political world that's less cut and dry as it was in the good old days of World War II. The musical score is more modern and chaotic versus the symphonic patriotic-sounding orchestrations of the original.<br/><br/>I can't say that there are any real surprises in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" It plays out exactly the way you think it will. The main villain is who you know it's going to be from the first sequence of the movie. However, it's still fun seeing everything unfold before you.<br/><br/>Whether it's predictable or not, it's nice to see a movie attempting to deliver a strong and complex storyline along with its over-the-top action sequences. ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" gets an ""A"" for effort across the board. I also give it props for being a game-changer. Things happen in it that will shake the foundations of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in general.<br/><br/>The addition of Falcon as one of Cap's sidekicks is a welcome one in the hands of actor Anthony Mackie. You can tell he's genuinely excited and honored to be a part of the Marvel movie world. He takes the part seriously and pours everything he's got into the role. It also helps that he doesn't wear a red jumpsuit with wings attached to it. His suit in ""Captain American: The Winter Soldier"" is much more advanced and modernized.<br/><br/>It's pretty obvious in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" that they're setting up Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow character for her own film. I just can't see the idea ever getting off the ground. I could see her guest-starring in episodes of ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" where they explore her checkered past while she helps that team out on a few missions. I can't comprehend how the character could carry a full-length theatrical release.<br/><br/>The special effects and CGI in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" look good for the most part. There are a couple scenes where human movements look a little sketchy. Overall, the real and the digitized blend well together.<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence, gunplay and action throughout. It also has some bad language sprinkled throughout. There's nothing here you wouldn't expect after seeing all the other Marvel movies.<br/><br/>As ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" came to a close, I found myself wanting more. I was already anticipating its follow-up and felt anxious knowing I'm going to have to wait another couple of years before getting some closure to the story it left open-ended. ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" will at least serve as an appetizer when it comes to our Star- Spangled hero. I want a third giant helping of the main course again, though!"
"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","9","2","4","8 April 2014"," ""You need to keep BOTH eyes open.""
","""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a very good movie, and it does what a sequel should do: it's a nice continuation of the first movie, and it furthers the plot from the first movie. Even though they borrow material from the first movie, you won't be too lost. Everyone in the film portray their characters in a real and genuine way. There is real character development and interaction, and the action is intense. Despite the fight sequences' occasionally relying on the ""shaky-camera"" technique, the action scenes are effective and impactful. My other complaint is that the winter soldier is not enough in this movie to warrant him as the main villain. I wish he was around more to make him more of the main villain. But aside from that, this movie is great.<br/><br/>The movie re-introduces Steve Rogers, as he is jogging around Washington D.C. Rogers runs his laps so quickly that he keeps passing Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) before Wilson can complete one of his. ""To your left!"" Rogers keeps yelling as he passes by, much to Wilson's bemused annoyance.<br/><br/>When the two officially meet, Mackie and Evans play the short scene in a manner that immediately suggests the start of a beautiful friendship. (This makes sense if you know who Sam Wilson really is.) Their chemistry allows us a more personal investment in their action sequences. But this is not the only form of chemistry that exists in the film. Also, there's the chemistry between the Captain and Black Widow, and the Captain with Nick Fury.<br/><br/>For the first ever, Black Widow and Nick Fury were characters that were fleshed out and were actually given personalities rather than being characters that were around just to move the plot forward. I can't wait to see what they do next with them. <br/><br/>I like the action sequences a lot. They went back to actual hand to hand combat for most of these sequences, rather than relying on guns or the use of CGI. My one complaint about the action sequences is how they are edited. For some of the fight, it seems like the camera is shaking, giving a somewhat realistic view of the fight, but nonetheless a tiresome technique. I just want the camera to stay still for me to enjoy the fighting. <br/><br/>My other complaint is that The Winter Soldier is not prominent enough in the film (despite him having the main title in the movie.) For the most part, he's just a character that appears to screw with the plans of our heroes, and then disappear for a while. I wish he was developed more; like with his origin story. However, he still makes an impact, and the reveal of who is his is still impactful.<br/><br/>This is the most fun I've had at one of these Marvel movies since the first ""Iron Man"" movie and ""The Avengers"". In my opinion, it's better than the first movie, and it serves as a great tie in with the next Avengers movie. Go watch it."
"Joe_Chadowski","8","2","4","8 April 2014"," Oh yeah, that's how you entertain!
","""Marvel's Best!"", ""Epic!"", ""Better than The Avengers!"" There's no doubt the ad execs were having a ball with this one. Marvel's been on a roll lately. They seem to have found a groove within the perfect balance of pandemonium-infused action, literal laugh out loud humor, and the perfect pinch of campiness. And now they're on cruise control. Normally I fault studios hard for complacency, especially when the motive is profit. But if in return the people get pure 100% entertainment, why should I complain?<br/><br/>Not a bad lead in if I do say so myself. Enter Captain America; The Winter Soldier. Directed by the dudes from Arrested Development and Community, and written by the dude from the Narnia movies. Yeah. But the usual suspects are in front of the camera, at least. With a couple of pristine new faces, and Robert Redford's half-melted Ken Doll face. Any way, after a hostage situation on a S.H.I.E.L.D. cargo ship is diffused by our hero, a series of events are set in place that lead the to questioning of sides on everyone Captain America holds in the highest regard. And *spoiler alert* the world will need saving.<br/><br/>I should rewind. At this point you're probably scrolling back up make sure you read my star rating correctly. Now you're probably feeling confused. Captain America is not better than The Avengers, or even equal. Captain America follows the same exact formula as The Avengers, but it ticks the excitement factor from a 10, to about an 8. Joss Whedon's steady camera is greatly missed, especially in the action sequences, where the camera jumps and jives and makes your head spin. The acting at best is merely expedient, which isn't a big deal in these kinds of movies, but occasionally the script takes a breather and gets deep. Which I love, but Evans and Johannson aren't quite up to snuff to pull it off. But there's no doubt the biggest surprise of this film is their chemistry. Where did that come from?<br/><br/>So why a four star rating given these sacrilegious defilements on these pillars of filmmaking? Because unbridled entertainment is a virtue that defies any kind of reason. And it's a virtue that Captain America; The Winter Soldier has in spades. It's a mind warping experience, and if my parched mouth and pounding hear are anything to go by, it's proof that when it comes to delivering good old fashioned fun, this film is right up there with the best. Sure it's devoid of cohesion, but it's so simple and uncomplicated that your attention is immediately focused on enjoying yourself.<br/><br/>To summarize, Captain America; The Winter Soldier is a film so entertaining, so full of attitude, that I feel like a buzzkill just for critiquing it. It isn't better, or even as good as, The Avengers, but it's a close second. And that is praise indeed. Marvel seems to be churning out awesome films like this without any apparent effort, and while they are laughing all the way to the bank, in the end, we are the winners. And we're left with tingling synapses, elevated heart-rates, and the delusion we could take on anyone who crosses us. Oh and mad brownie points are in store for anyone who saw the reference to Pulp Fiction."
"alindsay-al","10","2","4","8 April 2014"," An epic action film
","With age of ultron coming up I have rewatched captain America the winter soldier and I enjoyed it more the second time and realised just how epic this film truly is. The premise of this film sees captain America team up with black widow, Nick fury and the falcon to take down the mysterious winter soldier while trying to take down a conspiracy. Chris Evans was a bit of a controversial choice as captain America because of his connections with the fantastic 4 franchise but he was the perfect choice for captain America. He totally encapsulates what Steve Rodgers is all about and the moral character but action packed hero that he is in the comics. The supporting cast is also top notch in this film with Scarlett Johansson returning as black widow and her character is given much more relevance and back story so we care about her character, it also helps that her chemistry with Evans is fantastic. Samuel l Jackson is back as Nick fury and this is his best role yet, his character is given allot of depth in this film and it makes fury a really interesting character. Anthony Mackie plays Sam Wilson the falcon and he is a really cool character in the film and you feel his connection with captain America as they have gone through a similar past that makes you care about his character and their friendship. Robert Redford plays a high ranking shield officer in the film and he is great in his performance and really brings a real star power to the film whenever he is on screen. The character of the winter soldier was a great action star in this film, however, he isn't in the film that much and you want to know more about him that you won't get the chance too. The story could have been simple but it wasn't it had real moral conflicts and emotional moments that really made the story a highlight of the film. The script was fantastic with allot of great humour and some drama that really made these characters interesting and relatable. The style was superb, this is one of the best spy/action films ever with the action scene being perfect and the action being completely appropriate. Overall this is a truly epic film and one that you should definitely see."

","Before seeing this film I had very high hopes. The previews looked amazing and the reviews were all pretty good as well. And it didn't disappoint. This might be my favorite Marvel movie yet. It has it all with the action, comedy and twists to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>I personally didn't like the first one at all. I thought it was boring and didn't keep the audience interested. The action wasn't all that great either. But this one has you hooked from the start. You laugh a minute into the movie.<br/><br/>Over the course of the movie things happen and it definitely sets it up nicely for the next Avengers movie. All these marvel movies seem to be episodes in a very long TV series but instead of episodes, they are high profile movies and I'm not complaining because I think they all keep getting better and better.<br/><br/>Once again stay past the end credits...and I mean all of the credits."

","Hats off to Marvel Studios!!! They are brilliant in comics as well as in making movies based on the former. I want to say that after watching Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and The Avengers (2012), Captain America was not my favourite or he was my least favourite superhero from all the rest! I had not many expectations from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I just expected a good story that would take Captain America's journey forward. But when I watched it, it left me awestruck! I was so surprised that how marvelously this film is executed! With so many elements that I couldn't have asked for more. <br/><br/>Story: The story is riveting with twists and turns although I must admit that it is better than its predecessor! It has many scenes and moments from which you just can't take your eyes off, even for a moment! For more to know, just go to watch this film! LOL!<br/><br/>Characters: Chris Evans as Steve Rogers is back and yet with a bang!!! Still struggling to cope with the modern world, he's a man who is a Saviour and delivers a bucketful performance as Captain America!<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is charming yet more beautiful! You can't miss her daring action sequences which is appreciable!<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury delivers more to his audience with a extravaganza performance as compared to The Avengers! He gives a surprise which you would see in the climax.<br/><br/>Another character I would like to appreciate is Alexander Pierce. He truly justifies his role but you can't determine whether he is a good or bad guy in this film but you would know in the end. <br/><br/>Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter is delightful. I didn't knew she was alive but given her minimum role, she is decent!<br/><br/>The most magnificent villain in Marvel for me after Loki is The Winter Soldier. He is just riveting! I can't tell you who he is in actual! Yet another surprise which you would find out in the film!<br/><br/>Direction: Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo deserve a round of applause for making and continuing a franchise with so much elements! They are simply fabulous!!<br/><br/>Action and Visual Effects: I would like to say that the action and VFX are far more better than the predecessor!! The 3D effects also adds a little touch!! Every action scene is breathtaking!! <br/><br/>On the whole, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is yet another magnificent film and a wonderful addition in the Marvel franchise!! Captain America has evolved so much that for me, he is at par with Iron Man. A remarkable effort by the whole cast and crew!!"

","Not being a fan of captain America and not enjoying the first film, because it was full of clichés, I was quite surprised by this movie. It was actually really good! For a Marvel film this is definitely great and one of my favourite superhero films now.<br/><br/>It was a welcome change to see a superhero film tell a tale which involves politics, security and the role of authority. Captain America is a great choice for tell us a story because of what he represents: the ideal American in superhero form. Well done to all involved for going beyond a straight-cut comic book-to-film adaptation and making a memorable story.<br/><br/>As with any superhero and action film there are movie mistakes, ridiculous moments and inconsistent character actions. Often these can ruin a film however in this instance being a superhero film, and a good story, it doesn't detract at all and instead you'll be interested all the way through.<br/><br/>I can easily recommend this to anyone."
"zufaraiman","9","2","4","7 April 2014"," The superb superhero/thriller genre's yet..
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has trust issues.<br/><br/>Of course, who doesn't these days? What with continuing revelations of government spying, credit card hacking, hidden cameras and mass phone surveillance, there's a general assumption that somebody's watching you at all times, and they probably are.<br/><br/>""Winter Soldier"" tosses this paranoia atop the usual blend of super-heroics, explosions and large objects falling from the sky one expects from a Marvel action blockbuster. Meanwhile the film maintains the central question of the mothership Marvel film, ""The Avengers"": Wouldn't humans be better off under someone's rule, because we're certainly botching this democracy thing?<br/><br/>Captain America (Chris Evans) obviously doesn't think so, but, as the film begins, he is starting to question his work for the world-wide protection agency S.H.I.E.L.D. He keeps getting sent off on rescue missions that seem to have ulterior motives.<br/><br/>He's not so sure that S.H.I.E.L.D. Commander Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is sharing everything with him. He's even beginning to question the loyalties of fellow Avenger Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson).<br/><br/>All this questioning turns out to be a good thing. Because, under the leadership of one Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), S.H.I.E.L.D. has been building three massive flying warships that, once they've taken to the air, will look down on and basically police the whole world.<br/><br/>This power would be terrifying in anyone's hands. But once Captain America discovers an enemy from his past will sit upon the throne, while also using a friend from his past as a lapdog, he decides S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting way out of hand.<br/><br/>And so, much fighting ensues. Cap picks up a high- flying sidekick named Falcon (Anthony Mackie) along the way, and, of course, Black Widow turns out to be as trustworthy as an assassin can be, but they're up against a lot of hardware and an entire army of rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<br/><br/>Unlikely directors Joe and Anthony Russo (""You, Me and Dupree"" and lots of sitcom work) turn out to be just fine in the action realm, with big scenes at sea, in the air and lots of running around on the ground (one extended street-bound fight sequence looks like the shootout in ""Heat"" with back flips). It can get repetitious, and there are some logic breaks, but the action is never outright numbing (see the ""Thor"" movies; or don't).<br/><br/>Throughout, there's a running joke about how Black Widow is trying to set Cap up on a date, the most likely candidate being his neighbor (Emily Van Camp, likely to return). Why Cap and Black Widow don't hook up is a question that lingers. Who else is she going to get with? The Hulk?<br/><br/>Evans has been shushing rumors that he might retire from heroic roles when his Marvel contract is up (likely 2017, Captain America isn't going anywhere quite yet). If so, it will be a loss; now that his cocky young days seem over, he's become the absolute picture of an old-fashioned American hero, with dry wit thrown in as bonus. Few actors play straight this well.<br/><br/>In ""Winter Soldier,"" amidst the chaos, our hero learns to be wary of the modern world. Welcome to the 21st century, Cap."
"Fluke_Skywalker","8","2","4","7 April 2014"," Mission accomplished
","Marvel's 'The Avengers' set the bar awfully high, and up until now their so-called ""Phase 2"" had clumsily done the limbo right beneath it. 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' doesn't reach the dizzying heights of 'The Avengers', but it delivers a thrilling, fun, thoughtful film that manages to both build upon the Avengers cinematic universe and yet stand on its own.<br/><br/>What I really love about 'Winter Soldier' is that, at its heart, it's a 70s-style political conspiracy thriller. As if to drive that point home, they cast Robert Redford, who adds a real dimension of gravitas to the film. Of course the movie is called 'Captain America', and Cap is in fine Form here. Evans really owns the role now, bringing a quiet integrity as well as the physical goods.<br/><br/>My enthusiasm for Mighty Marvel's cinematic Lollapalooza had started to flag, but now I'm more excited than ever for 'Avengers 2'.<br/><br/>Avengers, assemble!"
"moviescoundrel","9","2","4","6 April 2014"," Winter Soldier is the Best You'll See All Summer
","Wow. The ninth installment from the Marvel universe is upon us, and although the timing for such an ambitious vehicle is odd, after viewing it, it is most welcome, and if every Marvel movie got this kind of treatment, the world would be a better place.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the present day and is chronologically set after ""The Avengers"", and ""Thor: The Dark World"". The movie starts off with Captain (Steve Rogers) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansen) on a SHIELD mission for Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and it is high on action, wit, banter, and set up for the rest of the movie. After the mission, there is a possible threat introduced and the idea of freedom put into question. Fury is then involved in a quite intense action sequence that was probably longer and definitely more intense to his character than any movie in the past has offered, which is when we first get our glimpse of the Winter Soldier. Trust and deception are now a part of the game. Who can be trusted? How is this related to Cap? How is the Winter Soldier involved? The film is part spy thriller, superhero movie, gritty action movie, and part character drama. And all of it for the most part works.<br/><br/>The film is a superb follow-up to ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and although not necessary to enjoy it, viewers of such will be rewarded with a decent amount of content directly related to events and characters from the first film. Considering the first film to place in the 40′s, it's pretty amazing how this film actively bridges to the previous film with characters, plot, and history. The movie also has the strongest links to the Marvel world and will have a huge impact on the Marvel Movie universe in its entirety. The effects of events in this film will continue to have an impact on future Marvel superhero movies for the foreseeable future."
"Hellmant","10","2","4","7 April 2014"," On a pure action movie level it is the best of the Marvel superhero films!
","'CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Sequel to the 2011 hit Marvel Comics superhero flick 'CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER' and the ninth installment in 'THE AVENGERS' film franchise. It picks up two years after the end of 'THE AVENGERS' movie with Steve Rogers still working for S.H.I.E.L.D. (and living in Washington D.C.) when he discovers a terrorist plot inside the agency. He has to team up with Black Widow, and a new ally called Falcon, in order to stop the threat. The movie was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (who are best known for directing TV shows like 'COMMUNITY' and films like 'YOU, ME AND DUPREE' and 'WELCOME TO COLLINWOOD'). It was written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who also co-wrote the first one). I found it to be immensely entertaining and well made; on a pure action movie level it is the best of the Marvel superhero films! <br/><br/>The action begins when a S.H.I.E.L.D. ship is hijacked by Algerian pirates. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a.k.a. Captain America, leads a team into rescue the hostages while agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), a.k.a. Black Widow, retrieves important data from the ship's computers. Rogers was unaware of Romanoff's plan and is angered by her jeopardizing the mission. He later learns, from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), that the data has to do with something called 'Project Insight', in which three Helicarriers are to be used to eliminate potential threats to S.H.I.E.L.D. (using spy satellite intel that they're linked to). After Fury is targeted by crooked S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, led by an assassin known as 'Winter Soldier' (Sebastian Stan), he informs the Captain that the agency has been compromised and gives him the thumbnail drive (with top secret information on it). Rogers then finds his own life in danger as well and has no one to trust (or turn to), except his 'Avengers' ally Black Widow and a new friend named Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), a.k.a. Falcon.<br/><br/>The cast also includes Robert Redford, Frank Grillo, Cobie Smulders and the stunningly beautiful Emily VanCamp. It's action packed and full of intense suspense driven drama. The stakes feel much higher in this movie than the prior film (or 'THE AVENGERS') and the whole thing is totally engaging and involving (with enough humor thrown in here and there to make it really amusing as well). The CGI is surprisingly light for a Marvel superhero film and the Russo brothers did a great job of giving it that classic action movie/political thriller feel. I like that it has a completely different style than the first one (and any other 'Avengers' movies) and really think it's arguably the best in the franchise (at least as far as action flicks go). I like the real world political commentary (it's obviously a critique on using drone strikes for targeted killing) and it does seem a lot more believable and reality based than most other films in it's genre. It's always funny (though) that none of the other superheroes are around when the world is in great danger (in these individual superhero movies); you'd think the other Avengers would want to be there when something very serious happens to a mutual friend and everyone's lives and well being are placed in harm's. It is a comic book movie though and that's to be expected I guess.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh0hmoLcuEo"
"zactac","10","2","4","7 April 2014"," Best Marvel Movie Since ""The Avengers"" and ""Iron Man""
","Considering we are now several movies, one mega-sequel to them all, and some direct sequels into Marvel Phase 2; needless to say there was a great amount of hype attached to ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". So did it deserve the hype? Did it live up to the high bar set by movies such as ""The Avengers"" and ""Iron Man""? The only thing I can think of is wow! This movie lived up to them both and then some.<br/><br/>We find Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) two years after the battle of New York from ""The Avengers"" and he is working with SHIELD now. While on a mission with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) he discovers that some things are not quite right deep in the ranks of SHIELD. On the run, he must uncover the conspiracy going on within SHIELD and deal with his greatest adversary yet; the Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed the first ""Captain America"" I have to say this movie went above and beyond what I was expecting. Not only do we get a deeper look at one of the greatest superheroes of our time but we get a look at the ideals that have shaped our country into what it is now, and even leaves us pondering if what we are is something good or not. This message is loud and clear especially when Steve Rogers begins questioning everything he ever stood for. One line in particular stood out to me from the movie. In a conversation with Nick Fury, Rogers states ""We fought for freedom, this is fear"" while discussing new weaponry being used by SHIELD, to which Fury replies ""We do things for the world we live in, not the one we dream of."" Most likely I messed up the wording in there somewhere but that is the gist of the conversation. This conversation really surprised me because it was showing that Marvel has no problem taking on deeper ideas when the time comes for it. I applaud them for it.<br/><br/>However, the ideals being used would mean nothing if it wasn't for the fantastic performances by the leading cast. Scarlett Johansson reminded us why we love Black Widow. She brought the right amount of flair, depth, and even humor to a character that proves women can be just as tough (even tougher) than men. But Chris Evans is the heart and soul of the film. His portrayal of Steve Rogers really showcased why he is the best person to be the leading man in this series. He took on Rogers patriotism, heroism, fears, and even questioning with elegance in every stride. He made us love a character even more when we already did.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt the best Marvel movie since ""The Avengers"" and ""Iron Man"". Instead of a regular superhero movie, we got a ""Jason Bourne"" type of espionage spy thriller with Captain America as the main character. Filled with intense, inspired action while also being a surprisingly intelligent film with fantastic performances; ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" soars above and beyond expectations with shocking twists that will be felt throughout the entire Marvel cinematic Universe. I am still in awe of it."
"diac228","8","2","4","7 April 2014"," Bold, Brilliant, and with Captain America on top of his game, The Winter Soldier is the among the best cinematic Marvel movies out there
","How can any Marvel movie match up to The Avengers? Similar to what happened to the quality value of The Expendables franchise after the Indonesian bloodbath funfest The Raid totally rewrote the rules on how to film and execute an action movie, The Avengers became the pinnacle of Marvel films simply because of all the superheroes involved and the sheer scope of the comic book mayhem. Overall it knocked down the standalone Marvel movies and even the Batman movies a few notches. Let's be honest, the Nolan Batman trilogy would have overall ranked to just above Spider-Man level if it had not been for The Dark Knight's Joker. <br/><br/>How can Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain America 2 possibly live up to The Avengers when it features each of these heroes AND more? Well, Captain America: The Winter Soldier succeeds by providing a deep plot, plenty of action, and an ability to take some gambles that will have ramifications within the cinematic Marvel universe. Lastly, menacing villains that doesn't involve ripping the hearts of comic book fans (a.k.a. The Mandarin in Iron Man 3) is always an added bonus.<br/><br/>In the mix of heroes, Captain America is the most likable and also the most relatable because of his sheer commitment to keeping the American public safe while also being wary of the 21st century techniques of keeping the nation out of harm's way. But adding to the mix are The Falcon and Black Widow, two also very supportable characters (Helps to have Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie) with similar goals, even though Black Widow's intentions can become muddy. All three are wrapped in a story that involves decades of betrayal, dark secrets, and politics behind staying one step ahead of domestic, foreign, and intergalactic terrorism. With a script that hits close to home, this is easily the best-written of the Marvel films thanks to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.<br/><br/>Tying in all the plot twists and surprises are well-executed action sequences that rely very little on CGI (well, up until the big climax) and depend more on excellent stunts, clever editing, and great direction (Special props to the Russo Brothers). The chases are fun, the shootouts are intense, and the hand-to-hand combat is leagues above the normal comic book movie. Instead of one overarching villain, we have multiple enemies fighting in the front lines and behind the scenes, increasing the tension throughout the movie---especially in the breathtaking final act.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the best of the standalone Marvel movies since the original Iron Man because its plot and themes hit close to the heart, the action is relentless, it never becomes too predictable, the acting is great, and the blend of political thriller gives it a special taint you usually don't find in comic book films. It is entertaining, thought-provoking, and intriguing from start to finish. Like your best Marvel comic books, it has plenty of heroes, plenty of enemies, and never wears out its welcome. Bring on Avengers 2, because the Disney/Marvel brand is definitely going in the right direction."

","Before anything, I have to make a confession. Yes, I am a Marvel fan, and yes, I tend to comment on Marvel movies from this angle. Yet I don't think anyone will disagree when I say that 'Captain America' was barely decent and that back then, we all felt it had only been released to make sure the audience would not be completely lost when 'The Avengers' would be released. Same went for 'Thor'.<br/><br/>THIS new Cap' America movie is a completely different movie. It is actually great. An ultra efficient mix between a super-hero-action-packed- movie and a really interesting thriller. And you only get to pay for one ticket!<br/><br/>Of course, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' hugely benefits from the mega box-office hit 'The Avengers' and from the tremendous success of the Iron-Man franchise. How? By bringing the audience into a world we have already know and like, Marvel recreates the conditions for a well made franchise: they get us familiar with their characters. And just like with TV shows, we cannot wait to see the characters we love so dearly! It also helps getting the audience instantly into the movie and suspending our disbelief faster because we already know these guys: they're family!<br/><br/>And like with every family, you have expectations. This time, Marvel completely lived up to our expectations! Directing is excellent, editing makes a great job at keeping things clear, acting is good, and the VFx are not overdoing it. The pace is very well-balanced between action and suspense, and when the lights come back inside the theatre, you just wish there was more.

"ReeltalkwithLaura","10","2","4","7 April 2014"," The best is yet to come...
","Oh Marvel, how I love thee...let me count the ways. I start by saying that Captain America isn't my favorite Avenger. I like him, but out of Thor, Iron Man, The Hulk, Hawkeye, and the Black Widow, the Captain is not my first choice. I enjoyed the first film and it was quite a bit more ""human"" than any other Marvel film. However, this film has completely changed my mind. To say that it was amazing does not even come close to describe my feelings about it. As the set up goes - Thor, The Dark World, and Iron Man 3 are all leading up to Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, with Captain America : The Winter Soldier setting it up the best!<br/><br/>Captain America ( Chris Evans) aka Steve, picks up right where we left off, with him attempting to find a place in an ever advancing world. Where he would choose a simpler life, he is forced to find satisfaction in the one that he is in. Being an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D, he continues to complete missions that are assigned by Director Fury ( Samuel L Jackson) alongside The Black Widow/ Natasha (Scarlett Johansson). When the Captain's world is turned upside down with revelations that things are not what they appear to be, he is forced to make a stand. He fights enemies that he thought were friends and faces on old enemy. <br/><br/>Along with returning faces, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L Jackson, Cobie Smulders, and Haley Atwell, we get new characters in Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Anthony Mackel as Sam Wilson, aka Falcon. And of course we can't forget our beloved Stan Lee who makes his appearance; I'm not telling where so be on the look out - it's funny as always! Everyone brings their A-game to the film with superb acting. It is 136 minutes of non-stop action and pure enjoyment. Quite a bit of hand to hand combat occurs with the fighting scenes that are beautifully choreographed - fighting that only Captain America can do with his shield at his side. The film also has quite a bit of comedy which has become a staple of the Marvel films as well. There's everything from one liners to Natasha attempting to set Steve up on a date. <br/><br/>Not giving much away, because even if you are not a fan of Marvel (which you should be ashamed if you aren't :-) ) if you like movies it is worth every penny. You will not be bored and you will find yourself wanting more. Make sure that you stay until the end, because as is true with every Marvel film you don't want to miss the surprise scenes, and yes there are multiple. At the end I dare you to not want to join S.H.E.I.L.D yourself, or at least go home and watch all the other Marvel films. It's a great movie, one of the best so far this year! Can't wait for Avengers: Age of Ultron: 2015 can't come soon enough!!!!"

","Saw Captain America: The Winter Soldier over the weekend (as well The Lego Movie the day after) and I can honestly admit that this was a strong start for Marvel's 2014 movie run. I liked the first movie but TWS succeeded to be bigger, better, and stronger than The First Avenger.<br/><br/>Storyline is great as its filled with not only superhero elements but it did have a feel of a political-thriller film (as I won't give too much, SHIELD plays a strong part in the story) so its not only a different take but it gives the superhero genre a new fresh look in a way. The ""easter egg's"" that occur in the Marvel Cinematic Universe are indeed delivered here, I won't give it away for you but it does give you a slight sense of what could be stored for Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>In terms of action sequences, I can say it kept me glued to what was happening with the characters. The directors here have managed to give lots of practical stunts and effects, but it doesn't mean that CGI is not used as some it helped in the epic climax and some shots in the film. <br/><br/>Lastly, the casting here give all their best! Evans as the title hero is indeed major proof that he's a matured actor of the genre (he's no longer the Human Torch from Fantastic 4). Robert Redford too deserves a great nod, giving a solid performance as always.<br/><br/>Overall, its an entertaining Marvel movie that kicks off the continuing Phase 2 towards Age of Ultron. My mate who tagged along didn't enjoyed it as much as I did but I left the cinema with a satisfied feeling! Stay during the end credits for an awesome surprise :)"

","Having just seen Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I gotta say this sequel surpasses the original in so many ways. In it's place of an adventure yarn filled with WW2 action is a modern day political thriller with a dash of Cold War with superhero theatrics that work wonderfully with it's main cast and well-written and gritty script. I liked that the film touched on themes such as privacy, loyalty, rediscovering your past while also facing the future, and many dangers. So if you liked the first film, you're gonna love this sequel. It's a well made film that really ups the stakes for Cap and his allies and enemies wrapped up in a nice package of political intrigue."
"Reef-Shark","9","2","4","6 April 2014"," Perhaps the best Marvel Studios film to date
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not only a great sequel but perhaps the best standalone Marvel Studios film to date. I wasn't overly fond of the Captain's first feature, so my expectations weren't too high going into this one, but coming out I have to say The Winter Soldier isn't only a great superhero movie, but I'd even venture to say it may even be superior to The Avengers.<br/><br/>At the start of the film Steve Rogers (AKA Captain America) is still accumulating to modern life after having been frozen since WWII, and is working under the orders of Nick Fury and SHIELD. Already having doubts about SHIELD's motives and methods Rogers suddenly finds himself at the center of a conflict festering at the heart of SHIELD and must fight alongside other agents to stop a villainous plot to establish a new world order. Along the way he'll have to face a dark figure which may be connected to his past and decide what freedom truly stands for.<br/><br/>As a standalone feature The Winter Soldier is arguably the smartest Marvel Studios film to date. While still providing the fantastical set-pieces, humor, and over the top action spectacles one would expect from a Marvel film The Winter Soldier's antagonist is grounded in real-world fears, and possibilities. For this reason I felt more invested in the film's action than any other Marvel film to date. While movies like The Avengers and the first Iron Man were fun superhero romps The Winter Soldier actually feels like it is addressing real-world concerns regarding government secrecy and drone warfare in a way which made me feel invested in the characters, and the stakes they were up against.<br/><br/>The decision to make it an internal, spy-movie type struggle subdued the annoying question of: ""Where the hell are rest of the Avengers?!"" which constantly itched at me during Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World.<br/><br/>Then there's Rogers himself who truly defines himself as a superhero in this film. In his first outing and The Avengers Captain America always seemed like a wet blanket, coming across as a giant flag draped Boy Scout. While he was likable enough he never warranted in-depth analysis. That all changes in The Winter Soldier. Here Rogers' reflects on his past, question his own values and whether or not he can uphold them in this cloak and dagger modern world. His character-arc is well-told, and by the film's end credits the Captain had risen to become one of my favorite characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is the first standalone Marvel movie since the original Iron Man I've felt actually stood proud on its own two feet. While Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World had me saying ""Can't wait to see the next Avengers"" The Winter Soldier had me leaving the theater saying: ""I can't wait to see the next Captain America movie!"" For this reason I am giving my full recommendation for Captain America: The Winter Soldier!"
"milescooper75","10","2","4","6 April 2014"," This film has to be one of the best superhero movies
","I have always been a Captain America fan so I had faith that this film would be excellent and it was! There were many surprises in this film and it kept me in the edge of my seat. One of the things I like about this film was Anthony Mackie's comedic timing. Ever since 8 Milenhe has been a vital supporting character. Don't forget Robert Reford, a legend and he played his part. But Chris Evans he stepped his game up on his 3rd outing as Captain America. He had me believe he was really Captain America. Samuel L. Jackson who I never get tired of is always a good part of any movie he does. This film really raises the intensity level it was almost like watching The Dark Knight. Highly recommend this one!"

","Yesterday I experienced Captain America 2 in all its freaking glory. My instant reaction after watching the movie was... ""Now this is how you make a Comic Book Super-Hero Flick, Thank you Marvel :)""<br/><br/>Captain America 2 is an awesome movie which every marvel fan or comic book buff must watch. It has an enthralling story which is nicely paced with superb action and epic set piece battles. This one is way ahead of any Marvel action flick you've seen till date. Above all, it has also given fans the best on screen Super-Villain since Loki.<br/><br/>Story: (No Spoilers) One of THE BEST! It's high time and I'm sickeningly fed up of Super-Hero movies where story is taken for granted. A negligence which exists just for sake of tying all the distracted pieces so as to make it presentable on screen. Captain America 2 is my savior as it easily exceeded my expectations. Not even a single moment of boredom or dullness to criticize or crib about. Hats Off! And yeah... DO NOT miss the post-credit scene. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to these mind-boggling teasers which keeps tickling our curiosity - keep craving until-next-time!<br/><br/>Characters: Captain America: Chris Evans successfully captures and portrays the essence of Steve Rogers, a soldier from the past who is struggling to fit into the modern world where lines between freedom and fear are blurred. Falcon: Anthony Mackie has done a fantastic job playing the daring sidekick who supports our captain both emotionally and in the heat of the action. Falcon sequences are among the best action scenes the movie offers.<br/><br/>Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) comes on top as one of the biggest highlights of the movie. He fits perfectly as one of the best on screen Super-Villain Marvel has to offer, rivaling our favorite Loki (Tom Hiddleston) himself. Marvel is criticized for not treating its Super- Villains with the character, story and importance they deserve in the movies. But they've done an amazing job with The Winter Soldier. Every moment he is present on screen is a delight of terror and jaw-dropping fight sequences full of awe.<br/><br/>Verdict: This is one of the best Super-Hero movie made till date. A political thriller carrying nostalgia from the 70's, served with one of the best story-line ever seen in Marvel movies. This one has raised a bar for Super-Hero movies... ""Now This Is How Its Done""... a Must Must WATCH.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5 / 10 (You cannot afford to miss this one)<br/><br/>A review by Anil007Gamer This is my very first review!

"spencerfdavis","10","2","4","6 April 2014"," On par with Avengers
","This film was outstanding! I really didn't care for the first one all that much but liked the Captain America character portrayed in the Avengers. It's interesting to me to see how much impact changing the director can have. I've never been a huge fan of Joe Johnston (Jumanji/Jurassic Park 3) who directed the first one. This movie has a whole different tone to it and was just well executed start to finish. In my opinion, this was one of the best Marvel movies and in some ways better than Avengers. Felt Christopher Nolanesque at points as well. The fight scenes were superbly choreographed, and the acting is very solid. I thought Black Widow was by far better in this than Iron Man 2 or Avengers. Do yourself a favor and go see this. It will not disappoint."

What I say about this movie its a Total Nonstop Action...Captain America is fast & furious the winter soldier is also very powerful in the movie..What is special about this movie is serious detailed action which is eye catching and The Winter soldier is much more best then the first part of Captain America first avenger I must say it has more action than Iron Man series, Spider man series, Thor series very good movie very good direction the action is well choreographed and long action scenes.

"CowherPowerForever","9","2","4","6 April 2014"," This isn't freedom. This is fear.
","Marvel and Disney are back for another round in this large, massive, and downright amazing Avengers universe. Captain American packs a massive punch as in my opinion Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the best film yet in the Avengers universe. Yes, even better than the Avengers film itself.<br/><br/>First I really want to touch on the story of this film. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, these guys deliver a great mix of comic book world, and political thriller. In a time where Americans worry about their overreaching government, and the power they have over our lives Captain America: The Winter Soldier takes these hot button issues and turns it into an amazing story and film. In terms of overall stories, frankly this is the best yet out of the Marvel Avengers universe as it is just so deep and intriguing. The story however is not without its faults. My complaints are nothing major that would really hurt the film, and frankly a lot of the Marvel Avengers universe suffers from this problem. As Captain America is battling it out trying to save the day, he is noticeably in a lot of trouble. Yet no other Avenger is ever in sight, for example Bruce Banner/Hulk, or Iron Man, or Thor. This is just a minor problem I have always had with this universe. Nothing that brings the film down though.<br/><br/>Directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, the guys bring in a nice and different feel to a Marvel Avengers universe films. The film has a great mix of not only CG action scenes, but non CG action scenes as well that take you back to those older 1970s car chase action scenes. Since this film offers a lot of action and destruction its hard to blend in story and action if you are a director. The guys handle it perfectly. Truly one of the best films so far in this huge universe of films. The only thing that is a shame is that the guys weren't actually able to shoot this using IMAX cameras. Now though would have been something to see.<br/><br/>As I'm a big fan of musical scores Captain America: The Winter Soldier has one of the better scores for a superhero film. The score for this film was done by Henry Jackman who recently did the amazing score of the Oscar nominated film Captain Phillips. This score really brings you in and just makes the film so much better, especially in those big action scenes. I would truly compare his score to one of another favorite musical scorer of mine, Hans Zimmer.<br/><br/>Now the acting as with nearly every Marvel film these days is once again top of the line. With a cast that is mostly the same minus a few actors here and there the foundation in this department is just beyond solid. Chris Evans is back playing Captain America, and frankly he doesn't get enough respect for playing this role. He should be remembered as one of the better actors to ever play a superhero. Adding in this second go around is the amazing Robert Redford. Redford has the acting experience that was needed for his role. Not to mention Redford has starred in a good bit of classic political thrillers. So he fit the role perfectly. Anthony Mackie is another addition to this cast as he plays The Falcon/Sam Wilson. In my opinion I found his acting to be nothing special. Its not that his performance was bad, its just not memorable at all. The rest of the actors bring us perfection as they have all done before in past films.<br/><br/>Overall this film is not to be missed. Its a great overall big screen experience that the guys over at Marvel are use to giving us over the recent years with their Avengers universe. The IMAX 3D is another great added experience if you get the chance to see it in that format. The IMAX as usual is a sight to behold, and while this was not shot in 3D the conversion for this film is not bad at all. So go out and see this film right away. It is well worth the price of admission."
"YasheshJ","8","2","4","6 April 2014"," Sounds such a cliché now, but Marvel does it once again. Winter Soldier is a powerful film in every aspect, helmed by a previously unheard duo of brothers. Kudos!
","Continuing after the cataclysmic events of ""Avengers"", the film focuses on the S.H.I.E.L.D. and its agents-primarily Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, and Nick Fury. The evil in the film is present throughout as an undercurrent--shuddery presence of the Winter Soldier and a bureaucratic leech.<br/><br/>Winter Soldier has the feel of a political thriller, yet delivers all the excitement of a mainstream action-adventure, aided by a good script, neat screenplay and just about right wittiness. When it comes to the cast, everyone delivers in tandem. Chris Evans keeps up the good work from the prequel. He is indeed one of the best casting in garb of superheroes--in fact, almost all Marvel characters have been transitioned to the big screen with utmost perfection. Do watch out for the great Stan Lee in one of his meatiest roles, just around a memorabilia museum! Captain America is the most morally correct superhero (probably next to only the blue blur or on par) and his belief in humanity is ever so unwavering. In a world full of turmoil and corruption he is the beacon of integrity friends, colleagues, and people in general look up to. Even someone as wary as Nick fury trusts Steve Rogers to an extent.<br/><br/>""First Avenger"" was a good film too; it rightly focused on the maturation of Captain America from a shy teenager into an icon. In that effort, supporting cast came out a little lopsided. ""Winter Soldier"" makes up for that. It gives enough screen time to the likes of Nick Fury (long time coming), Black Widow, and above all, S.H.I.E.L.D as an organization. Falcon and winter Soldier have been strategically under-exposed, it is expected that upcoming Captain America films will explore them in-depth, as a separate/parallel thread from ""Avengers."" Overall, ""Winter Soldier"" isn't just a big extravaganza; it has the same strength of character previously seen in Iron Man and X-Men First Class. Meaning, some more catching up to do for DC.<br/><br/>For fellow comic-book nerds! Bucky has been brought back at the right time. He might eventually take the Captain America mantle from Steven Rogers, as shown in the ""Death of Captain America"" and ""Fear Itself"" arc. The film itself sets the tone for that change. An inspiring and honest man like Steven Rogers is more useful weeding through a flawed, corrupt administration than as a field operative-impacting not just a mission or two but chastening the whole outlook.<br/><br/>Mid/post-credits: There is a lot in here and plenty of dissections to be made. A certain specter and an almost-immortal Nazi general are comprehensible, obviously cascading from previous films. However, there are some exciting, new additions: an object-manipulating female and a super speed male.<br/><br/>Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver will be more than handy in the upcoming battle against Ultron. Plus, are we right in perceiving an eventual, on screen bridge forming between the Avengers and X-Men via a famous father of the two new characters. It is not as apparent as the Captain America shield in the first Iron Man film, but provides some nerd-fodder to fuel the engine of imagination and possibilities! At last, Bucky pays the Smithsonian museum a visit--some goods signs, eh?<br/><br/>8.4/10"
"oscarxp25","9","2","4","5 April 2014"," All hail, Captain America!
","""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is not only the best Phase Two Marvel Movie but it is also in the ranks with ""The Dark Knight"" in terms of storytelling, directing, and acting. Oh, it is also one hell of a ride that is loads of fun. This movie has everything and nails every promise it made to give the title character the movie he deserved.<br/><br/>""Winter Solider' takes the approach of a conspiracy thriller and boy does it work. If you took the superheroes out of the picture, it still would have held up as an superbly written thriller. Joe Johnston has stepped down from the director's chair and the reigns have been given to Anthony and Joe Russo. The directors, who mostly did comedies, including directing a few episodes of ""Community"", seemed like an odd choice to take over an action film. While the film does have its moments of humor, it is quite serious. The Russos are more concerned about making the conspiracy plot work than gathering up a belly of laughs. It is not to say the picture isn't funny though. Their comedy background does help in giving light to the dark places this film goes.<br/><br/>Steve, who is Captain America when he is not kicking ass with that incredibly cool shield, lives the present day and is still learning about the years he has missed. He even has a checklist of things he must find out about when he has time for himself. When Nick Fury gets into a pickle, Steve is called to home base to talk to S.H.I.E.L.D. senior officer Alexander Pierce. Steve won't divulge what Fury told him at their last meeting and Pierce warns him that he will get the information no matter what. After this meeting Steve is labeled a fugitive and a person of interest. Along with Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and newcomer Sam Wilson, who later becomes Falcon, they try to go deeper with the information they have obtained.<br/><br/>That is a very brief rundown of the plot that contains many twists and turns. It does go a lot deeper and is a lot more interesting than that but half the fun of this film is experiencing it. The film is expertly paced and is quite interesting. As in 2005's ""Batman Begins"" the film is as interesting between action set pieces as it is when Falcon soars in the sky, with his mechanical wings, out running a number of heat seeking missiles. The plot in this thing is the best of any Marvel film to date. It is an intriguing puzzle that never acts like it is above the audience and forgets it is a comic book film.<br/><br/>A strong element in this film is the acting. Chris Evans, who was good in the original and ""The Avengers"" goes leagues beyond anything he did in those two movies here. Hell, this maybe his greatest role yet. Steve is a man who is starting to question his role, not only in S.H.I.E.L.D., but the world. His wide eyed innocence about the rules and how people like him are supposed to protect the world starts to crumble when he learns the shady dealings of the people he works underneath. He has grown into this role and made it his own as much as Bale did with Batman or Downey Jr. has with Iron Man. Steve is a fully fleshed out character that breaths and feels alive outside of the kick ass action scenes. Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie, who is plays Wilson/Falcon as a great admirer of Steve and is willing to risk everything to fight by his side, are great here too. Though they aren't as fleshed out as the title character, they do add to their characters quite a bit. Mackie as you can say ""earns his wings"" to be part of this epic universe. The real treat here is seeing the legendary Robert Redford play in a comic book movie. His performance is as serious and well played as any of the conspiracy thrillers he has been in during his career. It works extremely well and it looks like he has a blast doing it.<br/><br/>What about ""The Winter Solider""? Who is he and how does the Russos handle the character? The character doesn't say much at first but still comes off as deadly and dangerous. The Russos handle his scenes with brilliant care. The music and suspense are built up perfectly whenever he is on screen. You can feel the fear this man projects from being an unstoppable force. He is as dangerous as Steve because he has been enhanced to fight. Sebastian Stan plays this role as if Javier Bardem's, Anton Chigurh, from 2007's ""No Country for Old Men"", was dropped in a comic book universe. He is just an unstoppable killing machine with zero empathy. While Stan's Winter Solider is that way through brain washing, unlike naturally twisted Chigurh, he is still a frightening.<br/><br/>The action set pieces in the film are a marvel to experience. While the big set pieces, especially the ending battle, do flow nicely, it is the smaller battles that are just as impressive. Evans not only sells the emotional part of the character but the physical part as well. Captain America is fast, brutal, and expertly skilled at every type of skill a soldier, like him, would need in battle. One thing that many don't have is that shield. The shield really does shine in this film. The way it is incorporated into the battle scenes would make the coldest of men smile. You feel like a kid grinning ear to ear whenever Steve uses the shield as a weapon.<br/><br/>Steve's own personal story will continue from this film, even after the next ""Avengers"" installment, and if it is half of what this one was we are in for the treat."
"Life_in_Four_by_Three","9","2","4","5 April 2014"," A Captain for the Modern Times
","Abandoning the campy nature of the World War 2-era newsreels that influenced its predecessor for a more serious and modern tone, ""Captain America: The Winter Solider"" proves to be another outstanding addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Using espionage as a major story driver, Captain America, who is a bit less naive and more in tune with the world as it is now, finds himself in a tangled web of lies and deceit that makes the film feel less like a standard comic book movie and more like a spy thriller. <br/><br/>Chris Evans does a fantastic job of transitioning everyone's favorite shield throwing super hero into a more stern and figure-head type of leader as seen in the comics. This transition is helped out masterfully by the great performances of Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Redford, and Sebastian Stan. Mackie, who plays Sam Wilson, stands out big in this film, giving arguably his best performance since 2008's ""The Hurt Locker"".<br/><br/>While the film does super kick the viewer in the chest a bit with it's over the top action at times, some of it can be forgiven thanks in part to some incredible up-close fighting and choreography that might be the best seen yet in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Aesthetically, the film does a good job of using practical effects and CGI to create a vision that feels natural and one that keeps the attention of the viewer.<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Solider"" could be one of those sequels considered to be better than the original when all is said and done. Although the pacing of the film does have a few hiccups, the mixture of action, humor, and subtle nods to fans, supported by a fairly strong plot, make it a film worth seeing in the theaters a couple of times."
"tominator384","10","2","4","5 April 2014"," Marvel's Best to Date
","10/10. It's a phenomenal movie, and and instant all time favorite action flick for me. The action and fights are so, so , so well done. You can almost feel the thuds as Cap slams his shield into someone, or as Black Widow uses some crazy luchadore takedown move. The creators did a good job of framing the camera and shooting in a way that lets you get a great feel for the action. The action in this is simply state of the art. <br/><br/>The story is good, even outside of ""comic book movie standards"", which can tend to be a little campy and goofy. This story goes much, much deeper than ""good guy vs. bad"" and even touches on some issues in today's society relating to things like social media and government surveillance of the populace. All in all the story hits on a nice espionage angle, and it definitely provides a breath of fresh air to the ""Hulk smash"" solutions that Wolvie, Thor, Iran Man and umm.. The Hulk tend to resort to.<br/><br/>Character wise, I was impressed with the development they brought with this story. I was kind of ""meh"" on Cap's character before now, feeling that he was overshadowed by the other Avengers (namely Iron Man and Thor). Cap has always been the boy scout and loyal soldier in ""First Avenger"" and ""The Avengers"", but the creators took this movie as an opportunity to take his shining example and really flesh it out. He really comes across as a patriot and a man of high moral standards and integrity... yet is also 93 years old and out of place in our modern world. IMO, after this movie Cap is right up there with Wolverine and Tony Stark in terms of charisma. This is a character you want to see more of because he is the absolute embodiment of the ""selfless hero"". <br/><br/>And they really didn't overdo it with the heroic posing or bad boy attitudes that are so common in some other franchises... *cough* Iron Man *cough* Wolverine. Not to say I don't like those characters... But Cap offers something on the other end of that spectrum. It's a fresh improvement to the Avengers/Marvel lineup, and I'm really excited to see where Marvel is able to take this cast in the future. <br/><br/>Now I just can't wait for the DVD."
"WheelzFourReelz","9","2","4","5 April 2014"," Iron Man 3 and Thor The Dark World should start taking notes.
","The Phase 2 Marvel Avengers tie-in movies have been kind of under a dry spell. Sure, Iron Man 3 and Thor the Dark World were entertaining, but they were no where near capturing the essence of the Marvel movies like The Avengers and before did. However, if there was any movie to bring light into this phase 2 of Marvel movies, it would be Captain America the Winter Soldier. Ever since the first trailer came out for this, there was lots of promise. So the question is, was that promise fulfilled? In this movie, Steve Rogers is still getting used to the new world after being frozen and whatnot. He has been taken up by SHIELD to do missions. During a mission, he discovers a secret behind SHIELD that could put everyone's lives in jeopardy. So Captain America, along with Black Widow, has to discover this secret and put a stop to what's going on. And even encounter the Winter Soldier. I loved the plot for this movie. It was well written and it certainly got me engrossed into the movie. One of the things that made the story shine was how it developed the characters. It made you really care about them and in some cases, fear for them. The acting in this movie is well done. Chris Evans does an awesome job as Captain America and I can't picture anyone who could play him better. Sam Jackson was a great Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie was a great Falcon, Sebastian Stan was a great Winter Soldier, and Scarlett Johansson was a great Black Widow. It's also just fun to look at Scarlett Johansson so yeah. The action in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen. It contains action that looks real, brutal, and gritty. You feel every hit that's blown. The action's exciting and certainly made me giggle with excitement. And yes, guys can giggle. Despite all of this, I have a couple minor, nit-picky complaints. First is that I feel there are a couple scenes that feel out of place. The movie as a whole is pretty consistent with its necessary scenes, but there are a couple parts in the movie that seem out of place. (SPOILER WARNING!) One of them is the scene where Captain America meets with the girlfriend he left behind back in the 40s. It is a nice scene in its own right, but it feels out of place because nothing like this happens for the rest of the movie (SPOILER OVER!). This doesn't happen a lot, though. There's probably about three of these out of place points. I also wish that the Winter Soldier was in this movie more. The Winter Soldier is an absolutely awesome character and he certainly is a menace. However, I think that he wasn't in the movie quite enough for this movie to be called ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". Maybe about ten more minutes of screen time would be perfect. Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier was fun, exciting, intense, and funny without the humor completely overshadowing the material. This is certainly one of the best Avengers tie-in movies. Yes, The Avengers movie itself is still my favorite in the series, but it's a close call between Iron Man and this. This is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of the year and you absolutely need to see it. And don't leave before the credits. Just saying."
"vladberez","8","2","4","4 April 2014"," Nick Fury gets his own fight scene: that's all I need
","While keeping to the theme of ""Avengers universe"" and its sequels, ""Winter Soldier"" extends the overall universe plot forward as well as gives us a closer look at the characters in question. By throwing in elements of a mystery/conspiracy plot, we(the viewers) were given the little bit extra we needed to keep us entertained. I was happy to see them trying new things with this movie.<br/><br/>Besides the plot, witch in itself pushes the series forward as a whole, and leaves endless amount of paths for future films to take, the (arguably) main element of the film, being the action, was surprisingly quite defiant. It brought me back to the days were dropping a penny wouldn't lead to an 18 second slow motion shot of a nuclear explosion. The focus on hand to hand combat, from beginning to end, really did make it that much more exiting. Even the few gun fight ended up being just a prologue for a really bad-ass shield vs. knife fight.<br/><br/>After the events of the movie, we really have our first clue as to what the next (direct) big thing in line (""Avengers:age of Ultron"") will be about. The new-chapter-type ending, and possible new antagonist, weapons, and certainly new characters, give me a very good feeling about sequels to come, and really marvel movies in general.<br/><br/>The short of it is, that this movie is yet another step into the right direction for greater things to come. And if that doesn't sound like something worth seeing, then I don't know what is."
"drew_atreides","9","2","4","4 April 2014"," Marvel Phase 2 finally has a great one
","The first IRON MAN was the movie that put the MARVEL franchise on the map, but i always felt like the best film of the cycle was, surprisingly, the first THOR. It came out of nowhere to really blow me away, as I was never really much of a THOR fan.<br/><br/>Going into Phase 2.0 of the Marvel flicks i have to admit that I'd been disappointed with the offerings so far. IRON MAN 3 probably stands as the worst film in the franchise thus-far, and my high hopes for a repeat of THOR's success was sadly letdown by THOR 2.<br/><br/>I started to wonder if the Marvel movies hadn't lost a step. I shouldn't have worried, as CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER has arrived. With tremendous action, great characters and a smart script that respects its audience, i have to say that this could very well be THE best Avengers movie yet. <br/><br/>Nevermind the next AVENGERS movie (which of course i am excited for), but I can't wait for CAPTAIN America 3, and the search for the Winter Soldier!!<br/><br/>Great job, Marvel!"

","Witty and charming humor, incredible suspense, and action that'll put you on the edge of your seat. Captain America: The Winter Soldier surpassed my expectations and was definitely better than the first. This movie probably had some of the best fighting sequences and action scenes in any Marvel movie yet. That alone is impressive. It was kind of like Star Wars meets Marvel in some scenes. Unfortunately, that means the special effects were on par with Star Wars circa the 1980s, but they were well done when they needed to be, along with the cinematography. I guess that's the case for all big budget action movies. The overall movie had a heroic plot line and the characters were all incredibly written and decently acted. Although, I could tell where the writers tried to avoid holes in the plot. The big reveals were pulled off perfectly and the introduction of Falcon was great. I think, he should get his own movie. Come on Marvel...please! Anyway, I hope everyone likes it as much as I did."

","Another year, another collection of Marvel films, and fresh off the starting blocks is this sequel to the surprisingly decent First Avenger. A tour de force of action and humour, this is Marvel studios at their best. Chris Evans does a great job of playing Captain America, giving him the charisma and soul that he seemed to lack in the Avengers. Johansson was convincing as Black Widow, and seems to be getting noticeably better at acting with every film she does. Samuel L Jackson provides old school relief as Nick Fury, and has a much more substantial role this time round. The only disappointment for me was the Winter Soldier himself, who after being introduced as a mysterious and seemingly indestructible and lethal antagonist, gets watered down massively prior to the conclusion. Speaking of the conclusion, it felt a tad....well, stock to me. Overall though, it's highly entertaining viewing, especially for comic fans..."

","I found the first one pretty bad, thus I was reluctant to go see this one too. Thankfully, having watched a promising trailer, I went to the cinema to watch this... oh yeah!<br/><br/>This turned out to be one of my favorite films of all time and it made me a great fan of Captain America's character due to his ethos. It's remarkable, that initially, from the first movie, I found that same character completely dull. I should also mention the amazing bad guy (the Winter Soldier), who is almost as appealing - if not more - than Captain America!<br/><br/>In a current world filled with superhero movies with generic/shallow plots & characters and with kids as the only target group (too many over-simplifications so that the story can move forward), Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a gem! It doesn't just differentiate from that superhero mass, it's also one of the greatest action spy (superhero) films.<br/><br/>
P.S. I've gone to the cinema for very few MARVEL and even less DC films, intentionally. I wasn't convinced from the trailers. I have watched almost all of the MARVEL ones though, because of curiosity. Hats off for their very successful blockbuster machine based on inter-connection between the plots of all their films (though often in an ultimately insignificant way!) and, hence, addiction. I do want to mention my 5 most noticeable films from them. Thor 2 and Avengers 2 were kind of enjoyable. Captain America: Civil War was good I guess, although ultimately, I think I was satisfied more because of the hype to the release and less because of the actual film - I didn't like the bitter taste it left me with. Then, Avengers: Infinity War was bitterly addictive. And lastly, Avengers: Endgame was a complete let-down. A complete let-down. Thankfully, that last one - the so-called culmination - made me come to the healthy conclusion... that I'm done with superhero movies! I choose to remember only Captain America: The Winter Soldier!"

","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is probably in the TOP 3 MCU movies, especially in the last few years. It shines bright with all of the characters involved, the chemistry between Rogers and Natasha, the involvment than Nick Fury had in the movie, the villain that is the Winter Soldier, Falcon was also awesome and pretty much involved throughout the whole movie. The return of Hydra was something I did not expect since I am not a fan of the comics and I don't know what to expect, but man, was the think with that Zola AI cool as hell. I wonder what would it be if he(it) was just a bit more involved and had more screen time. The movie is around two and a half hours long and it doesn't ever get boring.

","The winter break gave me an opportunity to rewatch a film that, in retrospect, was probably the first film in the MCU to really nail the tone, approach and quality that the series has maintained since. I'm not decrying the earlier films, or suggesting that all the films have maintained this level since but here is where there Russo brothers announced themselves to the series and Markus and McFeely found the right beats that would serve them into the Civil and Infinity Wars.<br/><br/>With both World War 2 and the Battle of New York behind him, Steve Rogers struggles to catch up with the years lost in the frozen ice. He soon learns that far from diminishing over the years, the threats to sovereignty have become both more insidious and ideological. When a legendary ghost agent, nicknamed ""The Winter's Soldier"" attacks Nick Fury, it sets into motion a chain of events that turn S.H.I.E.L.D against Rogers and lead him, and a small band of allies, to a desperate battle to save both millions of lives and the soul of the country.<br/><br/>""Winter's Soldier"" is, for me, the first time that Marvel realised that they could make other genres of films, utilising their characters (and exaggerating the fight scenes) and move away from the standard superhero plots. The film is a spy thriller, with Steve Rogers, shorn of the advantages that being a SHIELD agent provided him, but forced to stand up to them anyway. Tonally, it's about perfect. A grave threat and a personal issue, assuaged against smart funny scenes of character interaction. It does pull through some of the story threads from ""Avengers Assemble"" to, with Roger's mistrust of Nick Fury's preventative measures tactics again becoming a friction point between the two of them. The film allows for both Sam Jackson's Nick Fury and Scarlett Johansen's Black Widow to show more of the range of their characters, some cracks in their demeanours.<br/><br/>Cinematography and direction are great, many of the effects done practically and some of the shots, like the initial rescue assault on a SHIELD research ship, are staggering. It's not perfect though. The stories two big reveals, of the identity of The Winters Soldier and the loyalties of some of the characters is fairly predictable. It sags a little once the opening is done and the fact that the villains constantly underestimate the heroes, despite working alongside them for a while doesn't really make sense.<br/><br/>All in all though, this film is a big step into where the MCU stands now and still is one of the best in the series as I write the review."

"geralts","Null","0","0","24 December 2018"," Great sequel to the Captain America saga
","This is an improvement on its predecessor. The first two-thirds of The Winter Soldier almost feel more like a Cold War-era espionage thriller than a superhero movie. The movie concludes with the expected special effects-laden battles and beat-the-clock action but those scenes are composed more coherently than related sequences in similar movies. And, although The Winter Soldier is available in 3-D, it's perfectly capable of being enjoyed in the less expensive 2-D format. The Winter Soldier is effectively paced with enough action to keep things moving but not so much that it overwhelms everything. One of the keys to the film's efficacy is that it takes the time to develop the relationships among the four key members. The narrative contains its share of unpredictable elements and isn't afraid to shake up the status quo."

","Captain America the first avenger was wasted potential the first half was great and the second half felt rushed.
The sequel however is great better than the first movie.<br/><br/>TONE
The tone in this movie is very different from the tone in the last movie.
Captain America and the first avengers was a Science fiction-film, but they changed that in the Winter soldier and made the movie into a Thriller.
I like the tone better in this one.
It's a tone that is different from Marvel but not to different so that the movie doesn't fit in with the MCU the thing that The incredible hulk did.<br/><br/>ACTION
This is a fast paced movie, the main plot already starts at the 10 minute mark.
It's good that it's fast paced it keeps the viewer interested.
The choreography for the action is pretty good.
The russo brothers have always managed to make good Action and Fight scenes.
The ne in the first movie was pretty bad.
The best one in the movie was when Bucky and Steve first fought each other.
The choreo was amazing and the different techniques they used to fight was really cool and the fight scene was overall well thought out but the final act was the only part where the fighting sucked.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
The villain sucked.
there was actually two villains, The winter soldier and Alexander pierce both of them where bad.
The winter soldier barely talked through out the movie he wasn't even there through out the movie.
They should have developed Winter soldier so that we would like him more as a villain and if not that they could have made Alexander pierce a better villain.
His motive ""Kill 20 million to save 7 billion"" it's basically the same as i want to destroy the world but they lazily changed it up a bit.
If the winter soldier sucked as a villain and Alexander pierce was a good villain then it would be okay but because both of them sucked it's not okay.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
The characters are pretty good.
Steve rogers was good, Black widow was good, Sam wilson was meh and Nick fury was meh.
They managed to develop Steve rogers more as character and him wanting to do the right thing no matter what happens to him really ads to his character.
Black widow was also good we get to know her better as a character but Sam wilson and Nick fury didn't have much development but i like Nick fury more because of this movie and how important he is in this movie.<br/><br/>FINAL ACT
Let me keep this short.
The final act was a mess.
really mediocre to bad action.
The final battle between Steve and Bucky didn't have any stakes nor did it carry any weight it was all boring action.
But that's just how i feel.<br/><br/>VERDICT
Just watch the movie"

","Junto con Guardians of the Galaxy (y quizás Endgame), The Winter Soldier es uno de lo mejor que lel UCM tiene para ofrecer, al menos como películas individuales y no como el Universo que pretenden ser. Con Guardians of the Galaxy vimos el punto de autenticidad que se necesitaba, y en Endgame vimos una culminación más que satisfactoria de 10 años de un universo compartido. Pero es en The Winter Soldier donde vemos lo más excepcional que han hecho, aquí es donde Marvel rompe sus propias reglas para ofrecer un trabajo de calidad más allá del Universo anterior que crearon y el futuro que prevén. Mientras Guardians of the Galaxy exagera el humor típico de su franquicia para hacer algo diferente, aquí el humor es casi invisible, y si lo hace es tan pequeño que no se siente como una burla como lo es el Doctor Extraño o las dos primeras partes. de Thor, pero presenta una película que se toma en serio, pero sin caer pretenciosamente como Black Panther o incluso más allá, como The Dark Knight, pero sí lo suficientemente serio como para mantener al espectador realmente comprometido con la acción que sucede. Estos son pequeños momentos de seriedad que se extienden a lo largo y que, al ser tan simples e incluso pasar desapercibidos, rompen las reglas del género para ofrecer algo nuevo y sin caer, otra vez, en la pretensión y la pedantería. Momentos como la escena en el ascensor, la escena entre el Soldado de Invierno, Alexander Pierce y la empleada de Pierce, o incluso la reaparición de Zola en un punto de la trama con una revelación que marca significativamente las creencias de nuestros protagonistas, estos momentos que transgreden lo que esperábamos de una película de la UCM y que nos dan esperanzas sobre su futuro, un futuro con películas que se toman en serio y que principalmente toman en serio a su público sin faltarles el respeto con películas como Doctor Strange, o Ant Man ( pero que sufre de casi los mismos problemas que el resto) o Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 (cuyo único valor radica en que finalmente se aprovechan de la fotografía que habían descuidado tanto). El Soldado de Invierno es, sin duda, el punto más alto de la UCM, al menos por ahora."

","~Review originally posted via Instagram (at ""@oratiosanctus"") on May 20th, 2018.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>In a post-Infinity War world, does a film like The Winter Soldier still hold its place in the Marvel ranks as one of its best? The simple answer, yes. When the task came to create a Captain America sequel that followed on from the events of The Avengers (2012), the task fell to the Russo Brothers (then newcomers to Marvel Studios) to create a film where the stakes felt higher than ever. How do you do that? By writing an espionage thriller that compromises the very agency the heroes always thought they could rely on, S.H.I.E.L.D.<br/><br/>Watching this film again after a fair few years past, I was delighted by how well it still holds up; not only as a superhero flick but as a riveting and hard-edged drama. At its core, this is essentially a film that is a story of brothers: both new and old; one's gained and those lost. It's there The Winter Soldier finds its heart. Even if you remove the excellent action set-pieces that drive a huge part of this movie or the gorgeous cinematography that fill its almost every frame, the performances by each member of the cast - from Chris Evans' Steve Rogers/Captain America to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, to Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury and Cobie Smulder's Maria Hill - is the movie's real strength. The actor's performances are carried home by these threatened notions of family and the comfort that had once come with that.<br/><br/>Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon gives a wonderful turn in this movie, breathing life into the picture as a likeable ally to Cap, but it's with Sebastian Stan's phenomenal turn as the mysterious Winter Soldier that the film finds its true standout. No longer the Bucky we knew, he is every bit as shocking and threatening as he needed to be and Stan's performance is one driven by tragedy and emotional loss. He is utterly convincing in the role.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier holds its place as one of the MCU's most consistent films to date, and is a must-watch for all Marvel fans."
"shanethedane","10","0","0","18 May 2018"," When Captain America Meets a 70's Spy Thriller
","Captain America's second solo outing in the MCU was something that I wasn't sure about at first. Some plot points can be a bit confusing upon your first viewing if you are not paying super close attention to every little detail. However, upon my second viewing, it all came together. In my opinion, there are only 3 comic book films that are good movies, not just superhero movies. These are movies with deep characters and complex story elements. Those 3 movies are Dark Knight, Logan, and Winter Soldier; this movie is amazing. First off, this film really does Captain America justice. He is so awesome in this movie. Just in the first ten minutes you really start to buy into the idea that he is the greatest soldier in history. I like the Russo brothers vision of the character in this film. Cap is the definition of the American Dream; the moral guy who was your great neighbor; but now in 2014, things aren't exactly the same. He quickly realizes he can't just trust anybody that easily, even his allies. Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff are fantastic characters to have in this film for that exact reason. We know Cap can trust them, but they are still very, very complex people with shady personalities. SHIELD is hiding very big secrets and when Cap has an unknown mercenary after him, things get more out of hand. The pacing in this film is excellent. It has frequent action but there is one time where roughly 25 minutes go by without any action, but I wasn't bored at all, The things that happen in there are interesting story and character building. The film has a great look. The CGI is polished in a way that fits well with this political thriller theme. A lot of people don't like this movie, and I sort of understand, it's easy to get lost. If you know what is going on though, this film is so much deeper than it appears. Next time you have family movie night, give this one a watch!"
"jcruz-42957","8","0","0","25 April 2018"," Captain America: The Winter Soldier: 8.4
","Although not as good as the first, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is on the same level as the first. From a Wartime Adventure in the first movie, this sequel jumps to the spy thriller genre. An excellent choice for a modern day Cap film, but it still has a sliver of that Wartime American pride to it. The action is ramped up in this movie to a fast moving, hard hitting punch fest that reminds you just how dangerous Captain America really is. The bar is set high in the beginning, and throughout the film that bar is either reached or passed with every new action sequence. One of the best sequences involves just Nick Fury on his own, and it contains some of the best action in the Marvel Universe. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury has never been more badass. From his action scenes to his awesome one liners this film squeezes all they can out of Nick Fury and it's never worked better. Unlike many other Marvel Movies, The Winter Soldier is a really good and lethal villain. He can go toe to toe with Cap and even make you question if he's better. You get the sense that his metal arm is something to avoid at all costs. The other side villains also earn their part in the film well. What also is very enjoyable to watch is how Steve Rogers lives in this new world, and how he struggles to face the fact that line between good and bad isn't as clear as it used to be. It's a very well done challenge that he has to face. Black Widow is back and she's even more entertaining then she was in The Avengers. Along with Steve her presence is elevated to new levels of lethality, and she's works great as one of Cap's companions. The other companion being The Falcon, who works as a fun new sidekick for Steve Rogers. The film succeeds on every aspect with only few head scratching moments to make the rest of the story work, but those few scenes that lack sense lead to story threads that make up for it entirely. Overall, this cold, hard, and intense spy thriller serves the character of Steve Rogers well, while also giving new levels of depth to returning characters and adding memorable new characters around him. So I give it an 8.4"

","This was so much better than I was expecting! Sure, I liked the first Captain America film, but in reality, he's not Marvel's strongest character - just their version of Superman, but he CAN die from a bullet. However, they were smart with this one, bringing in a strong cast to back Cap up - with familiar faces Black Widow (Johansson), Nick Fury (Jackson), Maria Hill (Smulders), Jasper Sitwell (Hernández) and Senator Stern (Shandling) all in at least one of the other films or the TV show - plus Falcon (Mackie) and Senator Pierce (Redford) as the new additions. The biggest mystery - if you haven't read the comics - is who the Winter Soldier is, and it does a pretty good job of the reveal (no spoilers here!). The whole film flows on nicely from the 'The First Avenger' and 'The Avengers'.<br/><br/>I was really happy with the pacing - it does a great job of reintroducing the familiar characters and bringing in the new ones and then there's plenty of action and great set-pieces - most on a scale I didn't believe Captain America could/would accommodate. And there's plenty of humour too, even when the characters are in dire straits. It also works well for the first 90min or so as a pretty great mystery, with plenty of curve-balls and ""did that really happen?"" moments. This is really fun to watch, as you get to see more of Steve Rogers as a character, rather than Captain America, the warrior. It's also nice to see Cap and Black Widow spending time together not fighting enemies - although I'm biased, because I would watch Scarlett Johansson in anything! But the best parts are still the action sequences - they've given Cap some great moves and it's just plain fun to watch him and how they've filmed it.<br/><br/>The Stan Lee cameo/one-liner is great and links in nicely with an earlier scene and Danny Pudi from Community even gets a pretty funny scene. It's also nice to see Fury play a more pivotal role, rather than one or two small scenes. The plot gets a little absurd near the end, but it gives Cap, Black Window and Falcon a mission and sets up a huge battle in the final 20min. There's sure to be some repercussions from the events of this film. And we only have to wait two years until the next Captain America film, which is a good thing, seeing how well made this one was. As always, stay until after the end titles for a very revealing scene!"

","'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is a film that needs no introduction. What directors Joe and Anthony Russo (who, might I add, were originally known for their work on comedies before they were hired to direct this) managed to accomplish with this film is quite impressive. Simply put, they managed to give us one of the most tightly-scripted outings of the MCU with a story that pays homage to classic 70's spy thrillers while also addressing Captain America's jump from the simpler days of World War II to the morally grey ordeals of the modern world. And it's all tied to one of the MCU's greatest twists that takes the franchise in a completely new direction. The action sequences are incredible and Chris Evans, Scarlett Johannsson, and Samuel L. Jackson shine in arguably their greatest turns as Cap, Black Widow, and Nick Fury, respectively.<br/><br/>Now with that said, admittedly I wouldn't call this one my absolute favorite MCU film to date. Still, I very much appreciate this film for everything that it did for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For one thing, it helped revitalize the franchise after the admittedly rocky year that it had in 2013 as evident from the polarizing 'Iron Man 3' and the not-so-popular 'Thor: The Dark World'. Plus, its iconic twist allowed Marvel Studios' first TV series, 'Agents of SHIELD', to finally find its groove after a rocky start. Thus, it may not be my #1 favorite, but it's certainly in the Top 5."

","Captain America The Winder Soldier: Movie Review.<br/><br/>Captain America The Winter Soldier is one of the best film by Marvel. The film has very rock solid character developments and moments, superb cast characters performances,top notch quality storytelling and beautiful visual effects. Captain America The Winter Soldier is visually dazzling, political conspiracy suspenseful thriller with strong cast performances and surprising intense and intriguing storyline and plot twist. The movie looks visually stunning.<br/><br/>The direction is amazing and Chris Evans is awesome as Captain America. Chris Evans with his charismatic charming personality and has made the character of Captain America looks great and emotionally enjoyable. Scarlett Johansson is fabulous as always. She has once again given a truly solid performance as Black Widow and Samuel L.Jackson is incredible as Nick Fury. Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier and Robert Redford as the main villains have also done a good job. The plot and story sometimes seems to be off the course and little bit rushed in the portrayals of main villains. Some CGI shots lacks realism and feels little bit overdone. All over Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a great movie and it is also one of the best movies of Marvel Studios and a great addition to Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others.

","Marvel delivers is best movie yet with a film that nails it on every front. The story, writing, directing, action, effects, cast performance were all top notch. It made Cap into my new favorite character as he is no longer the boy scout we saw in the First Avenger and in the Avengers. The Russo bros. proved that they can be true leaders in the MCU and their future with this franchise is guaranteed to be great.<br/><br/>Starting with the cast, Chris Evans proves he can be a leading man in big films. As Rogers, he showed all sides being humorous, humble, powerful and threatening. They could have made it depressing having Cap deal with being defrosted and outliving all his friends and loved ones. Having him with a list of things with watch and read was funny. Meeting with Peggy, who is still alive but with dementia, was sweet but still really heartbreaking. Johansson's Romanoff was as good as Evans and she is showed much more dimensions to her character. She showed that she wants a true friend in Cap. I love what the Russo bros said about Widow and Cap how they are work wife/work husband. As there is romantic/sexual tension between them but they trust each other enough that they know the need each other professionally. Mackie's Falcon was awesome too, as he is a new partner for Cap that showed so much swagger. He also had a great insight into being a veteran of war that meshed well with Rogers. The villains were great too. Redford's Pierce was great as a tactical leader of Hydra. He brought enough charisma into his performance that did not diminish the power he had and the brutality he delivers. Winter Soldier was also awesome as he proved to be just like Cap, and I won't reveal his true identity, but his effect against Cap, both physically and psychologically, was well acted by both Evans and Stan. <br/><br/>The story in this film was incredible, cohesive and thought- provoking. The idea of how freedom can be difficult to control as it is, by it's definition, independent from any control was well done as Cap adjusts to the new world. The writing, dialogue, humor was also amazing from the directors who did Arrested Development and Community and the screenwriters also created Agent Carter helped writing for other good Marvel movies. The action in this movie, especially fight choreography was simply breathtaking. The infiltration on the freighter, the elevator fight, the highway fight and the final battle, is some of the best choreography made in any action film. The effects were minimized for this film, which I really appreciate as the practical effects and stunt choreography was perfect. The helicarriers and Falcon in flight were very well done and looked so real over the Potomac river.<br/><br/>I really don't have a complaint for this film but there are a few tiny things that bother me. Why didn't they call in the Avengers in the final scene? Iron Man was supposedly retired but Hulk still could have helped. Why are so many people in the MCU dead but not really? Does anyone stay dead? I mean there are villains but basically no heroes die.<br/><br/>But those are very tiny things in an almost perfect superhero movie.<br/><br/>+ Cap and Widow relationship + Cast performances all around + Writing, directing, story + Impeccable action, effects and stunts - Tiny, tiny problems that you can only overthink<br/><br/>Final Score: 9.7/10"

Apparently some people don't understand the difference between good and evil, while others find the little things to nitpick at, like the bad guys not shooting at Cap's feet when he's running at them with his shield."

","This movie manages to stay out of superhero clichés and manages to be a realistic and logical action- thriller. Intro part is very attracting and casting Georges St-Pierre, one of the best MMA fighters ever, as Batroc is a very good choice. Hand-to-hand combat scenes and highway combat scenes are realistic and professional. The movie touches the theme of freedom, which is what Captain America stands for, elegantly."

","KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE <br/><br/>Lets say there is an old recipe and we want to try something different to taste it even better. So, it is important to mix the right ingredients in the recipe to make its taste exquisite. The same goes for the movie here. But in this case the director hits the right spot in terms of mixing the ingredients and the result is also very tasteful.<br/><br/>Kingsman tells a story of a young boy Eggsy who is extra ordinarily brilliant in everything but is withdrawn because of his personal problems. He is recruited in Kingsman secret organization by Harry Hart (Colin Firth) who is in fact a brilliant agent and 17 years ago owed his life to Eggsy's father. Eggsy plays an vital role to track down and destroy the eccentric millionaire Richard Valentine (Samuel Jackson) who is very keen to wipe out the worlds population.<br/><br/>We may have heard this kind of plot many times before. But Mathew Vaughn does an incredible job in bringing freshness in the movie. It is very stylishly filmed with witty dialog and a good script with constant twists which will keep audiences to the edge of their seats. One notable thing is that the action sequences in this film are very different compared to other action movies. The camera work during the action scenes is remarkable. For instance, there is a 10 minute action scene in a church will blow you away. Mathew Vaugn didn't use a lot of VFX effects or a lot of technical aspects during the action scenes, but he placed his cameras brilliantly which allowed him to show it in slow and fast motion which are is effective while watching. This movie may also be compared to 007 movie because of the freaky gadgets like granite lighter, poison in the pen etc. But of course its not bond at all. It may very well be called as Vaughn's ode to the spy movies.<br/><br/>When we talk about the performances, Samuel Jackson tops the chart. After Django unchained he once again proves that he can be one hell of a bad ass villain. Colin firth is having time of his life because comparing to the Kings Speech(2012) this must be relatively easy role for him and he gives a commendable performance. Its incredible that he did all the stunts on his own in this venture. Mark strong is reliable actor who doesn't disappoints. But all the credit goes to the director who seems to be in total control. After X men: first class, he left X men: Days of the future past to direct this movie. I must admire his passion for taking one of the biggest risks through this movie and succeeding in it. <br/><br/>What I felt short about this movie is that sometimes I got the essence of a little Christopher Nolan in the film. The way story is constructed from the beginning resembles to the way Nolan usually does in his movies. The violence in the movie some viewers may find graphic, but I am okay with that. I found editing of the movie as a shortcoming because there were 1-2 week scenes in the movie which couldn't have made any difference to the story if they were cut.<br/><br/>To sum it up, despite of some minor flaws, ultra violent action, King. n is one hell of a roller coaster ride and I think every entertainment seeker should take that ride."

","My expectations was not huge for this second part of Captain America, but I was fascinated. The story was great and the film was made perfectly. I am a fan of MARVELS and watched all films that are released. In my opinion the best films that have been made in the series of Marvel come first: ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", followed by ""The Avengers"" and ""Iron Man 3"". Now I'm looking forward to come ""The Avengers 2"" and of course next year ""Captain America: Civil Var"".

Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson (Captain America and Black Widow) both have great chemistry and they work very well together. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is amazing. He still plays the part very well. Sebastian Stan, who plays the Winter Soldier isn't in the film much, but when he is on screen, he kills it. Anthony Mackie as Falcon is really good.

The best secret dropper in all Marvel history. James Buchanan Barnes, aka Bucky aka Steve's dead best friend, is actually the Winter Soldier. The words ""Bucky? Who the hell is Bucky?"" made my heart stop. That one line was just wow. The fact that Sebastian Stan, the actor who plays Bucky, didn't have a lot to say, he said it through emotions. Sadness, confusion, anger. He played Bucky perfectly. This was the best Marvel movie of all times at the moment.

"brando647","8","0","0","12 February 2015"," Marvel Scores with a Brutal, Grounded Comic Film in WINTER SOLDIER
","Marvel scores again with the third film in their Phase II line with CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER. It's especially impressive considering Captain America has personally been the least interesting character in the MCU Avengers. I enjoy the movies (FIRST AVENGER was really good) but the character just doesn't grab my attention in the fantastic way Iron Man, the Hulk, and even Thor have. But after the awesomeness of IRON MAN 3 and the better-than-anticipated THOR: THE DARK WORLD, we're given a new spin on the superhero genre as the latest Captain America adventure has more in common with a political thriller than any of the Marvel films that have come before. This film saw a major shakedown of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as major changes took effect, and it managed to prove that Captain America is a force to be reckoned with all his own. As the movie begins, we find that Captain America)/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has continued working with S.H.I.E.L.D. since the events of THE AVENGERS. A routine hostage extraction puts Rogers at odds with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) over S.H.I.E.L.D. and its habit of withholding information, and the matter intensifies when Fury reveals Project: Insight. Insight finds S.H.I.E.L.D. launching three new helicarriers capable of eliminating hundreds of thousands of enemies in an instant, and Rogers worries about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s plan of maintaining peace through fear tactics. Within hours of the revelation, an assassin is dispatched against Nick Fury, and Rogerswith the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) must turn fugitive when S.H.I.E.L.D. turns its sights on him.<br/><br/>With all the bombastic comic films coming to the big screen, it's a concern that we might become oversaturated and burnt-out on the genre. I love that Marvel is finding ways to keep their films feeling fresh. WINTER SOLDIER is easily the least flashy comic film I've seen. It's grounded in reality (as real as a super soldier can be, anyway) and its action is hard-hitting and brutal instead of flashy and spastic. When Captain America goes into action, it's no different than a Bourne or modern Bond film. It's all beat downs and bullet casings. I can also respect that it's the only Marvel film so far without the colorful, grandiose villain. The film's actual villain is a pretty major plot point that I won't spoil (but I figured it out pretty fast) and the Winter Soldier is merely a tool at his or her disposal. Anyone semi-familiar with Marvel canon knows the Winter Soldier's true identity but the movie seems to play it off as a surprise so, again, I won't say anything here in the event someone new to the material might be reading this in hopes of a recommendation. Despite not being as larger-than-life as previous Marvel film villains, the Winter Soldier is one of the coolest. A fellow super-soldier, he's the only man who can go head-to-head with the legendary Captain America and pose a threat. He's a cold-blood murder machine and the enemy's most dangerous weapon.<br/><br/>Aside from the Winter Soldier (a fantastic addition to the MCU that I can't wait to explore further), the film also introduces the Falcon. As with the rest of the movie, he's presented in a quasi-realistic fashion. Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) is a military vet spending his time volunteering with those returning from service with PTSD. When Captain America comes along requesting for help, he's all about it, utilizing a piece of experimental flight technology and, boom, a new MCU hero is born. He doesn't get much to do until the final half of the movie but you can tell he's doing to be a popular addition to the franchise. Black Widow gets the expanded role she's been due, Evans continues to prove that there was no better choice to inhabit the red/white/blue costume, and the movie culminates in a franchise-warping revelation that'll switch things up a bit for future movies & television series. Despite its thriller vibe, action fans get plenty to enjoy with an extended sequence in the final act of the film where Captain America and Falcon get time to throw down. My personal favorite moment comes halfway through the film and, despite being a primarily exposition scene, features the return of Arnim Zola (Toby Jones, reprising the role from the first film). It doesn't quite feel like a Marvel film but there's plenty here to remind you that this movie does in fact take place in a universe that's still recovering from an alien invasion. CAPTAIN America: WINTER SOLDIER is the least comic book-ish of Marvel's film stable but that adds to its appeal, and I imagine that makes this film the most easily accessible film for those who aren't necessarily in the market for a grandiose superhero movie."

","Captain America The Winter Soldier seamlessly utilizes umber of innovative techniques to create a film that seems to seamlessly merge the real world with the fictitious Marvel Cinematic Universe. Using the ""political thriller"" genre for the basis of this movie proved to be very successful as it help give the story that relatable, realistic factor that the first movie lacked. The different approach that the director's took with Captain America also helped elevate not only the movie, but also the status of the Super Soldier himself. The deciding factor that puts this movie above other typical superhero movies is its villain. The Winter Soldier was a perfect choice for the villain, an helped introduce the more darker tone that most Marvel movies lack. However, Captain America The Winter Soldier does have its fair share of cons, with the movie at times being a little to cliché, but overall, it still manages to prevail as one of the best action movies of all time."
"ciccarellis","10","0","0","6 February 2015"," You'll Yield When Cap Throws His Mighty Shield!
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an exception film in every way and far superior to Captain America: The First Avenger, which fails to meet the standards set by this film. Captain America has left the demigod brothers and uncanny magic from the Avengers behind and has settled down in Washington D.C., living the life as a SHIELD agent beside Director Nick Fury and fellow Avenger Natasha Romanoff. One of the first things you will notice in this film is that it gives off a more realistic aura than other Marvel movies. There is no more chitauri or Thor's other-worldly abilities; everything in the film is of this world and could realistically occur. The characters, especially newcomer Sam Wilson, feel relatable. Sam Wilson and Steve instantly connect upon learning that both of them served in the military. Not everyone is a secret agent, but even Natasha Romanoff can relate to some viewers with her witty comebacks and her enjoyable personality. The script was phenomenally written! Many of the characters have lines that will stick with you even after the film's running time. Black Widow's speech at the end sent shivers down my spine. More importantly, during those dark, grim, and serious scenes, the screenwriters find a way to add some humor, which lightens the mood. The score is very fitting to the tone of the movie and compliments the action scenes very well. Emotion isn't really a word most people would correlate with a superhero action flick, but in this case, Marvel has found a way into our hearts. After the death of James ""Bucky"" Barnes in Captain America: The First Avenger, most viewers presumed him dead but Marvel decided to revive Steve's childhood best friend and bring him back as the notorious Winter Soldier. The final fight scene between Steve and Bucky, although it may be brutal and intense, will make your heart throb with emotion. The plot of the movie was thoroughly thought out and leaves no room for error. This film is riddled with plot twists, including the fact that Hydra has been secretly working under the noses of SHIELD agents. However, this came as a complete and total shock and somewhat felt as though they pulled it out of nowhere as the previous Marvel movies did nothing to set this up. Bucky comes back as the lethal Winter Soldier which was a shock to most. The Winter Soldier makes for a very intimidating antagonist. The action scenes with the Winter Soldiers are some of the most gritty, brutal, and captivating fight scenes of the century. The hand-to-hand combat between Steve and the Winter Soldier is excellently choreographed. The acting was stunning and realistic. Chris Evans does an amazing job portraying the loyal and patriotic behavior of Cap. Scarlett Johansson gives Black Widow a spunk we didn't see in the Avengers. Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier did a great job acting with just his eyes, as the Winter Soldier had minimum lines throughout the film. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a must see for any die-hard Marvel fan and I completely recommend it for anyone just in the mood to enjoy a movie. I assure you ... this film will not disappoint..."

"drqshadow-reviews","7","0","0","26 January 2015"," A Bright, Noisy Take on the Political Potboiler
","A nice rummage through the genre bin in search of a hybrid that hadn't yet seen the light of day: the action / adventure / superhero / political thriller. It's enjoyable enough, if a touch on the shallow, superficial side. Though it runs a bit long, I don't feel like the drama was given quite enough time to simmer and skeptics will see right through an early plot twist involving a major death (or two). The action scenes look and feel great, though, with an emphasis on physical effects in lieu of CG that pays big dividends. Scarlett Johansson gets a lot of screen time, much more than I'd expected, but feels purposeful and at-home, where Anthony Mackie's equal turn as Falcon seems forced and irrelevant. Of course, Chris Evans is vanilla but strong in the leading role and Sebastian Stan is appropriately cool-looking, if slightly under-explored, as his momentary nemesis the Winter Soldier. They probably should've kept the mask on longer, though; he seems far less menacing and visually striking without. I'm really struggling to understand why this didn't feel more substantial than it did. Even Cap's most appealing personality quirk - his disconnection from the trappings of modern society - gets little more than a cursory glance. Good but middle-of-the-pack in the Marvel family."
"john32935","7","0","0","20 January 2015"," Marvel successfully breaks away from its own mold
","With Captain America – The Winter Solder, Marvel steps away from its mega-moneymaking formula of witty dialog and action, action, and more action and moves into a darker direction based on suspense and political intrigue. Surprise, the movie still is a mega-moneymaker. That is mostly because Marvel retained an engaging cast (Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson), top- notch action sequences, and brought Captain America into today's world where moral ambiguities predominate the absolutist approach to good vs. evil.<br/><br/>This film will be enjoyed by anyone who has enjoyed prior Marvel offerings but should probably only be seen if you are familiar with Captain America's back-story through the comics or the first movie, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)."

","Evans certainly possesses the physical heft, but struggles to add emotional bulk to the Cap's latest adventure in which the freeze- dried World War II relic is labeled a traitor after discovering a nefarious attempt by S.H.I.E.L.D. to infiltrate our privacy – and worse. The homeland spying is for the good of the people, agency head Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assures Cap, who isn't so sure about that or his boss's new fleet of drone-like killing machines. He thinks it's an attempt to rule by fear, not laws.<br/><br/>Pausing for effect The Winter Soldier is not just a fantastic sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, it should also be recognized as one of the best sequels ever made. In fact, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the duo behind Thor: The Dark World, the Narnia Trilogy, and The First Avenger, have done such a great job shaping Captain America's story that this movie could almost stand on its own. There are many exciting twists and turns in this well- constructed, political action-thriller, but nothing comes as more of a shock than how important the story is at defining the direction of the MCU. What takes place in The Winter Soldier, along with an awesome mid- credits sequence tie-in, will inherently influence Avengers: Age of Ultron as well as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. – which should make the TV series a lot more interesting and reward fans who have stuck by its side. The direction will come into place for its third Captain America film. ==================================================================== ======= After a solid retwatch of this film (02/14/17'), I was able to see more things and more appreciate more of this film. As a sequel it definitely delivers upon the original and where it is a better film easily compared to Captain American: The First Avenger. What was more noticeable was the acting and overall film action scenes. This film delivers and has a certain charm where it doesn't feel stale or tend to drag on like its predecessor. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow steals the film, as she is great and makes people wonder why they have not made a solo Black Widow film for her as of yet. <br/><br/>The romance isn't forced with Cap and Black Widow and it plays great in many scenes. Samuel L. Jackson's scenes are much better and delivered with proper accuracy as one can tell is a great fit for Nick Fury. The villain of Bucky (The Winter Solider) is a solid and interesting character and makes the others around him feeling intimidating.

It seems that Hollywood is learning how to make good fight choreography nowadays. Of course the movie's main strength is in the action and spectacle. However, the conspiracy part is well played. It provides tension, and some room for guessing. However, Robert Redford seemed suspicious too early in the movie, and Samuel L. Jackson's character was underplayed. It also helps that there is a great villain: the Winter Soldier, who always seems to have a slight advantage over Captain America.

","As someone who is not well versed in the comic book lore of Captain America, he is quickly becoming my favorite superhero outside of Spider-Man and Batman. I really like First Avenger and appreciate it's unapologetic vibe of portraying Steve Rogers as a patriotic American who wants to fight for his country. You don't see that very often these days. And now that Rogers has woken up out of the ice and did his part with The Avengers, he's proved in this film that he's still a force to be reckoned with. <br/><br/>Whereas First Avenger was very Pro-America given it's WWII setting, The Winter Soldier doesn't hesitate to show the dark side of Patriotism and how bad it can get when it's put into the hands of the wrong people. It plays into Rogers trying to accept that the world has changed since WW2 ended but maintains his belief that America is still worth fighting for and that there are still people you can trust. Even when he along with allies Black Widow, Nick Fury and Falcon discover that HYDRA has infiltrated SHIELD and that the new assassin dubbed the Winter Soldier in town hunting down anyone who threatens to reveal the truth is revealed to be Steve's childhood/wartime friend, Bucky Barnes. <br/><br/>Winter Soldier is the installment in this franchise that shakes things up by being a more grounded and darker film than its predecessors but still maintaining the light hearted spirit the other films have, having some of the best action sequences that's ever been done in a comic book movie and having SHIELD go down with HYDRA to ensure that HYDRA doesn't stick around. This will undoubtedly affect the upcoming movies in a lot of ways and I'm excited to see where it goes. The Russo brothers who are primarily known for comedy flicks and TV shows did a brilliant job directing this movie and they excell at allowing the screenplay's strength to speak for itself. <br/><br/>Chris Evans continues to impress as Steve Rogers, Scarlet Johansson is even better here as Black Widow, Anthony Mackie is just AWESOME as Falcon, Robert Redford is probably the best actor they could've chosen for his character and Samuel L Jackson.... He's Samuel L Jackson, but in a good way. And Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier is terrific as well. And I have to admit that I think his reasons for being a villain were much better than I originally thought since the vision he has tells you everything you need to know about why he is the way he is. You don't necessarily need a 20 minute long scene devoted to his backstory. <br/><br/>This has officially made my list of best comic book movies of all time with TDK trilogy, Spider-Man 2 (2004), Days of Future Past, Iron Man 1 and the Avengers. I look forward to Age of Ultron and Civil War."

","This is by far one of the better Marvel movies. Along with The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, I would rank this movie among my top 3 Marvel movies. I heard from somewhere that this is ""the best stand alone Marvel movie since Iron Man"" and I could not phrase it any better. There were obvious, typical moments when the movie franchise tried to catch audiences off-guard such as when Nick Fury turned out to still be alive. But aside from those moments, the overall surprise, ""gasp"" moment when Bucky Barns turned out to still be alive was indeed gasp-worthy. I was engrossed with this movie from the beginning to the end every time that I have watched it. This film really does captivate the audience.<br/><br/>The first Captain America movie was not very impressive, and Steve Rogers (with his corny jokes and silly outfit) in The Avengers was also not impressionable. However, this movie completely makes up for all of it because Captain American was awesome, and frankly, he kicked some Hydra butt. Although his superhuman powers were not evident in earlier films and the franchise instead emphasized his ability to be a leader, Cap really knows how to fight and he proved so in this film.<br/><br/>Although I still hold my initial opinion that Scarlett Johansson/Black Widow is unnecessary in these movies, she actually proved herself worthy in this film as she went undercover to defeat Hydra and stuck by Steve Rogers' side throughout the film.<br/><br/>I really hope that the inevitable third and fourth installments are at least as good as Captain America: The Winter Solider, because this movie set the bar for any and every future Marvel movie. Honestly, the only Marvel directors worthy of directing future Marvel movies are Joss Whedon, James Gunn, and Anthony & Joe Russo."

","Where do I start the fill was amazing the action sequences where spot on, great directing from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo also wonderful acting from Chris evens and Anthony Mackie who play falcon, he has quickly made that role his own. The action sequences between Captain America and the Winter Solider where just great to watch. There are also two great end credit scenes which greats you ready and excited for further films. I would highly recommended watching this film even if you don't like or enjoy superhero films because this film is just has some great action scenes which everyone will enjoy. However if you are a Captain America fan you might notice a few changes from the original story however don't worry because it is not distracting, so its a great move for every one."

","After watching Captain America: The First Avenger, I had high expectations for this film and wanted to see Captain American in more action to reach his full potential as a superhero. And guess what? We do get to see that in this film!<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is by far one of the best Marvel films to date as it mixes hardcore action with an intricately woven conspiracy story that keeps the audience at the edge of their seats for the entire movie. You never know what's going to happen, and the layered story builds up to some epic moments of fighting and revelations. <br/><br/>There are plenty of action scenes along with some comedic moments that fit in perfectly with the soul of the film, and it is entertainment at its best. <br/><br/>I give it a 10/10 because it was well worth the money to go see this movie and I'm happy with the way Marvel is investing in the quality of movies being put out so far."

","""Wow!""<br/><br/>That's the word that continually prefaced everything I had to say about this movie once the lights came up in the theater. Not since seeing The Dark Knight have I left my seat feeling like I just watched a comic book movie transcend the usual pitfalls that plague the genre, becoming something else entirely. During the drive home I couldn't shut up about the movie. It felt like I was a hyperactive kid who had just seen something completely new, original and exciting. In other words: Captain America: The Winter Soldier is just amazing.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil anything that isn't already presented in the promotional materials for the movie, but a very brief synopsis goes like this: After the catastrophic events that take place in the climax of The Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D. has taken the initiative to drastically up the ante on national and global security. Super soldier Steve Rogers (aka Captain America aka Chris Evans aka Pete Pectorals) has to decide whether he wants to continue working for the organization all while facing off against a mysterious new enemy known as The Winter Solider (Sebastian Stan aka Noob Saibot). Of course, he has a little help from his old friend Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson in posterior-hugging leather) and new partner in crime fighting, The Falcon (Anthony Mackie aka Will Smith in Independence Day). Will they save the day? Well there's already a Captain America 3 announced so it's safe to assume they will, however you definitely want to see how they get to the next sequel.<br/><br/>Now that that's out of the way, allow me to gush further on about how fantastic this movie is. Let's start with the action. There's a lot of it. A LOT OF ACTION, I say! Most post-Bourne action scenes are shot very tight with the camera making ADHD movements. With The Winter Soldier you know exactly what's happening on screen. Every kick, punch, flip, slap and tickle is crystal clear, making the fight scenes absolutely riveting and engrossing. The Winter Soldier shoots its action tight, but with great focus. I was literally squeezing my armrests during several scenes, something I haven't done since Gravity.<br/><br/>Action is the real star of this movie, but I have to shower praise on everyone on screen. The entire cast is invested in this world 100% and it makes for a great viewing experience. Chris Evans just oozes charm as a confident Captain America and his one-on-one scenes with Scarlett Johannson seem more realistic and grounded in reality than most action thrillers that aren't based on comic books. Samuel L. Jackson actually shows up for work as Nick Fury (something that cannot be said about his recent appearance in Robocop) and Anthony Mackie is fun, funny and endearing as former ""pilot"" turned superhero. Oh by the way, they got Robert Redford to co-star in this movie. That is a BIG DEAL. The Sundance Kid himself just starred in a blockbuster Marvel movie. Of course he's phenomenal in it. Everyone is.<br/><br/>The flaws in this movie are very minor. One issue I had was that there are several pieces of dialog that are so campy that they do remind you that you're watching comic book characters come to life, but not in a cool way. This is obviously forgivable though since anyone expecting Elizabethan prose should lighten up. I only mention it because most of the dialog in this movie is fantastic and it was jarring to hear a line that seems ripped right out of an overly dramatic speech bubble. Another thing I noticed (and I'm hesitant to even call this a flaw) is that it might serve you well to watch both Captain America: The First Avenger (no kidding) and The Avengers before you see this movie. You might also want to have at least a basic understanding of the world of Captain America. I'm only saying this as a response to the fact that a majority of the audience I watched this with ""oohed"" and ""ahhed"" with glee at several things shown or said on screen that I didn't have the slightest idea about. Obviously neither of those issues negatively impacted my movie experience.<br/><br/>I referenced The Dark Knight earlier in this review as a comic book movie that transcends the genre. That's exactly what Captain America: The Winter Solider does, just as adeptly. Where The Dark Knight was clearly a crime movie with capes, this is an espionage action thriller that just happens to have guys dressed in costumes with superpowers. It even draws on our current real world situations with the NSA, Wikileaks, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, and company, and spins them into an enthralling action flick. This world seems plausible because it's an exaggeration of the world we live in now. There is an air of verisimilitude to The Winter Solider that truly makes us wish we had a Captain America of our own.<br/><br/>Comic book fans and comic book movie fans should see this movie. People who hate comic books should see this movie. To be perfectly honest I can't think of any group of people who shouldn't see this movie. It's fun, hypnotic and endlessly entertaining. If this is a prelude of what this summer's movies have to offer, it's going to be a great year for blockbusters."
"cherold","8","0","0","13 December 2014"," A fun follow-up
","Of the many Marvel superhero movies that have come out in the past few years, the first Captain America was my favorite. While this sequel lacks the Indiana Jones-ish vibe of the first one, it still has that human-scaled quality that is missing from the other movies, which often emphasize spectacle over quiet, human moments.<br/><br/>This is not to say the movie doesn't have some absolutely terrific action sequences, but rather to say that, unlike something like The Avengers, this movie takes time to breathe, let's us get to know the characters, and seems more like a movie than a special effects sizzle reel.<br/><br/>There are some issues. Sometimes the bad guys don't do things in the most logical way. More notably, they are a level of evil that comes across as cartoonish and ludicrous. But it's a silly movie no matter which way you slice it, so you can't complain too much about the particular quality of the silliness.<br/><br/>The cast is quite good, it has a solid number of jaw-dropping moments, and while I might not like it quite so much as the first one I do like it better than the non-Captain America films in this series."

","Who'd have thought Captain America would actually work as well as it has? Everyone was a little sceptical about how well a modern day version of Captain America would work on today's cinema-going audience, but, to many people's surprise, all of the 'Cap's' outings have been successful. And this is no different.<br/><br/>Although, it is a little different in as much as the film-makers are doing their best not to make it just a generic clone of every other recent Marvel superhero movie (and let's face it many of the latest crop of Marvel movies do follow a bit of a template). Instead, it decides to use a different 'tried and tested' film format – the 'Bourne' movies. We've all seen Jason Bourne being wrongly accused of something and then finding himself pursued across various cities by the people he was supposed to be working with. Well this is one of those films (only with superheroes instead of spies). Poor ol' Cap finds himself doublecrossed and 'outed' as a bad-guy. Therefore, he has to team up with (fan-favourite) 'Black Widow' and some guy he met in the street (who we later discover is 'Falcon') to prove himself innocent (not to mention take down the REAL bad-guy who you'll work out who he is loooong before the on-screen characters do!).<br/><br/>Yes, it may be a bit of a copy of the 'chase' movies, but it's still pretty good if you're into your Marvel universe. For a start we get to see the Cap doing what he does best a lot more than the first movie, i.e. kicking bad-guy butt. In the first movie, much of the action was kind of glossed over and they used montage sequences to portray the fact that he was out there hurting villains. Now, we get to see him hurt the right people more.<br/><br/>Of course it's not perfect there are some plot devices that are a bit overused. The main one being people who 'die' only for it to be revealed later that they actually hadn't. And, possibly mainly, is the title. Here we're watching 'Captain America: Winter Soldier.' Only the titular 'Winter Soldier' doesn't really show up that much. In fact you could probably watch the whole movie and the Cap would have plenty to do without ever having to face his frosty foe.<br/><br/>So, if you can ignore plot holes from former films (like the 'Avengers') regarding why Tony Stark didn't learn of Hydra's existence when he downloaded 'every dirty little secret SHIELD possessed,' you should enjoy this film as a decent entry into the Marvel/action/adventure/spy-chasy-type movie universe."

","""That's not freedom, that's fear."" Steve Rogers (Evans) is still trying to adjust to life in the modern world but he does have Natasha (Johansson) and Nick Fury to help him. Thinking there may be a problem inside the walls of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury warns Rogers not to trust anyone. He takes this to heart and when Fury is killed Rogers becomes a fugitive from the organization. He must now fight the mysterious Winter Soldier in order to avenge Fury and also to clear his name. The first thing I will talk about are the good things about this movie. The Avengers movies seem to be leaning more to the adult side with a real story line and leaning less on the special effects that earlier comic book movies fell back on. This one is no exception. It is dark and has depth to it to make you interested in what is happening rather than what is blowing up. They all do a great job of tying into each other which makes it feel like one long story rather then separate stories they attempt to tie together. On the other hand the fact that they keep pumping these movies out is what made the main plot of this movie not work. The whole movie has to deal with the leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D. becoming corrupt and Captain America being an outcast. The fact that they have already started to film Avengers 2 and have announced Captain America 3 takes away all the tension and suspense of Rogers and Fury's story lines. From the beginning you know that Fury will be fine and Rogers will clear his name and fix what is wrong with S.H.I.E.L.D. If they wanted to really have the viewer wonder what will happen they shouldn't have announced future plans for the series. To me the Avengers movies have become more of franchise done solely to make money rather than movies done to tell a story. While they do make a killing when they come out they are starting to cheapen the industry and are watering down the product. There is failure to see that the longer the series goes on the more it will take away from what has been done so far. If you don't believe me now you will when Iron Man 6, Captain America 5, Thor 6 and Avengers 7 all come out. Overall, the movie is OK and worth seeing but there is no tension or suspense already knowing what the next movie will be like. I give it a B."

","I thought Captain America: The First Avenger was pretty bad. So, I was hoping the new one would be better. And it was! I mean it was good action, an interesting and more realistic storyline, and Cap wasn't a sad old man anymore. However, it lacked a certain intelligence. Not that the plot was quite clever, it just wasn't developed very well. Although, I still enjoyed it and didn't get bored. It was very entertaining with the humour and action and everything in between. I thought it was over-hyped because in screen junkie's honest trailer for it, they said and i quote, ""its the best stand alone MARVEL film since Iron Man'. It really wasn't. To be honest, I preferred Thor: The Dark World. The performances were great. Chris Evans really proved that he could play a cool Captain America. And Sam Jackson, as always, was awesome (i mean that scene where he's in the car chase was damn cool). I also liked that little Pulp Fiction reference at the end there. On Nick Fury's (Sam Jackson BTW) grave stone it read 'Col. Nicholas James Fury. The Path of the Righteous Man... (Ezekiel 25.17)'. This made me laugh. Pulp Fiction is my favourite movie of all time. Oh yeah, kinda gave away that Nick died there. Well, he didn't, he faked it but.. Damn, i need to do the may contain spoilers thing now. <br/><br/>7.6.

"paul_haakonsen","7","0","0","30 July 2014"," A sequel well worth watching...
","""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" was a step up from the 2011 movie ""Captain America: The First Avenger"".<br/><br/>This is a great combination of action and special effects, and actually spiced up with a proper storyline that proved entertaining and also has the audience at a bit of guessing game as well. The plot line was very nice and well thought through, and it had several layers to it, which made for a more complex and enjoyable movie experience.<br/><br/>The action sequences are great and they are filmed equally great. Lots of great fighting, adrenalin-filled action and testosterone.<br/><br/>The acting throughout the movie was good as well. And it was actually surprisingly nice to see Robert Redford in a role such as the one he has in this movie.<br/><br/>One thing I don't understand, though, is that you have a guy running around with a shield, why doesn't the goons and villains just shoot at his exposed legs? No, they have to shoot directly at an impenetrable shield of course. It just doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Ah well, for a movie in the super hero genre, then the Captain America movies are actually some of the better and more enjoyable, as it is fairly devoid of super-human powers.<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" provides good entertainment and if you enjoyed the first movie, then you should most definitely watch this one as well."

"CinemaCocoa","9","0","0","11 July 2014"," While Cap'1 was average, Winter Soldier proves to be one of the best from Marvel!
","This Marvel train ain't stopping for anything! The Winter Soldier is quite possibly one of the best entries into the film series yet!<br/><br/>Captain Steve Rogers tries to find a sense of place in the modern world working for S.H.I.E.L.D. But when Nick Fury is targeted by a mysterious assassin, Rogers discovers that his patriotism could just be used as a pawn for corrupt political forces.<br/><br/>Captain America, as a singular character in the current Avengers team, has the most groundwork and the most to build upon in a sequel. There's a lot to work with! Tony Stark and Thor had mostly completed stories when going into their sequels, but the Captain did not; he's been left untouched since his debut in 2011. This is a great boon for The Winter Soldier. The film opens with a very stealth driven action sequence with the Captain and Black Widow taking on a terrorist takeover at sea. This is heralding more to come; the film's entire storyline is about espionage, spy networks and ambiguous political intent. The story is intelligent and interweaving, frequently summoning up ghosts from Steve Rogers' past, but in no unlikely manner, in fact the linkage with The First Avenger is were a lot of the film's intensity comes from. That and its not-so-heavy-handed social and political subtexts.<br/><br/>Of course, it isn't all talking and mystery (though I was surprised at how moody the film became) there is still plenty of action. The Winter Soldier himself is an excellent addition to the Marvel mythos, the soundtrack adding to the foreboding atmosphere around him and the film shows how deadly he really can be. The Captain too gets a much better sense of strength here too (I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt he was a little underpowered in Avengers Assemble) being thrown about, running through walls, using his shield in such marvellously silly ways. It is greatly entertaining when the bullets and punches start flying. It is also a surprisingly brutal film. With Captain America's origins and current story trapped in comparatively realistic settings (we are dealing with countries, governments and spies, not gods and space aliens) even to Iron Man standards, the action is intense and scenes get quite dark. People are shot, often viciously, they are wounded, they bleed, even tortured. A clear sign that Marvel aren't only delivering more mature content, but are confident in doing so. That said, there's a healthy sense of humour in there too. Maybe not as riotous as some of Tony Stark's adventures, but it is there.<br/><br/>I have trouble thinking of what's wrong with the film. The action scenes sometimes fall into a lot of shaky camera work, again, but other times it is fine. This could be due in part to the 3D, which I had no time for; just see the film regularly, the 3D does nothing. Some of the plot might seem predictable, but I imagine the younger audiences will be totally captivated.<br/><br/>All in all a great movie, and it stands alone and as an Avengers continuation very well! What is remarkable is that Marvel is successfully giving each of its character's movies a distinct theme and mood. Like reading the different comics, there is a difference. You know you are watching Marvel, but the heroes have their own presence and strength to give."
"Rob_Taylor","7","0","0","28 June 2014"," Good film, just a little bit...
","... samey. Not that it is anything like the first Cap'n America outing, but just that all these Marvel movies are starting to tread a very similar path.<br/><br/>By that I mean the plot is entirely predictable and refuses to be anything other than that. There are no surprises here. Just a tried and tested formula that, whilst it works, leaves you ultimately feeling a little let down.<br/><br/>It's kind of difficult to write this review, because although I enjoyed the movie, I also think it didn't live up to the hype. There is plenty of action and effects but little else.<br/><br/>For example... The Cap is from the era of World War 2. All his friends and family are gone. Yet there wasn't much in this film to really make you feel for the guy's predicament. There are references and so on, but the script didn't really try that hard to make you feel sorry for the proverbial ""Man out of time"". It felt more of a ""Oh isn't this sad.... moving on..."" kind of thing that doesn't really do him justice.<br/><br/>Also, though it was obvious they'd bring him forward through time to the modern day setting, I can't help but miss the first movies' setting. Call me old-fashioned, but there is something comforting and right about seeing a superhero beat up Nazis that just isn't there with their modern day descendants in Hydra.<br/><br/>That said, the story thread involving his supposedly dead buddy from the ""good old days"" was a nice inclusion but, again, I don't think they really did it the justice it deserved. It was there, but it was almost like (as above) that they wanted to get the personal aspects of that out of the way as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>One other thing I noticed... I know the Cap is superhuman because of the serum he was given, but it seems to me he's even more super in this outing than in the first one. He's not superman, of course. He can't fly but boy! Can he fall well! The thing I like most about Cap'n America was that he was the most normal seeming of the heroes. I hope they don't take that away from him in future.<br/><br/>Finally, please, please stop shoehorning Stan Lee into every Marvel movie. It was nice to begin with but now it is just embarrassing. It's also incredibly immersion breaking. You know he's going to be there, somewhere, at some point in the film. Then, just as you begin to really get into things, up he pops! It's bloody annoying and it needs to stop. With Stan Lee it was just a passing shot to begin with. Now they're giving him lines, for God's sake! Just stop it! Anything that pulls you out of the fantasy world the movie creates is just wrong and the sooner Hollywood and its directors (sadly I'm looking at you all too often, Peter Jackson!) understand this, the better.<br/><br/>There. I'm done.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Good action movie. Primarily Eye candy over substance but enjoyable anyway. Personal story threads feel rushed and an afterthought. A decent sequel, but a little over-hyped, as usual."

","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the best movie in the Marvel Movie Universe since the Avengers and is the best movie so far in this year.<br/><br/>Captain America (Steve Rogers) is still trying to fit Into this new world after being frozen for decades, as seen as his notebook at the beginning(its different in different countries). After discovering that the Black Widow is secretly doing another mission than himself, he started to question what values he's working for, it is made more apparent after when Nick Fury showed him project insight with new Helli- carries, he questioned him ""This is not Freedom, This is Fear"".This shows him starting to stop trusting SHIELD as an organization to promote freedom. He went to the Captain America exhibit to search for what he originally fights. After he met with Alexander Pierce, he finally found out he was betrayed by SHIELD and he feels like he can't trust anyone anymore, he didn't seem to trust Black Widow about the information on the USB drive. Instead, he turns to Sam (Falcon), an out-side. He insists to destroy SHIELD because infiltration by HYDRA and gains the approval of Nick Fury because of the belief that ""Once Power gets too great, It can't be controlled"". After it was revealed that the Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes, the Captain's was emotional, sad and don't know what happened to him, he told Falcon he wasn't sure he could kill him. At the final face-off between the Captain and the Winter Soldier, he told him ""I'm not gonna fight you, you are my friend"" and drops his Shield, showing he wants to save him and bring him back to Bucky Barnes. Even the Winter Soldier keeps punching him, he refuses to fight him, until before he lost conciseness, he told the him "".I'm with you till the end of the line"". I think that's the most emotional scene for me in the entire movie. Chris Evans did a great job in portraying Cap, he showed clearly his change of emotions and dislike of power in this movie. He shows stress in adapting into a new world and I felt other than his last scene with the Winter Soldier, his best scene is ""If you go to war you gotta wear a uniform"" . <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier (Bucky Barnes) is the most terrifying villain I've seen in a VERY long time. He was presumed dead after he fell of the train in 1944 but was found by HYDRA. He lost his left arm and was installed a new, bionic one by HYDRA. He was brainwashed and lost memory of his previous life. He first appeared when he tried to kill Nick Fury for the first time, and he just skid by his car when it went by passed him. This showed he is a calculated killer. When we see him for the second time,he was chased by Cap and he simply just catches his Shield and throws it back. This showed he has considerable strength to fight even with Captain America. We get a close face-shot of him in this scene and he looks truly terrifying and scary in his ""Black War Paint"" covering his eyes. When Captain America found out his true identity, he just told him ""Who the hell's Bucky?"". This showed he acts like a machine and almost had no emotion. He portrayed sadness and anger in his eyes when he was brainwashed again by Pierce, showing that the appearance of Capt. Rogers starting to bring Bucky back to real life. In the finally scene, when Cap told him his real name, he went totally emotional and he shouted ""SHUT UP!"", and ""NO I DON'T (know you)"" to him. In this scene he was on the fence between his brainwashing and memory. He drags Steve Rogers back to the shore but leaves, showing he still don't know what is the truth , but the Bucky side of him slowly comes back in this scene. Also he went to the Captain America exhibit to find out the truth about himself in the Final Credit Scene, I think he is surprised to find out about his true identity in this scene. Sebastian Stan plays the Winter Soldier in this movie, and I must say I was most impressed with him, sometimes even make the captain looks like a secondary character. He is very good at expressing his emotions and he successfully communicated with his audience with his eyes. I already know the kind of emotions flowing in him just looking through his eyes.<br/><br/>I am really impressed with the hand to hand action during the fights and NOT overusing CGI. This helps the movie more realistic especially the Winter Soldier/Captain America scenes during fights. The 2 fight scenes are also shows the emotions of the Captain/Winter Soldier. The script delivers with some of the best duologue recently. There are flaws in this movie, the most notable one is when Cap and Natasha went down to a 100ft bunker to locate the source and Dr Zola send a missile, they appear back on the ground. <br/><br/>Overall, this is an very exciting action-packed movie with a good script, with everyone at their A-game. They send out a message that even superheroes like Captain America is not free form injury and the consequence of an single origination getting to much power, in this case, SHIELD=HYDRA, which must be destroyed in order to protect our personal freedom . This is clearly better than the Fist Avengers and I hope the Avengers Age of Ultron and Cap 3 will be as great as this movie. I look forward to seeing Bucky slowing regaling his memories In Cap 3. <br/><br/>9/10"

Weak, unbelievable, grotesque. Though it doesn't matter much, because the action is great!<br/><br/>Great weapons, stunts, fighting sequences, etc. I don't recommend watching it in 3D like I did. The film has a dark tone and the 3D makes it worse. I'm not anti-3D but 3D projections do have significant shortcomings, which I thought would have been improved over time. It depends on the type of projector I guess, how bright the screen is lit.<br/><br/>Very cool was the Falcon, daddy I want a suit like that! All in all this is a spectacular movie that surely will not disappoint."
"imdb-8-499784","3","3","8","23 May 2014"," Good movie but not if you are a Nick Fury Fan
","I appreciate that a movie made in 2014 must be updated to correspond to current times (maybe) and attention should be paid to the interests of 2014 viewers, but as a reader of the comics when they were first released, (I used to SUBSCRIBE to Daredevil, Spider-Man, Strange Tales and Tales of Suspense) and one whose #1 favorite Marvel character was Nick Fury, I just do not understand why Nick Fury has been progressively changed from a powerful, principled, direct-acting figure in the Silver Age to an un-trustable clerk throughout all the Marvel movies. For example, the Nick Fury I grew up with would have never been portrayed looking sheepishly at people who were defying and dismissing him. Good grief, they even took the Howling Commandos away from him.<br/><br/>I remember when David Hasselhoff portrayed Nick Fury in a 1998 TV movie. True fans dismissed the movie as a weak adaptation. I viewed it again recently, and any five minutes of that movie are more dead-on than the combined entire Avengers franchise's portrayal of Nick Fury.<br/><br/>Well finally he's been ""killed"" in the story. The only positive I can see of his treatment in the films is that perhaps now that he is ""dead"", maybe they will leave him alone and not ruin the character further. You know, all they had to do was portray J. Jonah Jameson with an eye-patch and a gun, and they would have been far more accurate.<br/><br/>On balance, Captain America is portrayed well, adjusting for updates and the directors' obvious anti-NSA bias. So I gave it three stars. Would have given the movie five, but they stole the Howling Commandos and gave them to Cap."
"jcsuperjake","6","3","8","13 April 2014"," I'm in the minority
","I went to see this movie last Saturday with a few friends because we are all really big superhero fans, especially Marvel superhero movies. I was extremely excited to see this because I noticed it had a 89 on rotten tomato and an 8.3 on IMDb. So, I got a little ahead of myself in raising my expectations real high. After watching the whole movie, I sat there trying to determine how I felt about the whole movie. Sure, I was entertained by some parts. I love captain America, I think he's a great superhero. But, I just found this movie really repetitive. The endless action sequences, which Marvel usually does really well, just seemed too repetitive. At first, they were exciting, but it was just the same thing over and over again. I actually got bored because it felt like I was watching the same thing for two hours. Chris Evans makes a great Captain America. I am probably in the minority in thinking that the first one was better. I enjoyed how they coordinated WWII into the first one. I just couldn't get into this movie as much as most people could."
"jrhgriffiths","6","3","8","7 April 2014"," Deep action, shallow characters
","Although containing political innuendos and a conspiracy-laden plot, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is at heart an action movie. The array of action scenes in this movie is both dizzying and exciting. Captain America raids a cargo ship controlled by terrorists; Director Fury battles villains in a SUV that is also a weaponized tank; the 'Winter Soldier' fights Captain America atop a floating helicarrier. Yet, as is unfortunately common with action-laced movies, the depth of the movie's action results in the shallowness of its characters.<br/><br/>Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) is a soldier out of time. Having been asleep for sixty years, the filmmakers could have done much with the theme of a 1940s man living in a post-modern world. Instead, the movie regulates this theme to a brief scene of the Captain trying to catch up on pop culture. (Even 'Austin Powers' played this theme with more panache.) The filmmakers instead focus on the Captain as a conflicted man, who only knows how to be a soldier and yet feels an unease in the modern military establishment. While this is interesting, it doesn't go far, as the Captain quickly opts back into his soldier/hero mode after expressing his discontent. Natasha Romanoff and Director Fury are similarly underdeveloped, perhaps because the movie has so much going on. Samuel L. Jackson nonetheless succeeds in being as brash, curmudgeonly, and entertaining as ever.<br/><br/>Without delving too deeply into the plot, the movie is about a long- festering conspiracy that is about to transform SHIELD into the harbinger of a new world order. The movie's political message appears to be that complex governmental institutions that are designed for our defense can quickly become instruments of oppression. Within all this, there is a not-so-oblique reference to America's use of drones and NSA's intelligence-gathering. This is all interesting; and yet, the scope of the conspiracy and the sheer ludicrousness of its goals divest the movie's political message of seriousness.<br/><br/>While there is much to critique, there is also much to admire. The action scenes are creative and intense. The occasional humor is light and enjoyable. As an entertaining action movie, Captain America amply succeeds."

"edgereviews","8","3","8","27 March 2014"," The Winter Soldier Review
","Of all the Marvel phase two films, The Winter Soldier was the one I was least excited for. Captain America should really be the strongest of the Avengers characters, yet he had been pushed to the back by the superior Iron Man due to his character never really being fully realised in his movies. The Winter Solider was Marvel's opportunity to rectify Captain America's pretty weak career, and they definitely succeed, producing a movie that's second only to The Avengers.<br/><br/>This movie is made so good because of how well written it is. It's not a silly action fest with a weak story like other superhero movies are, it instead boasts a very strong screenplay that's completely unpredictable and hugely engrossing. The Winter Soldier has a conspiracy ridden plot that's constantly twisting and turning with some great character introductions and developments, some of which open huge opportunities for the future of the Marvel universe. Unlike the past two Marvel movies, ('Irons Man 3′ and 'Thor: The Dark World'), The Winter Soldier isn't held back by very silly, childish humour. It has genuinely funny moments with some great pop culture references, and it overall feels like a much more mature movie than any of Marvel's other work.<br/><br/>The Captain America character is at last beginning to become a much more interesting character, showing he has the leadership capabilities to control The Avengers. Chris Evans shines in the role, he does a perfect job and it's hard to picture anyone else in the role. We also finally get some great character moments for Black Widow, and her role in this film has made me certain that I want to see a Black Widow movie in the upcoming phase 3. Scarlett Johansson does an excellent job with her material, she seems to be really getting into the Black Widow character now and fully understands it. I knew Anthony Mackie would be great as Falcon because he's Anthony Mackie, and he indeed does a great job. Although the Falcon character is different to the traditional comics one, this new version still works very well and provides a lot of comic relief.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson is excellent as always, and Robert Redford is very good as well, although his character role is incredibly predictable, so predictable in fact that I already knew what his purpose would be just from watching the trailer. I was slightly disappointed by Emily Van Camp's Agent 13, as she's introduced quite early on yet is given nothing of any real substance substance to do. However, we do get to see a lot more of Cobie Smulder's character Maria Hill, which is always nice. Last but not least, Sebastian Stan does a phenomenal job as The Winter Soldier, a character who is easily a good enough villain to rival Marvel's beloved Loki. The character is very intimidating and genuinely intimidating at points, he has a great feel of menace and power to him which is elevated by Stan's incredible work.<br/><br/>Although I said that The Winter Soldier doesn't focus on the action, the action sequences that are featured in the film are perfect. They're brilliantly choreographed and are easily the best action sequences we've seen so far in the Marvel universe, so kudos to directors Anthony and Joe Russo for that. Like said above, The Winter Soldier feels much more mature than other Marvel movies, as the main crisis feels very real and catastrophic, whereas in past Marvel movies (other than 'The Avengers') there was no sense of massive danger like there is here. The film doesn't employ a dark tone that's so moody it's on the same level as the likes of 'The Dark Knight' and 'Man of Steel', but instead melds the dark tones with the traditional comic book style that Marvel always employ to create an end product that has a great impending sense of danger whilst still feeling like a Marvel movie.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is pretty close to perfect. It's easily the best written Marvel movie, and even though it's not as good as 'The Avengers', that's hardly a bad movie to be second to, is it? Let's hope this quality carries on into future Marvel adventures, because if it does then Marvel will never have to give up the crown as king of the comic book movies."

","Steve ""Captain America"" Rogers has found his place in the present day carrying out missions for SHIELD. But then it appears that SHIELD's security has been compromised, and he finds himself on the run.<br/><br/>This is not so much a sequel to Cap's 2011 initial appearance in the Marvel cinematic universe as a follow up, in which he is merely the central character in a wider story concerning the changing circumstances of the organisation SHIELD. As such, I preferred it to the origin movie, because I am getting great enjoyment from the way Marvel Studios is rolling out Phase 2 of developing its properties. Like all fanboys, I loved the teasers peppered throughout the end credits of the Phase 1 films, and was overjoyed when everything came together in The Avengers. Well, Cap 2 is not simply about Steve Rogers.<br/><br/>The story is solid, the performances are all fun, there are many returning faces, the effects are great, and Chris Evans again does a good job of nailing Steve Rogers' heroism and integrity. Nick Fury and the Black Widow both get a lot to do this time round, too. Plus this movie sets up a LOT of threads to be picked up in subsequent movies.<br/><br/>Do I have a criticism? Perhaps some of the combat sequences could have been communicated a little better, but that's a minor quibble.<br/><br/>The 3D is non-essential (very effective in the aerial sequences, though). There are mid- and end-credits teasers."

","Why does this movie only have 7.8 out of ten. It is easily placed in the upper echelon of Comic Book Movies and deserves to at least be the second highest rated CBM of all time, if not first (The Dark Knight possibly ranked higher, though it being called a CBM is questionable due to the massive departure from the source material and the non-traditional nature of the film.) <br/><br/>The action in this movie is some of the best seen in Western Cinema, eclipsing those series well known for their fight scenes (such as The Bourne Quadrilogy or The Matrix) with ease. The high octane thrill ride of the story is complemented by the amazing visuals and smoothly integrated CGI. <br/><br/>The movie seamlessly ties in to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe and lays the groundwork for future films with a delicate touch, not obtrusively forcing these easter eggs upon the audience but instead delicately and meticulously placing them on the board like a chess master who's moves are planned out ten ahead. <br/><br/>All actors inhabit and own their respective characters with great depth and thought, each one imbuing them with a significance and weight rarely seen. <br/><br/>Please change this score to at least 8.2.

The Russo Bros are complete hacks, if you don't believe me look up their filmography before they were drafted into making subpar Marvel films. The reason that elevator scene is so praised is because it's the only action scene in the movie where the camera isn't bouncing all over the place trying to disguise the cheap CGI.

","Captain America: The winter soldier is an excellent Conspiracy Thriller that felt so familiar to me, like a 90's Thriller like Enemy of the State (1998) or Murder at 1600 (1996) or The Fugitive (1993) you get the idea, it felt old school & that made it more grounded.
This is a much better film than the first film & is one of the best sequels ever, especially in the super hero genre!!!<br/><br/>This Captain America movie is the best I've seen in the MCU by far & that's because of it's real,grittier & more grounded approach, there's brutal fighting & terrorist shootouts, this is a conspiracy Thriller with a touch of fantasy with it being a super hero Marvel film but even with that it's still a much darker & more mature toned Marvel flick.
Steve Rogers/Captain America is easily the best character of the Avengers & is the most interesting & most human, here he goes on an emotional journey & questions the government & powers that control everything.
This is an exciting & intriguing Action Thriller that also rings true with it's corruption & conspiracy storyline.<br/><br/>Steve Rogers is lost, he feels alone in an ever changing world & he's basically a relic of a time when being a Hero ment something & he knew what he was fighting for but now everything seems corrupted & feels wrong, what is a true man of honour supposed to do in a world like this?<br/><br/>The loneliness is in Cap's eyes & it's an excellent very human performance from Chris Evans, who is perfect at coming accross dis-heartened & hurt at what he sees around him.
Can he trust S.H.I.E.L.D?
Is he fighting on the right side?
Captain America is lost & unsure & that's the heart of this excellent film.
Captain America is definitely my favourite character of all the Avengers & in this action packed Thriller he cements that status.<br/><br/>The always excellent Samuel l Jackson plays Nick Fury more serious here too & has some fantastic edge of the seat scenes.
Black Widow is excellent in this movie & show's she's one of the smartest & toughest Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D again another excellent & kick a## performance from Scarlett Johansson.
Anthony Mackie is also fantastic as Falcon, he's a good man with a good heart & you can totally see why Cap trusts him.
Caps old war buddy & best friend Bucky is a terrifying & deadly Assassin, again another excellent character & performance, he comes accross so deadly & fast like a Terminator!!!
We also have the great tough guy Frank Grillo & even movie legend Robert Redford rounding out the fantastic cast.<br/><br/>If like me you get bored of massive explosions & buildings getting blown up & want a more intriguing & more grounded Marvel film then Captain America:The winter soldier is definitely the one.<br/><br/>A truly fantastic,exciting & fast paced action-packed Conspiracy Thriller."

","I'm writing this 5 years later (after Avengers:Endgame) and I still stand with the same opinion as I had half a decade ago - this film is the best marvel has created. Chris Evan's Cap had one of the best character arcs through this sequel and his battle between his moral compass and the new world of government control is great. Samuel L Jackson was again great, and I loved Black Widows arc of redemption and dealing with the truth of HYDRA in what I think is Scarlett's best depiction of the character over all the other films. Finally, Stans acting was incredible. The winter soldier has so little lines but all his emotion and character is showed amazingly by facial and body expression. I have to say Sebastian's acting was best out of the great cast. The plot was thrilling, and I loved the sub plot of hydras infiltration which really adds to the characters' developments. An amazing film which maintains its thrill after dozens of rewatches."

","Captain America Winter Soldier stars Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L Jackson, and Robert Redford. And it is the ninth movie in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and is directed by the Russo Brothers. In this installment Captain America is caught in the middle of a conspiracy involving S.H.I.E.L.D and a mysterious figure named the Winter Soldier. Now I think this is the best movie in the MCU that I believe is the Dark Knight of the MCU franchise. What makes this film surpass the other MCU movies is that the Russo Brothers decided to take espionage films like Three Days of the Condor and All the Presidents Men and make it their own Marvel movie. They even got Robert Redford who is the star of Three Days of the Condor and All the Presidents Men to star in this. This movie smells of 100% pure confidence as every department involved in making this went with gut instinct to create something beautiful. It's also not afraid to take any risks either as it just does and takes whatever it feels like without any consequences. It's so brilliant that it makes me want to pick up a comic book that involves Hydra, S.H.I.E.L.D, Armin Zola, to just about anything I can think of. So in conclusion this is the best MCU movie hands down that whenever I watch it I'll never get bored of it."

I always pictured him as a symbol of the American propaganda. However , when i finally got to watch the Marvel cinematic universe movies like ""Iron Man,""Thor"" etch.. i couldn't help but watch ""Captain America : the first avenger"" mostly out of curiosity to see how they would present such a character into a live action movie.<br/><br/>I have to admit this was a very pleasant surprise since not only did i like the movie plot-wise but in the end i actually felt compassion for Captain America himself. After the surprise of the first movie i couldn't help but watch the second one too. What i didn't expect was a second surprise since this movie ended up not being an actual superhero film but mostly an espionage action-packed thriller. The plot ideas thrown into there are so interesting and well-presented that they made me want to shake the writers's hand and say ""Good job."" The references to other Marvel films are there too and what i also enjoyed is that they bothered showing us the fate of a couple characters who debuted in the first CA film. I can safely say that you don't have to be a geek to enjoy this movie. All it takes is liking fast-paced action spy films.

They took it to make sure it was more like Captain America as we should have seen from the get go. <br/><br/>I mean this film hold my attention from the start it contain a powerful plot that was helped by the first season of Agents Of SHIELD which had a series of episodes to help key in with the story. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier prove to be threat to Captain America and a unstoppable force, this proves to be one of the biggest challenges for Captain America as he has more on his plate in this film <br/><br/>The writers did a very well done job with the story telling of the film and the plot is one of the finest works I have seen in movies as well with having a good idea to bring Falcon, Nick Fury and Black Widow into the film which helps make the story more believable.<br/><br/>The performances from the cast are superb as everyone brought their A game to the table. I enjoy how they kept the humor in the film works when the timing was right. <br/><br/>Action scenes and stunts are top notch we see tense fight scenes with Captain America and The Winter Soldier and Black Widow shows that she is a boss when it comes to combat and she can run with the best of them. I just appreciate the fights and the action in the film that's what the first one was missing this one deliver big time so bravo.<br/><br/>Music in the film is just superb as Henry Jackman made a well done score each music piece in the film helps sell the story. <br/><br/>Captain America The Winter Soldier has proved itself to be worthy of Marvel's work and it is superior in every way to the original. <br/><br/>With great acting, excellent action scenes and fight scenes and well thought out story I can say I can watch this movie over and over again.<br/><br/>I give Captain America The Winter Soldier an 9 out of 10"

","It starts out as most marvel movies do with a mission, and a good showcase of how bad ass the cap is. Then it delves into an insane twist that I didn't see coming at all. With S.H.I.E.L.D. being compromised by Hydra for years, and about to launch a program that will use the three new Helicarriers in concert with an algorithm designed by the late (But still alive due to his mind being downloaded to a mainframe Howard Stark owned) Dr. Arnim Zola has created to kill anyone he sees as a potential threat to Hydras endgame. Captain America already doesn't want Project Insight to launch even before he realizes its complete nefarious objective. This is because he believes in the constitution, and that we shouldn't sacrifice freedoms for security. The movie definitely gets you thinking when it is explained how Hydra changed its mode of operation sense Hitlers failure in trying to forcibly take over the population, and now has created wars and enough conflict and fear mongering that make us Americans literally just lie down and accept, if not ask for something or someone to rule us (Its not that obvious, but that's what seems to be happening now in real life. Look @ the NSA programs and how much the government can see, read, and hear basically anything they want to)so as to ""Keep us safe"". But sense Captain America is strong, and smart, they (Hydra) needs a weapon, and that's there Bucky ""The Winter Soldier"" comes in. Obviously whatever tests the Doc was doing to him before he was rescued by the cap had some kind of an effect. Exp when you see him fall from a train that's like 300 ft in the air, and all of this back in 1940 something. So he's lived for years (But they show a picture of him inside of what looks like a Cryo-Chamber, so maybe that's how he's lived long and is still young) and is now mind controlled to fulfill evil operations for devious men (Hydra operatives) and it is a difficult conflict that Cap has to fight him to complete his mission of stopping Project Insight from becoming fully operational. Overall its an amazing movie that follows the enormous footsteps of its predecessors, and fills their shoes perfectly. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes action movies, and if you're a nerd, or a comic book fan, then obviously this is a must see! Hope my review was useful."

"pcd_lorico","9","2","5","9 April 2014"," Much better than the first film
","I never thought this was gonna be a awesome film because first of all the Captain America: First Avenger was super boring not because of its old school style but its story or plot was too predictable. But this movie was one of the greatest Marvel film i have ever watch. It centers the world of politics, and the power of trust and not trusting too much. Here you'll know more about Nick Fury, then Black Widow was more awesome, new characters like Agent 13 and Falcon, and the awesome enemy The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>This movie was fascinating it brings up more about Steve Rogers, Nick Fury, and The Winter Soldier. The ending was unexpected, and of course it's a Marvel movie so you have to watch some post credits for a sneak peek to the next film. After seeing the post credits it'll make you want to wait for the next Captain America film which was in 2016."
"logan_doneske","6","2","5","5 April 2014"," Good, but average.
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is just like every other superhero and action movie these days. Has lots of action, explosions, all that good stuff.<br/><br/>I don't hate or love this movie, I'm just kinda split. As I said, it's an average superhero movie, it doesn't do anything ground breaking or original, but I did like the movie's storyline, I'm not going to spoil it, but it was at least a interesting one.<br/><br/>If there was something I liked about this film, it was its fight sequences, it was pretty cool seeing well choreographed fight scenes in a movie like this, so that was a treat.<br/><br/>Overall, not bad, but just falls with the rest of the superhero movies today."
"michaelhirakida","8","2","5","4 April 2014"," A Blast! Breathes Refreshing air into the Marvel Avengers Canon.
","I just went to see Captain America: The Winter Soldier with very little expectations. After the last dud ""Thor The Dark World"" Which could possibly be the worst superhero film to ever grace the silver screen, I felt betrayed by Marvel. They haven't made a good movie in 2013. But now that I have seen this, I think this is going to be a great year for Marvel movies. <br/><br/>The plot: Steve Rodgers is framed for murder, SHIELD is compromised, and a new evil arises. But with the help of The Falcon and his other companions, Captain America fights to save the lives of millions.<br/><br/>The thing I like a lot about this movie, is that it takes itself very seriously with very little humor. Thor 2's problem was the constant use of humor. It can work, but that film had terrible writing which made the comedy scenes cringe worthy and immature. The Winter Soldier uses little humor, but the humor that is in it is very high brow and funny. <br/><br/>Also, The action scenes are good also. Even though they look like Ballerinas jumping around, it still makes as much sense as traveling through black holes. <br/><br/>The film's best parts are when things get emotional. Steve pays a visit to Peggy, his old love interest from the first film. I actually felt touched by this scene, and is one of the strongest parts of any of The Avengers canon. You feel sad that he missed all his life and never got a chance to dance with her until now. <br/><br/>The Stan Lee cameo was funny. He played a security guard. He seems to always make me smile, whether he is in an amazing superhero film or a dull one. <br/><br/>Danny Pudi gets a very small role in the film as one of the people working for shield. But just seeing him made my inner fan boy go wild. (He is Abed from Community) <br/><br/>The Villains in the film are not all the special, Robert Redford's character Alexander Pierce does not give any punch I felt. But The other villains, such as The Winter Soldier and SHIELD Soldiers are cool. <br/><br/>I have nothing else to say about it. If you love Marvel, you'll love this film. If you are a non demanding film-goer, then you will like the action sequences. Its good fun at the movies. I wouldn't pay to see it in 3D, but you can if you want. Lets hope Marvel keeps going on a streak with movies like this.<br/><br/>89/100 B+"
"The-Sarkologist","9","2","5","4 April 2014"," Captain America and the National Security State
","When I think of Captain America what comes to mind is the image of a pro-capitalist crusader whose goal is to purse the interests of the American State and to fight against external threats to the security of the one percent. Such was the case in the early 20th century when Smedly Butler walked out of the US army in disgust when he realised that what he was not frighting for was the freedom of oppressed people, but rather the interests of the corporate elite, when he realised that he was overthrowing legitimate governments in favour of business friendly tyrants who exist only to enrich the shareholders. Thus was my opinion of the American state, and thus was my opinion of the superheroes that this state had created.<br/><br/>However Marvel, and in turn Hollywood (as represented by Disney) seems to be undermining its own legitimacy for the sake of a good story. In fact it is films like The Winter Soldier that seems to emphasise Hollywood's own split personality, and adds weight to the belief that the flaw of the capitalist is that they will sell you the rope by which they will hang themselves if it means they can make a buck.<br/><br/>So, how is it that this movie brings to light Hollywood's split personality? Well, The Winter Story has as the antagonist the national security state. In fact everything that comes to light in the film is a reflection of the danger that the military-industrial complex has wrought since the end of World War II. As is mention in the film, when the war was over Hydra (Captain America's nemesis organisation) was not dismantled, but it was rather absorbed into societies of the victors. As such the goal of Hydra to enslave humanity on the grounds that humanity cannot handle freedom has been transferred from the Nazi regime, who sought to take that freedom by force, over to the modern liberal democracy, who seeks to have the people give up their freedom through fear. As such, in this modern world in which Steve Rogers, the all Americian hero, finds himself, the enemy is not external, but rather arising from the state that he was created to protect, and the people that he believed that he trusted the most, are in fact his enemies.<br/><br/>This is not the first Marvel Universe movie that has gone down this road because we had the same idea in Iron Man III where a terrorist (the Mandarin) was manufactured by the military-industrial complex (the same complex of which Tony Stark is a member) in order to create fear within the people so that they would hand up their freedom for security. This is a reflection of the real world, where while September 11th was not manufactured, the fear that came about afterwards was exacerbated to the point that the pervasiveness of the national security regime is complete, and everybody's communications are effectively monitored. It is against this internal threat to our freedom and our own security – freedom from the intrusion into our own personal life, and freedom to be able to hold whatever beliefs we wish to hold (as long as those beliefs do not infringe upon the rights of others – another way that the concept of freedom cannot stand due to its own inherent dichotomy) without an external force coming in and threatening us because of these beliefs."
"qharrup","10","2","5","4 April 2014"," Go watch this... like, NOW!
","OK folks, I just got out of watching Captain America: The Winter Soldier and I have to say, this is not only the best Marvel film to date, but it is also one of the best Political and Suspense thrillers EVER MADE!!!! Seriously, go watch this movie....but watch Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers before you watch this if you haven't seen them already.<br/><br/>To start things off of why this movie is so awesome, the action! The real fight scenes with real people was amazing! I haven't been this excited by a fight scene since the dual scene in Prince Caspian! You could feel the pain and blows with every movement! The action is like Kung Fu Panda meets Bourne vs Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee mutated together! It's that epic.<br/><br/>Secondly, the humor was great. The subtlety of it all was what made it hilarious.<br/><br/>The twists and turns in the film were kind of predictable by me, but that could be because I read up on all the news articles and stuff. I do think that a lot of the plot twists will be completely unexpected to most though. The correct title of this should be Captain Bourne: The Winter Menace, or Bourne America: The Chilly Armless Dude-who-has-been-brainwashed-and-has-serious-hair-problems.<br/><br/>The acting was amazing! I know most people think of Chris Evans as a ho-hum type of actor, and while he might seem kind of low key in this film, I believe that the source of that would be that his character is a goody two-shoes (and I don't mean that in a bad way). Scarlett Johansson does great again, and this time I really felt that her character was a real person and not just someone who is always pretending. Samuel L. Jackson was also great, and while he doesn't have as much screen time as I expected, he still makes Nick Fury look like a man with a real life,... and an old cyclops Bourne. Frank Grillo's role as Crossbones was excellent! I have to say, I wish he could come back and become an Avengers baddie or something. Sebastian Stan did great with the Winter Soldier. And while it feels like the Winter Soldier wasn't as used as he should have been, he is still a great threat. Seriously, halfway through the movie I started getting freaked out by him, and I thought when I got home that he might be sitting there waiting for me. Fffffreaky!!!!! Anthony Mackie was great as well! Sam Wilson was mainly a sidekick in this film, but he worked. And I hope to see him in the Avengers 3, if not Age of Ultron. Of course, nobody can write a review without complementing Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce! He definitely sells this movie as the film it's supposed to be. I don't think I've ever seen a CIA (technically S.H.I.E.L.D) guy as planned-ahead as him. Cobie Smulders and Emily VanCamp were also good in their roles, and I do very much like what they're doing with Maria Hill.<br/><br/>This film though is pretty intense. I am now more worried about the NSA's power than before. The twists and realizing that everything you know is a lie sense of this film is also scary. I was starting to get pretty freaked out over all the betrayals and deaths. Like I said before, the Winter Soldier's presence made me scared to go to bed, he's just freaky!<br/><br/>The music is great! The composer Henry Jackman made the score more memorable than any other Marvel score yet. I mean, Alan Silvestri was OK at making music that went along with the film, but this guy Henry Jackman was great at making the film go along with the music. Captain America actually has a cool theme now!<br/><br/>I expect great things from the Russo brothers. I hope they continue to make great films like this. If I could have my way, they would direct every other Marvel film that Marvel's going to make.<br/><br/>Stan Lee's cameo is again quite hilarious.<br/><br/>And last but not least, the after credits scenes (plural, you'd better stay through them all) were both great. The first one was a teaser for what's to come in Age of Ultron. I won't spoil too much, but it does make me interested in finding out how the subject matter of this after credits scene will unfold in Avengers 2. The second after after credits scene is more a a wrap up for the film. You kind of feel that something needs to be completed when you see the film ends, and then this after credits scene fulfills that.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it a literal 9.9 out of 10. If I had one complaint, it was that the Winter Soldier wasn't developed as much as he should have been.<br/><br/>Yes, go watch this movie! No, don't wait until the DVD comes out to do so, you need to see it in it's full glory on the big screen! Yes! Believe my review! (I don't lie, and neither does Captain America, except only slightly in one scene, and I'm not even sure if it was a lie or him being honest and others mistaking it for a lie)<br/><br/>P.S They did a great job of wrapping of Peggy Carter's story, and Howard Stark's."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","5","30 March 2014"," Surprisingly and satisfyingly good sequel
","In the cinematic world of the heroes of Marvel Comics, we had the Second World War origins of Captain America in the 2011 movie, starring the engaging but not exactly charismatic Chris Evans, before seeing him back in action the following year in the team effort that was ""The Avengers"" in the US and ""Avengers Assemble"" in the UK plus a cameo role in ""Thor: The Dark World"".<br/><br/>Now we return to an outing with him front and centre in modern-day Washington DC. The flamed-haired, leather-clad Black Widow (an excellent Scarlett Johansson) - whom we saw in ""The Avengers"" - is back as his side-kick (and I do mean kick) and later they are joined by the flying Falcon (Andrew Mackie). Their foes prove to be more ubiquitous and nefarious than we could imagine with the titular Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) - flowing hair and metal left arm - especially formidable and (for Captain America himself) unlikely. S.H.E.I.L.D. has never looked more formidable with Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) joined by Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) and some amazing weaponry.<br/><br/>Those not immersed in the Marvel Comics world may sometimes wonder what is going on but, as an action movie, ""The Winter Soldier"" certainly delivers with a cracking opening sequence and regular vehicle chases, shoot ups and fist fights before the whole thing concludes with an aerial battle reminiscent of ""Star Wars"". The special effects work well. But the film also taps into the current Zeitgeist of widespread fear that the agents of law enforcement, who are supposed to be protecting us, are hoovering up digital data, subverting any notion of privacy, and eliminating threatening assets - some 20 million, it seems - before those concerned even know that they are supposedly a threat. In the massive list of credits, space should have been made for the addition of whistle-blower Edward Snowden.<br/><br/>A trade-mark of all recent superhero movies is the inclusion of a clip at the end of the credits. In the case of ""The Winter Soldier"", there is not one but two such bonuses, so stick around to the end and be sure that ""Captain America"" will be back and with the same successful directors (Anthony & Joe Russo)."
"vistheindian","9","2","5","29 March 2014"," Go watch this NOW. Captain's orders.
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Four words – Best Marvel movie yet. That's a bold claim to make, but one I stand by. In this second stand-alone appearance of Captain America, we see him struggling to come to terms with the changed perspective of the modern world on freedom and security. CA:WS takes more of a spy thriller approach to the story, which ends up being very entertaining to watch unfold. This is the most bad-ass version of Cap we have ever seen, and he encounters an equally intimidating villain called the Winter Soldier. A must-watch movie with great action, characters, and story. What more can one ask for? Do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>Time to defend my bold claim.<br/><br/>Captain America: Winter Soldier, is directed by the Russo bros. (Anthony & Joe) who are mostly known for directing TV shows. Considering this is their first big-budget movie, they absolutely did an incredible job. I like how they made this movie feel more like a spy thriller than the generic, campy comic-book action. The story is very well paced and I enjoyed watching every minute of the mystery and conspiracy unfold in front of me. Despite being a blockbuster movie, I was surprised to see it go deeper than the usual popcorn flick by touching upon some relevant social issues. That's not the focus of course, but it is nice to see the directors take a serious approach, yet still manage to keep it fun and engaging.<br/><br/>Credit has to be given to Chris Evans playing Captain America. I always liked Cap the most of all the Avengers heroes, because of how honest and incorruptible the character is. Evans continues to play him brilliantly, but in this movie we also get to see his full fighting capability. This truly is the most skilled and powerful Cap we have ever seen. The action choreography is amazing. You feel every punch he throws and you will always be on the edge of your seat. Speaking of throwing, we see some of the most creative and impactive use of the shield so far. The main villain of this movie is Winter Soldier and he was excellent. He is definitely the most intimidating villain we have seen in the Marvel movies. Every encounter between him and Cap is exhilarating to watch, especially the climax where you really feel the gravity of their struggle. There is honestly no weak link in the casting at all. Even the newcomers to this franchise such as Robert Redford and Anthony Mackie made a dent in memorable performances.<br/><br/>After watching the CA:WS I just can't deny the fact that I haven't enjoyed a Marvel movie this much since Avengers, which many, including myself consider to be the best one (till now of course). CA:WS is all the more impressive bearing in mind that it was able to deliver the same amount of enjoyment without the spectacle of all the Avengers teaming up together. That is why I have to single it out to be the best Marvel movie yet. This is a must-see. I just can't stress that enough!<br/><br/>REMINDER: There is a mid-credits and an end-credits scene, so do not leave after the movie ends. I see people make this mistake, so make sure you are not one of them. Enjoy!"
"Paul1990","10","2","5","29 March 2014"," Best individual character film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet!
","The Marvel Cinematic universe is obviously smashing the box office at the moment and I can only guess they are going to carry on doing so. This film is the best film in the series aside from the Avengers and I had a great time watching it.<br/><br/>Despite the Marvel series of films obviously being huge successes at the box office and well received amongst audiences I feel a few of their titles outside the Avengers have left me feeling a little bit disappointed, I think both Thor films are mediocre but worth a watch, the first Captain America was okay and I didn't particularly enjoy Ironman 3 (but I am a fan of the first 2). But what they have achieved with this film is a standard which is on the same level as the Avengers. <br/><br/>Good Story, brilliant fight sequences showcasing each of the characters individual styles, solid cast and all the characters are likable too.<br/><br/>POTENTIAL SPOILER: The only thing I would criticise is that Hawkeye isn't in the film at all and considering this is pretty much a film about SHIELD it seems weird he doesn't pop up at some point.<br/><br/>But all in all go see this film, I think you will have a good time!"
"cambroon","10","2","5","29 March 2014"," Brilliant!!!!
","When I saw the first film I was among the few who enjoyed it you either weren't interested in WW2 or were confused how human torch is cap but this second film is the dark knight of the captain America franchise. It packs great characters, effects, Easter eggs and darker more gritty plot just how we like it. Basically cap is now an agent of shield but starts to develop trust issues when Nick Fury assigns missions to Widow without telling him. He starts to discover all he fort for is nothing. shield has been compromised and its up to the star spangled man with a plan to save it. Overall this is brilliant 100000 times better than the first every one on the project has excelled I will even go as far to say it's the third best marvel movie behind avengers and iron man 1. Be sure you see both post credits it really sets up age of ultron and cap 3. basically if you take anything from this review it SEE THIS MOVIE! 11/10."

","Captain America:The Winter Soldier is not one of the best of Marvels Grand Plan of Phase Two. Film starts Slowly by building up tempo in which the rest of the film is a plot, sub-plot and a under-plot, which is one of the best edge of the seat excitement which was missing from iron man 3 yes there was a twist in iron man 3 but Captain America The Winter Soldier is one of the best executed films with a sub plot. the fight sequences is one of the best have seen between Cap and The Winter Soldier is an absolutely draw dropping with the fight sequence on the bridge and the intersection so fast paced which the whole emphasis on a political thriller. the Most of the craziest ever Plotception is where the plot is within a sub-plot which is in a under-plot the plot is where Steve Rodgers Must Find out how deeply compromised is S.H.I.E.L.D in which Colonel Nick Fury Is killed by H.Y.D.R.A by The Winter Soldier's Hands then the sub-plot come in to effect is where H.Y.D.R.A grew under S.H.I.E.L.D. then the under-plot is revealed is where Nick Fury is not dead but faked his death. the Ending is so spectacular it is one of the best third act i have ever witnessed in by the H.Y.D.R.A Helicarriers which stark developed the turbines which are repulses based from the iron man Armour's this film has refreshed the superhero genre in which it becomes more of a political thriller/ espionage which the action scenes are really stunning most of the film was in fact wholly created with real sets no green screen and no CGI was involved in Captain America The Winter Soldier and that is why it is so viscerally stunning.<br/><br/>the action never stops it keeps on coming just like the winter soldier which is so epic in so many ways a there was a mention to Dr Strange in which not a lot of people have seen or heard. <br/><br/>the Plaudits Must Go to Joe And Anthony Russo By Delivering A Filmography Master Piece the writers for TWS Chris Markus, Stephen McFeely The Comic Writers Ed Brubaker, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby the Actors Steve Evans, Sam Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Redford, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders and Also And Of course The Winter Soldier Sebastian Stan Brings the terrifying version of the TWS he is much more sinister than any villain in the MCU.<br/><br/>I give Captain America:The Winter Soldier A 10/10 for Intrigue, action and the most interesting stories having been transferred from the Comic Books to The Silver Screen and The Russo Brothers had me blown away easily one of the best post avengers films."
"tiffanyyongwt","10","2","5","29 March 2014"," the Captain America: The Winter Soldier movie is one of the best solo Marvel Super Hero film (so far)
","Captain America is by far, my favorite amongst the other Marvel Super Heroes. And the Captain America: The Winter Soldier movie is one of the best solo Marvel Super Hero film (so far). Taking place 2 years (real and reel time) after the Avengers (yea, that movie was awesome too!), Captain America and Black Widow are both agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. fighting in the streets<br/><br/>I can probably go on and on blabbering on why I love the almost-flawless movie so much, but it will probably sound too bimbotic after a while, so here just three filtered, non-superficial points why the movie is GREAT!<br/><br/>Amazing Fight Scenes: Unlike the other solo Marvel movies, this time, the antagonists are human (or human-lookalike/ non-God) with no superpowers where you can simply just use special effects. There were numerous fight scenes, be it the opening rescue (fight scene with Batroc, the leaper), the Winter Soldier versus Captain America fight scenes or the enclosed elevator fight scene, they were all cleverly fused with real-world action with some sort of super-hero powers that are somehow still achievable by great gymnastics stunts. <br/><br/>It is refreshing to have the action sticking to the ground, with street chases, shoot-outs and brawls in broad daylight, creating real suspense by putting the innocents in harm's way. In one of the interview articles, it was revealed that the various fighting choreography made used of a mixture of Parkour, Brazilian Ju Jitzu, karate, boxing and gymnastics.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier surprised me with his jaw-dropping knife-fighting skills. I was literally on the edge of my chair despite knowing that Captain America will most probably survive the fight unscathed. Is it odd to have a ""favorite"" villain? Loki might be funny, but he's not from the Earth, so well, the Winter Soldier wins (for now). P.S. I will love to learn his skills someday.<br/><br/>Return of The 2 Most Well-Loved Characters from Captain America: The First Avenger: The return of Bucky Barnes was a wish came true (for me). I was almost squealing ""Yes, I knew he will be back!"" when I saw him again. I don't think it was much of a surprise given that he has appeared in one of the many movie posters, however, it was immensely satisfying for me. The appearance of the other (secret!) character was definitely a tear-jerker. To have a Marvel Hero film making me cry is rare, but Captain America did that not once, but twice (in both of his films!). My tears welled up when I saw Steve Rogers visiting his past - one of his biggest regret.<br/><br/>This film is closely linked to the first movie, as well as the Avengers, and the ability to weave the man from the 1920s with mindset ""frozen"" in the 1940s while living in the present day time was amazing. I could feel the anguished Steve Rogers in a real drama, not some staged character in an exaggerated Super Hero film (pun int.). In one of the scenes where he had to use his old blue uniform, his patriotism gave me an overwhelming sense of loyalty.<br/><br/>Captain's Strong Chemistry with Falcon and Black Widow: No weak link can be found in the cast of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Black Widow's (Scarlett Johansson) femme fatale character went beyond the token female role this time, with her own little back-story and secrets. The humorous-yet-non-romantic interactions (or should I say conversations?) were simple yet impactful.<br/><br/>To me, Sam Wilson aka the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) felt like an Iron Man who willingly followed the orders of Captain America. His fight with the machines was exhilarating to watch, and a Falcon he is, indeed. Just like how Robin is to Batman, I can just see them fighting together, air and ground for the future Marvel movies.<br/><br/>I can go on and on about Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson)'s action scenes (and wonderful car), Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford)'s political schemes but I guess the best way to enjoy it is to watch it for yourself how the strong cast combine with conviction.<br/><br/>All in all, this is one of those movies where... read more: http://bit.ly/1pnPz4W"
"freemantle_uk","8","2","5","28 March 2014"," The best of Marvel Phase 2 films so far
","Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is nearly at an end and Captain America is set to return to action once again in a very entertaining and satisfying start to the 2014 blockbuster season.<br/><br/>Since the events of The Avengers, Steve Rodgers/Captain America (Chris Evans) has become a full member of S.H.I.E.L.D. and is working as a top special forces field operative. During a rescue mission to save hostages from a notorious pirate, Batroc (George St-Pierre), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) retrieves intelligence for Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) regarding Operation Insight, a scheme that allows S.H.I.E.L.D. to have three Helicarriers across the globe. With S.H.I.E.L.D. constantly targeting threats against America, Captain America objects to the morality of this policy and brings it up to Fury. Nick Fury then attempts to examine the intelligence even he does not have clearance and he becomes the target for the mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier. Captain America ends up being a public enemy, along together with Black Widow, where they both have to expose an enemy within S.H.I.E.L.D. as they are targeted by the agency.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier satisfies both as an action film and being a more complex story than any other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The conspiracy storyline forcing Captain America to go rogue is very much Marvel's version of spy thriller and our hero having to battle a secret internal threat, like Jason Bourne against Tredstone, James Bond versus Quantum and Jack Bauer and rogue elements of the Palmer administration during the second season of 24. Washington D.C. is the main setting for the film and plays a big part of the story due the film taking place in the intelligence world and like Iron Man 3 has a big conspiracy and investigation as a part of its narrative.<br/><br/>The Russo Brothers took on the directing for the sequel, who are known for directing episodes for Community and Arrested Development. For the two brothers who come from a comedy background, The Russo's end up making one of the more serious films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They successfully cut their teeth with big budget filmmaking, showing confidence by giving us a fast pace adventure, bringing us the Marvel version of a thriller and providing some solid action sequences. Some of the action sequences were shot too closely, in a confined space like a lift or in a ship, not so good during a fist fight in the middle of a city. This was made up for by an action-packed third act as Captain America battle his match and greatly realises the use of Falcon and his flight pack as the camera follows him in the sky. The action for most of the film is based around good old fashioned fist fights, gun battles and chase and there is much raw, grounded feel as Captain America fights the Winter Soldier and highly trained assassins.<br/><br/>Many actors joined the cast of Captain America and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Robert Redford adds a lot of gravitas giving his years of experience and prestige as he plays the villain of the piece. Anthony Mackie as Falcon is always a welcome presence and he allows one of Marvel's minor characters to have his time to shine. Emily VanCamp and Frank Grillo were solid enough in their supporting roles: Grillo was an impressive physical threat in the henchman role and is in really good shape for someone in his early 50s.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier has obviously uses the themes of both The Patriot Act to monitor people and the use of drones to attack potential threats and Captain America acts as a critical voice as he starts for real America values of freedom and liberty whilst S.H.I.E.L.D. which has been a more ambiguous force saying these action are used to protect America. While this film was written before the Snowden leaks, it is easy see parallels between real life events of the NSA to the action of S.H.I.E.L.D. When the villain's plot is fully revealed, it shows a more complex, subtle plan raises issues about social control and manipulation and the American Industrial-Military Complex.<br/><br/>Captain America: Winter Soldier is a film that stands on its own, servicing as an excellent stand alone event and even more rewarding to experience to fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Russo Brothers and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely give fans little Easter Eggs of the wider universe that comic fans will recognise which will not be spoiled here. There are potential set ups for expansions to the franchise and the post-credit scenes whet the appetite for more.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is film that delivers on both the action front and on story. It will please fans of Marvel and fans of action spy genre. It is the best of the Marvel Phase Two films so far.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"

"david-z-365-260176","10","3","10","27 March 2014"," The greatest superhero movie ever. (Contains spoilers)
","I had heard before I saw this film that critics were calling it 'the greatest superhero movie ever', which I assumed to be bluster and exaggeration. However I now stand corrected - I can safely say this film is my personal favourite of any superhero film and stands among the greatest; The Dark Knight, Spiderman 2 and most importantly perhaps above Avengers itself. <br/><br/>The story was, for the first time in a while, actually gripping, clever and devious. The twist of Hydra being integrated into SHIELD, controlling it and turning the concept of the the world's good spy network on its head. Brilliantly played and I never would have seen it coming. The inclusion of Dr Zola was also brilliant in his brief yet cool appearance which was a fantastic allusion to the comic books.<br/><br/>The plot twists were many and every one made me gasp and get excited like I was a 5 year old boy. The 'death' of Nick Fury, the twist of Hydra, the reappearance of Nick Fury... All brilliant. Even though this is a spoilers filled review I won't actually write any more about the story twists as I don't want to sap any of them. Probably already did actually... Oh well just work with me. <br/><br/>The characters are all played to perfection. Chris Evans again is fantastic as Cap, showing the right balance of justice, bravery, humour, devotion, charisma and the sense of being lost in the modern world which makes him brilliant. Scarlett Johansson is again great as Black Widow and in her 3rd outing of the character still had plenty of tricks and great dialogue and scenes that kept the character alive. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is as stern and cool as ever, yet also we see a more sensitive side to him and a more damaged side which I felt was very well played allowing us to feel more attached to a character I believe in the Avengers was not particularly likable. (But still cool) Robert Redford as Pierce is charming, calculating and devious, making him the perfect antagonist who seems likable and genuine yet turns out to be much more cruel than we thought. This comes onto the Winter Soldier where my only issue lies - I think Sebastian Stan played him superbly as the character came across as a cold assassin yet when he starts to remember we instantly feel attached to poor ol' Bucky, who seems so vulnerable and confused. Where my issue lies is not in the acting but in that the character did not get enough screen time - more focus was on SHIELD/Hydra and Fury/Hill/Widow/Cap than the dynamic between Cap and his old friend, which whilst still there could have been delved into a bit more. However what was there was superb. Additionally Toby Jones as Zola was maniacal and great; Cobie Smulders as Hill was again the kick- ass female commander who was cool, calm and clever; and finally Frank Grillo was great at playing Brock Rumlow aka Crossbones, you're typical soldier-bad guy who seemed good but turned out to be evil. <br/><br/>Finally I want to review the mid-credit and post-credit scenes, if you don't want to read these stop reading now (although you've already come this far, might as well carry on): The mid-credits scene added yet another twist to the story which made me squeal in delight and ties into Avengers: Age of Ultron; we saw Baron Strucker for the first time who sounded very calculating and evil, as the new head of Hydra should; what was more interesting was that he now had in his possession Loki's sceptre from Avengers which I for one had completely forgotten about but can only mean trouble. Furthermore we saw in twin cells two prisoners (and potential experiments of Hydra's?) who were twins - Quicksilver dashing madly around his cell looking confused and Scarlet Witch who in her cell was levitating blocks and then crushed them at the end looking, quite frankly, deranged, which to me screams a potentially brilliant portrayal of the character. I look forward to Avengers 2 even more now. The post-credit scene showed Bucky/Winter Soldier going to the Smithsonian to see a Captain America exhibit Steve had visited earlier in the film, looking on at a board detailing the life of Bucky and the sacrifices he made, which showed the Winter Soldier was attempting to find himself; this did fill a little of the lack of Winter Soldier-ness I mentioned earlier, it was very touching and also hints to his appearance later on in the franchise.<br/><br/>Overall a cracking film that had everything a good comic book/superhero movie should have and more. Truly fantastic work from the Russo brothers. Also I should mention here the music by Henry Jackman was also fantastic and had me elated, on the edge of my seat and in tears, sometimes all at once. Thanks for reading!"

"Quinoa1984","9","2","6","28 April 2014"," ""This isn't freedom - this is fear""
","So in short, this is what happens when you get Ed Brubaker to write the story (If not the script in full) to a Marvel movie, especially one he started on - you get the finest story and plot for a Marvel Avengers movie yet.<br/><br/>You may notice I don't say best; I'll get to my nitpicks later. In this story, we get one of those pleasurable superhero comic book movies that is so enjoyable and engaging because it's ABOUT something, and in this case it's the Captain America movie for our times. Where the first film was a good old flag waving salute to world war two, and perhaps would be best seen in that context, Winter Soldier is for the America of Wikileaks and Edward Snowden, a time when secrets are being unveiled left and right and the NSA is probably everywhere and reading as I type out this review right now. And as a story I preferred only the first half of the first avenger more for its socio-political context before it became a two dimensional portrait of heroism - but here socio-political is the name of the game.<br/><br/>What happens in the film is fairly complex to go into spoilers which... ah screw it, its Hydra. they're back, they're really the ""I was the one-armed man all along"" sort of thing, and the conflict, what really gets the story to be so impactful, is the large scope of trust. Who do you trust, who do you become paranoid of (especially when there is already suspicion, following what happened with New York), and what happens when the Good American super soldier has to be surrounded by complete uncertainty ? And more than that, what if a certain winter soldier who appears to be a super assassin (his equal in fighting prowess and cleverly is designed and costumed like the dark side version of Cap all in black with dirty black hair and guns), is someone else entirely as well. Stakes stakes stakes.<br/><br/>That's all I hope to get in the substance of these movies, and I've gotten it more often than not in these marvel studios movies (even last year in the somewhat maligned iron man 3 we got a wickedly funny look at media manipulation). On top of this is clever casting - Also spoiler, Robert Redford is not who he appears either, and its using him in such a role that makes the film enjoyable as well. Here is a guy who is an icon of 70s politic thrillers, ie days of the condor And the candidate and all the presidents men - and his image is upsided but just perfect for a movie ABOUT America in uncertain times.<br/><br/>Its surprising for me too as I didn't think I cared too much about Sap after the first film, where he was the least interesting of the Avengers bunch; Steve Rogers seemed before to work best in the context of others, interacting with the other Avengers and the 'straight' guy. here that contrast gets amplified in a very compelling way, even against a character like Natasha Romanoff, who knows where she stands and tries to stay human - let's make a joke about a kiss at least - amid the chaos.<br/><br/>Another good thing as a side note, though it's a Captain America movie, it's also a Nick fury movie in some part and there it's also successful as you're never sure about this man in charge. What secrets does he hide, who is he protecting? needless to say as the audience you can't ever totally trust your own eyes. A question posed online recently was it this is the Best Marvel Movie Yet (in caps, pun intended). to answer this, if I still don't rank it completely on par with the two gold standard movies as far as just being great entertainments - the first Iron Man and the Avengers - it's some of the action from the Russo brothers that irked me.<br/><br/>Not ALL of it, and they're not as egregious as some of the offenders of quick cut/closely shot films. but as a personal preference I just didn't care for some of the fights and action set pieces (again, not all of them, I would love to watch the nick fury car chase/shootout in the streets of DC as it is intense and decent to follow (and even to compare to the slightly similar chase in the dark knight). In some scenes and shots at times I just couldn't tell what was going on as say a winter soldier and other gunmen attack the heroes.<br/><br/>But I can easily look past that enough to say this is a winner, a film that has something to say about the world we are currently living in, how times have really changed in 70 years and what happens when a man of total conviction as Steve Rogers is up against it (as well as some old revived villains). Its almost close to being a work, if one can see it as such, that could make people look twice and go 'maybe things should change when it comes to our government'. Oh, and it's a fun goddamn kick ads spy movie thriller as well where the story points feel organic and there's even pathos near the end for characters we haven't seen too much time together with but enough for it to count.<br/><br/>And Garry shandling as a senator!!"
"Aaron1375","9","2","6","16 April 2014"," My favorite of the post Avengers films so far
","Of course, who is to say that I will not like Guardians of the Galaxy more, but of this, the second Thor film and Iron Man 3, this is so far my favorite film since the first Avengers released. Iron Man 3 was good, but relied a lot more on comedy and felt at times separate from the rest of the Marvel universe. Thor delved a bit more into Asgard, but something about it seemed somewhat low budget. Captain America, though, felt like part of the larger Marvel universe as it dropped names, had multiple characters other than Cap and had the best villains in the Winter Soldier and an organization long thought defeated. So this one felt like a big movie where the action and story were on par with the scope of the Avengers movie. Though, that may just be me, mind you.<br/><br/>The story, Captain America is assisting the Shield organization. Something though is not right and Captain America tires of working for Fury, feeling that Fury is up to something and hiding things from him. A boat mission confirms these fears as the Black Widow seems to have a different mission than the rest of the team. Soon, Nick Fury is targeted and a mysterious villain emerges to rival Captain America in the Winter Soldier and Captain America and the Black Widow must team up to learn the truth of this mysterious foe and learn what mysterious organization seems to be controlling Shield.<br/><br/>Good stuff here as Chris Pine is doing a great job as Captain America and since this is his movie he gets to show audiences his skill set as they overshadowed him a bit in the Avengers film. A nice plot here, but anyone who has read the comics are has a basic knowledge of the comics will know the identity of the Winter Soldier before the big reveal. I like the organization behind everything though, as I was not quite expecting it, but then again, seeing as how it is Captain America I should not be too surprised.<br/><br/>So the action in this film is great, but that is not too surprising. I was surprised at how well the story flowed and I am also happy to announce that the 3D was pretty good too. Though, this is only the second film I have seen in 3D since that craze resurfaced. The only other film I have seen in 3D other than this is the second Ghost Rider film, and well anything is going to look better than that I guess. I like the direction this film took and I am interested to see how the events that unfolded here will affect the next Avengers film. Though before that, I must see The Guardians of the Galaxy, though from the looks of it, not sure if it will have any impact on the next Avengers film. This one though was a great action thrill ride."

"silviamaganalopez","10","2","6","13 April 2014"," Captain America Don't Trust Anyone!
","If you enjoy a well developed story that is not confusing and has a lot of action after the development of the three main characters– Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), and Sam Wilson (Falcon)– then you will enjoy watching Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The audience can also expect some humor, especially from Sam. The costumes fit the characters and the filming locations go well with the story. Lets not forget the sound effects, they bring to life the fighting scenes, it makes the armor sound powerful, and it makes the robotic arm sound powerful and mechanical. And a particular computer generated scene doesn't have a fake effect to it. <br/><br/>Since the beginning of the film Captain America and Sam start to develop their friendship as they ""ran"" together, of course Captain America is way faster than Sam. The audience will notice that Sam is the one who will bring the humor to the film because he is a more happy person and he is not as serious as Captain America and Natasha. After Captain America is given the order to not trust anyone he has to figure out who to trust, and they are Natasha and Sam. From here on the audience will notice a love relationship between Captain America and Natasha because when they talk their tone of voice is sweet and caring, and when they look at each other their stare is deep and caring. The friendship between Captain America and Sam grows beautifully because Sam is able to make Captain America laugh and they communicate very well. Sam is also a very good friend because he is loyal to Captain America. <br/><br/>There is also humor added to the film, especially by Sam. He is a very happy person and he says things that are funny because they refer to previous scenes, or sometimes his comments imply that he has more experience living as a normal human being than Captain America and Natasha. Natasha also says some humor towards Captain America by comparing him to a fossil because he comes from a different era. And of course they let Stan Lee, the honorable Marvel president retiree and creator of some of the Marvel characters (Chauhan et al., 2013), add some humor to the film. <br/><br/>Captain America gets to keep his suit and the rest of the casts have outfits that allow them to be flexible when they fight. The filming location takes place in Washington D.C. because the opening scene shows the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. Later on the location is taken back to the place where Captain America attended boot camp in Captain America: The First Avenger, which the directors pulled off very well because it fits with the plot. Then it is taken back to Washington D.C. to end the villains plan at the S.H.I.E.L.D's headquarters. It makes sense to have the movie take place in D.C. because many important headquarters are located in D.C., like the White House, the Pentagon, etc. and in this movie S.H.I.E.L.D is an important defense program. <br/><br/>What made this movie excellent were the fighting scenes and the sound effects that went with the fighting scenes. For each fighting scene the sound effect was different but it was big and it had a constant rhythm, kind of like a heartbeat but it didn't sound like a heartbeat. Or when Captain America throws his shield, it has a powerful hit by the sound effect used. Also, the Winter Soldier's mechanical arm is powerful and the sound effect used has that power when he clenches his hand, and sometimes it has a mechanical sound effect because the arm is robotic. A stunning scene is the disguise of a character because it is computer generated but it doesn't have a fake image effect. <br/><br/>People will enjoy watching Captain America: The Winter Soldier and they won't regret spending $6 or more to go see it. The main characters have a well-developed relationship that allows them to trust each other. The directors were able to add some humor to the movie even though the movie has a serious tone because Captain America has to be aware of who to trust and not to trust. And the audience will enjoy the fighting scenes because the sound effects give the thrill and excitement to the scenes. <br/><br/>References Chauhan, Y., Cunningham, J.M., Das, D., Kuiper, K., & Tikkanen, A.

"classicsoncall","8","2","6","12 April 2014"," ""Looks like you're giving the orders now, Cap"".
","I just read an interesting article on the film's directors, Anthony and Joe Russo. When they say it, you have to believe it - the picture is something of a commentary on present day, big government spying and terror-suspect 'kill lists' that have become topical with the advent of wiretapping by the National Security Administration and drones equipped to target enemies of the state. One of the more chilling ideas presented by Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) in the film was his objective to put seven billion people on the planet under his rule by wiping out a few million at a time until everyone gets their mind right. The movie presents society at a tipping point between freedom and chaos, and Cap had me when he declared his life against the threat of modern day tyranny.<br/><br/>That's probably all just a bit too deep for a film based on a comic book super hero. But comics have never been shy about dealing with current topics, and neither have films. However if all that makes your head hurt, you can simply go into this as a slam bang action flick and it will still be entertaining. Captain America (Chris Evans) and his trusty shield deal out some nasty damage during the course of the story, and sometimes it's so fast paced you wish they'd slow things down a bit so you can keep up with it all. With Cap, you have a 1940's hero who's still trying to adjust to his new life while holding on to the values that made America great.<br/><br/>So while you're trying to keep up with the fast paced action, there's also a story line that can get a little tricky if you're not paying attention. The whole notion of not trusting anyone posited by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) keeps Cap and the viewer on the look out for a double cross at every turn. He finds he can put his faith in a couple of resolute companions, the sexy Black Widow Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and high flying Falcon Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie). Mackie actually gets some of the picture's best lines, like when he describes being a sidekick to the Captain - ""I do what he does, just slower"".<br/><br/>And as always, my Marvel movie review wouldn't be complete if I didn't tip my hat to one of the guys that started it all back in the day, the inimitable Stan Lee, who cameos here as a security guard. When he discovers that someone (it was Cap) stole the museum's original Captain America uniform from a patriotic display, he declares his fate by stating - ""Oh man, I am so fired""."
"jojifrey","8","2","6","5 April 2014"," Not a BOOMbastic twist
","Watched the movie a coupla hours ago, was dissatisfied due to the end of credits scene (after the twin scene) was totally not worth the wait. Just watch it on youtube.<br/><br/>The Captain was as handsome as usual. Chris Evans is such a purrfect cast. The whole story though, a bit of a drag. No surprise factor except a spectacular action-vaganza.<br/><br/>Expect to be very entertained for the fast moving vehicles, fighting moves whether on the ground or in the sky, and waiting for the bomb to not explode.<br/><br/>The characters who made me interested are the Winter Soldier and Falcon. Other characters, are simply garnishes. Not really meaningful, especially that female Shield agent played by Colbie Smoulder. Why is she so underused? Her appearance is never as funny as Coulson, and yet she portrays an important position. Only made an appearance not as much as the total of my fingers.<br/><br/>The twist was ... a big spoiler if I say it here, but it was not a BOOMbastic twist. Not a breeze of fresh air at all. As a matter of fact, it was an old story made into the play. And this made the story goes stale.<br/><br/>But my crappy critic is nothing compared to the entertaining visual effects, acting, and flow of the movie that I am willing to give it an 8/10."
"tyse1","8","4","17","28 March 2014"," It could have been a lot worse....
","Since I wasn't a huge fan of Cap's first outing, the levels of expectation were kept to a minimal here as I took my seat in a sold-out movie theater in the heart of Manchester; and to be fair, the events to follow were no less (and certainly no more) than I expected. <br/><br/>Substituting a well-thought out script, character development and an actual plot for cheesy one-liners, multicolored onesies and big-ass explosions, this second installment in the Captain America side-quel franchise simply fails at being anything more than a money-spinner. If this is your kind of thing then I would probably recommend the big- screen experience, especially if you're a Marvel-lover. However if you appreciate quality rather than quantity then you might want to head for the corner house down the road. <br/><br/>The main issue with The Winter Soldier is the main man - Chris Evans just fails to deliver a convincing hero that us, the audience, can relate to and root for. It doesn't help when he's placed in the company of Academy regulars such as the likes of Samuel L Jackson and Robert Redford, who almost have fun showing him up for what he really is.<br/><br/>Even with a half-decent lead this film still would have sucked due to the screenwriter apparently being on minimum wage and not able to care deeply enough about the characters to make the audience do anything else other than laugh at how pathetic they are. <br/><br/>The reason this film has a '6' as opposed to say a '2' is because of the action sequences, which were the only aspect of the film that kind-of succeeded. At the same time as being insanely preposterous and at times just plain ridiculous, the magic of cinema really did immerse you in some jaw- dropping battle sequences (of which there were many) and unintentional comic fight scenes; and since this factor is what these films are all about for most people, I suppose Russo was successful in that respect. <br/><br/>It must be said however that if I was watching this picture for the first time on the small screen, the rating would be considerably lower."
"fernandoschiavi","9","1","2","2 March 2020"," A whole atmosphere of espionage, action thriller, a sense of constant threat that grows and unfolds over time
","Even in the comics, the Captain was always closer to reality. In the first film, he was fighting Nazis. In the aftermath, current controversial topics like drone bombings, illegal espionage by the NSA and WikiLeaks, the publics temptation to surrender their civil liberties in exchange for a sense of security. At one point in the film, for someone who trusts in human potential, Steve Rogers decision to wear his classic uniform again at a defining moment represents a man who faces a corrupt present with ideological weapons from the past, aiming to create a better future.<br/><br/>With just over two hours of projection, there is time to develop Captain America/Steve Rogers. This man's honor is even more evident and put to the test with today's conflicts. In fact, it is interesting to see the Captain, who slept for decades, still looking for an adaptation to today's world, of new inventions, technology and the behavior of society in general. And let's face it, two years is a short time for those who have lost decades of humanity. Steve's notebook in which he writes down tips of things he has lost in the past few decades and should update himself is a great example of this. This conflict of the past adapting to today's world was an expected theme.<br/><br/>Other important aspects that place Rogers in his current emotional state at the beginning of the film, is Steve's melancholic reunion with his aging girlfriend Peggy (Hayley Atwell). The hero's quest to locate himself in a world whose morals are portrayed in increasingly gray tones is his main conflict. Has the good man now been relegated to a simple museum piece In fact, Steve's visit to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History exhibit does not have an egotistical character, but it does show an individual recalling the values for which he fought and bled. Seeing that chapter of his life, returning in a painful way, both in Peggy's illness, in the threatening form of the Winter Soldier and in the ghosts of Zola (Toby Jones) and the fascism of the organization HYDRA.
In Captain America the Winter Soldier, certain aspects already present in the characters first film are even more present and guide the entire narrative of this plot. There is a whole atmosphere of espionage, action thriller, a sense of constant threat that grows and unfolds over time, involving conspiracy, betrayals, investigation, spectacular escapes, persecutions in the correct pace of spectacular action. Here, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo move the action according to the narrative amidst many dialogues and an intriguing plot. The action is never exaggerated and unbalanced, besides being directed with extreme competence. Directors abuse high-speed action scenes on highways, in bold camera frames that put you into the action and, for the most part, shot in broad daylight, which makes it much more complicated to hide any misuse of effects, which never happens. Another merit is the high number of scenes of corporal fight, without abrupt cuts, seeking to use more open plans and sequence plans.<br/><br/>These action sequences and visual effects are present from the first to the last minute and, as always, are impeccable. We witnessed a great sequence, right at the opening, when the Captain, alongside his team of trained SHIELD agents, invaded a ship hijacked by pirates and, shortly after, the attack suffered by Nick Fury on the streets of Washington, in addition to the persecution of the Winter Soldier to the Captain, Black Widow and Hawk around town, and obviously in all the action present in the last act of the film after the discovery of the great conspiracy involving HYDRA, which extended its tentacles within the spy agency SHIELD and seeks to materialize a megalomaniacal plan involving the aircraft of the Insight project. Incidentally, this last act can be compared in scale and quality to that seen previously in The Avengers.<br/><br/>Anthony and Joe Russo have a simple plot in hand, but it is complicated at certain times by editing, especially in explaining the main plot at the old Captains training site, but that does not compromise understanding. In general, the viewer will see, as in the previous films of the other characters, an evolution in the character's narrative line, which will bring consequences at the end of phase 2 in The Age of Ultron. The combination of an impactful action in a context that mixes espionage, suspense, unexpected twists is very well dosed. Even though the film has a more serious tone, with a real threat to the characters, humor, even to a lesser extent, is present, as it could not help missing. Together with The Avengers (2012), it is perhaps the best film from Marvel Studios, and represents a huge leap in quality for the studio."

is was expecting all style, no substance, token plot, wooden
performances, lives and dies by action scenes and special effects.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier has the action scenes and special
effects, but it has much more than that. Plot is fairly good. Not
watertight, but moves along well, mostly makes sense, and has some
character development.<br/><br/>Performances are good. The interplay between Chris Evans and Scarlett
Johansson works and the supporting cast give solid performances.<br/><br/>Overall, an entertaining movie and the best of the Marvel movies."
"Min111","Null","1","2","24 July 2017"," I liked how serious it was
","Captain America Winter Soldier was just an amazing film: great action packed thriller. It's undoubtedly one of the best films within the Marvel Universe, but the amazing thing about Winter Soldier is that even if it wasn't a superhero movie, it will still be a really amazing movie, and one of the best action-spy-thrillers of all time. The amazing thing about Captain America is that all its movies, besides the Winter Soldier, are amazing in their own right; the same cannot be said with all of the other superhero movies within the Marvel Universe. The story was very interesting, and though it's called the ""Winter Soldier"", that character didn't really get much of a screen time for some reason unless I'm missing something. Unlike most of the other movies within the Marvel Universe, Winter Soldier is one of these movies you would see possibly again. It was entertaining for nearly the entire duration. And that's why many like this movie. The movie looked serious too, and it was important within the Marvel Universe, especially for what is to come later. It was an interesting movie."

","When viewed in the context on the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe and the superhero genre itself, it's easy to see that the Captain America films are some of the best. The first one was a authentic war period piece from the 1940's, and now The Russo's Brothers, with their low filmmaking experience, take what the first set up and expand it to make a phenomenally film know as Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>This was always my favorite one. Even when I had seen it in theaters back in 2014 I knew that this was the one I was waiting for. Not only did The Russo Brothers improve on the first but decided to make a spy thriller instead of a superhero film. That's what I think makes the film itself so good, it's ability to be a superhero film second. Their idea to make it a primary espionage film is spectacular.<br/><br/>Both directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, The Winter Soldier is a marvel to see on screen. Their slick and darkish tone with the character of Captain America coincide perfectly. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the visuals are brilliant. The action is shot perfectly with well choreographed fights and great editing. Along side a menacing and unique score the film is boosted up to the sky with it's technical aspects.<br/><br/>Bringing his own flare and charismatic genius once again, Chris Evans is awesome as Captain America. He is so energetic and just feels so real. The casting is something Marvel Studios I feel always gets right. Scarlett Johansson was a great addition for Captain America as she brings her usual great moves and her spy like demeanor. Anthony Mackie, Robert Redford, Sebastian Stan, all these great actors giving their all in roles simply *made* for them. I couldn't see anyone else in their roles and their chemistry is fantastic.<br/><br/>Some may see my rating as a bit too high, but to me it's perfect. The Avengers may be their best film but, this is my *favorite* MCU film. That's saying a lot, because I watch these films so much I lost count, I've probably seen this at least ten times. What Anthony and Joe Russo did with this and really the entire superhero genre is stunning, taking an interesting character and bringing in an unfamiliar genre to add was pure brilliance. In short, Captain America: The Winter Solider is top tier God level filmmaking and one of my favorite superhero films of all time."
"mjplysaght","8","1","2","23 January 2017"," Fantastic action but no lasting stakes
","So, after seeing Captain America in his first standalone film and then in The Avengers, I thought he was a decent character but wasn't completely enthralled by him.<br/><br/>Well, things get taken up a gear in The Winter Soldier as Cap tries to deal with life in the 21st century. His old flame from the 40s is bedridden and senile, post-9/11 America starts to scare him, and ultimately he must learn to trust no one.<br/><br/>SHIELD gets infiltrated, taking Nick Fury out of the picture, so Cap and Black Widow must fend off the Winter Soldier and the rest of the SHIELD double agents, later found out to be members of HYDRA. They must prevent Robert Redford's character; the corrupt leader of SHIELD from using heavily armed aircraft carriers to decimate the city.<br/><br/>So, the Winter Soldier is revealed to be Bucky Barnes, Cap's childhood friend from back in the day, who coincidentally got frozen and experimented on with the same super serum as Cap. And I'm not gonna lie, he's pretty badass. The first scene we see him or when he's escaping from Cap after sniping fury, I get chills every time. He is more of a threat to Cap because of course, he is brainwashed and also, Cap doesn't want to kill his friend.<br/><br/>Cap also befriends Sam Wilson or Falcon in this movie, and his debut entry with the mechanical wings on top of a skyscraper is possibly my favourite entry for a superhero ever.<br/><br/>The action in this film is incredible. The pyrotechnics and combat are amazing to look at, but they're not done in a gratuitous way (like Michael Bay, for instance) The only flaw of this film is the overall lack of stakes. Yeah, sure, Robert Redford gets eliminated but that was kinda predictable. Nick Fury gets shot and is pronounced dead in hospital. Turns out he survived. Rumlow gets crushed by falling building debris. Oh no, it's OK, he's coming back for Civil War. Cap receives fatal gunshot wounds, gets beaten in the face with a metal appendage and falls about 500 feet into the middle of the ocean. Don't worry, he's fine! See what I mean? The one problem with these Marvel films is that you know deep down, they're always going to play it safe. These films are laid out on a conveyor belt after all. These actors have multi-movie contracts.<br/><br/>Aside from that, this is my favourite Marvel movie. It mixes elements of spy thriller and action films into a superhero film and it works dividends. It has my absolute recommendation."

","At first, you feel that you're in for a superhero super action. But then, you feel that you're in the titanic, while its sinking!<br/><br/>Let me cut to the chase: If Nick Fury has a device that transports him from place to another in nanosecond; why he didn't runaway from the car while the attack on him? And if he knew that Captain America's safe house is being watched; why he went to it? And if the evil guy knew that he was there; why didn't he kill him earlier? And if Fury assigned a girl to protect Captain America undercover; why she didn't act professionally and observe anything else that the radio's music was on? And if Alexander Pierce (played by Robert Redford) had a device that could kill all the board's members; why he didn't use it since the start? And if that so-called device could kill; how Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) didn't die out of it? And if Fury died, and became SO DEAD; how he was alive again?! And please, can anybody sane tell me how Hydra was controlling S.H.I.E.L.D. during 70 years??!! So whether the script finds it enjoyable to not telling us the answers, or DOESN'T KNOW THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE! As you see, this should have been named Captain America: Power of Idiocy, or Captain America: The Whys and The Hows!<br/><br/>In the climactic sequence, the script nearly committed suicide. If The Winter Soldier saved his friend in the end, how come he would be a menace afterwards?! And it seemed to me that Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie) transformed into hero haphazardly. It's as if anybody Captain America might meet in his life would be a hero, good or bad one, later! And, for the love of God, how Captain America wants to sacrifice himself, again, for saving the world, again, after the first movie?! I believe that there is some unofficial rule that says ""Do not repeat the first movie's end in its sequel"". But I believe that it takes clever people to apply it as well!<br/><br/>The dialogue is beyond silly, the information are being thrown at you faster than raindrops in a terrible torrent, and the cliché of ""Kiss me, so the bad guys can't find us"" is hateful among all the other clichés, since they look at it as the most trite!<br/><br/>The whole cast is infected with the epidemic of Woodenness. Johansson and Mackie were the most sick. However, it was more than painful to see the honorable Mr. Redford turning into wood! When I heard that he would play a role in a movie finally, and that role was in a commercial movie, that happened to be a superhero blockbuster-I was surprised and enthusiastic. I remember things like praising the movie's makers for convincing him to do so, and envying them for having him too. But, eventually, it was the peak of frustration when he looked like a perfect Robert Redford pod. Regrettably, he wasn't evil as a character, but he was so evil as an actor!<br/><br/>The movie is overall heavy. It's 136 minutes, yet feels more than that already. The direction of the dramatic scenes was TV-ish. I lived a soap-opera disguised as a sci-fi action thriller. And it came with all the mortal sins; from the lifeless cadres to the awful acting!<br/><br/>On the contrary, the direction of the action did awesome sequences. The CGI approached greatness. There were creative, really cool, new weapons. And the Neo-Nazism's plan to take over the world digitally was absolutely fantastic. However, if you think that the virtues' list is long.. Be sure, the vices' list is longer!<br/><br/>In its first 2 movies, Captain America pushed me to the ""This will rock"" yell, to end up with a ""Rock the boat"" situation. Frankly, after this one's end, the boat tanked, and I found myself singing ""My heart will NOT go on""!<br/><br/>..Nevertheless, I hope that part 3 will be better than so-so, because I got fed up with 2 of that kind!"
"taggard-98527","9","1","2","16 April 2016"," Captain America returns with an incredibly gritty spy thriller.
","The good - Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson reprise their roles as Captain America and Black Widow with every bit of energy as their previous performances. It's great to see the more human side of Natasha (a precursor to Age of Ultron) and Evan's Cap is more than capable of making me cheer for a true hero in an anti-hero world. If nothing else, you believe that people would line up behind him to fight.<br/><br/>The great - Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson (Falcon) is the heart, humor and humility of this film. He is a fantastic addition to the MCU and I bought his relationship with the Cap from the first moment. Being a big fan of the Cap and Falcon books as a kid, I felt this struck the exact right tone. I expect great things from the character going forward.<br/><br/>The awesome - I love the third act of this movie. The assault on the Triskelion, Cap's speech to S.H.I.E.L.D., the final battle with The Winter Soldier, Widow's twist...it all worked for me. One of the best third acts in a series that has always excelled in them. Something should also be said for the close combat fight choreography in the film. The elevator fight got my vote for best fight scene in all the MCU in a recent poll and some of the hand to hand knife work is simply outstanding.<br/><br/>The darkness - Following on the ""dark"" tone of Thor: The Dark World, the Russo brothers give us a spy thriller, wrapped inside of a comic movie, and I am not entirely sure it always works. The first act is rather disjointed, and a bit hard to follow (even after watching it a few times). The second act is a bit slow for me and while I loved Arnim Zola, I wanted him to stick around. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't take off until the third act, and, by that time, the spy thriller is pretty much over.<br/><br/>Summary - If I stopped watching this movie midway it would score much lower than it will. The third act pays off tremendously, and makes this one of the better MCU films. I don't get the absolute love this movie gets from many Marvel CU fans, as many feel it is the best of them. I certainly don't get that, but I think it might have to do a lot with the whole ""dark and gritty"" thing, exemplified by the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. I have a hunch that they also think The Dark Knight is a best comic book movie of all time, and while it is a decent answer, it is still wrong...that honor belongs to Iron Man. :)<br/><br/>Bottom line, for me, is that I love the lighter tone of (most) of the rest of the MCU, and while I enjoyed Captain America: The Winter Soldier (particularly the last act), it falls just short of the original."
"rolando19552001","9","1","2","23 March 2016"," Best Marvel movie
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier <br/><br/>This is the best Marvel superhero film, at least my personal favorite. It is better than the first entry of this super hero character, Captain America: The First Avenger. Where to begin? There is the political intrigue since the start of the film. Who is the bad guy? Is Nick Fury corrupt? All these questions get answered eventually as the film develops from a start that exposes a state in which everything is under control and serene into chaos and gun fights. Redford is giving an important role in this film. SHIELD is compromised since the start. You cannot trust anyone, Captain America learned this right away. Also it is worth the mention of the Captain's old flame, Peggy is still alive and she is quite sick, she has aged 70 years and she remembers Rogers. It get emotional as it had been a long time since World War II where their story had been so tragically separated from each other. Rogers needed to see her after all these years and Peggy seemed genuinely sad and hurt due of the distance in time, it has been too long. Indeed it is bittersweet for both of the would be lovers of another era. The time is gone and time does not wait for anyone. Then the attacks are done against the director and the soldier. Captain America is not easy to kill and he is bulky and has super strength but he can get hurt by guns and bullets. Captain America is disavowed by SHIELD, but this organization is not what it appears. Captain America thought he had defeated the enemy Hydra and the Red Skull in the end of World War II, but his sacrifice was not an end, it appears. There a good scene when the former Hydra scientific doctor, Zola, had been given an old dated artificial intelligence because his body had failed him and his mind had been stored in this computer. Mackie is the Falcon, a man that glides in the sky with a machine with wings. It is cool to watch, but it seems a bit too fantastic. Johansson is back as Natasha Romanov and she acts accordingly. The action is great the Winter Soldier had known Steve Rogers before, they had been best friends. The winter assassin had been Bucky Barnes and all people had thought that he had died in the bridge falling off a train. But he had not died, he survived and was used by the evil doers, Hydra, to kill many leaders and people around the world. It was said that he shaped the last century. The Winter Soldier has forgotten a lot of things, his memory had been wiped clean by the shock therapy he has underwent, it is quite disturbing. In the end the bad guys want to kill people that they deemed threats in the present and the future. They have super machines that are sky bound heavy with guns to kill the people, which are millions and millions. Captain America must stop this at all cost and there is CGI action in the end, that diverts a bit the old school action of the film. An important part of the film is that it details the political struggle in today's world. How freedom and liberty are being put in jeopardy. I love the part when the Cap. says ""The price of freedom is high, like it always have been, but this is a price I am willing to pay."" It was a good moment in the film. This film gets emotional with Captain America trying to recover his old friend, Bucky that is oblivious to his best friend. The Winter Solider sees the Cap. as only a end of his mission. Can Rogers win back his friend? The answer of this question is not easily answered as there is a lot of things to look forward in the sequels. Well, the Winter Soldier is a great film, yes it is better than Avengers Assemble that is a bit overrated. This is the best Marvel film. I give it a 90 percent rating, 4 and half stars. Solid action, solid story, it is good film all around. Highly recommended, maybe and hopefully I can have a second viewing of this film because it deserved so."
"dee.reid","8","1","2","1 June 2015"," A well done ""Soldier""
","I guess I should admit up front that I'm not a fan of Captain America, or patriotic superheroes in general. Which is why I have been extremely hesitant about approaching Marvel's ""Captain America"" film series. I've just never been a fan of the character, that's all.<br/><br/>So, I approach Captain America the same way I approached DC Comics' Superman, in which while I never read the original comics that inspired the character, I entertain myself with the big-budget cinematic depictions, and go from there - like reading the comics if I chose to.<br/><br/>I haven't seen 2011's ""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" but I was eager - however - to see its 2014 sequel, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" Part of the problem I was even more hesitant to see these movies was the casting of Chris Evans. I remember Chris Evans from the two ""Fantastic Four"" movies where he played Johnny Storm/The Human Torch and as one of the few people to like that two-film series, I thought he was perfect there. I have a personal rule about Hollywood actors playing more than one superhero (I'm looking at you, Ben Affleck) - since the superhero bandwagon is one ride it seems that everybody wants to hop onto. But, Evans's golden-boy good looks and straight-forward attitude make him an ideal pick for the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America.<br/><br/>The first ""Captain America"" was set during World War II. The sequel, ""The Winter Soldier,"" is set in the present (2014), and features Steve Rogers trying to embrace his role in the modern world - since the patriotic ideals and values about freedom and democracy that he fought for 70 years earlier have given way to a shadier, morally gray outlook for the future of humanity. In other words, he doesn't feel he's fighting for the same good reasons now, that he was during World War II.<br/><br/>Part of the problem stems from his immediate superior, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who stresses that things have changed drastically since Cap's WWII heyday. As the film begins, Rogers and his chief associate Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) uncover a conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D. that refers to the ghosts of the World War II era - namely the rogue Nazi science division HYDRA, which apparently did not die out with the surrender of Nazi Germany to the Allies in May 1945. So Captain America and The Black Widow are forced to go on the run as enemies of the government, and the pair are forced to confront the ""Winter Soldier,"" a Russian heavyweight who has a frightening connection to Rogers's past.<br/><br/>Also along the for the ride is newcomer Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), an Iraq War veteran with a secret of his own - he possesses an experimental flight harness that reveals him to be the superhero The Falcon, who in comics history was the first black-American superhero and who was also one of Captain America's closest allies in the comics. I partially wanted to see ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" to see the Anthony Mackie debut as The Falcon.<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a big, loud superhero-fest. The co-directing team of the Russo Brothers - Anthony and Joe - is one of the more interesting brotherly cinematic pairings in recent memory; the script - by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely - is also quite inspired (it draws heavily from a critically acclaimed comic book story arc called ""The Winter Soldier"" by Ed Brubaker, which I haven't read). The Russo Brothers and Markus & McFeely do pay particular attention to the fact that Steve Rogers is now a man out of his time, fighting for reasons that are vastly different from what he originally became Captain America for. Another thing the movie also does well is how it pays attention to how much the world has changed since the beginning of the 21st century, or more particularly, after 9/11, and how some people believe that some freedoms must be sacrificed in order to ensure security (and how some will surely exploit the loss of those freedoms for their own purposes). The movie also plays up some of the more recent conspiracy theories that have cropped up as a result of this - and having film legend Robert Redford (as Alexander Pierce, Nick Fury's close friend and colleague), who appeared in a number of conspiracy films back in the 1970s (which resulted from Vietnam and Watergate), is just the icing on the cake here.<br/><br/>In some ways, this is one of the more ""mature"" superhero films produced since the beginning of the 21st century (I would argue that honor goes to ""Spider-Man 2,"" which came out all the way back in 2004, but I know for a fact that I'm surely outnumbered on this assertion). But as can be expected, some of the attempts at slowing things down to get a grasp on the characters and story and some of the underlying conflicts between the beliefs and ideals of the past (and how they relate to the present day) get drowned out by the special effects and explosions. That's not a fault of the Russo Brothers, really, but just the fact that Hollywood has come to expect so little from some of those in the audience that DO want more, and not less.<br/><br/>8/10"
"g-bodyl","10","1","2","9 March 2015"," Marvel Strikes Again!
","In recent years, Marvel has been known for churning out quality products and Captain America: The Winter Soldier is no exception. It's a film that is high in action, but also high in substance and characterization. Unlike the first Cap film or the Avengers, this film is unique because it is an intriguing political thriller that was influenced by similar 70's thrillers. The film has great visuals and some darn good action scenes. y favorite is the car chase featuring Nick Fury and the opening action sequence with Cap rescuing SHIELD hostages from pirates. <br/><br/>Anthony and Joe Russo's film deals with Captain America in the aftermath of the events from the Avengers as he struggles with the modern world and the complexity of this world. Captain America, along with Black Widow and new ally Falcon, are put to the test when Fury admits that SHIELD has been compromised and they must go on the run and try to infiltrate SHIELD and get rid of the bad guys as well as deal with the past when he finds out the Winter Soldier is actually his best friend. <br/><br/>The acting, once again, remains spectacular. Chris Evans really builds up Captain America's persona from the events of the first film and the Avengers. Scarlett Johannsson is beautiful as ever and is a fine Widow. Samuel L. Jackson thankfully returns as Nick Fury and as always, I love his demeanor. Anthony Mackie makes a fine Falcon and trade wits with Evans very well. I am surprised Robert Redford would appear in a Marvel movie, but odder things have happened. I thought he did an excellent job. <br/><br/>Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a film that takes the success of recent Marvel films and pushes it to a new level. I love how they tonally changed the film and turned it into a spy/political thriller. As a cinema buff, that makes me very pleased that Marvel is willing to stray away from formula. With most Marvel films, the action is great as the stunts are regularly growing bigger and bolder. The film is more complex as we see Captain America face his inner moral dilemmas in the modern world as he tries to take down the bad guys. I cannot wait to see Captain America again in the Avengers sequel. <br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

","Where do I start, Well if you like formulaic, predictable, bad guys are so awesome, and there henchmen can't hit nothing, combined with predictable plots, and over the top fight and carnage scenes, then you will love this movie, you really will. But if you like plot, real surprises, somewhat plausible fiction action, then I think you may not. Let me mention the cliché fight scenes, with the stand issue unaware armed bad guys, who senses nothing is amiss, or that can't hit the broad side of a barn with a spray of bullets ever? Or maybe people crashing through glass and walls and not a scratch or injury, and those are not even the super heroes! or maybe the predictable plot, we just sat and guessed with 80% accuracy on every character,motive or situations as they were introduced or started. I read captain America comics from the mid 60s to 70s, and many reissues a a kid of back in the 40s. They should have just ended all the superheroes by the early 80s, they have all gotten so much like soap operas, bad karate flicks, and all special effects at the neglect of a good believable characters and plots within the fictitious super hero world. Now I do have to say the convenient light traffic and near empty D.C. city streets for mayhem scenes, how original (yawn. Hollywood puts so much over the top stuff in each of these new super hero films , that everyone who has a listed part is a superhero even if there a staff worker in a random office. dead bodies everywhere, major carnage in the street, and several hours later Captain America had no knowledge of what happened down town that was near equal to 911. amazing! I'm glad i got a movie editor program, I'll be trimming the junk to nite this will be a 70 minute movie if I'm lucky. . Please just not so predictable and less special effects that are nothing but to far fetched to be even plausible even for fiction. I know it's all fiction, but even Disney use to say it has to be somewhat plausible, even for talking animals!"

","This movie is great. I walked into the theater with high hopes and was not disappointed. The action was breathtaking and the story-line kept me on the edge of my seat. Captain America really showed off his skills in this film too. In The Avengers and Captain America:The First Avenger, Cap does not show off his skills. Before this film Cap was one of the least popular Avenger. But,this movie turned things around. He is now one of the most popular Avengers. Also, Falcon was a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Hopefully he will have an important role in the upcoming Avengers films. Also, The Winter Soldier was an amazing villain. The twist of Bucky being alive was excellent and the fact that he is now against Cap is even better.

He doesn't have time to dwell though as things kick off big style pretty quickly - a tale of espionage, world domination, assassination and of course super heroes follows. It flys along at fair old pace from the outset from one action set piece to the next with a few quieter character beats in between.<br/><br/>As well as Cap, Nick Fury and Black Widow return and The Falcon is introduced - I was intrigued as to how they would convincingly introduce the character and to be fair they've done a pretty good job. The titular Winter Soldier joins the fun as well and is another good creation. Readers of the comics will most likely already know his identity and story arch, I felt his introduction fitted the plot pretty well.<br/><br/>It works as a standalone movie of course but there are various seeds set for future films, including the next Avengers flick.

","Starring- Chris Evans, Scarlett Johnansson, Anthony Mackie, Frank Grillo, Sebastian Stan, Cobie Smulders, Robert Redford, and Samuel L. Jackson<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier 8/10- After seeing Thor: The Dark World, I was skeptical at how this sequel of Captain America will turn out. The Dark World was such a disappointment that I was almost certain that Captain America: The Winter Soldier would be nothing more than a good trailer. I was dead wrong. Captain America has earned the right to be mentioned in the same breathe as The Avengers and Iron Man. The plot of this film is by far superior than any other Marvel entry and the connections that it makes with the original film while still moving on to the next- stage of film making is without a doubt the biggest accomplishment of this picture. <br/><br/>The thing that made this sequel unique from all of the other Marvel films, with the exception of possibly Iron Man, is the enemy. Most of the Marvel films have a foreign enemy, an enemy that comes from a competing company, country, or realm. The Winter Soldiers enemy comes from S.H.I.E.L.D.This enemy is apart of the organization that swore to protect the world. That is the reason that Steve Rogers A.K.A. Captain America joined S.H.I.E.L.D. The way they introduce this new enemy is something that really keeps you entertained and wondering what will happen next. <br/><br/>All of the new and returning characters were a great choice of being added to this film. I was glad that this film focuses on the inner-workings of S.H.I.E.L.D. I was wondering which sequel Natasha Romanoff, who is played by Scarlett Johansson, would play in and they made they best choice of putting her in this one. Nick Fury, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson, was the obvious slam-dunk choice for this film and I was glad to see that he is more involved in this movie. It would have not been the same without him. <br/><br/>The acting is really secondary to all of the other aspects of the film but I would still like to point out some performances that no one else could have done better. The Chris Evans- Scarlett Johansson duo really was a breathe of fresh air considering that a lot of the superhero movies of today feature more solo heroes. They both had great chemistry together and I easily believed that they were going on secret-missions for years. I really have to applaud Chris Evans because I feel like he has tremendous potential as an actor. Seeing him play the too cool for rules, playboy Human Torch in Fantastic Four to seeing him play the straight-laced soldier in Captain America, it just seems like his acting can only go up at this point and he was without a doubt a perfect choice for this film. Samuel L. Jackson is without a doubt the master of the all wise but very angry leader of everyone, and his character Nick Fury is a great of example of that. <br/><br/>Again, none of the other Marvel movies even compare to how great of a plot this film has. This aspect alone is enough to make it an enjoyable movie experience, and when you factor in all of the others parts of the movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier goes above and beyond in every way. I definitely recommend this as your first choice walking into the theater. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"tofewviews","8","1","2","1 October 2014"," Great Friday night movie, enjoyed it much more then the first.
","Let me start off by saying, I wasn't the biggest fan of the first Captain ""Murica"" film so going into this film I didn't have the highest of hopes. But I was really surprised on how much I enjoyed this film, It acts as a squeal to the first Captain America film and The Avengers so there is lots for the story to cover. It follows Cap working with SHIELD and highlights how different his views are compared to that of SHIELD. All the big name SHIELD agents are back to :Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie. The Action in this movie (What really Matters) Is amazing, Car cases,Great CGI and just all around ass kicking. It held my attention much better then the first, great for a weekend movie night"
"jb_campo","8","1","2","30 September 2014"," Captain America Takes Charge
","I was lucky enough to get this film from my local library, so I watched it several times. I love many of these Marvel films, but the Captain America ones are the best...better than Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, or Spiderman. Maybe it's Chris Evans good looks and goody two shoes qualities, or the good guys fighting the bad bad guys. But Cap America has a storyline that works.<br/><br/>You really can't talk much about this film without giving out spoilers. Just be ready for some major changes. My fave scene by far is the elevator scene where it becomes obvious who is on what side. Plenty of great fighting, and as you'd expect, a finale involving Cap and Winter Soldier. <br/><br/>It would have been cool for Cap to get together with Black Widow, but it seems that at least for now, not happening. Keep it up Marvel. enjoy."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","27 September 2014"," Its best feature is giving your subwoofer a great workout!
","It was almost 3 years ago when I saw the initial Captain America movie with Chris Evans in the title role. I wrote ""This is my kind of movie."" And it is, a good story and appropriate action.<br/><br/>I did not like this followup nearly as much. The story is OK but as seems to be the trend in modern action movies, too overloaded with visual effects, gunfire, and great explosions. It just so happened that this is the first movie I watched with my new powered subwoofer and the low bass in this movie gives it quite a workout. Even at moderate viewing volume I was able to measure SPL levels as high as 98 dB at my viewing position. That's a lot of bass!! <br/><br/>Chris Evans is back as Steve Rogers, aka Captain America. So that the story can facilitate him looking just like he did at the end of the last movie, he has been frozen in a state of suspended life for most of the past 70 years. As a result he had no knowledge of historical events during the 1950s through the early 2000s.<br/><br/>But the big current event was the treason by the agency that now is calling itself (in secret) Hydra. They have developed a very long list of individuals who they say need to be eliminated, and new machines are scheduled to be activated to get this done. <br/><br/>Steve's job, along with a few loyal allies, is to stay alive as they hunt him down, and to stop Hydra. Other key roles are filled by Samuel L. Jackson as good guy Nick Fury. Scarlett Johansson as good guy Natasha Romanoff, aka the Black Widow. Plus Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, aka the flying Falcon, and Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill. Also good to see good guy Emily VanCamp as Kate, aka Agent 13.<br/><br/>The leader of the bad guys is Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, along with Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>The story is OK, to me the explosions and gunfire overdone to the point of becoming tedious while waiting for additional story elements. But it sure gets your subwoofer working!"

","This movie is why people love marvel, they never fail to deliver the goods when it comes to action packed movies like this. To me this is marvels best superhero movie yet. It's fun it's adventurous, and the fighting scenes make Nolans batman look like robin! The story is also very good, I won't get into loads of detail about it because I won't be able to stop, but by the time you read this review the winter soldier will probably be on DVD...and I definitely recommend it to you! 10/10<br/><br/>and btw, I just have to point this out that the winter soldier is so cool, his metallic arm, badass fighting skills and true identity will really make you love him, he's just a freakin awesome villain!"
"leonblackwood","7","1","2","25 August 2014"," Epic superhero movie! 7/10
","Review: I quite enjoyed this epic super hero movie, which had loads of action and a decent storyline. It was a bit long and it did lack some wit, like the Iron Man movies, but it's got loads of intense drama and action throughout. Compared to the other super heroes, I don't find Captain America to be the most entertaining because he hasn't really got any super powers like Superman or the Hulk. Anyway, the film is a great watch and the performances from the actors were quite good. I was expecting some references to the other Avengers at some point, but the director chose to focus on Evans character. Some of the lines and scenes were slightly corny but it's what you expect from an American hero who is completely devoted to the saviour of his country. In all, it's a great addition to the Captain America franchise, but I preferred the mixture of characters in the Avengers. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Chris Evans was a weird choice for this role because he plays the Human Torch in Fantastic Four franchise. He does play Captain America well and his chemistry with the other super heroes, really does work. His action scenes were quite impressive and he did show that he can fight without using the shield. Scarlett Johansson has been lucky to star in the Avengers, Iron Man 2 and Captain America 2 and she also had a role in the poor, The Spirit which also starred Samuel L. Jackson. I liked the chemistry between her character and Captain America but she really needs some gadgets. The Winter Soldier was quite impressive with his fighting skills but they didn't really go into depth about his character. The same goes for Falcon who joined the team without much introduction. Anyway, I'm sure that we will find out more about these characters as the franchise builds up, and judging by the ending, we have a lot to come.<br/><br/>Budget: $170million Worldwide Gross: $714million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there epic super hero movies about Captain America saving the world. 7/10"
"Spondonman","7","1","2","18 August 2014"," Crash Bang Wallop
","Every year that goes by and every film in the fantasy franchise that goes by the cgi cartoonery gets more polished and potent and this outing is no exception. Where will it end? This is an exhausting ride of cartoon violence and unremitting mayhem that although I stayed with it to the conclusion I knew was coming I was happy when it was all over and quiet descended again. Until the next time that is, when we can all start over again.<br/><br/>The organisation protecting the world's freedom SHIELD has been found to be completely infiltrated with the different brand of freedom lovers from the alphabet soup HYDRA. Boss Samuel L. Jackson's injunction to Capt. America Chris Evans to Trust No One rings very true here: don't trust anyone but especially don't trust your own eyes. Or his for that matter. Basically many people have to die in the chase for a flash stick, but the film loses impetus once its secrets are ""revealed"" and the graphics take over. Scarlet Johannson as Black Widow succeeded admirably in looking powerful and non-sexy, Evans' life was saved at least half a million times during the picture by his titchy shield, Falcon looked a force to be reckoned with except on very flimsy wings but it was the Winter Soldier who looked impressively impregnable. I couldn't imagine such a cool savage dude ever sneezing, getting a wedgie or paying a parking ticket. The heroes – or should that be merely saviours – didn't seem to care much for the Innocent Bystander, so it was refreshing to hear Johannson shout to hundreds of bystanders to get out of the way of the baddies flooding the air with bullets. And as for the mammothly expensive death-dealing flying machines – cheap teleportation will transport us all into a new world of non moving parts; same as those flying machines when disabled with a credit card, it's right on top of us.<br/><br/>However I enjoyed the film - less than the first because of the excessive cartoon choreography which probably doesn't play as well on a TV, but wasn't surprised or disappointed by any of it: same as all of us I knew what I was getting into. The biggest point to me: Why can't all freedom lovers whether political or religious mind their own business?"
"CrisMovieCorner","10","1","2","15 August 2014"," The best superhero film to date! Marvel takes a turn for the better.
","I was a little apprehensive about this film even after I heard all the amazing things about it, because come on, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" was a pretty poor film.<br/><br/>Steve Rogers first solo film in this new Marvel Cinematic Universe really didn't go as plan over at Marvel I wouldn't imagine, in the first film he was used as a Governments toy to use at their disposal resulting in a poor film. This time around Chris Evans got to stretch his super soldier legs in a role more befitting of a bad ass superhero.<br/><br/>From the get go the film is all action, we get a scene with Cap literally dropping onto a ship that has pirates on, he proceeds to send many of the flying with his super punches and kicks and he finally utilised his shield as a weapon than previous films. Even with this being a solo film, Marvel knows that they have to splice more characters into the mix resulting in Cap being joined by Black Widow (Johansson) and Sam Wilson - The Falcon (Mackie), the trio are forced into what may seem like an unlikely combination but boy does it work! The film itself takes on a MUCH more Thriller feel than we have ever seen in the MCU, the addition of Mackie brings a nice Comedy vibe to the trio of a grumpy old man Cap and a extremely serious agent Black Widow. Mackie gets plenty of one liners and lots of action in his flying supersuit? I guess it is a supersuit, given it gives a man the ability of flight. This was also my first time truly watching Frank Grillo and I was pleasantly surprised with his acting and not to mention his fighting ability second to only George St-Pierre in the film who is a pro fighter.<br/><br/>Widow herself is very pivotal to the story, maybe even as important as Cap himself at times due to her importance within their missions and keeping him grounded in the messed up modern time he finds himself in. There has been talk for a long time of a female lead Marvel film, after Scar-Jo's performance in this I would be surprised if it wasn't Black Widow we seen on her own very soon.<br/><br/>Even with the film having an over two hour long running time (just about), it really doesn't seem to be that long when watching, you have car chases, explosions, helicopter destruction and beautifully choreographed fight scenes. ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is enjoyable as an Action film, however offers so much more with its brilliant script of Drama and Thriller aspects. The film is a surprisingly perfect mix of Action/Drama/Comedy which given the background of directors the Russo brothers was a pleasantly unexpected. That being said the film doesn't rely heavily on Comedy like past films ""Thor"" and ""Iron-Man"".<br/><br/>Overall, the Russo brothers give us a more than good film, this film was truly great. The film can be watched as a standalone Conspiracy Thriller, however what we get is a Marvel film that can go down as an actual great film, with a brilliantly written script, with laughter, action and conspiracy. The Winter Soldier will go down as one of the few sequels that completely outshines its predecessor in every conceivable way."

","There are a lot of movies I've watched this year, but Captain America: The Winter Soldier is, undoubtedly the best I have seen not only in this year, in a long time. The most I liked from this one was the hand-to- hand combat. It was because the fights scenes are so well done, with a great choreography behind them. Special effects are amazing, see it and you will realize that everything in this movie looks realistic.<br/><br/>Chris Evans does a great job as Captain America, I just hope he won't be replaced for the next movie. Sebastian Stan, Scarlett Johanson and Samuel .L. Jackson were so good at their roles. With this, Marvel has demonstrated that they have a lot more to show and I can't wait to see The Avengers: Age of Ultron. I'd say that Captain America is now my favourite superhero after seeing this.<br/><br/>Don't miss it. This is a must watch!<br/><br/>10/10."
"priyantha-bandara","Null","1","2","10 August 2014"," An unexpectedly good super hero movie
","By the time I sat down to watch this I have already heard quite a lot from the comic fans that this is beyond what they actually hoped to see. Captain America being sort of a side roll in the Avengers and the first movie being somewhat less attractive than many other Marvel flicks I had mixed feelings. But Captain America: The Winter Soldier bitch slapped me and caught me at the first punch. And it's simply overwhelming to witness that this has being one of the best super hero movies up to date and for over two long hours it's just intense and gripping as its first 10 minutes. And Chris Evans just climbed my favorite super hero ladder a few notches with a Ka-Boooom.<br/><br/>I don't want to waste my words explain the plot a lot. It does what super hero movies supposed to do and it's heroic, adventures etc with lots and lots of plot holes. But hay no one expect top notch script from a superhero movie so it doesn't matter. But what it really matters is that Captain America: The Winter Soldier pulls off all the unimaginable and far-fetched stunts so easily and the viewers are kept on the edge of their seats and it gives no time to relax. The sheer amount of mind blowing action that appears within short intervals are just awesome. And the interesting thing is one after the other they become stronger and better and has its unique twists to make them differentiate from the previous.<br/><br/>What make Captain America: The Winter Soldier so good is that it's brilliant flow. There is no second wasted and no punches thrown in vain. And there is awesome sense of tense and unrest steadily built without putting too much pressure or indigestible acceleration of events. And visually the movie delivers a feast with super good CG combined with live action.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an unexpectedly good super hero movie. And it's being a while since we have witnessed one. And it can be simply enjoyed even if anyone does not have a thorough knowledge about the previous movie or the Avengers at all. So it's a very good standalone entertainer. Though I have no high hopes for a better Captain America in the next movie as Hollywood has this certain trend of bigger action and poor movie as the franchisees grow I have truly enjoyed this one."
"851222","8","1","2","9 August 2014"," OK flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>I'm not a big Marvel fan, nevertheless like many out here i have watched all Marvel movies. I still think that ""Iron Man"" (2008) was the best of the bunch, more exiting than ""The Avengers"" (2012) - now you can start throwing rocks at me. I also highly enjoyed ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) - it was very cool movie. And the worst from the bunch was annoying ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013) - crap, not a film. <br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is what Marvel does the best, it's not very complicated, but very enjoyable action flick - nothing more. Actions scenes are very cool, not overdone in CGI, i was surprised seeing greatly done car chases in superhero movie, they were really cool. Like i said, i'm not a fan of Marvel stuff, so overall, if you enjoy the first Captain America film, you are going to like this one as well. Nothing really new, but still 2 fun hours to waste."
"FormerlyDoh11","Null","1","2","4 August 2014"," Another Solid, But Nothing To Write Home About Marvel Studios Film
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier has one of the strongest first halves of any of the ""Marvel Studio Films"" to date.<br/><br/>We learn the fate of Peggy Carter (the best female character in the MCU), Captain America's (Chris Evans) old squeeze from the first film and see the effect it has on Cap. <br/><br/>We see Cap struggling to find his purpose in life and questioning the shady SHIELD and Nick Fury (Sameul L. Jackson) at every turn. <br/><br/>There is some good character development of the Nick Fury character that goes beyond ""Here's Samuel L. being bad ass"" that hasn't been seen before throughout the films. This goes double for Captain America, as Evans proves he can carry a film here.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is a solid blend of action and interesting character development that is tight and well constructed. Having been one of the MCU's hardest critics for its lack of focus on characters and their own personal journeys as opposed to almost every film feeling like a setup for the Avengers, the first half of the film integrates everything very well. Nothing feels like it's building towards something that we'll see three films from now.<br/><br/>Everything feels like its grounded in the present, characters that have been glossed over (Fury, Cap, Black Widow) are actually given time to breathe and grow here, and the action scenes are very well choreographed and and shot.<br/><br/>But then, like so many of the films from Marvel studios, the film collapses under its own weight in the second half.<br/><br/>There are so many story lines that come to fruition throughout the film that it gets ridiculous. The presentation becomes so over the top that any feeling of danger that the characters were in, in the first half of the film, flies out of the window. Conspiracy theories and back stabbings that were quite interesting becomes way too bloated and convoluted for its own good. <br/><br/>The film outstays its welcome in other words and gives us so much to chew on, that as an audience, it's like we've been fed a great appetizer and then been force fed an overdone 38 ounce steak. The flavor is great, but it's just too much to take in.<br/><br/>Robert Redford provides an interesting take on the proceedings in his role as Alexander Pierce, a high ranking member of SHIELD and one of Fury's most trusted comrades. <br/><br/>Technically, the film is well shot and edited. The direction is crisp and as mentioned, the action scenes are very engaging and pulse pounding. Technically, this may be the best Marvel Studios film since the original Iron Man.<br/><br/>Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Jackson carry the film and do a very good job, it's just that once you figure out why everything is transpiring the way it has been, it's almost too ridiculous and far fetched to believe, even for a comic book film.<br/><br/>So once again, a solid first half, and a bloated second half produce another solid, but nothing to write home about Marvel Studios film. While it is miles ahead of Thor 2 and Iron Man 3, writer/directors Joe and Anthony Russo's film is definitely the best Marvel film since the Avengers, and maybe since the first and still king of the MCU, Iron Man. <br/><br/>It's a step in the right direction for a studio that seems to have rested on its laurels in trying to be all about universe building without making me care about the characters in the universe. This really is the first film since the original Iron Man that feels focused on the present and the here and now as opposed to feeling like a setup for another Avengers.<br/><br/>I am interested to see if the third film in the franchise can improve on what was a solid second chapter."
"siderite","8","1","2","20 July 2014"," Surprisingly good
","The power of a mature story becomes apparent yet again in this film. The Marvel heroes stories have been created, changed to fit the times, merged, split, reinvented, all while in the crossfire of devoted fans that see and cry foul at any mistake or inconsistency. That is why Winter Soldier, while mixing up a lot of story lines, heroes and technologies, ultimately works. It is also not boring, as the plot is indeed thick.<br/><br/>But that is not all. All the actors played well, and just look at that cast, Scarlett Johansson had a major role and looked as delicious as she ever did, the action scenes were very good and diverse (although I still don't know why people aim at the shield and not at Captain America when they try to shoot him) and a bunch of story lines opened up.<br/><br/>As I see it, comic book companies want to recreate the comic universe on video - it makes sense since nobody reads anymore - and that opens a lot of available stories that are both wonderful and terribly silly. If Winter Soldier is at the level of quality of future films in the Marvel universe, I am happy with it."
"amyboardman22","10","1","2","19 July 2014"," Review of the Winter Soldier
","WARNING: This review contains spoilers for The Winter Soldier, may seem to dis The Dark Knight Trilogy (which I love, just not as much as this movie) and somehow, contains spoilers for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows part 1 and Deathly Hallows part 2. I seriously don't know how that happened. I left reviewing this film for so long and I really wanted it to be the first film I reviewed I think I may have over-thought. I have bracketed the spoilers in the word SPOILER! to warn you, so if you don't want spoilers, look out. <br/><br/>I seriously cannot believe that the entire Dark Knight Trilogy is rated above the Winter Soldier. I truly believe that The Dark Knight is the best superhero movie made so far (best but not my favourite-BIG difference)but Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises are long winded and (at points) boring.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier completely surprised me when it came out. The movie was truly brilliant and the plot-line was near perfect. In this movie they introduce some new characters and bring back some old ones. This movie was perfectly paced and the plot was not only interesting but also understandable. With many superhero movies the plot is often 'Stop the aliens in a heroic way' or 'Fight the bad guy in a heroic way' (this obviously does not take into account origins stories and sub-plots). This movie is truly different with a thriller/conspiracy storyline. It references past avengers movies and characters but is easily watchable as long as you know the basic story lines to The First Avenger and Avengers Assemble.<br/><br/>The characters were portrayed brilliantly in this movie. However, I will say there was not much character development besides with the winter soldier. Nick Fury was finally made likable to a wide audience while still being slightly manipulative. He is basically the Dumbledore of The Winter Soldier, using his 'death' to manipulate people.<br/><br/>The dialogue isn't the best in the world although it was delivered expertly. There was however beautiful dialogue exchanged between two characters who may just be mentioned in the title in the pivotal fight of the movie which- I'm not gonna lie- made me cry.<br/><br/>This of course brings me to what was truly awesome in this movie. The fight scenes. How the shield is used, how the setting is used, how sound effects and visual effects are used in this movie to create unbelievable fight scenes make the movie worth watching alone. They do what is possibly my favourite thing in superhero and action movies right now: They fight in broad daylight! Seriously, unless characters and weapons are lit up (which, if done wrong can look like a session of cool but tacky laser quest)then fights in darkness are just hard to see. Daylight adds more of a dramatic edge while also being perfectly visible. Yay! They use darkness in this movie, but thankfully, only for mysterious and tense moments. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie made me like Captain America and Nick Fury again, convinced me even more that Black Widow and The Winter Soldier are awesome, and even if your primary thought throughout this movie is 'IT'S ROBIN SCHERBATSKY'(the main comment from who I went to see this movie with and hadn't seen Avengers), you'll love it anyway. It is unbelievably underrated and was under-advertised. If you haven't seen it already (What are you waiting for? It's been months!)then I strongly (very strongly) suggest you do. I cannot wait to re-watch it when it comes out on DVD. I hope you enjoyed this review and love/will love the movie as much as I do."
"alandevro62","9","1","2","29 June 2014"," One Of The Best Marvel Movies To Date
","This movie is definitely one of the best marvel movies so far. In my opinion it's there just behind the avengers. This movie was handled perfectly and is a lot better than the first movie. After watching iron man 3 I was worried that Disney would try to make this movie the same way but they made it so much better. There was a lot of comic relief in the fight scenes but it was not done like in iron man 3 where the comedy distracted me it was done in such a way that it made me laugh but didn't distract me from the fighting. The falcon was put into the movie perfectly not like in the avengers assemble TV show in that show he is made to look like a childish hero but in the movie he was done so much better that it made me forget that the childish falcon even existed. The winter soldier is a great villain and I can't wait to see him in the future movies. So if you haven't seen this movie I would definitely say for you to go and see it as soon as possible."
"jhigginbotham151","8","1","2","4 May 2014"," Captain America: The Winter Soldier outperforms its predecessor in every way
","Captain America: The First Avenger was one of the weaker films in Phase 1 of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. But, besides Iron Man and The Avengers, really all the Phase 1 films were sub par compared to those films (The Incredible Hulk just being abysmal). Phase 2 however is really bringing it back. Iron Man 3 was a complete step up from Iron Man 2, Thor: The Dark World gave us the Thor movie we wanted after the disappointing 2011 film and now we have Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and its good, really good.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier follows Steve Rodgers as he once again faces a global threat that puts him at odds with everyone: who can he trust?. The plot is full of twists and turns that I honestly wasn't expecting, and from a superhero film such as this one thats nice to see. The film is set in modern terms, unlike its predecessor, so the idea that this would feel like a completely different film is warranted - but the film actually fits very well into the Captain America series and Marvel hasn't simply abandoned the WW2 era that Rodgers lived in most of his life. They show him still adjusting to life in the new world, he even has a notebook of all the things he has to catch up on and then even goes to visit an aging Peggy Carter in a shockingly emotional scene that makes you feel for Rodgers as a character far more than the previous film ever did. <br/><br/>The plot, like many have stated, is a lot like a spy thriller, superhero film mash-up. Its got the sneaking around looking for information while hiding from a powerful organisation, but its also got the classic over the top gadgets and hover-crafts and stuff goes boom and it's all very well and good and its all there and accounted for. The idea of Captain America going rouge is great idea that showcases the threat he's facing is very real. Its also is great for showing the relationship between Cap and Black Widow who have a wonderful buddy cop - like relationship on screen. Constantly cracking jokes to each other shows there're both very close and the fact they speak to each other as equals contrasts well to everyone else talking down or giving orders to them like their superior and Cap and Widow are just foot soldiers.<br/><br/>The film isn't all perfect however. They sadly under use Anthony Mackie as Falcon who I found a great wing-man to Cap and I felt it was a shame they didn't focus on him a little more because I think he has huge potential, similar to War Machine in the Iron Man series. Robert Redford I thought wasn't playing the bad guy the way I know he could, maybe the material just didn't allow for it but, I thought he underplayed his role a bit too much. The Winter Soldier, while undoubtedly a very bad-ass character I felt got underplayed in, what I assume, a film all about him. I get that there's a lot more going on, so they can't just focus on The Winter Soldier but I felt by the end of the film, I didn't see him enough to care about him as Bucky Barnes (because the previous film sure didn't care about him). Sebastian Stan has been signed for 9 films, so I have no doubt Marvel intend to replace Evans with Stan as Captain America, once Evans leaves the role.<br/><br/>Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a fantastic follow-up to the very flawed first film and a fantastic entry in Phase 2 of Marvels Cinematic Universe."

I plan on seeing it again in theaters before it leaves and I have to wait for it to come to DVD. Stan Lee must be one proud man, seeing all of his comic books come to life in these phenomenal movies. Great movie for the whole family, as well as huge comic book fans. And I must say comic book fans, like myself, will not be disappointed with this film and the direction that it takes the Marvel series. Not to mention the fact that Marvel does a great job of concealing almost everything in its movie trailers. I don't know how you do it, but please... Keep it coming Marvel! Marvel is the one studio that I will never hesitate to purchase ridiculously priced movie tickets to go and see. Worth every penny!"
"guivjacques","8","1","2","21 April 2014"," OK, Marvel finally did it
","It's general knowledge (GENERAL KNOWLEDGE - OK, sorry, Smulders)that marvel lost, in some films, the spirit of a good movie by making it look too much goofy.<br/><br/>Thor 2 had already changed this a little bit, but now, in this one, they finally found the right measure: a serious movie with some funny and well placed lines to break all the tension.<br/><br/>Personally, I HATE Captain America since I was a little kid. I really do. Reading my comic books years ago I used to want him to die (yes). After this movie, this feeling hasn't changed: I still think he is annoying as hell. But, anyway, I loved the movie!!! why? because it's not centered in him and in the Winter Soldier. It's all about SHIELD.<br/><br/>This movie shows Black Widow in her best performance so far (how can Rogers reject her? OH MY!) and has a very good background history about HYDRA and SHIELD, with epic and unexpected twists. It has great fight scenes, tension, the Falcon kicking some asses and an AWESOME ending that will change the whole direction of marvel's storyline, including The Avengers 2, making this movie a must-see in Marvel's universe. And, by the way, the references to Stephen Strange, QS and Scarlet Witch were awesome as well, introducing them perfectly. <br/><br/>This is, excluding The Avengers, marvel's best movie until now. HAIL HYDRA!"
"iamshadab","10","1","2","21 April 2014"," This time, cap has gone way far...
","First of all, its the best overall entertainer movie this year to date. Now to begin with story, if someone narrate it verbally to you, you might find it childish and funny, but well build script, packed with all the action that is required. Coz when we talk about Cap'n America, there are no super powers in him, that limits the writers from thinking super powers. It's a Super hero limited with resources, and the challenge was to beautifully taken and furthermore, tighter Direction and well timed acting of whole team, and the special effects team. Together they have served a wonderful movie that would be a new benchmark for Superhero movies.<br/><br/>The Action of the movie is also another reason one should see the movie, and my favorite was the starting ship sequence.<br/><br/>Whole movie is like a thrill ride and the first half keeps your mind so uncomfortable that what is it going on ? and makes you stick to your seat while not to miss any part of it. the 3D version is average and is okay to watch it in 2D.<br/><br/>Final words... If you are a fan of The Avengers series, this is something you should not miss...."

","Throughout the film, my mind was blown all over the place. Yes, my expectation to this film was very low because of the first one (that brought me to sleep). But when the movie start, there is a feeling that this film might be good, not awesome,not yet. Along the journey of the film till the end, my expectation change 180 degree. Its action-packed, emotional, elegant(in an awesome way) and bedazzled. I am really mad of myself because giving this such a low expectation. But above all this, i just wanna say, Captain America, you're the best Marvel's movie in my entire life although you're kinda old-school. This also maybe had overcome Marvel's The Avengers (which also my favorite superhero movie). BTW, the scene between the credits is awesome as an introduction to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch."

","To be honest, I never really liked Captain America as a hero. I was more a Spiderman/Batman guy. But, after seeing this movie, my thoughts have changed. Chris Evans acts wonderfully as Cap with all the jokes and fighting. The action sequences are just amazing. And the twist in the middle. AH-MAZING! But the other actors do a terrific job. Anthony Mackie is just too good as Falcon, Samuel L Jackson excels again as Nick Fury, Sebastian Stan makes the most badass villain ever, but Robert Redford is the clincher. His acting is just masterful. Must watch for any moviefan. P.s- watch the credits scene, important stuff happens ;)"

","Marvel has been doing great movies since the start, and the all new captain America is once again, another film that's up to all fan's expectations. I find Captain America The Winter soldier an excellent and engaging movie, which will engulf you into a world of excitement and entertainment. In this movie you finally see Steve Rogers dealing with the new modern world, and it added more feeling to the movie seeing that he wasn't absolutely comfortable with the new modern world. SPOILERS. Once you find out that The Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes, the movie gets interesting because you start to wonder how captain America is going to fight his best friend? The baddie doesn't have many lines, but was all told by his eyes and movements, great acting Sebastian. Chris Evans was also an amazing actor, he portrayed the character brilliantly. It was an excellent movie, and everybody should buy the next tickets for The Winter Soldier in the cinema near you."
"brijester","9","1","2","16 April 2014"," Just..Fantastic!!
","Title: Just..FANTASTIC!! I just saw this movie because I'm a huge comic-book fan of super-heroes. And I had seen that a local newspaper had given this a great rating so I thought of giving it a try. And man, this was MUCH better than I thought it would be! Everything and I mean everything about the movie is greatstory, acting, dialogs, fight-sequences, action, direction. This movie is full of class. I can happily say that this is WAY better than ALL the Superman, Batman, Spiderman, Ironman and Hulk movies that I've ever seen! Yes sir! The credit for this movie should go to the story-writers and the directors. They've done a marvelous job. Chris Evans has done a brilliant portrayal of Captain America..he was like tailor-made for this role. All the other main and supporting cast have done terrific job. Robert Redford was outstanding in his not-that- big but crucial role. I have never seen any movies of his before but now I can see the reason why he's so popular! The only acting that I wasn't satisfied with , was Sebastian Stan who plays Winter Soldier in the movie. Though he character didn't have much to speak, but still somehow I felt his acting as hollowhe could done more justice to his role. The friendship between Captain America Aand Falcon was very nicely shown. The way they get to know each other and soon become allies in battle, was shown very effectively and convincing way. The stunts were amazing in the movie. We see Captain America do a variety of different moves/attacks with his shield, which is just a treat to watch! The major plot of the theme , that is, about the Winter Soldier is taken from one of the story lines in the Captain America Comics , written by Ed Brubaker. For those who don't know, Ed Brubaker is arguably THE best writer r Captain America comics! In fact, he's the reason I started reading Captain America.Never used to bother about it before. Now some minor complaints about the movie: 1) The title ""Winter Soldier"" doesn't make much sense because his role is quite less and his role is actually not THAT important in the movie. 2) For those into comics, they will understand when I say that this movie (and other recent MARVEL movies) are based on the ""Ultimate"" Universe, not the usual (or whatever you call it) Marvel universe. I would have preferred it the other way, since that is the original. The ""Ultimate"" universe came much after the ""regular"" universe. 3) Most of the times Captain America is without the mask. Maybe no big deal, but I generally like it when the Super heroes keep their masks on most of the time. That's how it was/is in comics. But in Marvel movies, the super-hero takes a back seat to the alter ego/ man behind the mask. e.g. ""Spiderman"" movie was more about Peter Parker than Spiderman and ""Iron Man"" movies are ALL about Tony Stark..Iron Man is like a guest appearance there. In the end, I would say that this is definitely one of THE best super- hero movie of all times. When I used to read comics, Captain America was never one of my favorite heroes..but now he is!"
"lesleyharris30","9","1","2","15 April 2014"," Action Packed Marvel Intensity,
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. I kind of expected this to be an average movie that would give us one more look at Steve Rogers on his own before we see him with the rest of the gang in Avengers Age of Ultron next year, but I was mistaken. It stood out on its own as a great superhero film, and is much more action packed than the first Captain America. I won't spoil for anyone what happens in this movie, but I will say that it will certainly have a huge effect on future Marvel films, and I really am looking forward to see how they deal with this situation.<br/><br/>The only issue I had with this movie is that the actual Winter Soldier is poorly developed, we learn big pieces of information about him throughout that is all quite vague. I hope they develop the character more significantly in future films. <br/><br/>The cast is great, Chris Evans is back and as good as ever, Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as always, Robert Redford is on point, I never expected him to be in a Marvel movie and he did a really great job. Anthony Mackie stars and I have very high hopes that we will get to see more of him as he portrayed the character with great depth, as well as a sense of humour. Lastly, Scarlett Johansson returns as Black Widow, and I really enjoyed her performance. Her character develops a lot more and she's get more time in the spotlight than she did in Avengers. She is slick, cool, ruthless and delivered with pure charisma by Johansson, who has an excellent presence on screen. <br/><br/>It is action packed, exciting and all takes time to add great scope to its key characters. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a thrilling and very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to all Marvel fans.<br/><br/>Steve Rogers must battle the Winter Soldier as he struggles to deal with the world he lives in now. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Scarlett Johansson"

","This movie is just pure awesomeness. It's really fun and entertaining. The plot in this movie was way way better that the first Captain America. However, even though it's more fun and entertaining that the first one. The drama part is lesser,if they are more drama part it could have more tension, that's the only problem. I just want to see more dramatic part between Captain America and The Winter Soldier which is his best friend Bucky. That's the only problem in the movie I think. The movie is fun, entertaining, and better plot that the first one. Robert Redford is just amazing in the movie, he tricks everyone including Nick Fury. This movie is just great in almost every way.Very close to being the best marvel ever in my opinion. I think the only Marvel movie that is better than Captain America: The Winter Soldier is probably Iron Man. However, this movie is amazing. It was one of the Best Marvel Movie Ever! Captain America, you did it this time!"
"monstermayhem32","10","1","2","14 April 2014"," A entertaining thriller
","I will admit when watching the followup to 2011 film I liked how it showed Steve Rogers dealing with the modern world and continuing to help others. When Steve's old friend Bucky Barnes as the winter solider who has been brainwashed by hydra into being a assassin it makes Steve question the morality of shield and its ethics. In terms of the newcomers I would say that Anthony mackie is fantastic as Sam Wilson aka the falcon who is an important ally to Steve Rogers. I do wish that Emily van camp would have been given more to do as Sharon carter ask agent 13 but hopefully her role will be bigger in the third film. I would say that Robert Redford as Alexander pierce is a rather interesting addition to the role since there is a sense of mystery to his character. I will say that the events of this film will be a set up for the avengers sequel age of ultron. Can't wait for the next captain America sequel."
"Navaf","8","1","2","14 April 2014"," Best movie from the Marvel Universe after the Avengers
","After the Avengers this is by far the best flick by Marvel Studios. Within the Marvel universe the last Iron Man movie was a complete disaster, Cap. America delivers from a much more approachable angle with the rise of hydra, Cap questioning the ever more growing police state and constant surveillance. While Cap thinks compromises are necessary it isn't worth it with the loss of freedom, and challenges the established ethos. Later to find out S.H.I.E.L.D being compromised by HYDRA within.<br/><br/>Actions shots were awesome at the beginning with Cap, but later on it kinda movies into whats with the shield Cap Pic up a gun in a gun fight. Later scenes it get screwed up with Cap risking the mission when he did not properly neutralize Winter Soldier aka Bucky. Personally it felt like lazy story telling. <br/><br/>What more I think the movie does shed some light into the overgrowing security and surveillance obsession the world is gearing towards"
"t-hf","8","1","2","13 April 2014"," Definitely a the best in the current wave of avengers films
","I went to see this film last Wednesday with some friends and we were expecting it to be simply another film to kill time until Age of Ultron is released. Needless to say (unless other reviews have not convinced you), this film could possibly be the first great avengers movie that doesn't have iron man in it. Unfortunately my other friends weren't convinced, but I loved every minute of it. It has it's flaws granted, but the action scenes are epic, the plot is genuinely suspenseful and if Marvel keep going like this, then I am very excited to see what is still to come.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the plot basically concerns the Captain's first non-avengers mission, in which he senses that he's fighting for the wrong team and that there could be an internal conspiracy growing in SHIELD itself. From here, the plot becomes genuinely tense and you really believe that no one can be trusted. I really like the direction that Marvel took with this film as, to be honest, by now I think everyone has grown bored of the same old world destruction, aliens, ancient artifact plot devices that have been in almost every marvel film since the avengers. There are elements of these in the film, but the plot is smaller while still maintaining the epic scale that made the avengers as great as it was. <br/><br/>The only downside to the film is that sometimes it can be unnecessarily long, but it wont really bother you too much if you're used to sitting through these epics. Long story short, Captain America will really surprise you. Great fight scenes, tense story, nice little moments of humour all add to a film that will leave you absolutely starving for Age of Ultron."

Direction was great , Russo brother did an awesome job . Action was another solid aspect and showed that good action can still be done without huge CGI.On Acting front I think it was a step up , Chris Evans played Steve Rogers with heart and soul , Scarlet now looks and acts like Black Widow , Robert Redford , Anthony Mackie were fine in their roles .

"Jac23443","8","1","2","13 April 2014"," There Is No Way This A Marvel Movie!
","There is no possible way that this is a Marvel movie. I am as baffled now as I was while sitting in that creaky theatre seat. I can say that this movie has given me hope for the Marvel movies to come, mostly from the directors who created this delightful and marvelous masterpiece. I feel as though I repeat myself in these reviews but the truth is the truth. This movie and I think those who saw it will agree, say the same thing or something close to it, this movie was a surprise! A surprise that surpassed my thoughts of how great a surprise could be.<br/><br/>The intensity and high tension of the action sequences equally balanced with the well shot and perfectly paced character development was incredible to say the least... there's that word again... incredible, but in fact that is what this movie was. Nick Fury has a staged death scene, that elicited the enraged reaction of people around me, myself included. The revelation of Falcon which needless to say couldn't have been casted any better (loved the character from the beginning), even though I saw the same actor in Pain and Gain which was not all too great a movie, but I cannot judge because in the past Chris Evans had been portraying one dimensional characters like Johnny in Fantastic Four, which was cringe-worthy. Now that I stray farther from the subject I will say this... if you have been let down by the movies that have come out thus far this year, NOAH, DIVERGENT(being the worse) Mr. Peabody and whatever the hell else, GO SEE THIS MOVIE, DON'T PUT IT OFF, BECAUSE THIS A MOVIE TRULY WORTH THE MONEY."
"scottjohnson7896","8","1","2","12 April 2014"," A New Breed of Superhero Movies
","I want to preface this by saying that I thought the first Captain America film was the weakest out of all of the Phase One Marvel films. The dialogue was cheesy, the CGI was iffy at times, and I just had a hard time liking Chris Evans. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is a far superior movie, and by far one of the best Marvel movies to date. You also don't really need to have too much familiarization with the first film in order to find entertainment out of the sequel.<br/><br/>We pick up as Steve Rogers, or Captain America, is still trying to adapt to the new century. He throws himself into helping his country, never really finding anything to make him happy. His work is the only thing that he has. He has no real friends, no relationships, no hobby's. He spends his free time sneaking into museum exhibits about himself and reminiscing about the past. The plot starts to pick up after SHIELD is compromised from the inside and nobody can be trusted anymore, sending the Captain and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) off as fugitives in order to solve what is going on within the agency. <br/><br/>Chris Evans does a better job in this one than he did in the first. He is more conflicted and has a lot more on his plate other than leading a platoon in World War II. He has 70 years of history to catch up on, and he is technically 95 years old. Surprisingly though, we are not given a glimpse at how the events in the Avengers affected him like we did with Tony Stark in Iron Man 3. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson has a much more substantial role in this film than in the others. She has quite a lot of screen time, and is essentially the Captain's sidekick. We are given a little insight into her past and we can see the effects of her actions in life more clearly now. Oh, and she is still her kick-ass self. <br/><br/>Anthony Mackie plays Sam Wilson, better known as The Falcon. He offers comedy and heart, especially when talking about coming home from the war. <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role of Nick Fury, the leader of SHIELD. The country is still experiencing the ramifications of what happened in New York in The Avengers movie. The film mirrors the whole NSA controversy quite well, and it is obviously poking fun at that situation. The plot, probably a little more complex than most of the Marvel films thus far, does get a little convoluted at one point, but it does end up making sense by the end. <br/><br/>The movie also stars Robert Redford in a rare blockbuster role for him. He plays a senior agent of SHIELD who definitely has his secrets. Coming off of All is Lost, it is nice to hear him actually talk in a movie. <br/><br/>What surprises me most about this movie, other than the fact that it has Redford, is how dark and serious it is in tone compared to other Marvel films as of late. Where other Marvel movies rely more on humor and lightheartedness, this one feels more like a spy-film than a superhero movie. I think this is going to be a continuing trend because the new Avengers is supposedly going to be even darker.<br/><br/>But the most important thing about the new Captain America is how much of an impact the events of it will have on the rest of the Marvel Universe. The repercussions of the final battle scene of the film as well as the post-credit scenes will play a much bigger role than simply assembling the Avengers. There is a new enemy and things will no longer be the same after this film. <br/><br/>The action and fight scenes in this movie are also fantastic. Much better than the ones in the first one. They also feel a bit more realistic since the Captain doesn't have a magic hammer or a metal suit that shoots lasers. It is downright brutal at times, and the explosions and gun fights are even better at times. <br/><br/>So, if you are getting antsy for the new Avengers movie, are a fan of comic books, or just want to see a great action movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier has enough to satisfy anyone who goes to see it. It truly raises the bar for superhero movies to come. <br/><br/>For more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com"
"jacobclark512","8","1","2","12 April 2014"," The Most Impressive Marvel Film to Date
","The Marvel movie machine is an unstoppable force that will earn its money whether or not they produce good films. Thankfully, they have a high standard for their films that makes them critically successful as well as commercially. However, that standard has been slipping as of late, with Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World drawing in some of the poorest reviews of the series. Does the second installment of the Captain's story bring Marvel back to its former heights?<br/><br/>In short, yes. The Winter Soldier succeeds where the recent Marvel films have not: the story. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely make The Winter Soldier's story suspenseful yet thematically rich at the same time. Like The Dark Knight trilogy, it mixes political undertones and themes prevalent in our world today with incredible action sequences and tense, chaotic moments, propelling the movie through its 150-minute running time quite quickly. It never lets up on its relentless pace, making it quite a thrill ride. In traditional Marvel fashion, plot twists and witty dialogue abound; however, the character development takes more of a front seat this time in a similar fashion to Iron Man or The Amazing Spider-Man. The Winter Soldier answers many of the questions asked in The First Avenger, while also making Steve Rogers more brutish and less innocent.<br/><br/>The cast takes this phenomenal story and runs away with it. Chris Evans adjusts more to playing Steve Rogers, adding the dark, haunted side of the character this time around. He also gets enough quality screen time to show that he can make Cap work in the modern world. Scarlett Johansson, meanwhile, delivers her best work to date, offering up a complicated Black Widow that has a witty side as well. Samuel L. Jackson delivers once again as Nick Fury but adds slight sympathy to the character while reminding the audience that he can be one of the good guys. Robert Redford stands out here, however, as he is cast against type yet gives one of the best performances in recent Marvel movies. The rest of the cast does well as a whole, with very few blemishes in the film.<br/><br/>Visually, The Winter Soldier combines the look of Iron Man 3 with the effects of The Dark Knight trilogy. Its gritty, intimate cinematography allows the performances to be showcased, but the lack of CGI effects helps ground the film in reality rather than fantasy. In stark contrast to the warm, aged look of The First Avenger, The Winter Soldier relies on more close angles and colder colors, allowing it to reflect the cold, harsh reality of Steve Rogers's new world. The use of traditional stunt-work over computer spectacle brings more finesse to the film, allowing the characters to not be obscured by amazing visual effects.<br/><br/>Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a great improvement to Marvel movies, taking the franchise to new heights while reminding us of why we grew attached to the series in the first place. It has everything a great movie needs: riveting action, impressive performances, and a smart script. These great components make it a film for everyone to love, and I mean everyone. No one will be turned off by this installment in the Marvel canon."
"bradyseamus360","10","1","2","11 April 2014"," A brilliant view of the Cap's journey
","Cap America 2 is probably the best MCU movies behind the Avengers. It beats the Thor sequel and smashes the Iron Mans and even beats the first Cap film. This movie is unbelievable, surprising, action-packed and just thrilling till the very end. The villain was unbelievable in the Winter Soldier he is bad and strong as well as a good friend of Cap but of course he has no clue of this yet. <br/><br/>So the movie started out a little slow i must admit but when it got going it was on fire. The scene where Nick Fury died started things off for me. This was thrilling and devastating as seeing Fury get knocked about by the Winter Soldier and his men. This then kicked off the trust status that Cap had to trust no-one as HYDRA caved in on S.H.E.I.L.D and hunted down Cap and the Black Widow. They soon found out that HYRDA was in with Shield as Cap had no-one to turn to. They were soon captured but rescued by Agent Maria Hill and taken to a secret place. A major twist occurred as Cap and Black Widow found Fury as he had somehow survived the deadly blows.<br/><br/>Cap, Widow and Falcon soon made Shield turn on HYRDA as the battle began. Fury had his revenge on Pierce as he was shot twice for being part of HYRDA as his last words were 'Hail Hydra'. Cap and the Winter Soldier battled in an epic battle as the Winter Soldier didn't have it in him to kill his old mate Cap. The two soon fell with the hellicarrier into the water as Cap looked to drown but was saved by the Winter Soldier. <br/><br/>It was a fitting end as the two survived but the Winter Soldier went his own way as the last scene showed that Cap, Black Widow, the Falcon and Fury would be back in action."

So what do we get from the new Captain America movie? We see a Steve Rogers that is now firmly working for S.H.I.E.L.D. doing what looks like black op work. And let me tell you, the opening sequence is just packed with some awesome action scenes, though it does seem everyone has learned how to do parkour, but that doesn't really detract from anything. Steve Rogers still feels like a man out of place in this new world; he doesn't really know if he fits in with the way Director Nick Fury is running S.H.I.E.L.D.<br/><br/>But while Captain America is trying to figure out what he wants to do with himself and his association with S.H.I.E.L.D., it seems like there is someone trying to take out those in control of S.H.I.E.L.D., and of course, this sets Captain America on the case with Black Widow as his back up to figure out who is behind these attacks on S.H.I.E.L.D. and to find out what really is going on. Along the way, they recruit a former paratrooper that Captain America has been talking to during his morning runs, and as it turns out, he is also more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>One of the things I really wanted, though, is more of him in his Falcon costume, or uniform, or whatever you want to call it. We get to see him talking to Steve Rogers and tagging along all out of his costume, but its not until the final battle that we see him kitted out. He does add some much needed new blood in the Marvel franchise, and I do hope we get to see him in more of the movies, if not a standalone film of his own.<br/><br/>One of the things I was afraid of, though, is that this movie destroys in my mind the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. television show–and I am not saying this because of Cap, Black Widow, or even Falcon. I am saying this because we get to see some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in action in this movie, and while I was watching them on the screen, I was thinking ""why the hell isn't AoS doing this?!"" If you took out the super heroes and just had S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in this movie, it would have been an awesome spy movie or TV show. Plus, the way that this movie ended doesn't really give you any warm, fuzzy feelings about how S.H.I.E.L.D. or Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will be moving forward. I am sure they are going to try to tie both together, but it might be interesting to see what comes next.<br/><br/>Despite what I've said, I still stand by my statement that this is a great Marvel film. It went in a darker direction than I thought they would really go, and we get to see it through Steve Rogers: the man from a different century trying to process how this new world is operating compared to how they did things during World War II.<br/><br/>We also see hints of what is, in my opinion, going to become Ultron in Avengers 2. People have been saying that Tony Starks' AI Jarvis will get corrupted and become Ultron, but I have to say there is some other AI working in this movie that would make way more sense to evolve into the sinister AI that we have seen in comics. So, what I think will happen is that we will see this AI program in Cap 2 become Ultron and maybe, just maybe, we will see the Jarvis AI evolve into something more like Vision. Of course, this is just me speculating from what I have seen in the movie.<br/><br/>I really shouldn't have to say this, but there are TWO Easter eggs in this movie. The first one you get is a mid-credit one that gives us a tie in to Avengers 2 coming out next year, and I thought it was really well done. The second one was alright, but deals with the Winter Soldier himself. I will say, though, I think it was better than the one from Thor 2. My Recommendation: Like I have to say this to you guys, but this is a must see movie! It works as a standalone movie. It has awesome action, a good storyline, and great actors. So, go see this and be happy. I did not see it in 3D, so I cannot give you that recommendation for this movie."

","Captain America is an amazing Science Fiction movie. It is about Captain America a S.H.E.I.L.D super soldier who everyone hates because Nick Fury, the president of Shield had been shot in Steve Roger's apartment. Everyone in Shield believes that Steve had shot Nick Fury. Luckily for Steve a girl knew who shot Fury! Together, they found out that a terrorist group called Hydra - tracing back to the Nazi days - had secretly been controlling Shield through the secretary of the Security Council. They joined up with another friend -an ex Shield soldier - and destroyed Hydra. Steve's friend Paki, had his short term memory erased and is tasked to kill Rogers. Fortunately, he realized that Steve was his best friend and stopped fighting. This movie is outstanding and I would rate it 10 on 10."

","Don't remember when I last saw two shows of the same movie in a span of 24 hours. Had once ridiculed one of my colleagues for queuing up to watch the same film a second time without break. For once, Marvel has made a film where it's not the superhero who steals the show, but the film's story. And, it has one hell of a villain, menacing as he comes and spawning raw terror with his presence. Together, they make for a intriguing backdrop for Captain America to shine through. <br/><br/>It's a dark and brooding script, much like the ones churned out from the Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder stables. It consumes you from the very beginning where Captain Rogers is drawn into a game of deceit by the very people he has come to trust and maintains the adrenalin-pumping momentum till the final act where Rogers as Captain America confronts the devil from his past. <br/><br/>That brings me to the villain. Ah! After a long time I could actually see the terrified audience gasping in collective sigh every time the Winter Soldier would walk onto the screen. Thank God, Marvel didn't overplay him. He comes across as absolutely believable in an age of overrated CGI villains that pass off as easy distractions than vehicles of terror. <br/><br/>Perhaps,that makes the Winter Soldier frighteningly close to reality. He can happen to anybody. Just like Christoph Waltz's smooth-talking, 'eagle' hunting down Jew 'rats' Col Hans Landa in the Inglorious Basterds and Javier Bardem's portrayal of the unstoppable evil Anton Chigur in No country for old men. This is not comparison, just plain reference where our villain is going to take us. <br/><br/>Other takeaways include, the chirpy and unruffled black widow (Scarlet Johannson), the falcon (yes Marvel have introduced falcon in this installment), the senator (Robert Redford) and of course Nick Fury, the wily and unforgiving head of SHIELD (Samuel J Fox) Then there's the bonus: Captain Rogers aka Captain America who's once again on a mission to save the world. Since the story remains unfinished, I Am already salivating for the third installment of the franchise. Can't wait till 2016."

","I'm gonna be as spoiler free as possible, but this movie holds a seat right there next to Avengers for me. Some reviews may have said it's too long but I think it was the perfect length. For me it made up for what Iron Man 3 and Thor the Dark World lacked. As much as I enjoyed both movies, this has made Phase 2 STELLAR! I look forward to the rest of Phase 2. And I'm pumped for Phase 3. The action in the movie is deep and the lack of CGI makes the movie that much better and more realistic than others in the Marvel Universe. The Russo's are right up there with Favreau and Whedon as best directors in the MCU. I'm just so impressed by how deep the mythos have gotten. You can sign me up for whatever movies come next from marvel. Don't fail me now!"
"matthewssilverhammer","8","1","2","10 April 2014"," An action packed blast that is a must for any fan of the Marvel universe.
","Forget the lingering cold weather and winter skies. The summer has officially arrived with CA:TWS! The first movie was a hit-and-miss affair that really served as a place holder until the Avengers. The Winter Soldier far exceeds the original in every way, showing how a recently-unfrozen 90-year-old reacts to the technology and politics of the 2000s. True, I am undeniably biased and utterly impressed with the cinematic universe Marvel has created. Still, with Iron Man and The Avengers, this is one of the better Marvel Universe films, one with gigantic implications for the entire franchise. It takes place a couple years after The Avengers, with Steve Rogers trying to find his place within SHIELD and modern America. But a new mysterious villain, Winter Soldier, is taking down everyone close to him. It plays on the 70s espionage thriller genre with verve and nostalgia, with the stakes always high and always felt. It asks big questions like, which matters more to us: our freedom or our safety? As this blast of intrigue and mystery begins to unfold, our yearning for fantastic action and hand-to-hand combat is fully fulfilled in what may be the most action-packed Marvel movie yet. Johansson and Jackson both play their roles as strongly as ever, but what truly makes Captain America work is Evans. He doesn't play Cap like Superman, but instead injects vulnerability and naiveté into the superhero. He's taken seriously. This leads to a bit of corny nostalgia and some moments of slight boredom, but overall CA:TWS is an action packed blast that is a must for any fan of the Marvel universe."
"JohnnyPHreak","10","1","2","10 April 2014"," A 70's political thriller wrapped around an unstoppable superhero action film
","I'm writing this review from the place of a fan boy. And this fan boy is shocked at what he's just witnessed on the big screen. As a child I grew up as a DC guy. My favorite superhero is still Superman. But as growing up, getting more into movies and comic books, I've seen that Marvel is more to my appealing.<br/><br/>They get the best writers to create stories with characters that suck me in and the way they treat their stories are more creative. Like back in the day when making films was an art. With The Avengers and their whole Marvel movie universe, they have created a world where comic books come to life. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is the definitive Marvel movie. When it comes to speaking about Marvel films, the general public may gravitate to The Avengers, but lovers of film will say The Winter Soldier is what Marvel wants to do with the movie industry. This well directed, action packed, game changer is also a throw back to 70's political thrillers like Three Days of the Condor.<br/><br/>It's a tight story with Captain America doubting himself and his work. He's not sure why he's doing what he does and is it bettering the world. He doesn't know who he can trust. The fish out of water story is a play with him. It plays out well when some familiar faces show up. The film is power packed with stars at the top of their game. <br/><br/>Chris Evans is Captain America without a doubt. I almost want to say move over RDJR because it seems Evans has taken over as the definitive Marvel super hero and character. Scarlett Johansson is fantastic as Black Widow with her character getting much more to do than an any film before. Her chemistry with Evans is great. They play off each other so well. Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson is a delightful addition to this rag tag bunch. He feel like he belongs more than just a newest edition.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is more than meets the eye. (Pun intended) I'll be upset if they don't write more for him in the Avengers sequel. Robert Redford, not really straying far from the political thriller genre is a powerhouse. He steals just about every scene he's in. And to see him toe to toe with Sam Jackson is a film fans' dream. The action, oh the action in this film is top notch. Shot well, you can feel every punch, kick and throw. And its nice to see that they let Cap and Black Widow become more acrobatic with their fighting styles. The one on one battles are some of the best I've seen put to film. The two fights between Captain America and The Winter Soldier are something out of The Raid. They showcase each man's strength. <br/><br/>The film comes with so many twists and turns there's no real predicting where it will go. I can't explain enough on how the Russos have up the ante of any Marvel movie coming after this especially The Avengers: Age of Ultron. With the complex story, the name dropping, the Easter eggs and the way things change, I hope Marvel can keep this high they are on. The Winter Soldier is Marvel at the top of it's game in terms of crafting a full on comic book movie universe. I can't say enough positive things about this film. If one is a fan of comic book movies or films in general this is a must see. And dare I say, after multiple viewings, Captain America: The Winter Soldier might go down as one of the best action films of all time."

","Some of us aren't a fan of action movies especially the one that requires a deep level of knowledge about the main super hero or villain with an unfamiliar background for us to fully understand the concept. <br/><br/>""The Winter Soldier"" might be an exception. It is a sequel that showcases the challenging life of defrosted Steve Rogers, aka Captain America in the modern world after 50 years of time skip. <br/><br/>Based on the movie, I don't think it is mandatory to watch ""The First Avenger"" to enjoy ""The Winter Soldier"" as I am satisfied with the majority of contents despite not being able to vividly remember everything that happened in the first one. The fast-paced battle scenes that keep the audience's in awe along with feisty one-on-one and group combats that are highlighted by an eye-popping Captain's shield control, nifty movements of Black Widow and an array of high-end aircraft along with Falcon's acrobatic move take me by surprise.<br/><br/>Of course, it would be wrong to judge the film solely on actions. Yes, this film does have a decent amount of storytelling and intriguing twists that explain the protagonist's past and villain's true colors. There are also nicely arranged humors with a bit of cliché. They pan out because they are used by the right cast in a timely fashion.<br/><br/>Again, even if you are unfamiliar with the Marvel comics or the Captain America, no sweat and watch as this film succeeds in unleashing the greatness of Russo. brothers and it is the epitome of action movies."

"brent_or","8","1","2","9 April 2014"," Strongest Marvel Studios Film to Date
","This is the most serious, fully-realized, across-the-board result that Marvel Studios has produced thus far, in my opinion. While it may not be quite as big, or have quite the flashy lineup of superhero characters as The Avengers, CA: The Winter Soldier is clearly a better film.<br/><br/>Good, real-world relevant story, excellent visuals, thrilling (really thrilling) action. Terrific ensemble cast. Robert Redford, Emily VanCamp and Anthony Mackie are all wonderful additions. Redford especially lends a crucial weight of charisma.<br/><br/>This is really a SHIELD movie, and it does a great job of both building and breaking the backbone of these Avengers-related films. It also provides a great series of question-mark setups for the future of this saga.<br/><br/>As far as weaknesses, I found the humor to be a bit flat in several cases. Other than that, though, pretty solid overall.<br/><br/>Once you accept that this genre (superhero) is all about painting with broad strokes -- meaning relatively simple plot structures, archetypal characters and emphasis on visual impressions -- this film can be given credit for being remarkably mature and literate. A good sign for the future of the Marvel Studios machine."

","With the release of superhero blockbusters usually happening in the summer, ""Captain America"" stood out as a springtime favorite. Following the other six installments of the Marvel cinematic universe, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is easily one of the most well-written and entertaining chapters to date. <br/><br/>Chris Evans does the character justice as the hero Captain America, as well as the lonesome and confused Steve Rogers. He portrays a role that is believable as the alienated and wary superhero that is suspicious of the new order around him.<br/><br/>The movie opens up with Rogers in the midst of a casual jog with a fellow soldier, but quickly transitions to full-throttle action following a briefing for a mission. After the opening scene, it is non-stop action and suspenseful plot twists from there on out which audiences are sure to enjoy. There were certain parts with humor but nothing compared to the previous films. Unlike the other recent Marvel installments, this movie does not pry for witty jokes and one- liners every other scene, but instead focuses on the pain, conspiracy and thrill that drive the story. This is definitely one of the grittier Marvel movies since having the rights handed over to Disney, but it fits the tone and aspect of the movie very well. With some unforeseen but suitable twists, this movie is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>All in all the gritty action movie was more of a dark political thriller with a gleaming hero at the forefront, than satirical fist throwing action film, but nevertheless a good start to hopefully a new trend of superhero movies."

Chris Evans' performance was great, taking into consideration that he's only a moderately known actor.<br/><br/>The film is a direct sequel to the first and after The Avengers continuing from where the first left off - in the 21st century - but being that it's set in the 21st century, Marvel seems to have took advantage of that by adding a range of bad ass equipment to it.<br/><br/>The winter soldier is completely a bad ass leaving you in shock once you find out who it is. The film continues mixing faster pace scene with slow pace scenes to balance it out, but the fight scenes are fantastic! There are some familiar faces and amazing twists, all formed together nicely with an undercurrent of comedy.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch. 9/10"
"rahul412","9","1","2","9 April 2014"," Batman meets James Bond
","Captain America Rocks. Its everything a good superhero movie should be. When you leave the theater after watching the movie you will be craving for more & that's its true victory. I expected movie to be good and decent but it exceeded my expectation many folds.I used to think Captain America is just another good guy and 'human' how could he compete with the likes of Hulk Spiderman iron man etc. but boy o boy did the movie prove me wrong or what. It turned out to be a brilliant movie much much better than I anticipated it to be. CA:Winter soldier delivers as much fun as the Avengers did (if not more) and that's saying a lot. All in all this movie delivers a bang for your buck.<br/><br/>Story is mostly linear thus easy to understand .Script is like a roller coaster ride, moving at a brisk pace , as soon as you settle down you are drawn into the world of lies & deceit. The multi layered character keeps you guessing whose side they are on till the very last moment. Rarely do we have an element of surprise & mystery in a superhero movie & that's where this movie delivers its knockout punch. It's a bit of James bond & MI thrown into a Batman movie but it never feels clumsy.<br/><br/>Off late superhero movies are moving towards a different genre, these are not juvenile movies anymore (thanks to Chris Nolan who started the trend with Batman Begins).<br/><br/>Chris Evans played the part brilliantly you don't see any hesitation which was slightly observed in Part-1 (& in Avengers too). Here hes in full form & gets going immediately. You get a feeling that he belongs to the stage & is completely at home here. Among other characters be it Fury, Black widow or Alexander pierce every one has played out its role extremely well. I thought Samuel Jackson was a revelation & is guaranteed to blow you away & so is Scarlette. Captain Americas 1x1 duels with winter soldier are a treat to watch. Action & special effects ( including 3Ds) are fantastic , as good as they can be.<br/><br/>With this movie now there is no doubt that Captain America belongs to the top league of superheroes. Chris Nolan- Beware we have a new kid on the block ,"

","Captain America also has the usual villein and hero chemistry but there are good suspense elements and the characters were nicely casted. As the jokes are making the rounds on twitter, this movie is only warming you up for The Avengers! Am not complaining. <br/><br/>Goes without saying that I love Scarlett Johansson (we all do), heard her in her last movie HER (it has only her voice, ya sad) hence was more excited to see her do the fight sequences with such flawlessness. More like Katrina Kaif in Ek Tha Tiger. But that's a different love story all together! :) Pardon my comparison, I love both of them. <br/><br/>You will also get to see 'Robin' from 'How I Met Your Mother'. Yes, Cobie Smulders is in the movie with a short role. HIMYM ended recently, after 10/11 long years and it was a major fail (ideally it should have ended 5 years back!). You would also spot 'Emily' from the 'Revenge' fame. I was big fan of Revenge until the first 2 season but then lost interest at it just got dragged too much. I liked Emily's performance hence was excited to see her in a neat and sassy role. <br/><br/>Chris Evans needs no introduction. He has been a part of many super hero movies and has been flushing out great performances one after the other. With that body and handsomeness I can only imagine girls of all ages drooling over him! :) <br/><br/>The movie is fun, thrilling, full of surprises and humorous. And ya, its in 3D. I have said this for all 3D movies released in India and I will say it again, we have still not come of age to give a perfect 3D viewing comfort. Yes, the glasses are not great, viewing gets dull and most of times I get a slight headache, just a little. But then am speaking only about myself. <br/><br/>Captain America gets your pulse racing from the very first action sequence and it never stops. With 2 hours and 15 minutes to spend on a single super hero, the plot needs to be engaging, I thought it was. I give it a thumps up and suggest you go watch it in a movie hall now. Find a place which is running it in 2D instead, if you are in India. I would have preferred it. Nevertheless, go watch it."

I know they don't like making superheroes get involved or married, I don't see why. It was good the writers showed Captain A go visit Peggy.

","By the last half hour of the movie, you're thinking, ""Are they really gonna do this?""..and the answer is YES, they're really gonna do this. The commercials for TWS are stating that this movie changes everything for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that isn't an exaggeration. Avengers: Age of Ultron will be the culmination of the Marvel Phase 2 leading into Phase 3 and if they're willing to shake things up this much, then fans better gear up for an experience. The storyline is more solid and suspenseful than the Avengers and will send ripples into all future Marvel Avenger-based installments. The action is eye-popping and jolting, including a scene involving an elevator that was probably a lot of fun for Chris Evans to perform. He truly took it up a notch for this film, as well, because the action/fighting scenes were brutal, fast and non-stop warranting a ""Whoa!"" every 30 seconds. Scarlett Johannsen and Anthony Mackie made for perfect counterparts to Evans' soldier, each providing key hero moments of their own. But the real standout here is the one and only, super spy himself, S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nicholas J. Fury, once again brought to spectacular clarity by the incomparable Samuel L. Jackson. He has a chase scene early on that sets the pace for the action for the rest of the movie and makes one of the smoothest escapes you'll ever see in a superhero movie. Cobie Smulders is also appropriately set as Fury's right hand Agent Hill once again and comes through with a clever rescue of her own reminding us that even Fury needs people he can trust. She proves pivotal in the final act assisting Cap, Falcon and Black Widow with the big save. And Robert Redford, well, he's Robert Redford...there's isn't a second of screen time where he isn't completely convincing and commanding complete attention, but, then again, he's Robert Redford, so there is a bit of expectation for his presence. And every heavy needs a trigger man/guinea pig, and his is none than the Winter Soldier, who is as enigmatic as he is familiar and gives Cap some of the most brutal and jaw-dropping fight scenes you'll ever see in a superhero movie. Probably the only time you'll ever see someone else catch Cap's shield. And let's not forget about Mr. Marvel himself, Mr. Stan Lee with one of the funniest cameo lines I've ever heard (after realizing that a certain suit is missing from a certain museum). By the end, Rogers, Sam Wilson, Romanoff and Fury mark out their new respective paths and objectives, which will surely meld into what will become the next standard for the superhero film genre-Avengers: Age of Ultron. Marvel has raised the stakes has only they can and all we can do is wait for the roller-coaster to continue. Avengers: Age of Ultron 2015..."

Any ways I usually give films a 10 star rating as long I don't get wholly taken out of the film and for the most part this film managed to keep me invested.<br/><br/>I do like the fact that it is very tonally different from the other Marvel films we've seen so far. This is very much a spy thriller film with comic book stylization peppered in. It has a very engaging plot with a very cool twist in the middle which I won't spoil.<br/><br/>The plot involves Cap now working for SHIELD, doing missions, 70 years after being in suspended animation. He no A major story arc in the comics is how Rogers is trying to adjust to modern society. While the film does touch on this, it gets sacrificed for screen time and it looks as if Cap is more or less content. Something I do like is how, this once unrelatable superhero from the 40s who did nothing else but punch Axis agents in the jaw, is now the voice of reason against blind patriotism, over surveillance, the climate of fear and the drone culture.<br/><br/>The titular character, the Winter Soldier, is in all of his bad ass glory. While he doesn't get a poor send off like Bobba Fett or Darth Maul or get reduced to a punch line like (shudder) the Mandarin, he still kinda gets pushed aside for the larger plot elements. I do like the fact that they totally stuck to the comic book design of this character although the Soviet Star on his metal arm only confused me with his allegiance. You will see why.<br/><br/>The other characters were just awesome. Robert Redford doing his spy movie thing, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is hot as always although these films really like scratching at her back story but never provide. Anthony Mackie's character as the Falcon I thought was a cool addition and not too contrived seeing that Black superheroes are generally lacking.<br/><br/>The more technical stuff I enjoyed was actually the downplaying of CGI, the action set pieces and the fight choreography. I will have to say Marvel, they're on the up and up again after Iron Man 3."

","Marvel has truly outdone themselves with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. There is really no bad things I can say about this movie other than the fact that it ended with an amazing end credits scene and now I have to wait till next year for The Avengers. The acting here is top notch, Chris Evans kills it as Cap and Scarlett brings more depth to Black Widow than ever before. Robert Redford also delivers an excellent role and Sabastain Stan as The Winter Soldier delivers a excellent villain. Of all the marvel villains from the movies, Winter Soldier is the only one who made me nervous when he was on screen. It brought me similar feelings as The Joker and Bane did for the Batman films. The movie is a spy thriller and it serves so perfect to throw Cap into this kind of story line. The events of this movie will forever change the Marvel Comic universe in film. This film also delivered Marvels best fight scenes out of any of their films. No powers or weapons just good old fashioned throwing big punches. This is Marvel reminding us that they can actually be taken seriously which after Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World it seemed like they didn't want to be taken seriously. This is a fantastic film and without giving too much away I can say there were some awesome twists revealed that show some familiar faces.Defiantly go see this movie if you have not yet."
"silntassasin","9","1","2","5 April 2014"," My favorite superhero flick since The Dark Knight!
","Seriously believe all the hype because this film was absolutely superb. This movie is directed by the Russo brothers who have literally made nothing but a couple TV shows however after this film except to see a hell of a lot more of them. This is by far my favorite marvel movie to date and that's saying something as I really enjoyed The Avengers. Unlike the other phase 2 movies in the marvel universe which I did not enjoy that much , this film relies on a aspect of superhero movies we haven't seen instead of cheesy clichéd stories, it makes itself more of a spy thriller that reminded me a lot of the Bourne franchise with some superhero aspects such as over the top fight scenes. The direction the Russos take this film in is a game changer as literally every marvel movie following this film will have to adapt to the new events that have occurred. Also The Winter Soldier is a bad ass villain that I thought was kinda like a terminator of the marvel franchise, he was brutal, powerful and made for a very emotional villain who is on par with Loki as best villain of the marvel universe. The acting is all top notch and Chris Evans shows us and gives us the Captain America we've always wanted, also Anthony Mackie as the falcon is a great new character in the marvel films, all the returning actors such as Samual L Jackson and Scarlett Johanson get a lot more stuff to do I'n this movie also getting moments to shine in their respective roles. This is a must watch movie for not only comic book fans but also the general public who want a great blockbuster action movie with compelling and smart storytelling!"

","The Germans have invaded the United States of America, but with our people. I guess that is how I want to start this review, but one can only tell. Last time we left our hero, he was in cryo-freeze for over 70 years and then S.H.I.E.L.D came and found Captain America a.k.a. Steve Rogers. Then much to Fury's surprise the company had been ambushed by the same evil that they thought they got rid ofHYDRA. But through the unlikely of sources, Alexander Pierce (played wonderfully by the greatest actors of all time Robert Redford) – for you see the Red Skull a.k.a Schidmit was just the birth and now the past has come to haunt.<br/><br/>But it all began when Bucky fell through the wintrier snow of the Alps and Doctor Zola found him and made him into a killing machine and wiped all of his memories, including the memories of his best friend. I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for those of you who have not seen it yet, but I will say this – the war against Hydra has only begun and nowwell I'll let you decide that for yourself.<br/><br/>This movie was the best that Marvel has ever done all thanks to the creator, the master mind behind of all these movies and comic books – Mr. Stan Lee – personally, you are my hero and you are our Captain – thank you for bringing your world to ours."
"Seraphion","7","1","2","1 April 2014"," A worthy sequel indeed
","So the story starts with terrorists hijacking a SHIELD ship. Cap and Black Widow are sent in on it. Cap thinks their mission is strictly hostages, but Black Widow was ordered also to get some files. Back in SHIELD HQ, Nick Fury is denied access into the files from the ship. He then gets attacked by the Winter Soldier. Escaped the hit, Fury goes to Cap's place and warns him of a compromised SHIELD, and only they know. Fury then got shot while Cap failed to catch the shooter. At the hospital, Fury seems to be dead. SHIELD Director Pierce then summons Cap. Cap doesn't share Fury's info with Pierce, thus Pierce makes Cap a fugitive. Cap escapes and meet Black Widow. They try to figure out what's in the file and discover an abandoned old facility in New Jersey back from Cap's old war time. Turns out that Zola, a German scientist recruited after WWII by US government was also secretly a member of HYDRA, rogue Nazi splinter bent on a new world order. Zola died in 1972 but preserved his consciousness in the facility. He reveals HYDRA's plans, involving taking the three new SHIELD helicarriers. At the same time, a missile is launched to wipe them out. <br/><br/>Escaped danger, Cap and Black Widow goes to Sam Wilson to hide, and Sam reveals Falcon project. The three 'kidnaps' a SHIELD official, and interrogates him on HYDRA's plans. Winter Soldier kills the official right after, and attacks Cap and friends. Black Widow got shot in the fight, and it's revealed that Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes. Cap and friends then got caught by SHIELD, but Hill set them free and then brings them to Fury, who actually faked his death. Cap and friends then get into SHIELD HQ and announce the HYDRA truth to everyone. After a firefight the HYDRA cabals manage to launch the helicarriers. Cap and Falcon fight their way into the helicarriers to insert a hack so Hill can control them. After Cap and Falcon succeeded controlling two of them, Winter Soldier comes and battles Cap on the third, breaking Falcon's suit. Cap and Winter Soldier then face each other there. Cap inserts the hack to the helicarrier's control but Winter Soldier shoots him. Hill gains control of all helicarrirers and Cap ordered her to destroy them, with him still inside. <br/><br/>Black Widow sacrifices herself under Pierce's threat and Fury kills Pierce. The injured Cap tries to help Bucky Barnes regain his memories, but he attacks Cap. Bucky then regains his memories, but Cap has fall onto the river below them. Bucky then saves him and then disappears. Fury goes on with his faked death and goes to Europe to hunt down the remaining HYDRA members.<br/><br/>The fight moves and choreography is way better than any other Marvel universe movies so far. Now not only Black Widow moves fluidly, but now Cap does too. In this installment, Cap does a lot more juggling moves with his shield and also acrobatic attacks, including somersault kicks. There's also the nice touch of Cap getting back in touch with the now ill Peggy Carter.<br/><br/>From my standpoint of one who doesn't really follow the comics, the insertion of the Winter Soldier into the story, as a way of introducing a new main antagonist into a title which is already a franchise, is indeed quite smooth. The unsuspecting intro of Bucky Barnes from the memorabilia room start this well, though if you look at this scene individually it feels stupid and not quite logical. Why would Cap be strolling to a museum to look upon memories of himself, when prior to that he already said that internet helps him greatly in catching up?<br/><br/>The next thing is that you see Winter Soldier blowing Fury's car with a shot mine. For me another non logical thing happened here. If Nick Fury can escape very easily from the Winter Soldier after having being inside of a car which was turn upside down, why is it so hard for him to escape the shooters with no superhuman abilities?<br/><br/>The gimmick of having silly jokes in the middle of hot action is kept and inherited from the previous Marvel universe movies. This include the ""Air conditioning fully operational"" reply by the car AI during the car chase scene. Yes, product placements in a movie is so common these days, but I think we see one too much black Chevrolets in this movie. Yet there is also a store placement of Apple Store in this movie, way to go Apple!! LOL.<br/><br/>I say we don't have much to criticize about the cast, because they primarily continue on from the other movies. The acting is good, even though not in the range of any awards. The cast gets creative enough as to develop their own dialog, as Evans and Johansson do. On costumes, the idea of Cap getting a new uniform is quite nice, though he ditched it and goes back to his old colors. The music scoring is barely there, just enough to help build the mood of the scene. <br/><br/>Overall for me this 7 out of 10 scoring movie is good, not because it presents something new, but because it can live up to its name and be the worthy sequel, as compared to the stupidity done in Iron Man 3's antagonist. A recommendation is a sure thing from me, of course."

","Well Marvel, you lot just keep on pulling out all the stops when it comes to delivering a cracking, non stop, comic book movie! And this Captain America sequel delivers and then some!<br/><br/>Sequels are always difficult as you don't have the origin story to fill the first hour so this was spent with following Rogers around tying to find himself up until the attempt on Nick Furys life and then things got interesting. We then start to unravel the tangled web of SHIELD and Hydra and the massive conspiracy theory behind these two organisations which was done really well. <br/><br/>Once that was established the action kicked into overdrive and the second half of the movie was brilliant. Just what a Marvel movie should be. Plenty of action with the main and secondary characters. The Cap got loads of screen time along with Falcon, black widow and Fury, seeing some development into their characters. The fight scenes with the Cap were fantastic and really well done. Maybe the director of this film needs to have a chat with the chaps over in the Ironman camp?! (Just a subtle hint!) <br/><br/>So all in all a cracking comic book action movie and what you expect from Marvel.....DC, you've got some catching up to do."

"s_campanale","7","2","8","26 March 2014"," Captain anti-America? Conspiracy thriller overdoes it on the politics but balances out with decent action and pace
","Captain America is perhaps the hardest character to do in 'the modern age' due to the post 60s fashion for 'hip-anti patriotism' in the Anglo- Saxon world. An integral part of 'The Avengers' he got his own rather underwhelming 2011 standalone that served as part of the run up to that all-star tag team. But what story could you give him between Loki and Ultron?<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly Marvel has opted for 'hip anti-patriotism', a sort of inversion of the flag waving he represents, which would be quite interesting and refreshing in itself if only every other popcorn movie around for the last decade hadn't taken the exact same line! In fact any movie with even the tiniest little recognition that there are threats of any kind that have to be faced somehow would be a surprising change. Instead here, couched in the continuing Marvel plot arc, we have movie that tells us again that 'we are the only problem!', that those who try to stop world threats are in fact Nazis (literally here!) and only bending every sword into a ploughshare and sitting down to buy the world a Coke will lead to everyone singing in harmony. While admirable, it is precisely this sort of naive, insular 'splendid isolationism' that led directly to both world wars and is seemingly leading us towards the third one right now! If anything all of these movies will become historical documents of our time, like those 'Atomic science will cure everything' pictures of the 1950s.<br/><br/>But enough of the socio-political analysis, how good is 'Winter Soldier' as a night's entertainment? Well it openly boasts of being more thriller than a superhero movie, and in that it works well. Captain America gets to do his thing a lot, and his shield finally becomes his signature weapon. There are spectacular car chases, especially early on featuring Nick Fury in a tricked out Tahoe vs a fleet of fake cop cars. Close quarter fist fights of every kind abound, even if they are shot with 'wobbly cam'. Three drone Heli-Carriers that are integral to the plot are well realised if destroyed a little too easily, and those 'Quinn- Jets' also turn up strafing our heroes everywhere they turn. Evans continues his maturity as Rogers/America, a doubting hero in the wrong time (he says so every other line in fact!) aided by Black Widow, who is more at home as a spy than as a 'super heroine' slaying Chitauri left and right. Johansson, who has been opting for every odd role going lately, looks oddly uncomfortable in the black leather this time, but that may just be the character arc. Samuel L. Jackson finally bends Fury around into his Tarantino mode that goes full 'gangsta' by the end. Robert Redford is in it is an acknowledged nod to the 70s conspiracy thrillers he once headlined and that 'WS' models itself on, playing the villain in far too relaxed a manner to be genuinely menacing. Marvel fans will already know exactly who 'The Winter Soldier' is and who he was before he became it, and he proves an interesting enemy here, yet with a lack of other 'heavies' he is left to carry the villainy alone and it is a tough load even for someone with a metal arm. Anthony Mackie finally brings 'Falcon' to the screen, even if he ends up looking more like turbo 'Condorman' and is not even that big a presence anyway despite Mackie's winning performance.<br/><br/>The film continues the post-Avengers trend of 'scorched earth', seemingly destroying everything that came before it, presumably to then rebuild again in 'Age of Ultron' (if anyone cares anymore by that stage?) A couple of rather confusing post-credit scenes (one after end title design and at the very end as usual) hint at what is to come in future attractions.<br/><br/>Not a conventional 'superhero' film, it is a modest entry that is slightly above 'Iron Man 3"" (it actually features some Captain America!) and ""Thor Dark World"" (it has an actual story and some energy behind it) if one lowers their bar suitably. The films heavy handed politics will certainly alienate many but they are not exactly hidden so you take it as you find it."

"jboothmillard","8","2","9","16 April 2014"," Captain America: The Winter Soldier
","Avengers Assemble was such a big hit for the Marvel franchise, so I am making sure to follow the storyline that is continuing through each of the films, and of course I liked the first film starring the hero of this wearing the iconic costume, from directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo (Welcome to Collinwood; You, Me and Dupree). Basically it has been two years since the events in New York, Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) is still having to catch up with the modern world and pop culture, having been in suspended animation, frozen in ice for fifty years, he works for espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division). He is sent on a rescue mission to save hostages on a vessel, alongside agent Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), in fact besides the rescue the mission involves extracting data from the ship's computers for S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains about Project Insight, where three spy satellites can eliminate given targets, Fury is suspicious of the project. Heading to meet with agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), Fury is ambushed by enemies, led by the mysterious masked assassin the Winter Soldier (Gone's Sebastian Stan), he survives the attack and makes it to Steve's apartment, Furty warns him that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been compromised and hands him a flash drive, before being shot and dying in surgery, Hill takes the body. Steve is summoned to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to tell what he knows to official Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), but refusing to say anything he is regarded a fugitive, but he escapes as the agency hunt for him, he and Romanoff join forces and in New Jersey locate a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker where they can access the content of the flash drive. They activate a supercomputer with the preserved consciousness of Dr. Arnim Zola (Toby Jones), Zola explains that S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after the Second World War, but since then enemy organisation HYDRA has secretly operated within its ranks, causing global chaos in the hope that humanity will surrender freedom for the security, and then the pair inside the bunker narrowly escape a missile attack on them. Steve and Romanoff recruit former USAF para-rescue man Sam Wilson aka Falcon (The Adjustment Bureau's Anthony Mackie) to join them, and they deduce the HYDRA mole inside S.H.I.E.L.D. is Jasper Sitwell (Maximiliano HernÃ¡ndez) who they catch and force to divulge the information he knows, that HYDRA has identified through data searching every single individual on the globe who is a threat to their plans, and the three satellites could be programmed to eliminate them all. Travelling to headquarters the trio are ambushed by the Winter Soldier and his assailants, during the long fight the assassin's masked is removed, Steve recognises him as his former comrade James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes, who he thought was dead, Hill then rescues the heroes and takes them to a safe house, where they find Fury is alive, he faked his death and he has plans to replace the programming chips for the satellites so they will not fire. At the Triskelion the World Security Council are gathered, Captain America exposes the plot by HYDRA, disguised Romanoff reveals herself and forces Pierce to leak out all classified information, Fury comes in eventually and after a struggle kills Pierce, meanwhile Rogers and Wilson work to try and change the controllers, but with the Falcon suit damaged Rogers is forced to do it alone, the Winter Soldier tries to stop him but the attack is stopped just in time for Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Wilson fights and defeats double agent Brock Rumlow (The Grey's Frank Grillo), while the Winter Soldier rescues Rogers when the vessels crash to the ground, but he disappears after this, in the end Fury using the cover of his apparent death heads to find the remaining HYDRA cells in Eastern Europe, Romanoff provides Rogers and Wilson information for them to track down the Winter Soldier program. Also starring Emily VanCamp as Kate aka Agent 13, Georges St- Pierre as Georges Batroc aka Batroc the Leaper, Jenny Agutter as Councilwoman Hawley, Garry Shandling as Senator Stern, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Alan Dale as World Security Council Member, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark, Stan Lee as Smithsonian Security Guard, Gary Sinise as The Smithsonian Narrator, Silent House's Elizabeth Olsen (Mary-Kate and Ashley's sister) as Wanda Maximoff and Kick-Ass's Aaron Taylor- Johnson as Pietro Maximoff. Evans is still straightforward and definitely growing into the role as he becomes more determined, Johansson is terrific being equally determined and a little feisty, Jackson gets much more time on screen as the smart leader, and even though a little stiff Redford is a villain. You don't have to necessarily pay attention to all the dialogue, the story once you settle into it is well thought out, using the contemporary surveillance scandals to good effect for the usual world destruction concept, of course the best bits are the explosive chase sequences and special effects bundled fight and battle sequences which are fantastic, as a sequel it definitely outweighs the original, a most entertaining action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Very good!"

Unlike most superhero flicks, the story does not involve chasing and stopping a shiny object in order to save the earth. Instead, we have a tightly written political thriller. This could have easily been a Tom Clancy novel that had Captain America written into it. The story has many brilliant twists. The action scenes are spectacular. The visual effects are close to perfect. You name it, and the movie nails it - acting, directing, music. Chris Evans is at his best in the lead role.
The movie also stands up to repeat viewings, which can be a rarity when they have some surprising twists. Even when you know what's coming, it's still a fantastic movie."

","I was not the biggest fan of the first Captain America film. It looked great, and featured some fine acting, but it lacked some of the energy that had characterized Marvel movies up to that point. Cap's second standalone film improves in almost every way. When there isn't action there's suspense, both of which are managed very efficiently. Though it's hard to talk about this movie without spoiling the plot, it can and must be said that it's hard for me to imagine any of Marvel's Phase 2 films having this much of an impact on the canon. Rather than being a straight-up actioner like its predecessors, The Winter Soldier is a successfully hybridized action-thriller, with mysteries and cold stares abound. All this adds up to what is arguably the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, possibly even beating The Avengers or Iron Man. Guardians of the Galaxy, along with every other MCU film between now and 2015, has some mighty big shoes to fill."

","""Whereas 'The First Avenger' was a friendly route to introduce Captain Steve Rogers and his fellow comrades, 'The Winter Soldier' ventures to highly improve these attributes, making not only the film great as a standalone but, it also delivers some of the best flicks of the MCU""<br/><br/>First and foremost, what glows about Captain America is not either his strength or his badass movements but, his desires of helping others and stepping in at the front of the most vulnerable ones. Probably, in the MCU, there is no such person as him. These qualities are truthfully shown in the first instalment, which even though it is not their best result, the audience catches the idea and aspirations of humble Steve Rogers. Therefore, the sequel dwells on Steve's past and collides with his present, ending up being heartening because most of the viewers will recall what Cap has been through. The most valuable element about the film is that he is not alone, at the contrary, he is facing the Winter Soldier and S.H.I.E.L.D with Nick Fury, Black Widow and the newest superhero Falcon. This is a glorious adventure for the MCU due to the implication of a massive research organization and the danger it could provoke throughout the world. Moreover, they establish the Age of Ultron by judging Avengers implication with S.H.I.E.L.D and clearly, these problems will lead us all to the Civil War, therefore, it masterly shadows a crucial chapter in the franchise.<br/><br/>In spite of having outstanding action pieces, an impressive cast and an intriguing plot, it still has some flaws. To begin with, some characters as Alexander Pierce are barely mentioned during the film, making it difficult to fully comprehend their importance, thus, there are some unrealistic action moments, let's be honest, this is a science-fiction film where almost nothing is real, though, you can spot something beyond unbelievable like a little guy destroying an ultimate-technology plane or professional-well-decoded fake masks like the one Natasha wore... These are just scarce facts, people ... Still Bucky and Cap's relationship are the cutest of the whole MCU ... (83/100)"

It was so cheesy, so over-done with CGI that you thought you were watching a computer program....and you really were. That is EXACTLY what you were watching.<br/><br/>I'm glad to say that Winter Soldier comes back with a vengeance. In fact it is the polar opposite of The First Avenger.<br/><br/>This time when Cap gets in a fight it actually looks like he got into a fight. It looks like he's fighting people and not the green screen. Car chase, that looks real too, shoot out looks real, the Falcon flying looks real.<br/><br/>The First Avenger suffered from Star Wars Prequel syndrome The Winter Soldier suffers from nothing.<br/><br/>Finally Chris Evans owns Captain America. He won that role with this film and all doubts about his performance is cast away. It's refreshing because of the worry he caused in the first film.<br/><br/>The plot is fantastic, the introduction of Falcon was great. Anthony Mackie does a great job as the Falcon, out shining every other side-kick in the MCU. In fact, he's so good, you kind of want him to drop the side-kick role and get his own film. He can carry it.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson, that was a bit of a problem...she looked orange. It almost maybe gave you the impression that make-up was trying to give her a Donald Trump look.<br/><br/>Orange Scarlett was sort of distracting, but in Winter Soldier she had more screen time than almost any other film and she too owned the part. Sure, Natasha doesn't have any super powers but she took Buffy the Vampire Slayer's title of most beat down rough and tumble kick-butt female lead.<br/><br/>It's not only a stellar addition to the MCU, but it raises the bar for anything to follow and can stand alone as a great spy movie."
"Uriah43","7","1","3","2 October 2016"," A High-Octane Sequel
","Still adjusting to a new age and issues related to his past, ""Steve Rogers"" (Chris Evans) meets another man named ""Sam Wilson"" (Anthony Mackie) who has experience dealing with similar issues. Immediately after their conversation Steve is picked up by Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) at which time they are sent on a top-secret mission to rescue hostages aboard a vessel owned by the spy agency (named ""S.H.I.E.L.D."") they work for. However, during the rescue operation Steve (aka ""Captain America"") discovers that Natasha (aka ""the Black Widow"") had an alternate mission assigned to her that he did not know about. Angry about not being informed Captain America confronts his boss ""Nick Fury"" (Samuel L. Jackson) and after the argument he begins to question whether working for ""S.H.I.E.L.D."" is the right thing to do. What nobody realizes is that an enemy spy agency known as ""Hydra"" has infiltrated their ranks and has a deadly plan to take over the entire world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a high-octane action film which, as a sequel, is comparable to the original movie ""Captain America-The First Avenger"" produced 3 years earlier. It has an interesting plot, high-quality special effects and decent acting all around. That said, I have little doubt that those who like movies of this type will enjoy this particular picture as well and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
"shawtylord","9","1","3","10 May 2016"," One of the best movie sequels out there
","As a fan of superhero movies and the first captain America movie ( which some people like and others hate) I had my doubts going into this movie but boy was i surprised, the action scenes in this movie were well choreographed, the story was as compelling as it could get and the plot twist at the end is one to look out for. Captain America winter soldier shows how captain America adjusts to modern life and while he begins to build trust with men of today, he gets very betrayed before meeting up with something from the past which he thought was gone. As this film comes from people who directed only comedy before it is a very big shock that one of the best comic book movies comes from them. Bravo is all i can say!!!!!"
"Screen_Blitz","9","1","3","3 May 2016"," Superb continuation of Captain America
","Captain America strikes back in this sequel to the 2011 box office hit that bridges a continuation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a sequel that not only boasts some of the best action sequences and heavy special effects of recent memory but also improve upon its predecessor. Expanding the character development and a more charged plot, Winter Soldier takes just about everything from the original and cranks them up to the next level. Chris Evans reprises his role as Steve Rogers who now works side-by-side for S.H.I.E.L.D with Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) but has difficulty adjusting to the modern world as Captain America when dealing with powerful threats and moral obligations. Worse, he discovers SHIELD is being threatened by a terrorist group known as Hydra and the threat becomes real when SHIELD director Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is attacked and mortally wounded when Steve a visit at his apartment. With fingers pointed at him and his trust put to the test Steve, Natasha, and his trusted friend Sam Wilson a.k.a Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie) must fight against tyrant group while facing against questionable figures he once trusted. <br/><br/>It's difficult not see how well and what this film improves upon the first film. While the first one is highly entertaining and brought upon some likable characters and a plot keep it moving, this one digs deeper into the character arc and plot development while leaving room for fantastic special effects and pulse-pounding action. Chris Evan returns in the titular role and is more likable than ever before. Granted by a more three-dimensional development and a slight taste of humor, Evans strives in this role and displays his most charismatic performance ever put to screen. Scarlett Johansson is no exception. She stands well as Steve Roger/Captain America's trusted sidekick Black Widow and much of the appeal she brought to 'The Avengers' but with much more substance. Anthony is also quite entertains in his supporting role, and someone who viewers come to like. These actors appear to have fun as their characters and the chemistry results in a trio that audience can't help but care. If there is any surprise, it may come from Robert Redford playing a SHIELD agent, a role much different than what many audience are used to seeing him in. <br/><br/>The first film boasted a great introduction of our titular hero in a plot that generated plenty of fun and endearment, but the plot comes much more engrossed. As the plot centers around the main character facing off against an evil terrorist called Hydra which some may find familiar from the comics as the forces that brutally hunt down our heroes, it presents a more violent and darker tone but nonetheless a deeper atmosphere. Throughout the story, the characters are taken into deeper roots and surprises and with such an inspiring screenplay, it all works. Not to say it goes in the realm of flawlessness but is moves far enough to where it's flaws will come easily unnoticed. Along with the powerful plot development comes some of exciting, adrenaline-field action sequences complete with amazing stunt work and special effects too difficult not to appreciate. One scene in particular takes place with Captain America in an elevator that comes with quite a surprise, and in the end easily one of the most memorable scenes in the film. The action sequences do dominate much of the second half but what makes exciting other than the inspiring special effects is they never feel repetitive. As a result, they remain eye-catchers to the audience.<br/><br/>Captain America: Winter Soldier is a great example of a sequel that manages to dig deeper upon its original outing, and thanks by the strong direction by Anthony and Joe Russo it's fun to watch and serves as a solid addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is very entertaining and will have viewers, particularly Marvel fans pumped for the next film Captain America: Civil War which I am genuinely excited about."
"stanleylabs","10","1","3","24 March 2016"," The MCU's bar was raised
","My favourite movie of the MCU and probably the best one (yes, even better than both Avengers). It was a superhero movie with a sub- genre that delved into political thriller and a spy movie. Dear lord, I came into the movie just looking for a good time and came out of it totally engrossed and wanting more.<br/><br/>First things first, shout out to Chris Evans. He was good in both First Avenger and The Avengers, but in this movie, he truly embraced the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America. He truly translated the character's unyielding faith in people and why he and Superman are the true embodiment of freedom and justice.<br/><br/>Second, the supporting characters were not only solid, but played off each other and Steve very well. From Scarlet Johansson to Anthony Mackie, without forgetting Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Redford, every single one of them brought their A-game on the table.<br/><br/>The pacing was great and it seamlessly went from one plot point to another, until the immensely big reveal (spoiler-free review, even if it has been two years). The action... OH MY LORD THE ACTION! One of the best action sequences in any superhero movie EVER, especially the fight in the highway/streets. This is where you truly get to see Captain America as super soldier, something I hope Batman v. Superman will do for Batman.<br/><br/>All and all, it's been two years and I am not budging: one of the greatest superheroes movies in the Golden Age of comic book films."

That flick had it all and then some ,action, good drama, an mind blowing story and its outcome has opened this Francaise, which is now composed of movies and TV series, to a brave new world. The effects of the Winter Soldier, seen them in following movies and in Marvel's Agent of Shield the past two years made me convinced that after the Avengers, Marvel isn't done get and the fact that at 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy also came out, wow, you bet that the following years this cinematic universe won't die any time soon.

"japamo","10","1","3","3 July 2015"," A Spectacular Blend of Bond Derring-Do, Paranoid Government Conspiracy, and ""Star Wars"" Aerial Acrobatics (and of course a Superhero and a (maybe) Supervillain)
","""Captain America: The First Avenger"" was generally a hugely satisfying, if somewhat rushed, introduction of a superhuman patriot who forthrightly fights for truth, justice, and the American way. Before we could find out how his '40s and World War II experiences shaped Cap's (Chris Evans) outlook, battles with sinister Nazi scientific/military organizations cryogenically thrust him forward into our shockingly unfamiliar world. Of course, part of the reason for this was that he had to be available for ""Avengers"" movies. Nevertheless, this time travel motif set up the always engrossing and recurring conflict between Cap's straight-arrow traditional beliefs and today's more obscure, ambiguous, and even cynical concepts of right and wrong. ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (hereafter Cap A:WS"") explores this conflict, and many others, with soul-stirring action, rousing battles, labyrinthine, twisty, secret government agendas, and the near-Kafkaesque difficulty in telling the good guys from the bad guys in today's world.<br/><br/>""Cap A:WS"" begins in Washington, DC with Cap (aka: Steve Rogers) literally running circles around his new friend and partner Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), an aerial rescue expert whose alter ego is the high-soaring Falcon, at the Reflecting Pool. Cap is still trying to get accustomed to 21st century modern life in his own unique version of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Sam works at the local VA hospital and invites Steve to hear about wounded veterans' experiences and put his own into perspective. Despite his on-going culture shock, and his suspicions about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ultimate objectives, Steve/Cap still ably participates on missions under the watchful eye (literally) of the stern, enigmatic Colonel Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson).<br/><br/>On Fury's orders, Steve/Cap, along with exquisitely martial-arts trained Russian (double?) spy Natasha Romanoff (aka: Black Widow) (Scarlett Johansson), goes on what he thinks is a routine mission to save some S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel held as hostages aboard a ship by brutal mercenary Georges Batroc (Georges St. Pierre). After a bruising battle, Steve/Cap and Natasha succeed in freeing the hostages, but then notices that the mission had another purpose unknown to him, but quite known to Natasha: retrieve a flash drive disk containing important information. Steve angrily confronts Fury about this deception; Fury responds that the data pertains to the Insight Program, a type of national defense shield programmed to neutralize all hostile threats. However, S.H.I.E.L.D is unable to decipher the flash drive's data, prompting Fury to see an old acquaintance, World Security Chairman Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) to persuade him to delay implementing INSIGHT. Pierce apparently acquiesces.<br/><br/>Subsequently, while driving home, Fury is ambushed by mercenaries disguised as cops and led by the Winter Soldier, an unidentified masked assassin with a metallic left arm who has superhuman abilities equal to Steve's/Cap's. Despite grievous injuries, Fury escapes to the sanctuary of Steve's/Cap's apartment, gives Steve the flash drive disk, warns him to ""trust no one"", and expires. Now it's up to Cap, Natasha, and Sam to avoid the Winter Soldier and his hordes (and other, unexpected people) and find out what is on the disk. Eventually the trio uncover another organization with a name straight out of Greek mythology (and an apt name, too, if you know your Greek mythology) with short-term plans to seize S.H.I.E.L.D. satellites to kill millions of people, and long-term plans for world domination through promises of security. Not only do the trio have to stop this somehow without getting killed, they have to find out if S.H.I.E.L.D., the INSIGHT program and Councilman Pierce are complicit in this, AND defeat the Winter Soldier and uncover his identity (Hint: It's somebody from Steve's/Cap's past, a most unexpected somebody.)<br/><br/>""Cap A:WS"" certainly zooms (often literally) above a typical mindless superhero brawl and even a ""Star Wars""-type dogfight, and is certainly more thrilling, emotionally draining, and substantial. As my review title mentions, ""Cap A:WS"" is an enhanced, more muscular, more windingly complex (you have to pay attention) and even more relevant update of the Bond movies, dealing with national security and fear and the sometimes tyrannical lengths government will go to preserve one and banish the other. The movie deals with the paranoic effect corrupt agencies have on human loyalty, trust, and integrity and the psychological toll it can take; for example, even though they are effective partners, Natasha's shady, double- crossing, mendacious past makes Steve feel a wee bit distrustful of her. Ditto for Steve's testy interactions with Fury. The movie even finds time for Steve/Cap to encounter reminders and would-be lovers from his past, and the bittersweet, nostalgic feelings they produce. Not least important, ""Cap A: WS"" illustrates the strength of friendship, even if one person is more committed to the friendship than the other, and the sacrifices that committed person is willing to make to resurrect that friendship. You'll recognize that friendship if you see the movie.<br/><br/>And I most enthusiastically recommend you do see ""Cap A:WS"", both a critical and commercial triumph, because it is that oxymoronic rarity, the ""intelligent action movie"" It stimulates your adrenaline and emotions, and it challenges your reasoning and your ethics, and it reassures you that despite the lies, deceit, disillusionment, hatred, and betrayals that seemingly overwhelm our modern world, you don't have to be Captain America, Black Widow, or Falcon to have the will to defy these bad things and do the right thing (you'll recognize that scene when you see it)."

","Well, I enjoyed first Captain America movie, but that was kinda boring, because of Nazi stuff and WW2. The stuff we already had known and fed up with. On the other had, Captain America 2 is all about future! In the movie, The SHIELD and Agent Natasha is also added. There is some information and characters from first Captain America, that makes movies more enjoyable to watch. Before you watch this movie, I suggest you to watch Captain America 1, for obvious reasons, and Also to watch Avengers 1 to learn a little about Natasha and SHIELD. It was amazing to watch. And if you enjoy superhero movies you will love this. To be honest, I found it better than few other marvel movies. There was handful number of surprises and some great action. Captain Rogers fights much better in this movie. If you remember in first movie there was more gun stuff and less fist fight. However here we got both of them in brilliant ratio. I gave it 8/10, because it is hard to impress me sometimes and I saw better movies like BATMAN TRILOGY. But all in all it was BRILLIANT movie."

The Winter Soldier is a solid villain, played by Sebastian Stan and he is discovered to be Captain America's soldier friend who he presumed was dead in the previous film. His body was kept alive and corrupted into a super villain with an iron arm. Chris Evans returns as Captain America and he leads a charge to rescue aboard a ship where pirates have taken over. Scarlett Johansson reprises her role as Black Widow and Captain America questions her when he catches her extracting information about S.H.I.E.L.D. Captain America questions Nick Fury, who arranged the mission, on honesty, and he responds indicating that S.H.I.E.L.D has been compromised. Fury is soon ambushed in traffic and is presumed dead, and Captain America is on the run with information that regards an organization called Hydra. Anthony Mackie is added to the cast as Falcon. He is a sidekick to Captain America whose hero gimmick sprouts wings and a jet pack. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury ends up a target and presumed dead when he summons Captain America. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo manage to upgrade from the previous film with an ending that opens for more possibilities. With top notch special effects and action scenes to satisfy the biggest genre fans, this is one of the best superhero films spawned from The Avengers. Score: 9 / 10"
"caseynicholson","10","1","3","26 April 2015"," Among the Best of the Comic Book Movies
","I went to great lengths in my review of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" to point out that Cap was my favorite comic book character growing up, and how pleased I was that Marvel had stayed true to his origin story by making the movie a true World War II based storyline. I'm pleased to say that ""The Winter Soldier"" also is a good depiction of the overall vibe of the 80's, 90's and 2000's Captain America comics that I grew up reading. Supporting characters and villains such as The Falcon, Batroc the Leaper, and Arnim Zola all feature prominently in a film that demonstrates the fun action of comics in general, the suspense of Captain America comics, and the feel of a comics based Bourne Trilogy film. <br/><br/>Having seen all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, I'm comfortable saying that this movie is among the best of the movies the studio has produced. The plot is immersive and consuming in its complexity and its thrill. The acting is well done, and you can tell that many of the MCU actors are growing into their characters as time goes on. The special effects are well done, and the fight scenes and chase scenes are fantastic without being overdone. <br/><br/>It's seldom that I give movies a perfect 10, but I did give this film that score upon seeing it in the theater. My pre-Avengers 2 viewing saw me continued to be impressed with this exemplary offering from Marvel. I really don't have anything negative to say about this movie. Bravo! 10/10."
"user-196-766417","9","1","3","25 April 2015"," Stunning film.
","""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a brilliant, well-written film that ticks all the boxes. A great script, wonderfully choreographed fight scenes, amazing actors, stunning cinematography, and an interesting, unique plot make this film (in my opinion) one of Marvel's best.<br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>The plot weaves the elements of The Winter Soldier - Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson) secrets, Project Insight and the infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. by Hydra really well. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is much more badass in this movie than he is in either ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" or ""The Avengers"", and Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), is given much more development. The Falcon, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), is also introduced, and he is an instantly likable character. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have delivered an amazing script that is smart and engaging.<br/><br/>Chris Evans absolutely nails the character of Steve Rogers, portraying his conflict, his purposelessness and his determination beautifully. Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier creates a figure that is menacing and terrifying, yet tortured and pitiful, and all this with barely twenty words. Scarlett Johansson gets Natasha's snark and humour just right, Anthony Mackie makes the Falcon likable, and Frank Grillo portrays Brock Rumlow's brutish thuggishness really well.<br/><br/>The cons:<br/><br/>The only fault I have with this film is that the final confrontation between Steve and Bucky is a little over-dramatic and predictable in terms of dialogue, especially after a flashback to the 1940s. There are some parts that are a little unbelievable, like Steve managing to fight Bucky after being shot three times, or jumping out of an elevator with hardly a scratch. But these flaws are dwarfed by the movie's brilliant script and actors.<br/><br/>Overall ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a great sequel (much better than the first movie) and a valuable addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"JSSTyger","10","1","3","25 April 2015"," Best Comic Book Film
","I think we have finally found the balance with seriousness and comic book style in this film. To compare it to Batman, I would call it a cross between Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan. I never really supported Nolan's films but fans always said his were better because they were more serious. I always argued that they didn't have the style and aesthetics of a comic book film. I was not sure it was possible to appease both sides. Winter Soldier did that.<br/><br/>All of the actors do a fantastic job. Robert Redford is a surprisingly evil **** and Anthony Mackie does a great job as the Falcon. Samuel L Jackson turns on boss mode. Sebastian Stan is the terminator. Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansen whoop ass all day long. And we have at least three more (geez, that's 8) to mention--Frank Grillo, Emily Van Camp, and Georges St. Pierre. Heck, even the Russos themselves are in the film and do OK with their roles! Great film. No question. 10/10!"

","In fact, this film is what I secretly wished every other Marvel film was like. It has been since the first ""Iron Man"" that everything is done so absolute: from the top, dark, brooding action down to great character development.<br/><br/>Steve Rogers is adapting to today. Meanwhile, Nick Fury is just about to find out about a dirty little (but huge) secret inside S.H.I.E.L.D. Trying to figure out what is going on, the Captain and Natascha Romanof are the only ones he can trust (along with a few others). And when the lines are crossed and all secrets are revealed, there comes a much greater threat than what was expected and even Captain America himself finds his dilemmas on the fairs of justice and evil.<br/><br/>Captain America before this movie was the least progressed Marvel hero. The main reason that happened is the first movie being called ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". I mean, seriously, we all just sat through that flick just to return to see the Avengers. <br/><br/>But the directors (the Russo brothers) took that poor constructed storyline and wounded structure, and made it work on much farther levels. The continuing narrative demanded greater personalities and more accessible dialogue and, of course, better action. I was stunned by all three. <br/><br/>It has been said before, so I am not the first to point it out, but this is actually the first comic book movie since ""The Dark Knight"" that deals with political interests, friendship and past causes to today's expense. It brings all of that together displayed equally and fashionably. It also manages to make us care for lesser attended characters, like Captain America himself, who is know done properly (no offense Marvel).<br/><br/>So if you liked Avengers, you'll love this one. And if you are not just a comic book fan, and like movies at greater expansion, you'll like this more than the Avengers."

"lordman","6","1","3","16 November 2014"," Trope-filled, silly, pretty, and fun.
","(VERY minor spoiler below) The Winter Soldier may be dressed up as an espionage thriller. Don't fall for the deception, it is a silly, high-budget, dumb but thrilling action-adventure-sci-fi-romp through and through. On the inevitable way to its conclusion, the film leaves no trope untouched, no predictable plot twist avoided.<br/><br/>First of all, for all concerned: this is very much a Captain America movie. It's filled to the brim with pathos and good ol' American Exceptionalism. We're meant to just accept that the US were accepted as the world's leading nations once more on merit of the Avengers. That's fine, though - a Captain America film is still that. Where it gets a bit iffy is a contrived plot twist that pulls what could have been a seriously critical look at the military-industrial complex and some soul-seeking on part of the American militarist public mindset into golden age comics territory. In the Marvel movieverse, the Nazis weren't done in 1945 - they still serve as antagonists all the way in 2014. Seriously? This is a movie that Captain America would love - its core message: idealism beats realism, and realism always corrupts. Personally, I don't agree (and a review is always a subjective thing), and for a movie that tries so hard to be an espionage thriller, this movie sure also tries hard to insult the viewer's intelligence. That aside however, if one is to accept the black-and-white morality and cheesy done-twenty-thousand-times-before plot, this is a competently directed, action-filled film with brilliant special effects and masterfully choreographed fight scenes (UFC getting name-dropped should give you an indication as to what to expect).<br/><br/>So yeah, there you have it - it's dumb, but fun, and anyone who wasn't prepared for American pathos going into a Captain America film probably only has him- or herself to blame."
"agentbinky-74-891144","7","1","3","15 September 2014"," Can be hard to follow
","First off, I saw in some of the blurbs that people were saying this movie is better than The Avengers, and I definitely disagree with that assessment. The Avengers had a whole CAST of superheroes, including Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, fighting a full scale alien invasion of New York city. This movie features one superhero fighting one nefarious government organization, although the organization in question is very resourceful and nefarious indeed.<br/><br/>There are so many plot twists in this film, I can't really describe the storyline without ruining it. I read that it was ""inspired"" by 70's government conspiracy films like Three Days of the Condor, and it definitely seems like it was. Basically everybody is out to betray everybody at some point in this film. To be honest, the intrigue came so quick and fast that I had a hard time keeping up with it, what with my frequent bathroom breaks and messing around on my phone. I guess I shouldn't knock it for that, since I didn't give it my full attention, but I will anyway. It's not a film to multitask with.<br/><br/>The action is, as expected, big and loud, although not quite as compelling as one of the Marvel movies where the main character has actual ""superpowers,"" like Spider-Man swinging through the Big Apple on webs or the Incredible Hulk shrugging off bullets. Captain America's foil, the titular ""winter soldier,"" is more like a cypher than an actual character, and although they try to flesh him out a bit near the end he comes off as rather cardboard and uninspiring. He also allows himself to be manipulated in a way that seems absolutely counter-productive and confusing to me. He looks awfully cool, though.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannsen is in this film also, reprising her role as the Black Widow, looking as hot as ever. There's a little sexual tension between her and Captain America that I could appreciate, given that their relationship never moves beyond the platonic. Oh, how I know that place so well! Anyway, I suppose her and the handsome fellow who plays Cap turn in acceptable acting jobs, although nothing to write home about. They're surprised and shocked in the appropriate spots, but nothing really emotional or demanding is expected of them. And the ""mastermind"" villain does a pretty good job of leaving the scenery intact, instead of chewing it all to hell.<br/><br/>All in all I say this movie is definitely incredibly action-packed and fun to watch, although a little confusing if you don't play close attention. I think I liked the first one a little better, though, simply because it featured Hugo Weaving playing the Red Skull. I guess if you were to evaluate the movies ""objectively,"" however, Winter Soldier would have to come out on top. I'd have to say I give it a definite ""thumbs up,"" and four stars out of five."

"Sci-FiHorrorFan","10","1","3","8 September 2014"," This is a very good Film! And Captain America is a BadAss!.
","This film was very surprising to me I've seen the film two times now and watching it the second time the film still holds up very well. I liked the first captain America film but I liked This film even more.I thought it had more action than the first film and I liked the story more too.This film was really entertaining and is one of the best films of the year! and more films like This Need to be made Instead of boring films like the Robocop remake which sucked in my opinion. Captain America the winter soldier blows that film away!. The film has great action right from the start! So I Was sucked into the film right from the outset which is what Films should do.This film was also fast paced and had some good humour.The Film had the perfect balance of humour and seriousness and it was very well Directed.<br/><br/>Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson were very good as our two leads and I thought their acting was good and they were believable as our two hero's of the movie. Scarlett Johansson returns as the black widow and she becomes captain Americas partner and I liked her a lot in this film I thought she kicked a lot of ass she sure knows how to fight and so does captain America I thought together those two were a force to be reckoned with. The movie also has a strong bad guy known as the winter soldier and I thought this guy was totally Badass! He knew how to fight! And he was very strong and he was without a doubt one of marvels strongest villains!. The guy was obviously a trained fighter because he knew how to attack and defend very well and he had some cool weapons to use too and the character causes a lot of destruction in the city when he fights captain America and Black widow.the fights he had with those two were fantastic!.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of good car chases and gun fights and captain America beats a lot of people up all through the film which I enjoyed watching. Captain America and black widow were cool characters and I thought they were likable,I liked them both and cheered for them through the movie. You also have Anthony Mackie in the film who played Falcon he's a new character that helps captain America fight,I liked him too and his acting was good and he had some cool moments. Samuel l Jackson is also in the film returning as Nick fury and he gave a good performance as usual and he was also likable and He was involved in an Exciting car chase. The film has a good story and there are a few twists in the story that people may not see coming there was one in particular that surprised me.<br/><br/>The film has good effects,great action scenes and good acting and a good story.what more could you ask for in a film?. This film has all the ingredients that I like in a movie and the film was a lot of fun.I also really enjoyed the ending fight between captain America and the winter soldier I thought it was a good fight it was very brutal and reckless and they both threw good punches at each other. The bad guy was strong but I thought captain America was just as strong as he was and he put up a good fight. The film had a very interesting ending and the scenes after the credits were also interesting which has wet my appetite for the next movie. To sum things up captain America the winter soldier is a definite must see! It was a lot of fun and I Loved it."

","This film was one of the best of the year because it was astonishingly awesome. An absolute masterpiece of a film, the choreography, action sequences and stunts were amazing. The acting was brilliant and the characters were so genuine and every line they spoke delivered. The film is an exhilarating thrill ride and the Winter Soldier was a great villain. The plot was very grounded and political compared to the sci-fi heavy marvel films we all know and love. Because it's a fresh twist on the marvel canon speaking of twists the film has some shocking twists and surprises. The film also deals with Steve Rogers who is now working for shield with Black Widow trust and moral issues because the world is very different and a lots changed. Also Falcon was a great character and had some awesome action scenes. CATWS is an exciting,original amazing and breath-taking marvel film which kicks ass 10\10 all the way"

","Such a copy pasta story pattern from other mediocre superhero movies, no invention at all in any direction, so precalculated of how things should affect target audience (btw nice side boob of scarlett). I could write long paragraphs of how this pop flick is the protagonist of anti-creative movie industry but i just remember one thing that striked me more than others. When there was a james bond moment and our beloved el capitano struggled to finish the job against the time, i just realized how this scene made me cold and absolutely not caring about anything i saw on the screen. That scene made me just feel bad, like i am less intelligent animal than a monkey, like the creators even think that some 1% of people doesn't already know how the situation will turn out, it made me feel like having a baby with a prostitute who just continues her job. This kinda summarizes the movie for me, its just the same BS in different coat acting to look new and cool and screaming at me with that lying face - come pls pay to look at me pls. Expected more from a 8 rated movie. But don't be negative kiddo! no one wants that so - pretty nice CGI, Scarlett Johanson in tight leather (+1 to the rating for that, job well done producers tap tap), Abed for like 10 sec."
"xcvb_2003","8","1","3","6 August 2014"," Now this is how you do a sequel.
","Now this is how you do a sequel. Captain America: The First Avenger was my least favourite movie from Avengers Phase one, this is easily my favourite movie from phase two. <br/><br/>We are shown how the captain is dealing with living in current times and working for shield. He is a real bad ass in this one. Even if you never liked Captain America's character before, I'm guaranteeing it that you'll like him after watching this movie. <br/><br/>The story was really good and gripping. Had some really good twists and turns. It wasn't just a superhero movie, it was more like a conspiracy/political/Action Thriller with a superhero in it and that really made it different from other Marvel superhero movies and I loved it for it. <br/><br/>Chris Evans upped the ante as Captain America, he was great in this. Even more awesome was how fleshed out Black widow, played by Scarlet Johansson, and Nick fury, played by Samuel L Jackson, were in this movie. Both got their best roles respectively so far in MCU movies. Nick fury was plain BAD ASS. And black widow has come a long way from that typical robotic spy-ish character from Iron man 2. Her character was great in the Avengers and it was greater still in this. The chemistry between her and cap was nice too. We are introduced to a new character too, Falcon, who acts like a buddy to cap, and he was pretty good. The winter soldier was a pretty good villain. His presence was powerful and fearful and was always accompanied by a great score. Wished he got more screen time though. <br/><br/>The action scenes were AMAZING. Hand to hand fights, car chases, gun fights, aerial combat, you name it, ALL were just awesome to watch and really made up for the lack of action in the first part. Soundtrack was pretty good.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like was that there was no mention of Hawkeye. I mean he works for Shield so they should have at least come up a with a line or two to tell us that why isn't he helping out etc. That and no Agent Coulson, he was like the go-to familiar guy in MCU movies, not having him this time was sad. <br/><br/>The events of this film have made the wait for Avengers 2 even more hard. It is one of the best movie of the year so far and one of the best MCU movie. Aside from Iron man 3, phase two has been really strong. Highly recommended. 8.7/10"

","Captain America is an amazing Science Fiction movie. It is about Captain America a S.H.E.I.L.D super soldier who everyone hates because Nick Fury, the president of Shield had been shot in Steve Roger's apartment. Everyone in Shield believes that Steve had shot Nick Fury. Luckily for Steve a girl knew who shot Fury! Together, they found out that a terrorist group called Hydra - tracing back to the Nazi days - had secretly been controlling Shield through the secretary of the Security Council. They joined up with another friend -an ex Shield soldier - and destroyed Hydra. Steve's friend Paki, had his short term memory erased and is tasked to kill Rogers. Fortunately, he realized that Steve was his best friend and stopped fighting. This movie is outstanding and I would rate it 10 on 10."
"hellocookie","10","1","3","18 June 2014"," A perfect comic book movie right from the funnybook pages
","When the first Captain America movie came out, I was so surprised that I became such a huge fan of it. Going into it, I figured that as a Canadian, the whole rah rah rah America thing would grow tiresome very quickly. Patriotic music, flags boldly waving in the background, hokey dialogue and wars for the ""cause"" just didn't seem to fit with my idea of a good time. Somehow though, Captain America defied all of the stereotypes that the title implies and made the character and the cast immediately beloved to me. Moreso than any other Marvel movie that came before it, watching Captain America was seeing a comic book come to life. It was like flipping the pages and smelling the new comic book smell as I watched it.<br/><br/>I've admittedly not read a whole lot of Captain America comics, but the movie made me feel like I'd been a lifelong fan.<br/><br/>Cue Winter Soldier, the first comic carrying the title of a comic that is actually a direct adaptation of that comic. Not just that, but it's a direct adaptation of the comic with the comic book writer on board as a consultant for the film. Between Marvel's already nearly perfect movie formula and this additional ingredient, Captain America: Winter Soldier was bound to be fantastic even before it started being filmed.<br/><br/>After seeing Winter Soldier, the word fantastic does the movie absolutely no justice whatsoever. I loved every second of the movie from start to finish. The story, the dialogue, the pacing, the action, the cast the whole freaking thing. Like the first movie, Winter Soldier is like reading a comic book on the big screen. You see the page layouts, you see the word balloons and the movie makes you feel like it's just you reading your comic somewhere quietly and excitedly.<br/><br/>There are clichés and hokey bits that are scattered in the movie, but they fit in with Captain America and what he's all about and Marvel seems to understand that you can't just put together a comic book movie about superheroes without having fun with it. It pokes fun at itself and at the genre in a way that isn't disrespectful and is more teasing instead. Falcon and Winter Soldier were so perfectly cast and portrayed on screen that despite my not having read much of anything with them in it, I once again felt like I'd had a connection to these characters for years and years.<br/><br/>Don't let the title Captain America: Winter Soldier fool you one bit. Those may be the two headlining characters, but it seemed pretty obvious to me that this was a test to see how a Black Widow solo movie might fair. Natasha gets just as much screen time as the fellas and steals almost every single scene that she's in by just kicking some serious ass. I'm not a huge Scarlett Johansson fan and while there's probably other actresses I would've preferred to see instead of her, I will admit that she OWNS the role and she isn't ScarJo pretending to be Black Widow in this film, she straight up IS the Black Widow.<br/><br/>My ONE nitpicky thing about the film is this: they spend so much time making the characters perfect. Black Widow is written with so much care, as she's largely decked out in practical spy gear (sans heels, mostly) and the like. She's the spy that might make mistakes but she gets the job done because she is damn good at her job. My one thing is that while they spend so much time making her believable in all those ways, they forget something silly like her hair. A spy wouldn't go into a fight with long-ish hair flowing in the wind. That's just stupid. All it takes in a fight is one of those dudes to grab onto her lovely, flowing locks and she's either losing a chunk of hair or she's going to be temporarily incapacitated. I know that she's SO GOOD that they wouldn't have a chance to grab her hair, but I feel like the character of Black Widow wouldn't take a stupid risk like that just for the sake of looking good. I know it's a silly nitpick, but I swear to god, this is the only thing that brought me out of the movie and made me think ""Huh?"" for a moment. You know, other than the one girl in the theater, who managed to not see any trailers apparently, and was still shocked at the reveal of who the Winter Soldier, shouting ""HOLY SH*T!"" in the moment.<br/><br/>Truly that's my only nitpick about the whole thing and I feel like that's none too shabby.<br/><br/>VERDICT: See it in theaters. Preferably right now and about 60 times afterwards. And then after you see it in theaters, go preorder your copy on Amazon and when it's no longer in theaters, wait in front of your doorstep for your copy to arrive every single day until it does.<br/><br/>This is the best Marvel movie to date and that's saying that after thinking they couldn't top The Avengers. This movie has so much heart and so much brilliance in it that it's hard to imagine that this is simply a comic book movie. There were several moments that involved me so emotionally that it caught me off guard (I'm looking at you, Peggy).<br/><br/>Oh, and just when I thought I couldn't have loved the movie any more, I got to the midway credits scene and I actually started freaking out in the theater. Seriously, I was like shouting and fist pumping and stuff. There are witnesses. Scared witnesses. I haven't been that excited about a sneak peak post-film ever. EVER! That scene (not the very end one) might've been better for me than the entire Winter Soldier movie. It's like everything in my life all of a sudden made sense."
"jul-kinnear","7","1","3","16 May 2014"," Henry Jackman's score for The Winter Soldier is utterly bland and modern, so it fails to evoke a protagonist who is, despite everyone's efforts, neither of the above.
","Let's start this out on a positive note. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo) features a likable protagonist, comfortable pacing, and some rather good plot ideas. <br/><br/>Tying in to the growing Marvel cinematic universe, The Winter Soldier takes place soon after the events of The Avengers film (for a full grasp of the setting and characters, we're supposed to have also seen Captain America: The First Avenger).<br/><br/>WW2 hero Steve Rogers (Captain America, played by Chris Evans) is still trying to adapt to life in the 21st century — which, in his case, entails working for a well-intentioned but overbearing intelligence organization headed by the sensibly paranoid Nicholas Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).<br/><br/>On paper, at least, there's a great deal of dramatic potential in the idea of the honest, quietly gallant but somewhat old-fashioned soldier of the 1940s trying to work alongside a former KGB assassin (Scarlett Johansson) who lies for a living, under the command of a leader who trusts no one. Add to this some dubious anti-terrorism tactics and blurred lines between security and oppression and you have the recipe for an exciting and morally rich story.<br/><br/>All that's on paper. On the screen, what we get is a decent set-up, a couple of distinctive — though mostly unexplored — characters, a juicy ethical conundrum that vanishes unresolved in a puff of smoke (or rather, a series of explosions), and an overdose of acrobatics and flying bullets. <br/><br/>Let's be fair here. Dynamic, over-the top fight scenes are one of the perks of comic book movies, and this one does indeed deliver a few entertaining dustups. It also contains quite a few that overstay their welcome and wear out the old Hollywood tradition of ineffectual antagonist gunfire.<br/><br/>While it's true that too short a confrontation at the very end of a film can feel anticlimactic, it's also manifestly true (even in the world of comic book fights) that less is often more. A shorter fight can actually pack more of an emotional punch instead of leaving the audience numb and wondering why everyone isn't dead yet. <br/><br/>Speaking of everyone being dead, there's also the small problem of collateral damage to be dealt with here. One of the charms of the Captain America character (as set out in the previous movies, anyway) is his sincere, instinctive decency and compassion. Here, there's not even a second of anguish or even acknowledgement of civilian damage caused by his exploits and those of his enemies. <br/><br/>Having said all this, many of The Winter Soldier's flaws would be much diminished if only the movie were shorter and better scored. The Russos could have knocked nearly half an hour off the movie's two-hour-plus runtime without losing any of the plot, humour, or characters depth simply by slimming a few obese action sequences. What remains would then benefit a great deal from a more distinctive and evocative soundtrack. Alan Silvestri's work on the first Captain America movie was both memorable and very fitting for both the historical period and the hero. Henry Jackman's score for The Winter Soldier is utterly bland and modern, so it fails to evoke a protagonist who is, despite everyone's efforts, neither of the above.<br/><br/>http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/captain-America-soldier"

","Probably going to upset a lot of Captain America fans now but i actually thought Captain America Winter Soldier was dragged out to much, As usual it is a solid performance from Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansen but i just feel like the writers ain't taking this movie as serious as other Avenger films such as Iron-Man. Don't get me wrong, when the action happens this movie can be great but it's all the in between scenes that made me feel bored when watching. It's not a rubbish movie, it is very good i was just expecting better given the success of the Avengers Movie but i would recommend watching the movie as all people have a different taste, as stated before, i was just left unsatisfied half the time."

","Hands down, the best movie that Marvel has ever put out. I am not a comic book reader, so there are some things about this movie that I particularly loved, more so than the normal comic book reader. The big thing for me is that Bucky is the Winter Soldier. I'm now aware that this is a well-known fact based on the comics, but since I had never read the comics, I completely took me by surprise, and I loved it!! Outside of that, the character of the Winter Soldier was just amazing. I also thoroughly enjoyed the story line. The fact that HYDRA came back was so stunning and incredibly well done. The end of the movie just makes me want to see what happens next even more. SHIELD is gone, Bucky is on the run... Where could Marvel possibly go from here?!?! This movie just made me THAT much more excited for Avengers 2! All around, fantastic movie. I would highly recommend it!"
"flapdoodle64","10","1","3","6 May 2014"," Captain's Commentary
","A lot of people expect Capt. America stories to be jingoistic right wing combat porn, but in the mid-1970's, writer Steve Englehart did a kind of parallel Marvel Universe Watergate-saga called 'The Secret Empire,' which showed corruption reaching the pinnacle of US politics, and Capt. America was confronted with reality. <br/><br/>And in the early 2000's, writer Ed Brubaker again brought contemporary politics and war into the Capt. America storyline with the original version of the Winter Soldier. Brubaker's run writing Cap was the best ever for Our Hero. <br/><br/>This film is a brilliant synthesis of the best political CA story lines and the 1970's conspiracy movie thrillers, such as 'Day of the Condor' and 'All the President's Men,' and the presence of Robt. Redford here is a clear signal of what the directors intend. <br/><br/>It's also clear to anyone with the slightest bit of imagination that the main plot is a hard-hitting critique of the US's policy of assassination-by-drone...Cap's pal Nick Fury intends to pre-emptively rub out 20 million 'bad guys' in order to (supposedly) protect 7 billion. <br/><br/>Chris Evans nails the difficult part of being an earnest and noble man in the modern world, and there is copious high quality super-heroic stage business, as Cap (and his pals Black Widow and the Falcon) smash their way through the requisite armies of henchmen and super-villains. The directors and fight choreographers also nailed the difficult task of translating Kirby-esque shield-slinging fight scenes into cinematic reality...this film, like the 2013 Thor movie, was like a living silver-age Marvel comic. <br/><br/>So we have been given a pulse-pounding conspiracy thriller and socio- political critique, delivered in the mighty Marvel manner. This is the best (so far) of the comic-book movies. But will it spur a discussion? Will it awaken America to the sense of outrage we so adeptly suppress...the grim reality that we inhabit the Drone nation...sending our aerial buzz-bombs into the world, killing thousands of innocents? Will this film knock our blinders off, bring the realization that our mealy-mouthed pseudo-liberal and belligerent right-wing politicians are bringing unprecedented death and destruction to the world? Only time will tell.<br/><br/>But it's telling that in a time of political corruption of a scale and nature which makes the Nixon Administration look like a church picnic, the only main-stream film with the guts to speak up is a comic book movie."
"wcreamer330","9","1","3","1 May 2014"," A Must-See!
","Captain America: The Winter Solider is arguably the best Marvel movie yet. It has action, violence, suspense, surprises, symbolism, humor, and everything one might want. Taking everything good about Captain America: The First Avenger and adding everything the first movie missed, this movie is extremely wonderful, not only for Marvel standards, but also in general. The portrayals of the characters are phenomenal, and this movie remains true to the comics. The visuals are amazing, and Nick Fury takes off his eye-patch! As usual, make sure to stay after the credits (or just until the projector turns off to be sure). Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a must see."

","I mean the deal with CA always had been the fact that he tended to be a tad boring always when compared to other superheroes for no fault of his own. There were legit reasons for all of that of-course and not because of any issue with the actor or anything. But all that changed with this movie. It was one hell of a ride and a very good entertainer. The character was accorded more depth and people understand what CA stands for more than ever I guess. Also the special effects were right up there. <br/><br/>The screenplay was very good and the director did a very good job of making the movie very pacey. The cast was superb and thus delivered on all fronts. All in all a must watch movie I would say."
"dyllon_jeng","7","1","3","27 April 2014"," Exceeded my expectations
","I walked into the theater not expecting much from this movie, considering how the sequels to Iron Man and Thor were not particularly satisfying to me. However, Captain America: The Winter Soldier surprised me in a myriad of ways. As for the story, the plot is more complex than other Marvel movies and isn't the typical bad-guy-tries-to-achieve- ultimate-power-and-destroy-the-world. The movie is action-packed and many of the action sequences are enjoyable to watch. What I particularly liked was the deeper character development of Captain Steve Rogers, in which we see much of the nostalgia he feels for his past life and the difficulty he has adjusting to the modern world. <br/><br/>The only complain I have is that some of the action sequences are a bit unrealistic or illogical. For example, there is one scene where the Winter Soldier goes onto the car holding our protagonists and attempts to kill them there. But the Winter Soldier is forced to retreat to a truck that holds explosives and rocket launchers that he could've simply used to kill his targets instead of trying to kill them the hard way. But I guess that's typical in many action movies. While this isn't something that particularly bothers me, I feel obligated to reveal this: The Winter Soldier isn't as big or important in the story as the title implies, so don't go into the movie expecting much from him. <br/><br/>That's all I can say. The movie is great for its standards and would probably exceed your expectations if it weren't put on the top 250 list."
"utgard14","8","1","3","25 April 2014"," ""I'm 95. I'm not dead.""
","Very good sequel that seems to be slightly overrated. That's kind of the norm with comic book movies these days, for a variety of reasons. It's not a big deal, really. Time is the true test of a movie's rating. The observation about the movie that it is less a superhero movie than a spy action/thriller is accurate, I think. Of all of the Marvel movies so far, this certainly seems to be the one least concerned with superheroics. A primary reason for this is probably due to the movie being inspired by the Cap comics of the last decade, which are much darker than they used to be and more spy stories than superhero ones. I'm not a fan but there's no point in getting into that here. For the purposes of this film, it works well and towards the end when Evans finally dons the proper Cap superhero costume (or at least the closest we'll get to it in these movies), it's a powerful moment.<br/><br/>Chris Evans, not surprisingly, is terrific. If he hadn't before, he has certainly proved himself as an actor in the role of Captain America. He's brought more to the part than I think anyone ever expected from him. I was a little concerned about the large cast going into this. I was afraid there were so many characters, all with significant roles, that Cap would wind up being sidelined in large parts of his own movie. Thankfully, that is not the case. The other characters add to his story instead of taking away from it. Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance from any of the films Black Widow has appeared in so far. She and Evans have a great chemistry together, which is good since they are paired up for most of the film. Anthony Mackie is lots of fun as Sam Wilson/The Falcon. Hopefully in future movies he will get a more colorful costume. Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Redford are both good. I doubt that shocks anyone. Sebastian Stan spends a lot of the movie with his face covered and simply there to be a villain who can fulfill the movie's action quota. But as the movie progresses and the audience learns more about his character, he gets to act more and does an admirable job. It is kind of funny Winter Soldier is the B plot in this considering the movie's title.<br/><br/>The script is much tighter than the first Cap film. The special effects and action are very good but, as in the first film, there are no scenes that stay with you. If there is a singular ""flaw"" with the Marvel movies, it's that most of them simply try to be an entertaining movie with no aspirations to be anything more artistically. To use a baseball analogy, they seem to be content to get singles and doubles. They aren't trying to swing for the fences. I'm all for great popcorn movies, of course. I just think you can be that and also have memorable moments and scenes that stick with people for years. Thinking back on this movie that I just watched a week ago, there are no iconic moments that come to mind. Still, it's a very good movie that I would recommend everyone check out. I would caution you not to make this your first stop in the Marvel cinematic universe though or you're likely to be lost about a lot of the characters and plot."
"Logan8888","Null","1","3","23 April 2014"," AWESOME! This is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material.
","Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. One dimensional, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, it leans towards dark because of the subject matter but everything mixes so well. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and believable even though the concepts are still wild. It's truly better than most comic-book movies have ever delivered. All the dramatic beats really click. Steve Rogers is indeed troubled but he leans on his moral conviction and does not fold under modern pressure. He is so well written and displays true character establishment and development over the course of the previous two films that we've seen him in. (SPOILER: we even get to see a truly touching bed ridden moment dealing with the longing and missed opportunity between Steve and Peggy from the first film.) That leaves an undertow of lonely romantic longings and other implications of loss and grief over being thrown out of his time period.<br/><br/>What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that just about every scene packs real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable movie no matter the genre no matter the source material. Oh yeah, did I mention that Cap kicks loads of butt too? That you could tell from the flood of action clips seen leading up to the movie. What was a pleasant surprise was that Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a complete, wonderful and very well done movie."
"Al_The_Strange","9","1","3","15 April 2014"," Captain America Winter Soldier Review
","In the first phase of Marvel's cinematic universe, Captain America made his appearance as The First Avenger; that film proved to be a fine adventure and a fine introduction to the character, but the best had yet to come. We got to see a decent sampling of Cap's heroics in Marvel's Avengers, but in the aftermath, the man would kick some serious butt in the modern age, while fighting the Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>Captain America's second film in the Marvel franchise is pretty much an action film with a strong political-thriller undercurrent that shifts character alliances and cranks the stakes to huge levels. It starts off with a thrilling hostage crisis on a boat, which sets off a series of events that causes the characters to go on the run and fight against massive odds. There are loads of great fight scenes, all fast-paced, hard-hitting, and choreographed with expert precision. The stuntwork is a thing of beauty. But that's not all; scenes in-between the action remain engaging thanks to the suspense and the personality of the characters. The film culminates with a fantastic climax involving a huge amount of mass destruction.<br/><br/>What really makes the film great, however, is the constant stream of peril the story dishes out. It is a huge challenge that makes for a very thrilling plot (and will undoubtedly serve as a paradigm shift for whatever may happen in Avengers: Age of Ultron). The film does take its time to let the characters shine a little (and character conflicts make up the most relevant dynamic for the various conflicts involved). Underneath it all, the film daringly underscores the threats of the modern world, so troubled by the loss of privacy and liberty through surveillance and technology. It's a world where Captain America finds himself way out of his element, but that's also what makes him the perfect hero for this story, because it's only his old-fashioned down-to-Earth mindset that gives everybody a chance. In the end, the film provides a relevant reflection on modern-day geopolitical issues, and the film hints at the scary notion that our world could be subverted. It's a captivating paranoia-thriller, inspired heavily by similar thrillers of the 1970s (such as Three Days of the Condor), but with big-scale action the likes of which only Marvel can dish out.<br/><br/>This film sports some fine photography; it's very solid most of the time, but tends to get jittery during the action scenes. Editing can be rather fast and hectic, but it gets the job done without being too overbearing. Acting is swell; Chris Evans is still apt as Captain America, and it is especially impressive seeing how physically demanding the fights must have been. Sebastian Stan elicits a good amount of sympathy for his character, and he has quite the presence. Scarlett Johansson is given quite a bit of screen time as the Black Widow; her character seems way more sarcastic than usual, but she's still easy on the eyes. Robert Redford is quite suitable in his role. Everybody else does alright. Writing is okay. This production features lots of good, slick-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is okay too.<br/><br/>Despite having some shaky camera work in the action scenes, the film is pure excitement, and still has room to breathe and make a few relevant points on the characters and their ongoing struggles. As one of the better films in Marvel's repertoire, it comes casually recommended.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"
"svanlijnden","8","1","3","15 April 2014"," A Very Good and Spectacular Conspiracy Thriller
","Like Superman, Captain America is a tricky character to make interesting. As conceived, they both stand for moral absolutes. In Cap's case, for 'truth, justice and the American Way' though thankfully, that last part isn't overly emphasized. The second (semi) solo movie handles Cap very well, throwing the ultimate Good Guy into a conspiracy thriller and making him have to doubt the morals of everyone around him. It is also pretty current, tackling the topic of safety versus freedom. How much are we willing to give up of the latter to gain more of the former?<br/><br/>I won't get into the plot much, for fear of spoilers. Let's just say that Black Widow kicks a lot of ass, Robert Redford does the same with his acting and that Samuel L. Jackson has a very good action sequence. Cap's shield is used in a variety of cool ways and Chris Evans makes Cap a likable guy you root for every step of the way. There is also the introduction of a new superpowered character or two, one of whom looks a bit silly in action. While most of the heroes and villains here rely on hand-to-hand combat or guns, the outlier seems to belong in X-Men, rather than in this relatively grounded outing for Captain America.<br/><br/>Maybe my use of the word 'grounded' is unfortunate, given the climatic scenes. They are visually impressive, especially on a big screen in 3D, but things do get a bit convoluted and messy. There is silly pseudo- science at work in them – or rather pseudo-technology in the shape of three doohickeys – and the heroes' strategy for the endgame ends up relying on quite a bit of luck. Also, it's funny that Evil technology has red lights which turn green when Good people hack it. Who knew morals were colorcoded into hardware? Evil is 'no', Good means 'go'!<br/><br/>Two more nit-picks. As in other stand-alone movies from the Avengers crew, it's not clear why the rest of them aren't called in to help. And what kind of glass is in all the windows in this movie? You could base a drinking game on the amount of people throwing themselves out of a building by effortlessly crashing through one. Even if these buildings are otherwise heavily secured, the windows shatter right away. I would have loved to see at least one instance of a character bouncing back off a window and onto his ass.<br/><br/>Nitpicks aside, this is one of the best Marvel movies, only slightly below The Avengers and on par with Iron Man 3. Up next is Guardians of the Galaxy, full of characters I've never heard of, but blessed with a great trailer. Bring it! <br/><br/>@PopCultJunk"
"fredschaefer-406-623204","9","1","3","14 April 2014"," Marvel kicks it up a notch.
","It would have been very easy for the second stand alone Captain America movie to simply bring back the Red Skull and pick things up right where THE FIRST AVENGER left off, Cosmic Cub and all; but the Russo brothers, who directed the third Cap go round, CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER, have given us a marvelous thriller that speaks very much to the fears and concerns of the 21st Century rather than just another super hero face off with a criminal mastermind determined to take over the world just because he can. <br/><br/>WINTER SOLDIER has Steve Rogers working for Shield in the aftermath of the events of THE AVENGERS and taking orders from Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, but this straight shooting hero from the 1940's has a tough time operating in the gray area that this kind of work demands, and when Shield decides to go the preemptive route, Cap has real problems; as well he should be, for I won't be giving anything away if I reveal that Shield has been infiltrated by one of Marvel's great invisible empires of evil and they're out to use all of Shield's high tech weaponry to bring their own version of ""order"" to the world.<br/><br/>In the end, it all comes down to Chris Evans's Captain America and a small group of allies to save the day and take down a mammoth conspiracy just in the nick of time. This brings Steve Rogers face to face with the Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes, his best friend from their World War II days, now a revived super soldier just like Cap, but one whose memories have been wiped clean, making him the perfect assassin. Every super hero needs an antagonist who is his equal, and in the Winter Soldier, Cap gets a foe who can go toe to toe with him and then some. Their fights are spectacularly staged, especially a running street battle and their climatic throw down on the helicarrier. In fact, all the action scenes are terrific, the highlight has to be when Cap takes out that elevator filled with Shield agents all by himself.<br/><br/>The script and casting do a terrific job with The Black Widow and The Falcon, played by Scarlett Johannsson and Anthony Mackie respectively, fleshing out their characters nicely and making them compliments to the Captain: the Widow can be ruthless when the situation calls for it and the Falcon can fly, the one thing Cap can't do. Robert Redford brings all the gravitas of his fifty years in movies to the role of Alexander Pierce, the head honcho who likes to get his way. Sebastian Stan is back as Bucky, Cap's former best friend and now worst enemy, a potential villain who has the potential to rival Loki as a fan favorite. Who misses the Red Skull? But Toby Jones returns in a very pertinent cameo as Armin Zola. And Samuel L. Jackson takes Nick Fury to some places we haven't seen his intimidating character go before. As for Chris Evans, he is still doing a masterful job at making what some consider Marvel's dullest hero vibrant and relevant. The only casting problem I had was when Gary Shandling showed up as a Senator, it took me completely out of the movie.<br/><br/>WINTER SOLDIER does an excellent job of expanding the movie version of the Marvel Universe; we are introduced to Batroc and Jasper Stilwell among others, and that is Ed Brubaker, the writer of the original Winter Soldier comic book arc, as a scientist in one scene. If there is any complaint, it would be that Brubaker's original story was stream lined for the movie, leaving out some elements the fans loved.<br/><br/>As for the post credit sequences, they do a nice job of setting the stage for the next Avengers movie, when they go up against the evil Ultron. We meet some new characters for the first time, including one of Cap's oldest foes. It does a great job of leaving us wanting more."

","All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot. Captain America The Winter Soldier is such a movie. It's the best big budget movie that I've seen since Avengers. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining an intriguing plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, charisma, a dash of true patriotism, honor, duty and puts it all together in one amazing package. This movie will surprise a lot of people with its heart while sacrificing none of the thrills. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Steve Rogers. His never say die attitude and heart of a champion makes this hero more interesting then most. He remains the ""good man"" his creator instructed him to be in the first film even through the most trying of times. <br/><br/>This movie delivers on every level and does so with great emotional moments and it's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated."

","""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is undeniably the sequel that fans of Marvel: The Avengers and Captain America itself, wanted. As usual the movie has suspense and entertaining factor as an action pack movie that has been power of success from all of The Avengers franchise. The opening and some no-gun combat scenes are remarkable that would give excitement feeling. Also some good performances from it's supporting role (Scarlett Johansson, Robert Redford and Samuel L. Jackson) has helped Chris Evans to develop as main character, without them the film would feel empty though. The only thing that goes wrong with it is the movie has no element of surprise also it lacks heart and originality from ""Captain America: The First Avengers"". The first installment successfully portraits the old-school personality of Captain America as a hero and offers engaging love story that could differentiate it with the other The Avengers character. Perhaps this sequel got cooler action sequence but it doesn't have the uniqueness that memorable in mind like ""The First Avengers"" did. Overall ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" fulfills the duty as blockbuster entertainment and important yet satisfying entry from the franchise that would easily guide audience's curiosity into ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron""."

"Anurag-Shetty","10","1","3","4 April 2014"," An outstanding film that's miles ahead of its predecessor.
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier continues with the story of Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans) & his continuing struggle to adapt to the modern world. Set one year after The Avengers, Rogers is now working for S.H.I.E.L.D with the help of handy sidekick, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson). After a controversy emerges at S.H.I.E.L.D, it is up to Captain America to stop the threat. However, he's going to need all the help he can get from the likes of, Black Widow, Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson), Maria Hill(Cobie Smulders) & Sam Wilson/Falcon(Anthony Mackie). Along the way, the Captain faces the Winter Soldier(Sebastian Stan), a Soviet Agent who is someone significant from his past. <br/><br/>This film, doubles up as a political suspense thriller apart from being a superhero film. You just can't differentiate the good guys from the bad. Of the three Marvel Phase 2 movies released so far, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is on par with or, dare I say, even surpasses, Thor: The Dark World(another brilliant film in Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe) & is a million times better than Iron Man 3(the weakest movie in Phase 2). Anthony Mackie described Captain America 2 in one of his interviews as, The Avengers 1.5. I could not have given a more apt description. Directors Anthony & Joe Russo have reduced the flaws of Captain America: The First Avenger, to a bare minimum. The stakes are really high in the film & The Winter Soldier is almost as flawless as The Avengers. Another reason it's so similar to the most successful superhero film of all time is due to, the presence of S.H.I.E.L.D & all the familiar S.H.I.E.L.D characters, who were conspicuous by their absence in all the other Phase 2 movies. I liked the fact that all of Cap's deleted scenes from The Avengers, made its way to this movie, especially the scene involving Peggy Carter(Hayley Atwell). The movie was filled with brilliantly executed action sequences that looked realistic & eye- popping in 3D. However, the film has a generous sprinkling of humor, as well(as is common with all Marvel Studios' movies). Unlike in Thor 2 where Tom Hiddleston's Loki stole the show, every character in this movie is memorable in their own right. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans improves with each portrayal of the most humble, kind & honest superhero who ever lived. Samuel L. Jackson is sensational as Nick Fury. Jackson flawlessly portrays various shades of the mysterious Director Fury, with ease & panache. Scarlett Johansson is unforgettable as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Johansson is not just eye candy as the sexy Widow but, packs a punch & shares great chemistry & bonhomie with Evans. Romanoff's wisecracks about Steve Rogers' age are hilarious. Robert Redford is great as Alexander Pierce. Sebastian Stan is mind blowing as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. Anthony Mackie is hysterical as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Mackie's winged superhero, is a nice addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe & I look forward to seeing more of him, in the future. Cobie Smulders is impressive as Maria Hill. Frank Grillo is great as Brock Rumlow. Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell & Toby Jones are excellent in their cameos as Agent 13, Peggy Carter & Dr. Arnim Zola. The supporting characters are effective, as well. Stick around till the end of the credits for two unforgettable post-credit scenes. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a must watch. The best movie of the year, so far!"

"kii-belling1","Null","1","3","3 April 2014"," A solid entry but not Marvel's Dark Knight
","Captain America's second solo outing sees him questioning his allegiances, punching people and pits Steve Rogers against the iconic comic book villain, The Winter Soldier. I had high expectations going into this film with many heralding it as the greatest solo film to date and some even saying it surpassed The Avengers.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: The hand to hand fight scenes are expertly choreographed and executed and this combined with great cinematography makes for intense and fact paced fight scenes. The characters of Captain America, Nick Fury, Black Widow are all expanded on and explored in greater depth through perfect writing and acting. The film also introduces new characters, Sam Wilson and Alexander Pierce who are equally memorable and great additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overall the direction and tone of this film is excellent, it's not quite as grim as a movie like The Dark Knight but much more serious than many other MCU entries and rightfully so. However the film does have several good moments of levity, which are all well timed. <br/><br/>THE BAD: While the hand to hand fight scenes are well crafted the big explosion set pieces are poorly handled. Chalk it up to bad directing or bad writing but they just didn't have the impact they were supposed to. At the climax of the film 3 enemy helicarriers all begin firing on and crashing into one another which is impressive at first but it quickly becomes boring to watch. There's no jeopardy as we know that Captain America isn't going to die and the mix mash of gray and orange fire and rubble quickly becomes numbing and uninteresting. My biggest complaint with the film however is the character of The Winter Soldier. He is a rather insignificant part of the story and is reduced to a henchman rather than a fearsome antagonist. It can be assumed that they are laying the groundwork for further development of this complex villain but in the context of THIS film, the character is underused.<br/><br/>All in all I had a very solid time with this film but I couldn't shake the vibe that it felt like Avengers 1.5 rather than Captain America 2. Despite ending on a Desolation of Smaug-esque cliffhanger, I did get a certain feeling of resolution and I left the cinema perfectly satisfied. I eagerly await future Phase 2 films, and the eventual Captain America 3<br/><br/>Also, the TWO post credit scenes are top notch. Easily the best ones to date."

He has all the virtues a good American is supposed to have, and that is what it makes him so amazing, he is like America's point of view of Nietzche's Uberschman, And i find his shield being the purity of the ideals of America. And the only thing that is a formidable opponent for this captain America is a Nazi-Soviet conspiracy with super evil Soviet super strong bad guy that represents America's virtues but corrupted.

","For years I was wondering out loud how a Captain America film would work without it coming across like a colossal joke. Fortunately, Captain America the first Avenger worked beautifully... which begs the question... how do you make a sequel to Captain America work in modern day without it being a colossal joke? The answer is simple... you bring back the brilliant writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen Mcfeely and the Russo brothers to direct.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is a comic book/political thriller. While in part being a commentary on today's world that's very relevant to our current social climate and fight against terrorism, it also serves as a cautionary message as to how easy it is for evil, powerful men to fool people into believing they are the good guys... I'll let you draw your own conclusions from there.<br/><br/>Chris Evans continues to be amazing as Captain America. The man somehow is absolutely perfect despite his resume containing characters such as Johnny Storm and that guy from Not another Teen movie. Sebastian Stan is also awesome as The Winter Soldier, and the beautiful Scarlett Johannson as Black Widow, and newcomer Anthony Mackie is really awesome as Sam Wilson/The Falcon. I was slightly annoyed he wasn't fighting with the Avengers in Age of Ultron. Before I forget, the absolutely lovely Cobie Smulders returns as the smuldering hot agent Maria Hill... get it?<br/><br/>And of course Sam Jackson returns as the charismatic Nick Fury. Between this amazing casting that also includes Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce... who would later return in Avengers: Endgame, a great script, fantastic direction and great character stuff... The Winter Soldier is an absolute win for the MCU."

"spookyrat1","9","1","4","18 May 2019"," Superb Action Film!
","Besides being a terrific sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, Winter Soldier is just an absolutely pulsatingly exciting action film. The set pieces from the initial night raid on the boat through to the arguably somewhat over the top carrier v carrier ending, are just brilliantly rendered and all so varied.<br/><br/>I love the way the Captain's story has progressed along with that of Black Widow. It makes sense that they would be thrown together in this film as neither has any sort of regular family. The introduction of Falcon was welcome and focusing quite a large element of the story around Nick Fury, also added depth to his character, whilst throwing a light on Shield operations past and present. At the same time, introducing the Winter Soldier into the mix added what is almost a touch of Shakespearian tragedy to a super-hero espionage film.<br/><br/>For me, Captain America is the most interesting of the Avengers.We see him adjusting and adapting to life after a 70 year jump, whilst simaltaneously missing a life time of companionship with hs one true love Peggy Carter. It all serves to accentuate his humanity, which we see again when he continually questions the actions and ethics of those with whom he continuously has to deal.<br/><br/>This is everything a big budget super hero film should be. Great job Russo Brothers!"

Many of the best moments in the franchise are in this film including the elevator scene and the fight on the bridge, this film also has great character interactions especially with Steve Rodgers and Nick Fury.

Then I one day decided to watch it and I fell in love.<br/><br/>Chris Evans is so mind blowing good at being Steve Rogers. As a comic book fan, I think he is the one that nails his performance for his character perfect. The CGI in this movie is good, you can tell they used some time to do it well. The dialogues are good, great cast, great plot, this movie is just perfect. <br/><br/>The only thing that bothered me was the car chasing scene. It was okay to watch the first time, but when I watched the movie for the second and then the third time it was just boring. Luckily, it was the only scene I really got bored off watching. Marvel is so good at fighting sequences though. Fighting sequences can often be boring and repetitive (looking at you The Dark Knight Rises), but The Winter Soldier nailed those scenes with combinations of parkour, martial arts and what else! <br/><br/>The more times you watch the movie, the more you notice and appreciate the small details (natasha's arrow necklace!!!) and the musical score, which is also so beautiful. <br/><br/>I 10/10 would recommend for anybody looking for a good action/superhero movie.

","Most people probably would have answered ""Iron Man"" when asked about their favorite stand-alone Marvel movie since Favreau's adaption hit the cinemas in 2008 but in 2014 our beloved Marvel superhero received some serious competition. At this time ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" hit the cinemas. Having never been a huge fan of the first movie or of the hero himself in ""The Avengers"", my hopes for this one were pretty low and I even considered not watching it but gladly I did! <br/><br/>Steve Rogers alias Captain America (Chris Evans) still tries to accustom himself to the new era. He and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) regularly observe secret missions by the order of SHIELD 's director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Soon he learns that SHIELD got infiltrated by agents of HYDRA and additionally the world 's most dangerous assassin the Winter Soldier is in pursuit of him.<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" takes Marvel movies to a new level. When watching a Marvel movie you can usually expect a lot of well-done action, a great protagonist, a little bit of a love story and enough humour to keep yourself entertained. ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" brings all those elements typical of Marvel to perfection and even adds something new. Besides the Winter Soldier being for Marvel's standard an extraordinary villain with a great emotional impact on Chris Evans' Captain America, the movie can be viewed as a political thriller taking place in the Marvel universe as well. <br/><br/>If you are a Marvel fan you probably will love this movie such as if you are a fan of action movies in general. The only recommendation before watching this film would be to be familiar with the first Captain America movie (and in the best case ""The Avengers"" as well) otherwise you might not understand every notion of the movie fully. <br/><br/>To sum up, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is my favorite movie of 2014 and every fan of comic book adaptations should watch it!"

","In 2008, director Christopher Nolan did his part to change the world of comic book movies. Rather than use the source material to create another action blockbuster with a recognizable superhero lead, the filmmaker instead made The Dark Knight as a dark crime thriller that happened to feature Batman as the lead detective. To say it ""legitimized"" the genre is reductive to some of the fantastic movies that were released before it, but its unique approach garnered deserved attention from those who might not otherwise be interested in cape-and-cowl wearing vigilantes. Of course, in that same time span, Marvel Studios has left an equally impactful mark. Not only have they delivered differently toned superhero stories – favoring the bright and fun over the dark and dramatic – but they've also developed the innovative and risky Marvel Cinematic Universe that webs together all of the studio's characters into one shared world."

","Thrilling, suspenseful, and clever—these words can be used to describe almost every feature film that the very busy employees of Marvel Studios manage to crank out year-after-year. However, in April of 2014, Marvel Studios just may have outdone themselves.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the second installment in the Captain America franchise, picks up a few years after the first installment left off (The continuity of the Marvel Universe is a beautiful thing). Steve Rogers (Chris Evans)—a.k.a. Captain America— is still trying to orient himself to the strangeness that is the 21st century. To recap the first installment: at the start of World War II, Steve Rogers was turned into a super-soldier, rising to fame for his fight against not only Nazi Germany, but also for his fight against the sinister organization Hydra. The first installment ends after Rogers wakes up and discovers that he's been asleep for nearly 70 years—a result of being frozen in ice following a plane crash in the Arctic Ocean. Rogers is now ""a man out of time."" Adjusting to modern life is hard especially when you're a chemically engineered super-soldier who has been tasked by an organization known as S.H.I.E.L.D. to help protect the world.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier finds Steve Rogers in the middle of his daily workout—jogging around Washington D.C. landmarks. Over the course of his workout, Rogers meets and befriends Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie). Their friendly banter is interrupted when Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) a.k.a. Black Widow whisks Rogers away to a meeting with S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). The skills of Black Widow and Captain America are needed to rescue hostages after a S.H.I.E.L.D. boat was taken over by pirates. However, Rogers soon realizes that their true objectives for this mission are more nefarious then a simple hostage rescue. <br/><br/>Over the course of the film, Captain America and Black Widow come to realize that S.H.I.E.L.D. been compromised. They discover—through a series of complex and violent events—that a S.H.I.E.L.D. bigwig has ties to an organization long-thought to be destroyed—Hydra. That's right; Hydra is back and ready to attack. Now outlaws within their own organization, Steve, Natasha, and Sam Wilson a.k.a. The Falcon, have to navigate through a web of deceptions and secrets—both new and decades old—in order to save S.H.I.E.L.D. and destroy Hydra once and for all. However, Hydra has a not-so-secret weapon—an extremely deadly assassin with an extremely secret identity. This unstoppable assassin comes fully loaded with an arm that's deadly and robotic, and a face that's a major plot twist. He is known worldwide as The Winter Soldier, however Steve Rogers knows him by a different and more familiar name. A name that, like Rogers himself, is ""out of time."" <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier's name will not be mentioned in this review because doing so would reveal one of the film's better plot twists. That being said, the Winter Soldier's identity is a huge plot point but surprisingly is not the major focus of the film. So many major events occur within this film that it is hard to distinguish which of the events is the film's true focus. Is the focus on The Winter Soldier's identity? The rise of Hydra? S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new top-secret project? The choice made by directors Anthony and Joe Russo to have the focus shift constantly between these plot points allows the film's action and suspense to build and build. Just when it seems that our heroes have tackled one problem, they are thrown another curve-ball.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was superb. Evans, Johansson, Mackie, and Jackson all brought their A-game to every scene. Throughout the film, the audience witnesses the bond between the characters grow stronger and stronger though their dialogue and body language. And of course, Captain America: The Winter Soldier wouldn't be a Marvel film without the signature witty banter and dry humor laced throughout a majority of the interactions between characters. <br/><br/>Even though this film may be labeled a ""superhero movie;"" Captain America: The Winter Soldier is anything but a mindless action flick. Don't worry; this film does deliver your daily dose of destruction, fight scenes, and massive explosions. Special effects are in heavy demand by the audiences of today. Every explosion must be bigger, blood must run redder, and car chases must be cooler than ever before. These massive special effects and their subsequent massive budgets are trademarks of films created by Marvel. It is now the widespread expectation of audiences globally that Marvel will deliver bigger, better films year after year. When used effectively, special effects are wonderful devices in which to capture the full, undivided attention of an audience. The special effects in this film do not detract from its overall humor and heart.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Captain America seems to have the most heart out of any Marvel superhero. This film proves my point; exploring subjects such as the unbreakable bonds of friendship and the pain of past loves. Captain America: The Winter Soldier blew me away with its action, humor, and heart. It truly is a must-see film."

","Hydra, a terrorist cell within S.H.I.E.L.D thanks to German scientists (like the malicious Zola whose ""brain"" exists within ancient databanks in an old warehouse), supposedly kills Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and plans to use a Project Insight (with special aircraft machines equipped with superior weaponry) to annihilate anyone on earth who might threaten to deter their mission of herding humanity into captivity to follow a security rule. This would be to abandon freedom so anyone that might be a detriment to Hydra's plans is targeted for extermination. It will be up to Captain America (Chris Evans, who has made this character his own; this character will define his career for the most part) and former KGB officer, current S.H.I.E.L.D member (that was until Fury was attacked), Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, with red hair and toned, athletic body) to stop Hydra. Joining them is former soldier, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackle), going by Falcon because he has a special device in his backpack that unfolds metallic wings that allow him to fly. Assisting Hydra besides an equipped strike force called S.T.R.I.K.E is a former buddy of Captain's named Bucky (Sebastian Stan), captured by the Germans and built into a supersoldier called The Winter Soldier. With an arsenal of hi-tech weapons (including a computerized metallic arm akin to Captain's shield, explosives, and guns), impressive strength (he is one that can go man to man with Captain America), and fighting prowess (when Captain and the Winter Soldier do battle, neither can get an edge over the other), The Winter Soldier is quite a threat; he's the perfect solution to the pesky Captain America. Within S.H.I.E.L.D, Fury thought he had an ally in Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford; this role a direct departure for the actor), who is a high ranking member within the organization, but is wrong.Pierce is Hydra and believes the solution is to coral the human race into rule. To him, The Winter Soldier is his weapon along with the Insight heliacarriers that will remove future threats to his and Hydra's dream rule.<br/><br/>Convoluted plot or no, Captain America: Winter Soldier is an incredible action film and utilized the popular comic book super hero amazingly well. It brings him into this century and wisely incorporates the past and present to flesh out and evolve the character. It also takes a hard look at ""compromising"" one's ideals in order to survive in this day and age, with Captain America a throwback to old fashioned heroism, values, integrity, and defense of freedoms long fought and died for. Redford is a kind of example or symbol of corrupt idealism where the use of murder is necessary in order to adopt and secure a control over people, forgoing the moral entanglements that come with eradicating millions in order to achieve a master race of sheep. To stop war, diplomacy isn't the answer, it's removing millions so that the billions under Hydra rule could be part of a brand new future.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you just want a comic book action film, this is perfect. You get incredible car chases (Fury's evasive van drive through the city in an attempt to avoid Hydra forces, Captain America and Natasha's first meeting with The Winter Soldier and members of S.T.R.I.K.E), breathtaking fight sequences (Captain's overcoming the strike force in an elevator and battle with The Winter Soldier on board a heliacarrier, and Captain's early fight with Georges St Pierre on board a ship where hostages of S.H.I.E.L.D are held), and eyepopping special effects (Captain's disarming a heliacarrier with his shield, Nick Fury's van withstanding major damage thanks to a protective shield, Captain's feats of strength through the use of his shield by going through windows and moving through the use of running like a locomotive) really provide the audience bang for their buck. A rather complex plot aside, this had something to say along with all the bells and whistles. Marvelous entertainment. The story of the Winter Soldier in relation to Captain's past is also well done. Anthony Mackle gets a plum supporting part while Redford successfully plays against type."

","I half wanted to see this, as I'm not the biggest fan of Marvel's film franchise. The first Captain America was less than convincing to say the least, and he's never been anywhere near my favorite comics character. But here he's a badass! The action sequences are pure eye-candy. CGI is kept to a minimum (or at least -- the minimum a superhero movie would allow). The fighting choreography is fast paced and varied, the Cap isn't overpowered or getting his ass handed to him all the time (like movie Wolverine). His powers are developed in an ingenious way and don't deviate from the source material, to please the Avengers fans out there. Chris Evans' performance is solid, even though the Captain can be annoying at times with his naive outlook on today's world. Still, those are only fleeting moments, and overall, the character is quite likable. There's definitely a nice dynamic with Scarlett Johansson, who is convincing as a more fleshed out Black Widow. The tone of the movie is quite different from other Marvel blockbusters: it's much darker, more inspired by high tension thrillers. Obviously, the plot doesn't hold up to any Robert Redford classic, and isn't all that deep but then who would go into a Marvel movie expecting Citizen Kane or the Manchurian Candidate? The weak link here is the antagonist, who is definitely poorly handled. I didn't remember him from the first movie and honestly didn't care about the emotional aspect of his confrontation with the Cap. These appear as relatively minor flaws compared to the rest of the film though, and the highlight really is the action sequences."

","Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans) is now a full-time agent for S.H.I.E.L.D., the high-tech law-enforcement agency led by eye-patch wearing champion of justice Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). After Fury is attacked by a mysterious metal-armed assassin known as The Winter Soldier. Accompanied by agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and pal Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Rogers sets out to discover who is behind the violence and finds that evil organisation Hydra has been thriving within the very walls of S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is regarded by many comic-book fans to be the best superhero movie to date. X-Men Days of Future Past currently holds that title in my opinion, but I do agree that there is much to enjoy about this second cinematic adventure for the super powered, shield-flinging patriot in the snazzy stars and stripes uniform. The story is solid and the cast superb (it's particularly nice to see old-timers Robert Redford and Jenny Agutter on board), the special effects are extremely impressive, and the film's stunt-packed set-pieces are spectacular, combining fast and furious fight action, incredible vehicular carnage, blistering ballistic mayhem, and death-defying acrobatics.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in their effort to provide as many jaw-dropping thrills as possible, directors Anthony and Joe Russo occasionally misjudge matters, allowing proceedings to go way over the top, thereby preventing the film from being the masterpiece that it otherwise could have been. Cap's plummet onto a concrete pavement and Sam Wilson's leap from the 40th floor of a building into a waiting helicopter might look impressive, but their sheer preposterousness serve to take the viewer out of the movie, if only for a moment: suspension of disbelief can only go so far.<br/><br/>8/10. Not perfect, but for the most part, another very entertaining addition to the Marvel cinematic universe."

","Now I would like to take credit for that summary line ... come to think of it, no I wouldn't. But still the fact of the matter is, that my summary line is the actual title the movie received upon its release in Germany. Can you see them Dollar bills (or Euro bills in that case) in front of you? No you can't? There are there, because the only reason to change the title was to make it more marketable.<br/><br/>Apart from that scheme though, this movie is better than the first one. Which I did like too (it's an origin story after all), but I understand that some weren't that fond of. It did have issues being in the past and all, but this one is in the ""now"" (well after the Avengers and the other movies). There is also a TV show (Agents of Shield) that might tie up into the events of this, which I haven't seen. Marvels plan with phases and different story lines does work very neatly.<br/><br/>I reckon it won't be long until the first will get weary of all those superhero movies, but I'm not one of them (yet). Especially because the quality is there. As with all the other movies, there are extra bits in the credits and after the credits. Nice ones too"

","Well, let's start with an invulnerable, ultra-competent superhero. He's a good guy, with a team that's rooting for him. There are also the bad guys, with their team.<br/><br/>There's the martial arts, of course. Not real martial arts, but fake movie martial arts. The film also has many shootouts (with various weaponry). It has quite a few serious chase scenes, too, with cars, planes, people, you name it. Usually they end in explosions. Everything ends in explosions in this movie. You've got lots of technical wizardry and huge sci-fi space ships. And the beautiful girl and the black guy. Clever and daring, but unimportant in the end.<br/><br/>Oh yes don't forget the spy agencies with endless money and godlike powers. (However, there's always a rogue element in these agencies, of course. There's always something about them that is not really as it seems.) <br/><br/>I don't remember the plot of the movie (even though it ended an hour ago), but I do remember the muscle gods, the endless kung-fu, the cool hi-tech hardware, the huge space ships, the chases, shootouts and explosions, and of course (spoiler alert) the good guys winning in the end. <br/><br/>Samuel Jackson is in this movie. But you already knew that, didn't you. He's in every movie.<br/><br/>Robert Redford is in this movie, too. Robert, what were you thinking...<br/><br/>It's a new way of doing movies. It's entertainment for the body, not the mind or heart. It's meant to trigger the same reptilian part of your brain that responds to flashing lights, car accidents, loud noises and porn. Future directors will have to add more muscle boys, more explosions, more CGI and 3D, more chasing and fighting -– although it's hard to see how they could do that.<br/><br/>I suppose movies like this are produced because there is a very big market for it. That's plain enough from the IMDb scores. The Russo brothers, writers and others can only be commended for producing a film that so many people think is awesome.<br/><br/>The question is why does a movie like this get such adulation? It's one of life's mysteries, I suppose, like why do some people go nuts over watching basketball and golf. I suppose it's not so weird that the people who love these movies are exactly the kind who would never spend the hours necessary to do what their heroes on the silver screen are doing. It's vicarious reptilian fantasy fulfilment perhaps, but notched up with CGI to satisfy an internet and gaming-addicted generation and with a certain homoerotic element for the ladies.<br/><br/>OK, this is not my genre at all. This is not my franchise either. But I've written about that before, so I'll spare you. I thought this movie was barely entertaining. It was not realistic, intelligent or moving at all. I enjoyed watching Chris Evans though, although I'd rather see him as another character."

Had you on the edge of your seat the whole time wondering what would happen. <br/><br/>New characters to the Marvel world are brought in (The Winter Soldier, seemed to be a tough matchup for Cap which you don't see a worthy opponent too much in these movies anymore, so do not take it for granted. The Black Widow is sexy, smart and mysterious.. deadly combinations that bring her character to life more in this entry. The Falcon's introduction was almost an overload, but worked out well for the story's purpose. And of course mister Captain American, Chris Evans steps it up with a solid performance, showing us more of what he can do with Cap). <br/><br/>Excellent fight scenes were an enjoyment to watch with the villains bringing the heat to keep you guessing. Overall, very entertaining and you can't ask for a better sequel.. maybe tone down to one liners, that is all."

","""The price of freedom is high... and it's a price I'm willing to pay! You told me not trust anyone and this is how it ends: EVERYTHING goes!"" – Captain America<br/><br/>Another Marvel Studios film has been released. This time it is starring the masked superhero with a huge shield and big muscles to go with it. You guessed it: Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>The story starts off with Captain America, played by Chris Evans, leading a team of SHIELD Agents to help get back their hijacked ships from Algiers pirates. They successfully get back the ship with butt- kicking action, but Steve Rogers aka Captain America gets suspicious when Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) or better called as The Black Widow does another mission of protecting SHIELD's data. Furious, Captain America starts to question the loyalty and honesty behind SHIELD industries to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). <br/><br/>Nick Fury, being a secretive badass, answers that SHIELD is just like any industry. They have missions to fulfill and no time to waste. All of which is to maintain the industry's target to protect families from future terrorists attacks. However, the rest of the film reveals that SHIELD is a dirty industry – the one that audience might not expect.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is fun superhero movie with very stylish effects. The movie package really highlights the heart-pumping action scenes. Not to mention, it's funny on right spots. <br/><br/>Audience without any comic background would be shocked at some of the surprising events. It will lead to many speculations on who really are the good guys and the bad guys, because anything is possible in Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>Although it can be referred that this effect is to get the audience interested, it does not successfully fulfill that target. <br/><br/>Somehow, it felt like watching a soap opera, as some events in Winter Soldier are similar to plots of soap operas. (Mainly because a dead character is revived and a friend turns out to be a backstabber, like what most soap operas show)<br/><br/>The actors involved are big stars of Hollywood (Chris Evans, Samual L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson). It pays off though, as they played very well in the film. Chris Evans played well as the ultimate American hero, and his charm makes up for any flaw that he has. Samual L. Jackson also did his part well. Although we don't see a lot of him, his role as Nick Fury was enjoyable. His part was exceptionally badass with some laughable parts.<br/><br/>However, Scarlett Johansson's role as Black Widow was excellent. She played a very powerful and intelligent character, all of which is packaged with her sexiness. It's her being very natural that made her a favorite among other actors.<br/><br/>For the most part, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is highly entertaining – a movie full of wit and packed with action. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of marvel comics and marvel films, it is highly recommended that you watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier. <br/><br/>However, if you are looking for something more than pure entertainment and fun, don't waste your time going to the cinemas. It just won't hit a memorable spot. 7/10"

","I applaud the Russo brothers and the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely on a job well done in this action thriller The action is riveting as are the quite scenes between the characters. There are Good humorous punches in this script also. The returning cast are great and expanding their roles from other movies, I am trying to be vague here as not to ruin the movie. Also there are some great additions to the cast as well. Anthony Mackie does a soaring job as the Falcon (pun intended), he has a very comfortable fit to the cast and no way feel forces in. Robert Redford is a very compelling character and presence on screen. The action scenes were fantastic when I saw the resume of the Russos's movies I was a little worried, now I think they might have to worry about being type cast as action movie directors. There are a few changes from the comic book story line but they are not distracting. The Winter Solider is a movie that greatly expands and shakes the foundation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Stay for the two end credit sequences. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it. If it's action you want. Go see the Captain."

","The great: Chris Evans performance. He does a great job and plays this type of roll very straight which works and saves the film in my opinion. Also Anthony Macky..Mackey? Was a shining spot in the film. Cannot say the same for Scarlet Johansen as Black Widow who is a bit annoying on screen spending most of the time practically winking at the camera and continuing her cartoonish Betty Boop ""aren't I sexy?"" eye/lip gimmick. Redford is serviceable too as is Sam L Jackson. <br/><br/>Also the action sequences and CGI are both very well done. This has entertaining stuff in it to be sure and is not boring, a lot better and moved along with energy more than the first.<br/><br/>The Bad: Pathetically predictable, not to mention that Hollywood studios show us half the movie in their ""teaser"" trailers nowadays. And...ahem, Dear Hollywood, can you think of anything else in a superhero movie than ending it with some type of count-down doomsday event mixed with multiple mcguffins? The film should have been smarter than this, but just like the Dark Knight series, it had to end with some death star count down with unexplained stakes that don't make much sense when thought over more than 5 seconds. And aren't we past the predictably evil villain who practically twirls their mustaches while explaining their evil plot to the good guy to give them time to get away? And Hollywood, seriously...are you still stuck in the mode of constantly bringing about WW2-era villains like the big bad Nazis? This was already the focus of the first film..we need it again? Heil Hydra? Are you f**king kidding me? And a computer controlling our intelligence community and secretly controlling all events on earth like it's a finely tuned ballet? Not even our incompetent CIA/NSA could accomplish that even if they wanted to. My point being, the film was ambitiously aiming high with the political thriller content, but it became a bit laughable when faced with a retro computer zombie Nazi explaining to us his evil plan that apparently 30% of Shield went along with for some reason...and I guess all other military agencies just kind of allow our capital to get blown to hell for hours before asking potshot Black Widow to explain the events to them..and the audience. <br/><br/>And lastly..the villains. Come on..a pro MMA fighter as a bad guy cameo? Why not cast Hulk Hogan. Just as silly. <br/><br/>And recycling 2 people we already know is bad enough but one of the ""super villains"" is just good at shooting guns, posing with guns, and strutting around like a cat while bad guys hand him guns? Is there really no fleshing out of this character from the comic books or any of these millionaire screenwriters pea brains?<br/><br/>And alas! Hollywood has only two modes with films: 1) Super serious/dark or 2)super campy/quip filled..PICK ONE! You can't take yourselves so damn seriously while having undeveloped laughable villains who take time to let good guys run away instead of shooting them in the face or who explain their intentions instead of shooting them in the face.<br/><br/>Anyways...frustratingly familiar but I admit I had a good time. A fun ride with some bright spots being the main cast and the direction/action. But Marvel needs to break the mold again and not fall into the trap of the cliché, cookie cutter formula action/superhero film that they think we expect or need as an audience paying out the nose for a ticket."

","if you like spy movies with political intrigue and massive conspiracy theories about secret organization corrupting our society from within while trying to destroy the world. then you'll love this movie. if you like actions films with high flying explosions, awesome hand to hand combat and gun fights galore. then you'll definitely like this movie. this movies is basically a spy conspiracy thriller wrapped in an action packed superhero burrito. this isn't a supernatural sci fi action film like Thor the dark world or Ironman...but its definitely something to watch. now ill be honest i didn't like Ironman 3, not so much because the movie was bad, but because the story essential killed ironman and ridiculed his arch nemesis the Mandarin. i would have liked the story for any other movie, but not that one. then came Thor: the dark world....awesome!!!love that movie and now with this second installment of Captain America...i don't even know what to expect out of the next Avengers movie. Joss Whedon has his work cut out for him. my only complaint is that i kept hearing it was supposed to be better than the Avengers and better then the Dark Knight, but honestly those two movies are part of the pantheon of not only the best comic book movies ever made , but some of the best movies ever made...period. in the case of this movie,even if its up there with the best comic book movie ever made, it's still not in that league, but i appreciate the ambition. honestly i thought Thor the dark world was better, but that is just my humble opinion. the villain of the story, the Winter Soldier, was essentially the antiCap...his same speed and strength but much colder in his execution. the fight scenes were great, and capt himself got a noticeable upgrade in fighting style for this movie...he embodied the captain America from the comic books. i hope we get to see more of the Winter Soldier and his story in the future because he is a very cool character. o yes and one more thing, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Dr. Strange...we are definitely getting them. enjoy the film"
"dcobbimdb","6","1","4","6 April 2014"," Just okay for me.
","I tried not to read much prior, although I saw the high rating and read a few reviews, so maybe my expectations were too high going in. I thought it was better than the first one although I didn't think much of the first one. My biggest complaint is they really could have done with some better editing and cut it down 10-15 minutes as it just dragged in spots. While I very much like character development, some of those scenes just went on a little too long, but more than that character development should slowly build and set the stage of things to come and get you hyped up like in Avengers, however I just didn't get that same feeling here at all. I kind of liked the whole conspiracy gig at first, but at the same time it was a bit of a re-hash as well once things finally came out.<br/><br/>The one thing I did really like is Cap was noticeably stronger in this one. Able to fall a long way down and land on solid ground, jump out of a plane from high up and land in the water with no chute, and able to take on a horde of people when seemingly outnumbered. So that was cool and I liked that they beefed him up quite a bit as he was little more than a pompous dork with a shield in Avengers. But my other gripe is I don't think he picked up a single weapon the entire movie. Yeah I get his shield can be an offensive weapon too, but I'm sorry when he's walking up to a horde of gunfire and his only defense is that shield, surely you would think a bullet or two might hit his legs, so that aspect of him only using his shield just kind of bugs me. Even in the first movie and Avengers he used guns to some extent, but not here that I can recall at all<br/><br/>Far as other characters, Scarlet / Black Widow being in the movie was pretty much a treat as she's just sexy as hell and you know she'll never get her own movie, so why not put her in as a side kick whenever possible. I liked how they were kind of building something between her and Cap but it just fell flat and didn't go anywhere. Fury also got more air time in this which was good. Far as the Falcon, I really don't know what to think. You get introduced to him early and like Cap know he's a veteran and righteous guy, then don't see much of him and then all of a sudden Cap and Widow crash his pad when they're desperate and then all of a sudden this guy who you know nothing about is stashing a futuristic pair of wings and seemingly a semi super hero as well? What the hell??? It's not that I disliked him but it's just as if he came out of obscurity. They tried to develop his character a little from the beginning but didn't really do a good job IMHO. So kind of a mixed bag there. I liked the winter soldier although he was the one guy I wished got more air time. I like how they developed him and who knows where we'll go from here with all that. Can't really say anymore on that.<br/><br/>To sum up, I saw it in IMAX 3D which is really the best possible viewing experience and overall I wasn't wowed over and left thinking it was just decent. I was bored through the first 20+ minutes, it started to get a little better. The whole conspiracy thing started off intriguing (intentionally leaving this vague here) but ultimately I just thought was kind of dumb upon the big reveal and one of those ""Okay, really"" moments rather than a ""whoa that was a cool twist!"" they were trying for. The final buildup and battle made for some decent action but was also very straight forward, unoriginal and telegraphed, so no big surprises there which would have been nice. I guess when you leave a movie and end up saying to the buddy you went with ""Well, the trailer for Spider man 2 looked awesome!"" that kind of sums it up. Overall I rate as a 6/10 (5 being an average movie)"

","This movie was way better than i expected. I expected another goofy Marvel movie. Another comedy, like Iron Man 3. I got the exact opposite. Even though there are jokes in the movie, they aren't abused like in IM3 and they're actually funny. They aren't throwing jokes at you in every single scene, you get a few jokes in the movie, but they are actually good! The movie is great, it's a movie in which it's probably impossible for anyone to get bored at, and Chris Evans does an excellent job as Cap.<br/><br/>I saw him more as Captain America in this movie than in any other. It was a shame we didn't get closure on the whole Winter Soldier thing, but i'm sure we'll get that in future movies.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a GREAT superhero movie and a GREAT action film.

","After the events in New York, Captain America is living quietly in Washington, and trying to adjust to the modern world. <br/><br/>But when S.H.I.E.L.D. comes under attack, he becomes embroiled in a web of deceit that threatens to put the world at risk. <br/><br/>Joining forces with Black Widow, Captain America struggles to expose the conspiracy whilst fighting off assassins sent to kill him at every turn. <br/><br/>When the full scope of the plot is revealed, Captain America and the Black Widow enlist the help of a new ally, the Falcon. But they soon find themselves up against a formidable enemy with the Winter Soldier.....<br/><br/>Out of all the Marvel franchises on the market at the moment, I thought CA was the weakest. The first movie was below average, and very boring for a superhero movie, so obviously I was very apprehensive about seeing a second installment, especially after the disaster that was Thor: The Dark World.<br/><br/>But, rest assured, this blew me right out of the water, and is easily the best standalone Marvel movie since Iron Man número uno.<br/><br/>Saying that though, Cap still is the weakest Hero from The Avengers, and that's all because he's a traditional all American hero, and he's just too nice. Stark has his wit and arrogance, Thor has his beef with Loki, and Hulk is just an angry little monkey.<br/><br/>It's the support here that really elevates the film. And the strongest part of the film is Redford, harking back to the conspiracy movies that made him so famous back in the seventies, like 3 days of the Condor, and All the Presidents Men. <br/><br/>The plot point with H.Y.D.R.A to, in theory, protect the world, is wonderful, and maybe some of most intelligent narrative in a superhero movie yet.<br/><br/>Ironically though, the titular adversary, is sidelined, and nothing really is delved into his being, apart from Redford erasing his memory, Cap recognising him, and an electric Toby Jones giving us some Basil Exposition.<br/><br/>Other than that though, its wonderful stuff. The set pieces easily equal The Avengers, and Jackson has never played Fury better. <br/><br/>Twenty years ago, this would have been one of those movies that would've been the big release of the year.<br/><br/>With great references to Pulp Fiction, War Games, and a touching tribute to Paul Newman, Cap 2 easily usurps its predecessor, and for once challenges the brain a little."

"WaltWiz","7","1","5","8 September 2014"," The first movie should have been like this
","When I first saw the trailer, I thought the movie was going to suck even more than its predecessor. Well, I'm glad to say I was wrong, this one is actually pretty decent. It follows the Cap's adventures in the present day, where/when he finds himself on the run from SHIELD, which turns out to have been infiltrated by his old enemy, Hydra. This is a nice twist, and doubly so because this time Hydra is actually efficient for a change. They take over the very organization that was founded to counter threats like them, they have a solid plan for world domination, and Captain America actually has to break a sweat to bring them down. He is assisted by the Black Widow, but she mostly plays the part of the token woman, along with the token black guy, although she has her moments. The titular Winter Soldier feels tacked on; he turns out to be the Cap's old buddy, but, since he lacks his memory, or any personality to speak of, the revelation feels pointless. Essentially, he is a badass with a metal arm who acts as Hydra's unthinking enforcer, so his background is completely irrelevant and only serves as a distraction. Fortunately, this aspect of the story doesn't take up too much screen time. Most of that is taken up by action and good old butt-kicking, which is what a movie like this is supposed to be about, although one can't help thinking, ""Where was Iron Man during all this?"" There are also unobtrusive references to classics like Star Wars and Pulp Fiction that I enjoyed. I recommend this movie."

","This time, Captain has changed his personality from a boring soldier back in the 90's to a real hero in this modern era with clear mission and vision, not only to S.H.I.E.L.D but to all the people. Unlike the siblings Thor and Loki, Captain Americaï»¿ and the Winter Soldier have their own unique story as well as performance that appears to be balanced out rather than overshadowing each others. Although the film itself led by a bad profile director, thanks to the smart, darker with several minor twisted political plot, this has successfully converted the brand into a more mature franchise. While the development of the story might seems to follow the style of The Dark Knight's trilogy, great cinematography without any drags, beautiful old classic actions art most of the time with bare hands between the heroes and a more serious tone of scores by Henry Jackman would certainly entertain all the audiences, of course not to forget on Black Widow. It seems that Marvel has the guts and confidence against DC when Captain returns in 2016."

"shawneofthedead","7","1","6","29 March 2014"," A fine, bold entry in the Marvel canon, if not an entirely successful one.
","There's no denying that Marvel Studios is - by most industry standards - almost ridiculously brave. Its president, Kevin Feige, has given the green light to any number of projects, decisions and personnel that would make most studio executives faint from horror. He trusted, for instance, out-of-left-field directors like Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon and Kenneth Branagh to helm his studio's riskiest and most expensive projects. And here comes Captain America: The Winter Soldier - one of the bravest decisions of them all, if not an entirely successful one.<br/><br/>After fending off the Chitauri invasion of New York, Steve Rogers (Evans) again tries to settle down to life in a country - and century - he no longer knows. The young man with the old-school values starts working for Nick Fury (Jackson) in S.H.I.E.L.D., an agency meant to protect ordinary people from external threats, but finds himself asking a lot of worrying questions about the way things are being done. ""You're holding a gun to everyone on Earth,"" he frets manfully at Fury, ""and calling it protection.""<br/><br/>When it becomes clear that the methods and machines of S.H.I.E.L.D. have been badly compromised, Steve teams up with the two people he's decided he can trust - results-oriented Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) a.k.a. Black Widow and war vet Sam Wilson (Mackie) a.k.a. The Falcon - to get to the bottom of a nefarious conspiracy that threatens to destroy Earth as he has come to know it. Oh, and he's also being chased by another genetically-engineered super-soldier: the titular Winter Soldier, who might possess a secret or two of his own.<br/><br/>There's an enormous amount to love about Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It is, truthfully, the boldest entry in Marvel's canon yet, and not simply because it dares to bring superheroes into the gritty, twisty world of spy thrillers. That, by the way, is a great touch, particularly in a really quite spectacular car chase through the streets of Washington D.C., one that culminates in a literally heart-stopping encounter in Steve's shadow-lit apartment.<br/><br/>What the film really dares to do is shake up the mythos of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe to date. Across several films now, Nick Fury has emerged as the sardonic but unquestionable defender of what's good in the world. It's somehow fitting that the most red-blue-and-white of superheroes should be the one who uncovers all the shades of grey. It's a storyline that upsets the comfortable narrative of S.H.I.E.L.D. and its enforcers to date but also disrupts the way ahead (including, intriguingly enough, for Marvel's companion television series, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.).<br/><br/>Directors Anthony and Joe Russo - best known for their work on cult TV sitcom Community - demonstrate a great flair for character development. This is a talky and occasionally silly picture, its plot getting more outlandish as it unravels, but the Russos make up for the occasional deficits in logic with a lot of heart and depth. Steve's attempts to battle his survivor guilt allow him to connect with both Natasha and Sam, and there are some quietly effective moments when it becomes evident how much Natasha has come to care for Fury. Steve also gets the chance to re-connect with a couple of familiar faces from his long- buried past, which allows him to come somewhat painfully to terms with his strange, new-found life.<br/><br/>The film fares less well in terms of its unwieldy script, which marshals its unlikely elements together quite effectively but is - at the end of the day - formulaic and a tough sell. The big conspiracy lying at the broken heart of S.H.I.E.L.D. manages to be both predictable and ridiculous. It's a narrative twist that feels a few decades too old, like Captain Rogers himself: a relic of a certain type of Cold War thriller on which this film is clearly modelled (think All The President's Men), rather than an idea that better captures the nebulous shifts of the world's current political climate.<br/><br/>The film also frequently begs the question - more so than Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World did - 'Where the heck are the rest of the Avengers?' It beggars belief that only Steve and Natasha are reacting to the events of this film, which are catastrophic and earth-shaking enough to suggest that their old team-mates should really have popped in at some point. <br/><br/>The cast goes a long way towards making up for the hokier parts of the script. On paper, Steve is a rather one-note good guy, fighting for old- fashioned ideals in an unrecognisably debauched world. But Evans gives him heart and creates a huge amount of sympathy for the shield-wielding Captain America, particularly in a surprisingly emotional last-act confrontation with the Winter Soldier. This film also gives both Johansson and Jackson more to do than in any other Marvel movie to date, and they're both so electrifying that you'll continue to wonder why they haven't yet received their own flagship movies.<br/><br/>The decision to cast Robert Redford - still hopelessly debonair at 77 years of age - as Alexander Pierce, Fury's commanding officer and confidant, is a canny one. It's a nice callback to the 1970s thrillers that made Redford's name and no doubt inspired the grit and feel of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Redford delights in the role, and helps make it appear more complex than it really is.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, Captain America: The Winter Soldier can leave a little something to be desired when taken on its own merits. Frequently, its grand ambitions outstrip the logic and power of its script. As an extension of what has become the world's biggest franchise of blockbuster films, however, it's an unmitigated success. It's brainy, dark, and boldly rips apart the entire underlying narrative of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In that sense, at least, there's no doubt that this is one of the finest blockbusters you'll see this year."

","Well it was good but the movie didn't need to take this long"
"Lost_In_Translation_","10","1","7","17 April 2019"," Still the best Marvel movie made, ""The Dark Knight"" of Marvel
","I hadn't seen this movie in a while, probably since Civil War came out and I forgot how amazing this movie. The Russo brothers crafted a tight script and made one of the best spy-thrillers probably since Casino Royale or the good Bourne movies.<br/><br/>This has everything you could ever want from a Marvel movie. Superb action, so well choreographed and fully realized. The story is dripping with mystery and feels exactly like a spy drama, but with the added Marvel flair for action. It vastly improves on Black Widow's character as she wasn't fully realized yet in IM3 or Avengers, but also add a Falcon that is realistic and not in red & white spandex.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this one is stellar and easily the best in the MCU. It just feels so different from any of the others. It matches the spy drama with cool blues and greys. This is probably the only MCU movie of them all that I could see being in my top 10 movies of all time. For the most part I enjoy them all. Some more than others, some are just pure entertainment and fun to enjoy, but The Winter Soldier is something above that and on whole new level.<br/><br/>It'd probably be overkill to compare this as ""The Dark Knight"" of the MCU, but it's pretty damn close. It's almost TDK with CGI action and over the top set pieces, rather than the stellar practical effects and solid action sequences. It's like a more comic-esque version of TDK.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie just feels so goddamn great. I like it a little better than Civil War overall, but this and Civil War are pretty much the perfect Marvel movies. Civil War expands on The Winter Soldier and incorporates Bucky into the story so well that even comic diehards probably don't care that it doesn't follow the comic book story. The Russo's have made the best three Marvel movie in the MCU and it's gonna be hard for anyone to top them. Here's hoping Endgame continues their perfect streak in the MCU."

","Ya know special effects will only take a movie so far...... That is what this film struggles with in my opinion. This sequel to captain America had entertaining action sequences, but whenever somebody wasn't getting shot or cars weren't flipping, the movie was pretty boring. I just didn't have a good rims with this film like i thought I was going to. I thought the movie kinda drug along in places, and I spent a good portion of the film being bored. I know this movie was pretty darn successful as far as critic and audience reviews go, but I just wasn't that impressed by it. Also, the script and dialogue really was not that great at all, pretty dull If you ask me. I will say that Chris Evans did do a good job, as he did in the first film. I didn't really like Samuel L. Jackson in this movie, I didn't think his performance was up to par. Scarlett Johanson did well with her source material. Overall I think a 4/10 is fair."
"dralla-1","10","1","7","27 March 2014"," Great Movie with a little fly in the ointment
","Amazing Twists, big story. You heard the audience go ""Oooh!"" on some scenes that you never saw coming. It is a big movie. Still it didn't feel as great as watching Iron Man I or the Avengers. And I wondered why. I think the difference is in the lead actor. Although Scareltt Johansson has a big part in the movie and is fantastic in it, Chris Evans is just not that good. He has a great body. He does a decent Job. Maybe he doesn't understand the essence of what makes Captain America a great man. But he just isn't as good as RDJ. Maybe you'd argue that nobody is. But I think that Marvel should try to cast great actors first. Not just a good actor with a spectacular body, but the other way around. We have seen that great actors are willing to transform themselves into Greek gods, but it is much harder to get a decent performer with a great body become a charismatic actor. Anyway it is a great Popcorn movie. It is highly entertaining. This is not the best Marvel movie but you should watch it, just don't expect to be completely amazed."
"monstermadness25","1","1","8","10 May 2014"," The second best entry to the MCU behind Iron Man
","The Winter Soldier is a very well thought out sequel in which it escalates from its predecessor and improves very way. Captain America is a likable protagonist and Chris Evans does really well in the role in which he questions his own morales and Shield's actions. The film is a unique type of superhero film as it feels more like a political action thriller which allows the film to explore and question real world ideals which makes the film compelling and valuable. This separates the film from other superhero film as this film actually considers actions and consequences. Also Black Widow is at her hottest in this film as she looks STUNNING and gorgeous in every scene, making the film worth watching on her looks alone. She steals the show through her tough approach and sex appeal which simply gives the film its cutting edge. Cap 2 is a worthwhile film and it reminds us of what great sequels should be, much like X2 and The Dark Knight and so in conclusion only Iron Man betters this in the MCU, but only by a fraction."

","At minute 13:00 in the movie, Captain America, the character, and Captain America, the movie, do something that is unforgivably awful. They fail to neutralize a hostile. I am not an expert in warfare, nor do I play one on TV, but the one absolute that must always, always, always happen in a combat situation is that you completely neutralize your target--you make it ineffective. So many movies and TV shows transgress this obvious rule that for media the rule should usually be the opposite--leave hostile forces hanging around, fully capable of wreaking mayhem.<br/><br/>But just because it's transgressed in media doesn't make the tactic forgivable much less laudable when it's done. It just speaks of poor writing. If the character needs to escape, write it in the script that he/she escaped some other way. Don't spend ten minutes showing how tactically advanced your troops are, just to have them idiotically leave a hostile ready to catch the troops unaware. That makes it look like they have stupid soldiers despite years and millions of dollars of training and advanced weaponry.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, Captain America, the self-righteous, just after the 13:00 minute mark, goes on to tell Black Widow that she has jeopardized the mission despite his blunder that will, within a matter of seconds, almost cost both of them their lives.<br/><br/>At the moment, I can no more rate the entire movie than predict the end of the world because I haven't seen it. I have watched up to 13:23 because I had to get up in disgust and walk away from it. I have given it a neutral 5 because I suppose it will redeem itself somewhat later.<br/><br/>One possibility that the writers are really trying to say is that Captain America, the character is stupid, that he's an arrogant moron, a big fat loser, a washed-up has-been blow-hard. If that is the case, and I'm not betting that it is at this point, then kudos to the writers for nailing him to the wall. It's a effective way to make him look stupid and arrogant. It certainly works with the character Tony Stark in Iron Man. The character's hubris and flaws are served up for him to be knocked down and humiliated. Maybe Captain America needs it as well. I'll find out. If I can convince myself to keep watching."

This film is masterful in how it vastly improves the characterizations of Steve Rogers, Black Widow, Nick Fury, and other characters. It also introduces some truly terrifying villains, excellent twists, great character moments, and witty, smart dialogue. The fight choreography also remains the finest in any Marvel film with one duel that rivals films like Ip Man and the Raid 2. And I stand by that opinion. I really want to gush about how much it made me love the Winter Soldier and become an even bigger fan of Black Widow, but you can see that for yourself. I will close this review off by saying that this film's grounded story does it huge favors as it explores topical subjects of politics and freedom, relevant to our political climate.

It's compared with James Bond and Mission Impossible, two franchises I never cared about, and makes me want to watch them.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it's perfect because they shouldn't have made Hydra that important of a part. They should've owned the fact that America is as dangerous as other countries for them to have that developed weapon. Not just because ""we might get infiltrated by bad people, but we are good"", but because America it is dangerous, period.<br/><br/>That fact muddles the message that Captain America learns (don't follow institutions, even Americans ones) and puts the blame exclusively ""on the dangerous others"", but still, Steve Rogers' arc keeps developing in coherent ways (something can't be said for all the others)."

","Thawed-out war hero Steve Rogers (Evans) is ever more uneasy about his affiliation with deep-spy network S.H.I.E.L.D.. And when the organisation turns on him, he uncovers a horrifying conspiracy.
There is something pleasingly, and no doubt deliberately, ironic in Marvel Studios' flag-wearing hero fronting its most subversive movie yet. Not that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus are being subtle about it. ""You're holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection,"" Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) tells Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) early on. During the very same dialogue he says, ""I thought the punishment usually came after the crime,"" and - just in case we hadn't got the point - ""This isn't freedom, this is fear."" Even so, what we have here is the key to Captain America's real appeal, the answer to any criticism that he's just a stiff-necked, steroidal boy scout. As a 95 year-old thirtysomething with an early-'40s value set in War-On-Terror America, he is less the USA's poster boy than its most steadfast foil. Something co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo (Welcome To Collinwood) clearly relish getting their indie-cred teeth into on a blockbuster scale.<br/><br/>Post-Chitauri invasion, Rogers is a useful asset for shady superspy network S.H.I.E.L.D., but also a pain in the ass. During a great opening set-piece in which Rogers, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and a squad of S.H.I.E.L.D. goons take out a crew of French/Algerian pirates, our blond hero complains of being forced to play ""Fury's caretaker"". This is not what he signed up for. This is not what America should be doing. History has seen the nation gradually diminished from world's saviour, to world's policeman, to a ""caretaker"" over the course of decades. For Rogers the moral decline appears instantaneous, and it rankles intensely. There are then indirect tributes to Edward Snowden's whistleblowing and shades of the NSA privacy-invasion scandal. Pretty bold stuff to be sneaking under the canvas of this primary-coloured marquee.<br/><br/>It's uncertain how much any of it will land with the film's young, core audience, although this does feel like Marvel's most 'mature' picture yet, an admirable risk to take. It is certainly the studio's most talky and plotty, and the big wink that is the casting of Robert Redford (who, by the way, would have been ideal Cap casting in the '70s) as S.H.I.E.L.D. suit Alexander Pierce suggests 1975's Three Days Of The Condor as its most obvious inspiration. The Manchurian Candidate (1962) is in there too, for sure. But, as Rogers' journey manhandles him out into the cold and makes him a hoodie-wearing renegade advised to ""trust nobody"" and targeted by a similarly empowered super-agent (the titular Winter Soldier), the influence of the Bourne trilogy weighs down, too - the Russos even going so far as to steal a famous Bourne shot directly towards the film's end.<br/><br/>The action and violence are the most grounded we've seen in a Marvel film. The First Avenger, with its steampunk-laser weirdness and numbing, never-ending montages, felt dull and insulated. Iron Man, Thor and Hulk all dodge (or brush off) bullets via their self-evident fantastical/sci-fi trimmings. But, apart from the fact that he lobs a big metal Frisbee around and has been artificially pumped to the very peak of attainable physical fitness, the Captain is operating on the same plane as Jason Bourne, Jack Ryan and James Bond. He even throws a knife at someone.<br/><br/>Evans has settled comfortably into the title role, and bolsters its appeal with a precise charm, never letting you forget that the heart of a regular and sincere wimp beats beneath that rock-sculpted chest. He spends much of the film working up a will-they-could-they? partnership with Johansson's still-sparky Black Widow, who enjoys her greatest chunk of Marvel screen time yet. It's an engaging double act. And when he isn't ticking off Fury, running righteous rings around the cycloptic boss' persistent, end-justifies-means ambivalence, he's fostering a whole new buddyship with Anthony Mackie's likable veteran support-group organiser Sam Wilson.<br/><br/>And then the wings pop out. Wilson, after all, is also The Falcon. Not just any ex-forces guy, but someone with secret impossi-tech that enables him to flap about like a supersonic swift. To chide this development as silly in a comic-book movie may be like spitting out a jellybean for tasting of chemicals, but even so, after the Russos' first-rate work setting up a smart, Washington, D.C.-based conspiracy thriller, it feels like a backstep into formula. And The Falcon does look naff: Three Days Of The Condor giving way to Condorman.<br/><br/>Inexorably, the whole enterprise drifts into business as usual. The more the story refers back to the first Captain America film, the less interesting it becomes - its subversiveness becomes subverted. The twists are easy to figure, and certain reveals are just stamp-your-foot hoary. Plus, given the constant reminders that this is just one adventure within the greater Marvelverse, you can't help but be distracted by one, nagging question: wouldn't Tony Stark have something to say about all this? Especially when those huge, deadly S.H.I.E.L.D. machines - now propelled by his technology - launch into the sky.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, The Winter Soldier is the third of the last four Marvel movies to take its final-act set-piece into American airspace and feature a lot of shiny CG things whizzing around amid orange-blossom detonations. In Avengers Assemble it was exhilarating. In Iron Man 3 it was acceptable. Now it's a case of, ""This again? Really guys?"" There's also an earlier action gag, in which the Captain single-handedly takes down an aircraft on a bridge, that is almost a beat-for-beat repeat of Heimdall's dark-elf ship takedown on the Bifrost in Thor: The Dark World - and it, too, feels like a last-minute, studio-led insertion.<br/><br/>None of this is ruinous, though. The Winter Soldier does go out on an intriguing note, which should have big repercussions on future Earthbound Marvel stories. Captain America is an interesting character, arguably the most interesting of the Avengers, the one with the greatest thematic scope. And that can only bode well for his next solo, hopefully Helicarrier-free,
It may climax with an overly formulaic splurge, but The Winter There is something pleasingly, and no doubt deliberately, ironic in Marvel Studios' flag-wearing hero fronting its most subversive movie yet. Not that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus are being subtle about it.

"meeshoffmanns","9","0","2","9 March 2019"," A Thrilling and Surprisingly Complex Movie, with the Best Action Marvel has ever put to Screen!
","This was one of the movies that actually started my love for the medium as a whole: back in 2014, it was the most thrilling cinema experience I had thus far, and it still stands as one, if not the best action movies I have ever seen. Marvel can be truly proud of this!<br/><br/>Acting:
Chris Evans in his third outing of Cap is perhaps his most subtle and mature performance yet. He plays the part of a disillusioned, somewhat broken yet optimistic and kind warrior, and he does it brilliantly. It is by no means award-worthy, but it shows how much Evans has grown as an actor the last few years.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson plays a very different Black Widow since Avengers and Iron Man 2, and goes for a more playful and sexy personality, while still maintaining the badassery and cold-blooded killer attitude that she was introduced with. It is very effective, and she gets a vulnerability that is fresh and interesting. She plays really well opposite Chris, and I would've liked to see this performance a bit more in sequels.<br/><br/>Sam L. Jackson is back as Nick Fury, and while his role has always been fairly simple as the brooding and stoic super-spy, he gets a lot more character and personality here that I really dig. In addition, he is getting his own action sequences to carry as well, equally impressive. Samuel is never doing a bad job of course, and I give him high praise everytime.<br/><br/>Sebastian Stan:
Going into SPOILER territory here:<br/><br/>Sebastian is the Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>For a guy who hasn't had much big films on his resume yet, Stan does a terrific job as the silent and deadly, yet broken, Winter Soldier. He had to do a lot of physical demanding stuff in here as, well as show some heavy and subtle emotion, and he pulls it all off.<br/><br/>Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce is clearly one of the lesser characters. Redford is a veteran, actor and gives a realistic and strong performance as the layered bureaucrat. The character however, isn't that interesting in the end, and can quickly be forgotten.<br/><br/>Anthony Mackie as Falcon is a nice addition to the MCU as the grounded soldier guy who has a good heart and a strong sense of duty and loyalty like Steve Rogers. The two play well against each other, and Mackie delivers in both the calm subtle scenes and the tense action sequences. Can't wait to see more of him.<br/><br/>Emily Vancamp and Frank Grillo are compelling side characters as Sharon Carter and Brock Rumlow, the first one being a kind and realistic love-interest/badass, and the second one being a likable and also brutal brawler. Both actors are giving grounded and well-acted performances.<br/><br/>Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill is also a bit of a surprise, given the fact that her role is quite small. She still pulls off a compelling and subtle performance that adds a lot to the small character that Smulders plays.<br/><br/>Direction:
For merely having directed ""Office"" episodes, it is astonishing how well the Russo brothers have handled the transition to big action blockbuster, their first big movie being the best of the whole MCU. They handle pretty much every aspect of it as if they have done it for years, ranging from subtle emotional scenes to cgi-heavy brutal action scenes and comedic stuff. This is a golden pick from Feige if there ever was one.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
While the MCU movies have been critisized for their lack of compelling camerawork, i think that ""grey"" style fits this movie really well. Trent Opaloch utilizes a surprising amount of interesting camera positions and lets certain shots linger just long enough to speak to you from an emotional level. That is quality shooting. The action sequences are pretty much perfect in terms of camerawork, with exactly the right balance of shaky-cam and quick cutting.<br/><br/>Plot:
This is not your typical superhero movie, and perhaps that is what makes it work so well. It is a political spy thriller, with a superhero touch. Its themes are surprisingly relevant, and full of character and subtle emotional touches that still make heavy impact. The pacing is just right, and there is a great balance between EPIC action and story progression with character development.<br/><br/>Music:
Again a great surprise from Marvel, who have again been critisized for their forgettable scores. Henry Jackman delivers a thrilling and exhilarating score, while at the same time leaving room for the emotional calm tunes that are necessary. Not everything is as memorable or fun to listen to, but it is really impressive work.<br/><br/>Editing:
The style in which this movie is cut together, is surprisingly subtle and effective for a blockbuster movie. You feel the impact of each transition to a different segment of the story, and the action is just well enough cut together that you can still tell what's happening while at the same time experiencing a break-neck pace.<br/><br/>Production Design:
Nothing really interesting to mention here: mostly offices and modern buildings, with a slick and clean style, but not really elaborate. The same goes for costumes and make-up: efficiency over style. Maybe that's exactly what they where going for, and it works for the most part.<br/><br/>Sound:
High-quality work here, ranging from startling gun shots and heavy explosions, to screeching cartires and crashing vehicles. Some of the best sound Marvel has given us since Iron Man.<br/><br/>VFX:
This movie got an Academy Award nomination for this, and I can see why. Not since Avengers has there been such a great blend between the real environment and digital, particulary in the action sequences.<br/><br/>Tone:
Until Infinity War, I would call this the darkest movie the MCU has brought out. Perhaps because it is so realistic at the same time. There is a lot of humanity to be found in here, and it ends in a way that may even leave a few tears. There is still room for comedy however, and that works equally great because of the pitch-perfect cast. The action sequences are staged in a way that adds a LOT of adrenalin to it, and when they eventually finish, you are still feeling the weight of every epic thing that you just witnessed.<br/><br/>Overall Concensus:
This is my favorite MCU movie, even next to Infinity War and Black Panther. Aside from feeling like a comic-book movie with a bit of goofiness, it does pretty much everything right or achieves what it wants to go for. Not to mention that it is absolutely spectacular in terms of entertainment value. 9.0/10"
"Nighthawk97","10","0","2","8 March 2019"," The very best film in the MCU
","What makes this film stand out from every single other one in the franchise is it's commitment to telling a fleshed out spy-thriller story that just happens to star Captain America.<br/><br/>The action sequences really pack the thrills and highlights include great chase sequences, an excellently done infiltration sequence, and several fist fights that leave you wanting more. Some of them lean a bit too hard on shaky cam and quick editing, but the choreography and intent is absolutely there.<br/><br/>To be honest, I actually skipped this one in theaters due to how middle of the road the first Captain America was, but was so pleasantly surprised when I decided to give this one a shot at a rental many years later. I of course bought the Blu Ray as well, as I felt compelled to own it.<br/><br/>I'm also a huge fan of Civil War, but I think this one edges it out in being the best film in the MCU because of that fact that it works perfectly fine in a vacuum. Civil War is pretty much a mini Avengers that is a culmination of all the preceding films before it. This one can pretty much stand on it's own and doesn't lean as heavily as Civil War does in the spectacle of the heroes powers."

","Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is struggling to adapt to life in the modern world after being suspended in a coma for a number of years. However, he is forced to put his objections aside when director of SHIELD Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is shot down by an unknown assassin. After some digging, Rogers learns that there is a much bigger conspiracy involving Fury being gunned down and sets to work to get to the bottom of said conspiracy...<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier overall is a decent enough film (certainly in the second half), but sadly the same problems that plagued the original film seem to plague this film and the main problem being;<br/><br/>PACING; the first 10-15 minutes or so are great; some fast paced action and a basic set-up to the story, but then things kind of grind to a halt. Some of the scenes in the first half of the picture revolving around Captain America seemed a little too self-congratulatory and don't serve as much purpose as the running time suggests (there is some purpose to some of what we witness which becomes apparent as things manifest later in the film, but personally I felt that proceedings dragged on more than they needed to).<br/><br/>Having said that when the main story does develop it is actually pretty good and is more expansive and deeper than the story that we witnessed in the original film. Once you're hooked it's pretty involving and I did like the way that director Anthony Russo retained the light-hearted approach that Joe Johnston applied to the original film. The humorous exchanges and light touches within the film made it palatable and digestible which did serve the film well over its rather generous 120 minute plus running time.<br/><br/>The acting from the principal cast is mostly good with Evans really getting into the skin of his character; it was more difficult for him to achieve this effect in this first film (for obvious reasons), but he does a solid job here. Anthony Mackie is also excellent and offers strong support. Scarlett Johansson is also very good and I think I may have finally fallen in love with her voice; she could read me my miranda rights and I would still take notice and that's not even acknowledging that she looks hot as hell here. If we're talking about acting then Samuel L Jackson does OK, but this particular role is not really stretching him, but what does let this film down slightly is Robert Redford whose inclusion in the film seems a little too obvious and I would suspect that most people would be able to see who is and what he's about more or less straight away.<br/><br/>Overall, Captain America: Winter Soldier does work as the plot is richer and more deeper than the first film, but it does suffer from the same pacing problems as the first film with one cast member who is too obvious as highlighted in the above paragraph. However, in summary, like the first film this is worth watching, but also like the first film it isn't quite the spectacular blockbuster that it thinks it is."

"bowmanblue","8","0","2","7 September 2018"," If only 'The Dark World' was like this
","I don't know why some people didn't really go much for the first 'Captain America' film. Yes, I know it was a success, but it's never really talked about as one of the MCU's vest offerings. Maybe it was because it wasn't set in the present and therefore somehow felt less relevant to some cinema-goers? Anyway, I liked it. But, for those who wanted to see our (now UNfrozen) 'First Avenger' getting to grips with the modern world, they really got what they were looking for here.<br/><br/>I think the best way to describe the 'Captain America' sequel is by calling it a 'Jason Bourne film with superheroes.' If you're familiar with the 'Bourne' franchise then you'll know the titular character is a spy who uncovers some disturbing truths in his own intelligence organisation and has to go on the run, pursued by rogue agents who were once on his side. This is basically the plot to 'The Winter Solider.' It may not be completely original, but it is damn good fun.<br/><br/>There's all the action and chase scenes you'd expect from a spy thriller, plus it's naturally 'beefed up' as many of the protagonists have a multitude of special powers to give the action an added boost. Plus, because it's all set in our modern surroundings (no need for a 'Ragnarok-style' alien planet to be created here) the computer effects required aren't too overbearing and noticeable.<br/><br/>I guess the best thing about 'Part 2' is that it has more 'character development' that your average superhero movie. We last saw 'Cap' in his 1940s world, so there's plenty of time for the story to show us how a man from the past deals with present day, not to mention the fact that he was once used to fighting for an 'honourable' power system whereas now the lines of good and evil can sometimes get a little blurred, even on our own side.<br/><br/>If the film has a flaw then it kind of falls into that oh-so familiar trap than many Marvel films do (or at least the ones not featuring Loki) and that's the fact that the villain is a little underused. I guess you could say that 'The Winter Soldier' has two villains - one you'll probably forget completely and the other is the titular 'Winter Soldier' himself. The problem is that he just pops up here and there to cause a bit of bother for Cap and then we don't see him again for a while until the next action scene is upon us. There's also a bit of an over-used plot device in which characters 'die' only for us to find out that they're not really dead later. I won't say who or how many as that runs into 'spoiler' territory.<br/><br/>But, don't let those minor gripes detract from what is one hell of a fun ride. It really does cover more than a few genres, i.e. superhero, action, spy, chase, thriller and does them all justice here. There's pretty much something for everyone here and Marvel show that not all second instalments have to be a 'Dark World' (that's a 'Thor' joke, that is!)."

","Imagining awakening up after about 70 years of being ice cold.

He also finds out that the Winter Soldier is more than just an assassin.<br/><br/>Let me just say this: Spider-Man is my favorite hero, while Batman has produced the best superhero of all time (The Dark Knight). But, when it comes to the MCU, my favorite hero is Captain America. In this film, not only does he fight for what's good for America, but that also includes going against government officials whose morals have gone out the window. If the American government is corrupt, he will go against it. Captain America is a hero that we need in this time of government turbulence.<br/><br/>As for the actors, well they all play their parts well. Steve Rogers practically IS Captain America, and he conveys the confusion and the morality of Captain America well. Scarlett Johansson is at her MCU best in this film; she is the one who stays by Captain America throughout this whole process. Academy Award Nominee Samuel L. Jackson is his Samuel L. Jackson self in this film, which is always a good thing. But this time we get a couple of newcomers. Anthony Mackie is awesome as Falcon, as he gets a few pretty sweet moments himself. And the great Academy Award Winner Robert Redford always does a great job with whatever role he is presented with.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film! Go and watch it!"

","4 out of 5 stars (one of the best in its series)<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a prime example of how to do a sequel right. It builds on everything that was good about its predecessor while still being a solid standalone movie. I also applaud the inclusion of pointed political commentary that actually feels like it was researched and understood by the screenwriters before it was placed in the story. But explosion junkies have no fear: all of that weighty material is perfectly balanced out by good old fashioned action that services the narrative and almost never overstays its welcome.<br/><br/>We follow Steve Rodgers/Captain America (A dryly charismatic Chris Evans) as he is adjusting to modern life after being defrosted by the military. Working with Natasha (Scarlett Johannson) as a field agent for secret government organization SHIELD, Steve doesn't exactly trust that the men upstairs are honest about their work, a suspicion proven when someone puts a hit on SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Worse still, high-ranking senator Alex Pierce (Robert Redford) believes Steve was involved, causing him and Natasha to go into hiding and eventually encounter someone from Steve's past who will complicate the mission even further.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier holds up better than most other comic book films. It's a political thriller and character piece before an action extravaganza, and that increases its appeal beyond comic junkies. It also humanizes Steve Rogers and handles its plot quite smoothly. This is the kind of movie that knows how to serve up awesome battle sequences and character drama in equal measure. Action fans will be more than satisfied, and people like me who enjoy actual stories should be entertained too. See it.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Violence, Action, and Gunplay Throughout"

Iron Man is mentioned, but it seems the rest of the Avengers are on vacation during the struggle for humanity.<br/><br/>This film has a decent plot (i.e. fitting bad guys for good guys) with a good mix of action and drama. It even has some light moments such as when our twosome are among some old computers and Black Widow does her 1983 ""WarGames"" voice and proclaims, ""Shall we play a game?""

","THE WINTER SOLDIER is a far superior sequel to the original Captain America: unlike the first film, this doesn't descend into a CGI mess in the second half, and instead remains tight and compelling right up to and throughout the climax. This one has a retro, '70s political thriller-type feel going on, with Chris Evans cast as a friendless figure out of his time and out of his depth, at the mercy of sinister and unknown forces.<br/><br/>It's a decent film too, one never less than entertaining, and the second-best Marvel film I've seen, right behind AVENGERS ASSEMBLE (which had the huge budget and scale as a result). The fast-paced narrative includes all manner of martial arts-based fight scenes which, although reliant on CGI, are still exciting to watch. The elevator sequence is a real highlight and expertly staged. The effects are generally above average and the humour and camaraderie that these films are known for are both present. Scarlett Johansson shines here and Samuel L. Jackson gets more depth than usual, while Robert Redford is fun in a stock role. I wouldn't call THE WINTER SOLDIER a masterpiece, but it certainly does the job well enough and never disappoints."

","The Winter Soldier is such an improvement over The First Avenger you'd find it hard to believe that they're part of the same series; don't get me wrong: The First Avenger was entertaining, but I thought it was more pedestrian than this film. The Winter Soldier is like putting Captain America into a James Bond film and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. has been a more immediate threat than we thought. Marvel does use a lot of the tropes of typical superhero cinema: cameos galore, references in-universe, and sequel-building; the difference being that the events feel more immediate to what's currently happening. The Winter Soldier stands out from The Avengers crowd, pretty well I might add.<br/><br/>Captain America has gone up in the world since being in one of the 90's worst movies ever made (Captain America|1991): The First Avenger redeemed that partially, and The Winter Soldier effectively gave the character a complete turnaround and he's kept driving straight since. Of course I'm writing this after Captain America: Civil War came out and I can say that THAT film is the strongest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe thus far, but The Winter Soldier is still a personal favourite of mine. Steve Rogers is a freedom fighter in this film, and it does seem that Chris Markus and Steve McFreely wrote the script celebrating Edward Snowden's leaking of the NSA's global surveillance scheme. The Winter Soldier does play out like a regular superhero film, but it has more underlying themes than usual 'lets-bash-the-baddie-real-good' stuff, and Captain America wants to save the world from the control of totalitarian-hungry tyrants.<br/><br/>On the surface Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a comic book movie full of stereotypical traits of superhero movies: underneath it actually breaks down what the character stands for, just like The Dark Knight did with Batman; we get the heroes we deserve but not the ones we need. We need to go through hardships to get the heroes we deserve, and Captain America is a character respecting this struggle."

Rogers has great comedic timing as he tries to understand how technology works and amazed by the new fashion women have adapted. His sincerity is ever present bringing the heart and soul of Cap to the screen which isn't an easy feat.<br/><br/>Another praise goes to Marcus and McFeely for investing the story line back to the Nazis as hydra was developed by the evil organization to being the world to its knees. It elevates the danger imposed as heroes around the globe are left without data or can communicate between each other leaving them defenseless. While resolving plot holes in why the other Avengers can't join in the action.<br/><br/>The fighting sequences were limited compared to the first but are styles and used to perfection as usual.<br/><br/>The winter Solider was fantastic and even better them the first in my opinion."

","The real-life lessons: again with these kind of movies there is not much to this area, besides maybe the trending topic that you have to think by yourself because everyone else might have their own agenda. <br/><br/>Character development: strangely enough there was not much depth and development in main characters. Alexander Pierce strangely enough was the one that developed to an extend in the end. He gave reasons why he supported what he supported but why those reasons were his in the first place, was not explained. There was a failed attempt in my opinion, in developing Steve Rogers character by the dilemma he was having about how to fit in the new world at the beginning. But that dimmer somehow just seemed to disappear and was not deep enough. And it was bot well presented how he managed to escape it. <br/><br/>Storytelling: very well done in my opinion. It had its twists and surprises and was never quite enough and without action. It kept you interested and engaged.

","Captain America: The Winter Soldier fixes some of my complaints of the first movie. In my review for The First Avenger, I opined that I never felt convinced about the relationship between Steve Rogers and his best friend Bucky Barnes. This film does a much better job going back and delving into that relationship to make it seem more convincing and relevant. If you are wondering why I mention Bucky Barnes in a movie called the Winter Soldier, well, connect the dots and keep in mind that I did warn you with a spoiler alert.<br/><br/>Scarlet Johansson is at her best as Black Widow as the relationship between her and Captain America really develops as she finally takes responsibility for her previous mistakes. Also, Anthony Mackie is a wonderful addition to the Avengers as Falcon and seems like less of a throwaway than Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye.<br/><br/>I believe the film does a decent job mulling over the moral implication of mass surveillance programs, and you even feel some empathy for some of the villains and their goals. As a result, Captain America: The Winter Soldier does seem to be the most morally relevant of the MCU films to date.<br/><br/>My only complaint with this film is it seems a bit rushed at some points and the plot comes together a bit too conveniently; it seems like a lot has to go right (or wrong depending on which side you are) for things to come together in the epic finale. I guess I'm just not convinced that so many people (police, S.H.I.E.L.D., politicians) were working on the bad side without there being leaks.

","What can you say about Marvel films that hasn't been said already? When Marvel started making movies, with the exception of Batman, I hated superheroes, I hated everything about them. I had written them off as the lowest, cheapest form of science fiction, and the first few Marvel films did little to prove me wrong, but then they started getting better, and arguably the best films in the franchise, or at least my favorites have been the Captain America films. Chris Evans is just terrific, he has this innocent naiveté about him surrounded in a childlike wonderment, but when the time comes, he can still kick some ass and even crack a joke, Evans just fits the role like a glove. There's not much point summarizing the story, because if you're not into the whole Marvel scene, you're probably not going to understand or see this film anyway, and that's a shame, because from a visual stand point alone, The Winter Soldier rivals anything Marvel has put out to date. On that note, the one draw back to this film is there is a lot of Avenger story line involved. This is supposed to be a stand alone film, fans of the series loved it and rightfully so, but what about the people who just like the character and aren't into the whole genre? All the other Avenger/Shield/Hydra stuff and other characters from other series could make the story for them more than somewhat confusing. In watching this film, you almost have to have some kind of background knowledge of the characters involvement in other films in order to be in the know and that doesn't sit right with people, particularly kids, who just want to see Captain America. For the fans, however it doesn't get much better than this, it's slightly longer and rougher around the edges than The First Avenger, but it is still a great film, and a must see for anyone is trying to keep with the Marvel franchise."

So Captain America finds himself in a position where he doesn't know who to trust. That said, he seems to trust Black Widow, who he quickly teams up with and who also features heavily in this movie.<br/><br/>And that's just the start of it. Together, Captain America and Black Widow uncover a truly sinister secret at the heart of the organisation they work for.<br/><br/>It's all delivered with perfectly good fight scenes and character interaction throughout. The sinister plot is unravelled at a steady pace, meaning it's easy to stay interested right up to the climax.<br/><br/>My major criticism is that I don't find the characters all that engaging. Captain America is a boringly clean-cut hero, and the bad guys didn't seem very memorable."

I had a nice experience watching the Phase One Marvel films from the original Iron Man until The Avengers because Phase One marks the beginning of this incredible Cinematic Universe Marvel has made. I did enjoy the first Captain America movie but this sequel takes it to a whole new level in terms of style, execution and storytelling which by the way is full of surprises that has never been done in a Marvel movie. To my surprise I like this film even better than the first film because ever since Iron Man 3 Marvel is brave enough when making their movies, they seriously showed proof when this film was made and makes you feel excited about the next Phase Two Marvel films. First of the action is intense and well choreographed. Everything in the movie is superbly suspenseful and very intense all the action scenes are well done combined with outstanding realistic practical effects and less CGI. Second of all the story is well paced and amazing. When the Winter Soldier appears on screen for the first time it was so shocking and intense how he was introduced. Last but not least the overall execution is amazing because this film is not only a Superhero film, but it also acts as a Conspiracy Thriller in the vein of Three Days At The Condor and The Parallax View along with The Dark Knight since both movies deal with similar themes and just imagine this movie being directed and written by Christopher Nolan and you get the idea of this film and the performances of the casts is really cool and amazing at the exact same time.

"one9eighty","8","0","1","10 May 2016"," A modern film with a twist of retro themes and cold wars
","The Captain is back, and this time he's in the present. While the first film dealt with a back-story/ origin you may remember that at the end of the film Roger's is brought into the future after being frozen in ice for some 50-60 years. A lot has happened in that time and in between films you'll have to make the assumption that he has been debriefed and brought up to speed on the world which has changed significantly. If you search online you'll find a nice chronological viewing order so you know how to watch the films and where they sit on a chronological list; for the purpose of this lets say that the events of the first Avengers film have unfolded, as have all the Iron Man films and just before this Cpt America film Thor 2's events have also occurred. In this film you kind of get some of the fallout of those prior events (Shield is taking a lot of stick for events in the Avengers movie as well as the Iron Man films and is getting pressured to be safer and strong with controls in place) as well as things that spill out of Cpt America's past from the first film. Steve has a lot to catch up on and just when he's making friends (The Falcon) and finding his feet in the modern world Nick Fury is killed by an assassin working for Hydra. In fact Hydra have infiltrated Shield and parts of the American (and World) government so who can Cpt America rely on. Trusting nobody it's up to Rogers, Widow and Falcon to try and stop the assassin called the Winter Soldier and save the world, even when it looks like they are on the wrong side of justice because Hydra has infiltrated and corrupted most of the ruling bodies. <br/><br/>The stars of the first film and other recent Marvel films all deliver credible performances, that's Evans as Cpt America, Samuel L. Jackson as Fury, and Johansson as Black Widow. Introducing Widow into this film was clever as it allowed an emotional probe and outlet for Rogers, typical of a man from the 30/40's he's very private and doesn't let his emotions out, he is absolutely a man out of time, using Black Widow to help convey his hidden pain was very effective and gives the characters an additional layer of depth. I have to mentioned Sebastian Stan for his performance in this film, he's still Bucky Barnes but he's also the Winter Soldier and as a brainwashed assassin he does really well and suits the role. Anthony Mackie is introduced as Sam Wilson/ Falcon and makes a decent first showing. Cobie Smulders works well as Maria Hill and I am expecting more great things from her to come. Frank Grillo (Brock Rumlow) lays decent foundations for a role which is set to get bigger if you recognise his name from the comics. Toby Jones (Dr Zola) is just as creepy in this as he is in the first film despite not making a physical appearance. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this film as much, if not more than the first Cpt America film and other MCU films. It showed lots of clever depth with it's plots and sub-plots all unfolding at once and laid some great foundations for the 3rd Cpt America film which is set to put a 'cat amongst the pigeons'. This film is fast paced and very clever. It uses themes used throughout film and politics in the 60's, 70's and 80's including paranoia, secret societies and agendas, world domination, cold wars, and so on. This is not just a superhero movie but also a spy/action film with romance, heartache, reflection and ultimately a heart. 8 out of 10"

","Seeing this movie made me quickly realize that in comparison, it is better than the first one. I thought it was a bit of an improvement, which is one reason why I think it is a stronger film.<br/><br/>When watching it, I thought it started off rather confusing when the people in the beginning were being held captive on a vessel and I think it was mainly because it wasn't clear straightaway who the character Agent Rumlow was, at least to me. I wondered if it was the result of HYDRA still being active and had members within S.H.I.E.L.D. There were a lot of things that were explained as the film went on, but I was just kind of confused by that beginning. I like the character of Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans). I liked the way he questioned S.H.I.E.L.D. As oppose to just blindly following orders because nowadays our government is far more corrupt then it was in his day. He's basically anti-establishment, like he wasn't for imprisoning people or enslaving people. Although this takes place two years after The Avengers, I like how it is also a continuation to The First Avenger. That was probably where I was confused, considering I have not seen The Avengers movie yet. The character of Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier made for a very compelling villain. The entire storyline of Captain America realizing his friend is the enemy is very heartfelt and gripping. I appreciate the measures he goes through to try to save him. Through every account of their final fight. He never stops trying to save Bucky. I love that aspect. Steve Rogers is constantly trying to get through to him throughout the fight. Even till the very end. He never gives up on his friend. They've known each other all of their lives and Steve Rogers aka Captain America did not want to give up on that. That really is a powerful scene. All of the action scenes are very well done throughout. Also, I like Black Widow and Falcon. I thought they were excellent."

","This movie is ultimately just a setup movie for the rest of the MCU, however that does not stop it from being a very well made and entertaining movie. Personally I was feeling tired of Captain America himself, but watching this movie again I found that he was actually a more likable, well written character. The Russo brothers did a very good job of taking an already well established character and making something much better of him - expanding his character and in doing so shaping him into a character who you will be excited to see in future movies. However the supporting cast of characters was a mixed bag. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson both reprised their roles and if you liked them in previous movies, you'll like them here. I didn't feel we learnt much about their characters and by the end of the movie it felt like Scarlett Johansson's character was in the same place she started. However all three of the actors mentioned above gave great performances, and having seen the rest of the MCU movies I think the performances in general were some of the best in a MCU movie. The problem came in the new editions to the cast - I was disappointed to see Robert Redford given quite a bland character, who is an instant edition to the already crowded canvas of forgettable Marvel villains. The Winter Soldier himself felt like a kind of supporting villain without much of a role in the movie - definitely not a big enough role to name the movie after him. Although the final edition was perhaps the best character in the movie: Falcon. This was a surprisingly well written character wonderfully played by Anthony Mackie, who took a fairly large role in the film and was generally one of the most memorable aspects of this movie.<br/><br/>This is the first MCU movie to be directed by the Russo brothers and by far the best directed MCU movie to date. Marvel has noticeably struggled with finding suitable and good directors to put any auteur in their movies, with previous directors such as Shane Black and Alan Taylor failing miserably. However here is a movie which not only found suitable directors but benefited greatly from them. The Russo brothers did a stunning job of portraying the tension and suspense both throughout the movie and in their juxtaposition of the the conflicting ideologies of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Steve Rogers. The Russo brothers shined in many other places, from their creation of highly emotionally resonate scenes to some of the best action in a MCU movie to date. The entire movie felt very well dealt with and made; the plot was stronger than most superhero movies and well thought out, and it did a very good job of setting up future MCU movies, in particular Captain America Civil War. In a world already crowded by an overload of superhero movies, this one is sure to stick out."
"quinimdb","6","0","2","1 April 2016"," Captain America: The Winter Soldier
","""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has probably the most intense and exciting action scenes of any marvel movie. In fact, I feel like the movie as a whole has more in common with a ""Bourne Identity"" movie than a superhero movie. This is largely do to the way these scenes were shot, edited, and choreography. The scenes are almost always shot in a wide angle, showing each full hit. While there are many cuts, I realized that again they almost never cut on a hit, which lessens the impact of the hit so it seems much less visceral. Also, again, while there are many cuts, the action is always kept in the center of the frame, so the viewer's eyes aren't jumping all over the frame every second, trying to figure out what is going on. Finally, the character always starts at a disadvantage at the beginning of a fight scene and has to fight his way back up (particularly in one of my favorite scenes, the elevator fight). I know these may seem like very subtle touches, but they add up to make some incredibly visceral fight scenes.<br/><br/>And those are definitely the best parts of the movie. The fight scenes. Don't get me wrong, nothing else is really bad, per se. The main characters are rather well rounded (for a superhero movie that is), and they all follow similar character arcs (they all learn to be able to trust in people again, while also learning that maybe everything is not quite what it seems). There's also some political commentary, but it's very surface level stuff. Basically it tries to tell us that, while technology becomes better and better, the government will be able to develop more powerful weapons. And the government themselves could actually be apart of some Nazi party and we could be entirely oblivious as to everything they believe in and the power that they hold. Of course this sounds ridiculously over the top, and that's because it absolutely is. Hell, I even found myself laughing out loud at some of the crazier moments in the plot. So obviously it didn't exactly portray the message that I thought it was going for very well, unless it was going for satire, which I'm 99% sure it wasn't.<br/><br/>But nonetheless, it was a very entertaining movie, with pretty good dialogue (although some obligatory cheesy superhero movie lines), well written characters, great action, and a little bit of political commentary delivered in a very over the top fashion. So I'd say it fulfilled it's purpose, and even went a bit farther than that."

"nmholland","9","0","1","24 February 2016"," One of the Best Marvel Movies to Date, Making Captain America Seem Awesome
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and stars Chris Evans reprising the role of Captain America, along with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and introducing Anthony Mackie as the Falcon. This film follows Captain America and Black Widow as they are forced to run and hide from S.H.I.E.LD., once the agency spontaneously turns on them. Now, there's more than a few spoilers in this film that I won't give away, but I still want to review it.<br/><br/>Now, in my opinion, this is one of the best Marvel movies to date. It's at least on par with Spiderman 2, Guardians of the Galaxy, and possibly even The Avengers. The whole movie's tone is not the same, fun tone that Marvel took with The Avengers, or the first Captain America movie. This whole film feels like a 70's spy, espionage movie. The film is also very dark, almost like Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. It's a complete new take on Captain America and on S.H.I.E.L.D. in general.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about the film is how bad Steve gets the life beat out of him. He has about three allies in the world, and everybody else is convinced he's a criminal. Other great superhero movies have done the exact same; beat down the hero. This was present in Spiderman 1 and 2, Iron Man, and The Dark Knight Rises. This element makes us feel for our hero, and ultimately love it even more when they come out on top.<br/><br/>The directing and cinematography was amazing, as well. All the wide shots of the S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, or the Triskelion, look great. The action is near perfectly directed, especially in hand to hand combat scenes. My favorite scene in this film is the fight scene on the highway between Cap and the Winter Soldier, mostly due to the action. The directing, along with the slowly rising score, make this scene as close to perfect as it gets.<br/><br/>Now, there is an issue with this movie. And it's going to be hard to explain, because it involves a plot twist. And, not just a plot twist for this film, this twist links all the way back to the first Iron Man. So, I really don't want to spoil it for anybody that hasn't seen this movie yet. However, the twist was somewhat rushed. Yes, it was surprising, but it was thrown at the audience like a baseball. It was very rushed, and presented no evidence from the previous films in the Cinematic Universe. However, this is my only problem with the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the best Marvel movies to date. I would give it an A, or a 9 out of 10."

","Absolutely better than the first, and I am incredibly impressed. I really loved the interaction between Captain America and the Winter Soldier and seeing a few other heroes come along for the ride was a great experience. Plus seeing that Bucky Barnes was in fact the Winter Soldier was a fun nod to the comics that I was really happy to see, and then there was the huge surprise involving Hydra, which blew me away. The fact that S.H.E.I.L.D. was infiltrated was awesome to see. Along with this darker toned movie, the characters where really well done and developed, the plot was incredible, and it was amazing to watch the Helicarrier fall. There was also the fun addition of the Falcon who happened to be a very good well thought out character who I am happy to see is sticking around for future movies. I give this a 10 out of 10 for a spectacular performance. ""Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky."" –Steve Rodgers"

","Okay so it took me a very long time and many times of watching Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) to write about it. I watched Captain America: The Winter Soldier in the theaters when it first come out and honestly I fell asleep. The next time I went to watch this movie I fell asleep again. This seemed to be the trend every time I watched this movie. Is Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) a good movie? Well it is a fair movie, it is exactly what you'd expect. The action is fair, the acting is what you'd expect and the story is just rushed in very slow mode. It took me yet another 5 hours to watch this movie again for like the 10th time to even get through the movie fully enough to even write about it.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is a fair film, though it is very hard to sit through and it doesn't hold our attention. The story and the way the scenes are go so slowly that it just gets dull very quick. I'm not sure what truly went wrong with this film and I'm not saying that it isn't good; it's merely very slow paced."
"Bunkerwelt","10","0","3","17 October 2015"," Captain Snowden vs. The Big Data Soldier
","Even though ""The Raid 2"" is the strongest contender for being my favorite action movie of 2014 it is clear to me now that ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is on top of my list of favorite movies 2014 over all. It is absolutely mesmerizing to me how the Russo Brothers managed to make a movie about a superhero I never gave a chuff about and turned him into my number one favorite. Just to underline how few people care about Captain America in Germany: His solo movies have been called ""The First Avenger"" and ""Return of the First Avenger"" here, because it's actually easier to con your friends into watching ""That new Marvel movie about the first Avenger"" with you before they find out it is about lame ass Captain America! The first thing the Russo Brothers did right was looking at the character and seeing what makes him tick. His superpowers are superhuman strength and agility, so you naturally should see that on film. With that in mind they went for hand-held cameras and fight scenes with actual talented martial artists involved. With people like Frank Grillo and UFC Welterweigh Champion Georges St-Pierre you know Chris Evans had to workout like a mad man to keep up. But not only are the fights better choreographed than anything seen in Hollywood Blockbusters in the last 10 years, they are also much better shot, with wider angles and longer shots dominating the screen. Sure, they aren't as crazy as the shots that Gareth Evans and Isaac Florentine present to us, but for a Marvel movie this is a gigantic step forward.<br/><br/>The second thing the Russo Brothers did right was relying heavily on practical effects. If they were able to build something they went for the real thing instead of CGI, and boy does it show. The car chases are some of the best stunt driving I have seen in years and compared to something like ""A Good Day To Die Hard"" this will bring tears of joy to your eyes.<br/><br/>But the praise doesn't stop here: ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" also features the best character development out of all of the Marvel movies. When there isn't amazing action on screen the characters are talking like they are in a real conversation. Black Widow already was in 2 Marvel movies, one even directed by characterization specialist Joss Whedon, and only now does she feel like a real character to me. Captain America and Black Widow basically pull off a buddy cop routine with running gags through the entire movie, which is such a breath of fresh air after thousands of unnecessary romance subplots in other action movies. A female and a male hero on equal terms are best buddies and take down the bad guys: Chuffing finally.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this movie is the very grim tone that is only lightened up by conversational gags every once in a while. There are so many innocent people getting shot in this that I had to check twice what rating it had. Sure, their deaths aren't nearly as bloody as your good old 80s action fare but it has a very high body count and some really gruesome kills.<br/><br/>The greatest thing though has to be the story. As somebody who never cared about Captain America I had the impression that he's the kinda guy that goes around being all ""You don't do this to America, Oorah!"" but he really isn't. He is a superhero that stands for the freedom of speech, the freedom of the individual and all that good stuff that America supposedly stands for. So without spoiling too much this movie basically shows Captain America resisting against his superiors and with that the government, becoming a fugitive in the process by trying to do what's right instead of what was commanded to him. It's a very topical story about big data and the prevention of crimes by analyzing it. It even leads up to a point where it basically calls people like Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning heroes for what they did, a stand point I never would have expected to be taken in such a big budget comic book adaptation.<br/><br/>All this combined makes this one hell of a watch and turned Captain America into my favorite superhero. I don't often cheer during movies, but this basically has everything I love. Sure, I would have loved a little more blood on screen, but instead I got to cry some tears at the heartfelt climax."

","This film is one of those pleasant surprises: the sequel that is better than its predecessor. Not that Captain America (1) was bad, but it somewhat underwhelmed and the villain was a bit goofy. But this film has all the engrossing action and witty dialogue of the Avengers, with a dash of Bond-esque adventure, and is easily viewable more than once. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier himself virtually steals the show. Someone give an award of some kind to the director for taking his time to slowly introduce the Winter Soldier, and even more slowly reveal who he is. The Winter Soldier is a textbook case of how you do a villain. He's dangerous, effective, doesn't mess around, and is equal to the Captain. Perhaps the most telling scene is when he knocks the Captain down and we see him standing there with Cap's shield, like a boss! The music score also enhances the Soldier with an accent of horror film dread and Matrix-esque insuperability.<br/><br/>To him, I would add Robert Redford's Secretary character, who lends the film a Bond-esque debonair villain who overseas a credible global threat. Redford brings class to his character, to the point that you kind of like him despite his evil plans.<br/><br/>There are probably some foibles to this film, but come on, it's a summer popcorn film that kept me engaged from beginning to end, so who cares!"
"almosalami","10","0","2","19 July 2015"," My Favorite Hero Film
","Captain America The Winter Soldier is not perfect film but is the perfect comic book film. If you pay attention enough you'll notice some conveniences and clichés and lapses in cinematography that are aside from it being a comic book film and could've been fixed/avoided and made the film slightly better. But boy is this film freaken awesome in almost every way. People talk about this film as an espionage type film, and it is one in many ways and it does that very very well with great tension put up throughout the film and very clever moments fitting of a good espionage film and has some great commentary on the War on Terror and the ethical conflict between Captain America and (to those familiar with Marvel Comics) the ideology of Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. (not that Iron Man appears in the film, though is referenced here and there, which is cool). For me personally, I loved how Hydra in the film carry out their plan, because it makes sense and is a very smart, very clever, very despicable plan, and makes for a smart film. But it is also surprisingly a great hero film - the kind that will inspire the good side in you, especially from Captain America. Man, that guy is a hero and a true friend, and just on these points I've mentioned, this is probably my all time favorite hero film and a very refreshing approach on MCU films. Let's talk about the characters. I've mentioned Captain America as a real hero, and I say that because of the way he talks, the dialogue coming from him, the actions he does, THE AWESOME FIGHTING AND ESPIONAGE SCENES WITH THIS GUY (I MEAN WOW!), his morals and willingness to do what is right, his loyalty, the charming quirks here and there, and the way he is portrayed by Chris Evans. At this point, I can't imagine anyone else as Captain America. Chris Evans could've very easily been just some pretty boy with abs, but Chris Evans really fits the role of a hero. He has that honest face and voice needed for when Captain America speaks and acts, and he has the physique and expression for violent action that make for great actions scenes. We also have Black Widow, and while I did not see the point in some of the things she said to Captain America (like in the beginning), is actually a really great addition to Captain America, as not only is she a badass, but she also has real conflict and whenever she is not in her fun, badass mode, she actually has great emotion and realness to her, and as with Chris Evans for Captain America, Scarlett Johanson plays her really well. The thing about her character is that very easily she could've been played as this badass with nothing else going for her, and usually actresses that play those roles are not all that great. Scarlett Johanson, however, does not follow that trend, and she has some really great moments with her character, and I'm glad that she played the role of Black Widow. And not enough people are talking about how fun and great Falcon is, played by Anthony Mackie. Not only does he have really fun moments and awesome action scenes, but he makes for a true friend to Captain America, and I love that and really look forward to seeing him and Captain America more together. Now we don't really need to talk about Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury being awesome, because of course he is! All the dialogue coming out of that man's mouth is so awesome and fitting for the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and for the actor of Samuel L. Jackson. One character that kind of stole the show, though, is the Winter Soldier. Oh my word is there such depth and moral conflict and moments of greatness in action and in emotion from the character that I don't believe there has been a villain like him that I've seen in a long time. His relationship with one of the characters really really hits you right in your gut and by the end of it, THE FEELS!!! OH MY WORD!!! THE FEELS! Now, I did mention in the beginning that this is not a perfect film, and just to expand on that, there were a few moments where things were a bit convenient (like say, when Winter Soldier goes after Nick Fury but for some reason takes a slow walk to him, which allows Nick Fury to escape) or clichéd (I don't want to mention to keep this review spoiler free) or a bit too much on the side of exposition and dumbing-down for the audience (like at times, Captain America was not quick enough to follow the logic, not because the character was like that but because the film was attempting to explain to the audience), but there is no way on Earth any of that detracts from the film, and that is why I give this film a perfect score, even though it is imperfect. And for you who rolls your eyes at someone giving a perfect score to an imperfect film, just say I rounded up ;)."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","2","6 July 2015"," Fantastic action espionage thriller
","One of the best things about the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the variety of their characters and the possibilities that stem from that fact. It allows them to make a huge variety of movies, straddling different genres with ease. Whereas the Thor movies belong more comfortably in the fantasy genre and whereas the first Captain America film was a war period piece, this film can more accurately be described as an espionage thriller.<br/><br/>And it works great! It totally embraces the genre and gives us an interesting, multilayered and nail-bitingly exciting mystery to unravel, yet it still feels like a Marvel film - perhaps even more so than some, because it's the film in Phase Two that arguably moves the story forward the most.<br/><br/>So what is this story? Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has joined S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of The Avengers and along with Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) he fights against global threats to keep Earth safe. Yet it seems that tensions are rising even within S.H.I.E.L.D. and when an old Soviet threat, the Winter Soldier, re-enters the fray, Captain America has to use all of his skills and assets to solve the mystery before the world is doomed.<br/><br/>Basic premise, but its the execution that's so much fun. Johansson and Evan are a fantastic battle couple together, having some of the best chemistry I've seen in a long time. The various supporting actors are also A-list through and through, delivering some great performances. I also really appreciate how the film ties so many of the other Marvels movies together, yet it doesn't feel crowded with references.<br/><br/>The action scenes are also fantastic. Captain America is one of the more normal superheroes in the Avengers, yet that somehow makes all the action seem even more exciting because you know that he is not that much above the human norm, making all of his feats seem even more impressive. The fight choreographies are also suitably down to earth yet impressive, the special effects support all other aspects beautifully and it's simply a very competent film on the technical level.<br/><br/>If I had to name flaw, I'd say that the name of the film is a bit misleading as the eponymous Winter Soldier isn't really the central focus of the film, which can lead to some disappointments if you've set your expectations erroneously.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the best Marvel movies made to date and a clear proof that Steve Rogers is the beating heart of the franchise. Definitely worth a watch."

I'm sure most of you reading this know the Captain America mythos. This is a high speed, action every minute, mind bending experience. The individual characters are interesting and complex. I still need to watch the first movie to actually figure out the whole ""Shield"" and ""Hydra"" thing and how it works and what Captain America has done. However, when you have your characters being pursued by the most formidable of villains, it isn't necessary to have an encyclopedic knowledge of all this stuff.

","7.8 out of 10. People are hard to please. Such a huge difference from rotten tomatoes, which had 89% critic, and 92% audience rating. That feels more accurate. I'd say this Marvel movie has the best playback value of any of them. If it's on TV, I'll put it on, more so than any other superhero movie. Gaudrians of Galaxy is also great in multiple viewings. This one doesn't live off of as many one-liners as the other marvel movies (which are great in the first viewing but can be tiring after multiple viewings) or as many superpowers (no super speed, no flight, no hulk-like strength). The fight scenes are spectacular, but in a more traditional movie sense, they are like cop-thriller fight scenes on steroids. I think that's why I like this one the best, it stretches the imagination, but not to the point that it becomes too cartoony, yet keeps the charm/comedy that Marvel does so well. Where as GotG and Avengers is like 80% comedy and 20% serious, this is closer to 60/40."

","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, and complements it nicely. Most sequels just go for the overused formula of bigger equals better, which rarely works out well. This time, the second movie is the continuation of the first, contrasting the differences between modern day and the time Captain America lived in. Things aren't so black and white in this movie, for awhile Cap doesn't know who to trust, and is just going off his guy instinct about what to do. This movie is about everything Captain America believes in being torn down, with SHIELD and with the Winter Soldier. Spoiler: The Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes, Steve's best friend, so watching Steve have to fight him, is very emotional. Not only that, but the Winter Soldier is a very menacing villain. So, yes, I really liked the way they played off of the first one with this movie, and I thought that was a very good dynamic. The cast is great this time, even better than in the first movie. Chris Evans is better than ever in the titular role, and Scarlet Johansen delivers once again as the Black Widow, though her role isn't as well written this time around. Samuel L. Jackson also reprises his role as Nick Fury, and he and Cap play off of each other really well, because they each have their own contrasting ways of doing things, and as you can imagine there's a lot of friction from that. Anthony Mackie's The Falcon is a good addition, as he brings some extra charm to the movie. And, to go back to what I said earlier, I think The Winter Soldier is the perfect villain for this movie, and I much prefer him to the Red Skull, as he provides some actual menace to Captain America, as well as his numerous allies. And for the hard-core comic book fans, there's even a minor role of Crossbones. I also think this movie boasts some better action scenes, with car chases, shootouts, and three different super-heroes all running around and using their own gimmicks. The most noteworthy are (though it is very brief) the elevator scene where Cap dispatches at least a dozen Hydra cronies in an elevator, after giving them all the chance to back out. So cool! The final battle between Cap and Winter Soldier also delivers on some really hard-hitting emotion as well as a very tense duel, as they are standing on a cat-walk, really high in the air. This is the quintessential Captain America movie here, but then again so is the first one, it's just that they each tell a different type of Captain America story, each one equally iconic. Most superhero movies in a series tell a very similar story, so it was very refreshing to see something so different. I just hope that the Civil War will live up to the first two, giving us something original, instead of just two and a half hours filled with poorly timed jokes and so many characters you need an index to keep up with them. Which brings me to another point: the tone. There are jokes in this movie, but they are timed well, and they feel more intelligent. These feel like things real people would say, not jokes bordering on fourth-wall breaking. I also like the way they handled such a large cast, in that each character was well developed, but we had a clearly defined main cast. In the end Captain America the Winter Soldier is a great movie, with a stellar cast, great action, a great story, a good tone, and makes for a great follow up to the first one."

The plot concerns the conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D. which Rogers tries to uncover with the help of Black Widow only for Rogers to discover that his past hasn't been eliminated yet.<br/><br/>Directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, the film is thoroughly balanced when it comes to action & drama although the humour does take a hit in the film's intent to go a bit darker but not by much. The screenplay is brilliant too for the story keeps the core of its predecessor alive in its new form. Camera-work is dynamic, pacing is fabulous & Henry Jackman packs in with a score that feels much evolved.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Sebastian Stan & others with Robert Redford & Anthony Mackie as new additions. Evans is a natural in the role of Rogers & the suit is as fitting as before but it's his chemistry with Johansson that feels most refreshing this time. Rest of the cast chips in with fine contributions however I wish writers had put some more meat on the main antagonist here.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of Marvel's better offerings which never loses the thread that connects it to the original, keeps the action flowing at regular intervals, is sprinkled with political themes that are nicely dealt with, features a quite formidable villain, has a surprising depth in both story & character elements, delivers the entertainment that's bigger & better than last time and while its large-scale spectacle remain ridiculously fun, it's how the whole film is narrated that makes it satisfying on many levels."
"skoobydoo6789","10","0","1","19 March 2015"," One of the best entries in the MCU
","Captain America became one of my favorite comic book characters after I watched First Avenger. I had low expectations for the movie because the character wasn't as cool or awesome like Iron Man, Thor, the X-Men, Spider-Man, the Hulk, and even Batman. After watching First Avenger, I was excited for the next Captain America movie. Winter Soldier did not disappoint. The movie is one of the best entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise.<br/><br/>Captain America-Winter Soldier takes place two years after the events of the first Avengers movie. Captain Steve Rogers is now working at S.H.I.E.L.D alongside fellow Avenger Black Widow, Nick Fury, and Maria Hill. He still feels like a man out of time in our modern day society. Rogers finds out about Project Insight which eliminates threats before they even happen via three Helicarriers after a mission. He learns not everything is what it seems.<br/><br/>The newest threat that Cap has to face is the mysterious assassin called the Winter Soldier. After the assassin kills Nick Fury, Captain America goes on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. The only help that he has are Black Widow, Sam Wilson/Falcon, and Maria. They face a threat from the past that comes back to haunt them.<br/><br/>Captain America-Winter Soldier is one of the best comic book movies that I have watched in recent years. It's on up there with Iron Man 1, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Captain America-First Avenger, Spider-Man 2, the Avengers, X-Men 1, Guardians of the Galaxy, X2: X-Men United, Thor 1, and the Dark Knight. I enjoyed the movie a lot. It had a great story- line that will keep you interested through out the movie. There are some great twists in the movie (except for the major one if you're a comic book fan whose familiar with the Winter Soldier story-line).<br/><br/>The movie's soundtrack was also amazing. The special effects and CGI look great. Unlike the recent Iron Man and Thor sequels, the humor in Winter Soldier felt more natural. The new characters (Agent 13, Alexander Pierce, Sam Wilson, and Brock Rumlow) introduced in the movie were great additions to the MCU.<br/><br/>My favorite of the new characters is Sam Wilson aka Falcon. I love his interactions with Captain America. Can't wait to see more of Sam Wilson/Falcon in future MCU movies. Captain America-Winter Soldier is definitely one of the best comic book movies that I've seen in recent years. It is an amazing addition to the MCU. It has a great story with espionage/thriller tones. This is one Marvel movie that I will be watching over and over again."

","I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this. The jingoism of the first film was gone, replaced with a rather interesting discussion on the moral compromises we are often urged to accept for the sake of peace. Action-fans are provided with the requisite explosions and shoot-outs, too, of course. Borrowing as much from political thrillers as blockbusters raises the quality of the piece. It's very 'talky' by action movie standards, but nicely balances that action with characterisation (in that Chris Evans HAS one, this time, and Me Johansson is more than just kick-ass eye-candy), and hints at a rather darker Avengers flick to come. <br/><br/>And we had Batroc ze Leaper. A fan-boy 'Yea!' to that!"
"ericrnolan","8","0","1","12 March 2015"," Okay, now — this was actually a pretty good movie; I'd give it an 8 out of 10.
","And that says a lot coming from me — I gave only a lukewarm response to ""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" because I thought that film was an overly safe family film that had no depth or suspense, and some awkward fight scenes. I've also opined that Captain America is one of the flatter characters on The Avengers' lineup. And he's got a simplistic character concept, even by comic book standards (super- soldier serum, anyone?).<br/><br/>But ""Winter Soldier"" does improve greatly on some various weaknesses of the origin story. The action scenes (my favorite is the highway fight) are very, very good, with well choreographed brawls and suspenseful shootouts that aren't too hard for the viewer to follow. And the space opera-level climax will definitely give action junkies their money's worth.<br/><br/>Chris Evans actually is a really good actor, in my estimation. He seems to do a far better job here than in the other Marvel films, and the script gives Cap a depth that lets Evans show a nice range. (And dammit if he doesn't look the part.) He's a charismatic lead that lets you more easily buy into the character. And  Robert Redford in a comic book movie?! That's something I never saw coming. But what a great actor.<br/><br/>My quibbles? There were a couple. (BEWARE – SPOILERS AHEAD.)<br/><br/>1) Cap meets his best friend and (literal) wingman, the superhero Falcon, on a chance encounter after a run around Washington's Mall? DEUS EX EXERCISE.<br/><br/>2) Winter Soldier is nice and intimidating with his bandit-like costume and metal (vibranium?) arm, and it's a little unnerving when Captain America's ostensible equal comes crashing into the scene. But when his mask comes off and he utters one of his few lines of dialogue, he looks and sounds like a slightly dull, soft spoken, 16- year-old boy. He's utterly nonthreatening.<br/><br/>3) I've always been hard to please when it comes to conspiracy story lines. The larger the conspiracy, the less plausible — I refuse to believe that huge numbers of people can keep a secret so big. S.H.I.E.L.D. is an utterly incompetent spy agency if it allowed Hydra to flourish as it did within its upper echelons. Besides, Hydra is made up of weirdo fanatics — nuts like that would have a hard time blending in to a mainstream community.<br/><br/>4) S.H.I.E.L.D. was more fun when it was made up only of good guys. I never watched the TV show, but I rooted for them in the films. It was America's everyman response to a world of super-beings, and it was sort of the committed underdog.<br/><br/>5) Again, we are never quite sure what Cap's powers are. He can withstand 15-story falls with no major injury, but apparently isn't bulletproof.<br/><br/>6) Why on Earth does nobody call The Avengers for help?<br/><br/>But don't let those minor irks prevent you from checking out this movie. It's pretty decent.<br/><br/>Comic Book Nerd Trivia — Winter Soldier looks a heck of a lot like an anti-hero named ""Nomad"" in the mid-1990's. He teamed up with Daredevil when he went to Las Vegas in the ""Dead Man's Hand"" storyline. It's probably the same character; I am just too lazy to look it up right now.<br/><br/>https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/"

","As Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with another super soldier, the Black Widow, to battle a new threat from old history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>This was a very clever plot idea. Rather than the super villains of other heroes, have Captain America take on his own spy agency. This is the sort of thing one might expect in the Nick Fury comics, but Cap fills the role in nicely here. (Apparently Cap is replacing Fury, as now we see that he had the ""Howling Commandos"" in World War II, a group formerly lead by Fury in the traditional continuity).<br/><br/>Apparently the Russo Brothers wanted to keep visual effects to a minimum, and this was a wise choice. Unfortunately, the effects kept in look really bad. How this got an Oscar nomination is unclear, because the scenes are just so animated-looking. Cap on the plane, attacking it with a shield? Could probably have been done without effects, and now looks silly.<br/><br/>At least we finally got to see Samuel L. Jackson in an impressive car chase."

Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with an entertaining plot that offers a modicum of character development to go along with all the mayhem, chase scenes and CGI effects that are the life's blood of the modern- day action flick.<br/><br/>In this installment, '40's relic Steve Rogers (he even has an all- American name) is still adjusting to life as a superhero in the 21st Century when he discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D, the fictional spy agency, has been infiltrated and taken over by a traitorous organization known as HYDRA. Rogers has no idea who he can and cannot trust as he endeavors to save S.H.I.E.L.D. and the world at large from certain destruction. Enter the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), a manufactured super being similar to Rogers, who just happens, however, to fight for the other side.<br/><br/>As the granite-jawed, all-American-boy hero, Chris Evans possesses a good-guy earnestness and a disarming charm that fit the character nicely, and he's matched by such stellar figures as Robert Redford, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, etc.<br/><br/>It's all in good fun, and the time passes quickly, but, when all is said and done, you probably won't remember much about ""The Winter Soldier"" a few hours after it's over.

","""Before we get started, does anyone want to get out?""<br/><br/>After the rather dull ""Thor: The Dark World"" I thought we'd be in for more of the same with Captain America ""The Winter Soldier"". I have never been more mistaken. Man, it's so great that we get to see a national treasure on the run from his own corrupt government. This particular thread throughout the entire film gives it a distinct ability to explore its own subtext. It does this in a way that no Marvel Cinematic Universe films have done to date. Everything is palpable for the most part and done with a sense of never ending rhythmic urgency similar to last summer's excellent ""Star Trek Into Darkness"". The Russo brothers best known for their work on shows like ""Community"" and ""Arrested Development"" are clearly fans of the Bourne franchise from which much is lifted and transfixed as a suitable narrative framework. Yet they somehow manage to disseminate their own particular voice over proceedings. They do this in spite of overwhelming producer pressures at the same time.

","The first movie was decent, but The Winter Soldier stands on it's own. I applaud the Russo brothers for doing what they did to this movie, Captain America was kinda like an underdog in Marvel's The Avengers, but this is everything Captain America movie should be like! The Cap that kicks ass and fights for his country, a good man who hasn't change a bit since he got the serum, a man that might be out of time but is adapting very well! The plot,the CGI, the acting everything was outstanding, but what I mostly was surprised by were the action fight scenes, the choreography's were excellent, these scenes put to shame many other superhero movies and their fight scenes. What also was impressing is that there was plot behind every single one, which is not happening that much in nowadays movies. Whoever thought Marvel movies couldn't get any better, well think again.

So I was looking forward to Captain America: The Winter Soldier..<br/><br/>The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got better. I mean that Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a huge improvement on Captain America: The First Avenger. What Anthony Russo and Joe Russo did was very revolutionary to me. They were unexpectedly clever in making a great and descent film. I was very excited when I heard that they were going to direct Captain America: Civil War. The cast was perfect. Chris Evans was the one that stole every scene he was in. Scarlett Johansson and the rest of the cast were good too. The story is what caught me. It was revolutionary and one of my favorite scripts of Marvel. The action scenes were very amusing as well. The theme was very different than the other Marvel movies which is what made it enjoyable.<br/><br/>Overall, an amazing, action-packed thriller with a lot of fun. I recommend it."

This is best movie role for his acting talent. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is perfect for this role, but for example she has talent for serious movie like in The Prestige. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in this movie have (in my opinion) best ""running away with car"" scene ever. All other characters not very important.

","Finally, I got to see this! This was one of my most anticipated movies this year, and boy was it worth the wait! In this latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America and a few friends take on S.H.I.E.L.D. after an assassination attempt on Nick Fury. Along the way, he uncovers some secrets that fundamentally change his understanding of how he thought things were. That's probably all the plot you need going in, because to say anymore would spoil the experience. Everything and everyone fires on all cylinders here. Chris Evans is outstanding as Captain America, as well as Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon. What I appreciated most was the attention to character development in addition to the jaw-dropping action sequences. But what surprised me was how smart this film actually is. The basic premise of the film, you could say, is ""ripped from the headlines."" With the NSA scandals and privacy vs. security debate currently going on in the US, this film couldn't be more timely. It also fits in nicely with the other films in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. While the story is self-contained, there are nods to other Marvel characters and past events so that everything ties together quite well. Honestly, there's not too much more I can really say about it, except that if you haven't seen it you don't know what you're missing. Also, as expected with comic book films these days, don't forget to stay for the mid- and post-credits sequences, which hint at things to come."

","Captain America is a real throwback superhero. He embodies honesty and nobility. Truly, he's a superhero that all should look up to.<br/><br/>He doesn't do it for me.<br/><br/>Whereas the story of Winter Soldier was pretty good, Captain America (AKA The Human Torch from Fantastic Four) was exactly what I thought he would be. Stronger and faster than the most athletic man he can fight multiple foes; and with his shield he can even fight armed enemies. It's not that impressive. There have been so many Marvel and DC comic heroes to hit the big screen that a strong good fighting superhero no longer sparks my interest. I like him as part of the Avengers because he's not carrying the show, but on his own...

","The Winter Soldier is a solid sequel with a smart and meaningful story. Indeed, it starts off after The Avenger, where we find Steve Rogers slowly catching up with 21st century living and being confronted with betrayal and treason within S.H.I.E.L.D. The movie raises issues that are of actuality to us all, such as drone technologies, manipulation of people private information by the NSA and even false flag attacks. It gives an homage to Classic movie of the 80's, Wargame in one scene. And also, in another scene, gives a nod to Samuel L Jackson most famous lines of his career from the movie Pulp Fiction. Look at the inscription on the tombstone towards the end of the film. Highly recommended!!"

","The day has come for Marvel to dip their toes in the darker tones of filmmaking, and do a fine job in doing so. Although the trailer for iron man 3 gave us the idea that marvel are going to take a new direction in their productions it's finally captain America which delivers.<br/><br/>Acting from everyone involved was sublime, witty and sharp. The chemistry between Johansson and Evans is unbeatable, finally adding a maturity to male-female partnerships in the marvel universe rather than tongue in cheek dialogue. The action has never looked better in any marvel film to date, mainly due to the minimal amount of CGI used which I respect the filmmakers in doing so greatly.<br/><br/>The story was thought out long and hard and had me captivated from start to finish, it has the original superhero themes but adds the dark,sensitive themes that I'd love to see in more Marvel films which is even shown in the characters clothing(falcon).i have not read any comic material from the Marvel universe so I have little to no ideas about the plans for our on screen heroes but there was some characters who I can see coming into the fray as the Marvel universe expands.<br/><br/>Evans is coming to terms with 21st century life and the attitudes of those around him. The villain has a large back-story which we delve into as the story progresses. What i found most interesting is Samuel L Jackson's Nick fury character. We find there's a lot more to him than meets the eye (no pun intended) and find aspects of him that has not been revealed in previous films as he is generally seen as the boss of the avenger team who takes it upon himself to keep his allies in check, but he holds the responsibility of shield heavily on his shoulders, for good reason.<br/><br/>The film still keeps intact the campy soundtracks that the prequel was known for but also introduces tension building/frightening tracks to emphasise the direction which the directors want to add to the captains storyline. The action flows smoothly, the acting is breathtaking, the story is solid. There is very little wrong with this gem of a film and I hope more marvel films catch on to this effective,fresh way of filmmaking."

","I'm getting fed up of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While The Avengers is amazing, many of the other Marvel films are just factory products and Marvel is failing to do anything bold. For example, in this movie they supposedly kill Nick Fury but then back out of it. However, I still like most of the films and this is an exceptional knockout blow and thus far, the best blockbuster of 2014. Captain America is finding adjusting to the modern world hard, and after being framed becomes a fugitive and tries to bring down a Shield conspiracy. What sets this apart from other Marvel films is that it's not just an action movie: It's a living, breathing narrative with characters we care about, a sense of tension and material to appeal to those who aren't fan boys. True, the film is in some ways just another Marvel movie and doesn't take a lot of risks, but the reveal of Shield being infiltrated half way through is genuinely shocking and the film is a dazzling mix of political thriller and superhero movie.<br/><br/>Chris Evans proves those who say Captain America is boring wrong, while Scarlett Johansson is strong as Black Widow. As usual, Samuel L Jackson is brilliant as Nick Fury and everyone else does a good job. The MCU has suffered from bad villains but this breaks that trend, with 2 awesome villains. The action sequences are totally astonishing and despite being full of huge explosions and massive crashes there is palm sweating tension maintained throughout. The screenplay is also great, and there is a sense of character development and emotion that aren't seen in most of the other Marvel films. While Iron Man 3, Thor The Dark World and Guardians Of The Galaxy were factory products to some extent, this actually does a few new things and best of all manages to be a great time even if its not your genre. Merging the comic book world with the real world and developing characters, pulling out the rug and blowing up everything is sight with great enthusiasm, Captain America The Winter Soldier is a brilliant, mind blowing and genuinely fascinating comic book slam dunk which hits with the force of Captain America's shield.<br/><br/>9/10"

","In Captain America, Captain America (Chris Evans) is forced to go up against an old enemy that was believed to be dead and gone, a new enemy who he thought he could count on, and also deal with a part of his past that he is not ready for. The action is terrific in this film. Sure, car chases, gun battles, and secrets have all been done before, but they take the action way above all other films. The plot is not hard to follow, but that is not a bad thing. It is paced just right to go along with the character of Captain America. Sometimes films try to have too many plot twists and it just becomes confusing or doesn't make any sense at all, but this movie has a good twist to it that fits so well. Of course Samuel L. Jackson is brilliant as the elusive Nick Fury, and Scarlett Johansson is perfect as the Black Widow. New comer to the franchise, Anthony Mackie, is great as the Falcon, and Sebastian Stan is excellent as the Winter Soldier. To me, there are no bad actors in this film. The action is spectacular, the sets are great, and the story is excellent. I say give it a try, it is worth the money."

","Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)<br/><br/>Actors: 7/10<br/><br/>Plot/script: 7/10<br/><br/>Photography/visual style: 6/10<br/><br/>Music/score: 6/10<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is the second film starring Chris Evans as Captain America. The first was set almost entirely in the 1940s, and documented his origins. It was a black-and-white good vs. evil story of the kind that is very dated by today's standards... which is exactly what it needed to be, to set up the character that is Cap, the 'Man Out of Time', whose obsolete, simplistic value system often comes into conflict with the complexities of the modern world.<br/><br/>In this film, The Winter Soldier, we see him some time into his new life in the present day, long past the initial disorientation which has been done many times elsewhere and didn't need to be seen again. However, he still has some adjusting to do, as a major institution on which he depends - the covert military operation S.H.I.E.L.D. - turns out to have corruption in it. This was the stock in trade of a number of conspiracy thrillers during the 60s and 70s, during which the world learned to distrust. It's a lesson Cap has to learn at an accelerated pace, in an emulation of those films like 'All the President's Men'.<br/><br/>To this end, the choice of Robert Redford as the calculating villain at the centre of the conspiracy is a knowingly ironic one. Redford starred in AtPM, as well as other thrillers of the type. In fact, over the 40 years of his film career, he has generally been one of Hollywood's most prominent liberal spokesmen, as well as one of its biggest stars.<br/><br/>On Cap's side are two characters who have served to weave together the Marvel film-verse, even though neither has ever had as prominent a role as they do on this occasion. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is a counterpoint to Captain America: a hero who has learned the bitter lesson of suspicion, and perhaps been blinded by it. Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson is the de facto co-star (and love interest?) as Black Widow, who goes on the run with Cap. She gets some real emotional scenes and carries them off in a way I would barely have believed if I had not seen 'Her', in which she gives a performance of unprecedented subtlety, showing me for the first time that she really can act.<br/><br/>What the film does well, it does *very* well. The action scenes are exciting, with some cool touches in the fight choreography, and the political allegory, if a bit unsubtle, is forcefully put and well illustrated. If I have any criticisms, they are as follows:<br/><br/>1. The Winter Soldier character himself was pretty peripheral to the overall plot, and his story was never very well explained. I was left feeling like there was a lot more to tell, but surely this, being the movie with him in the title, was the one in which that should have been told.<br/><br/>2. Toby Jones' character, Dr. Arnim Zola, giving what amounts to a massive plot info-dump. Having to explain so much of the story in one expository lump is a sign of lazy writing. His explanation for doing so is not very good either.<br/><br/>The modern comic book action and the tense, morally ambivalent political games don't quite sit comfortably alongside each other but, if you were going to put them together, this film is probably the best result you could hope for."

In some cases this is the way, that the selling point are the noise and special effects, but Winter Soldier remembers that it is important to draw the viewer in because if they even sort of care about what is happening then the film will be better for it. It does this by having a plot that is made to appear smarter than it is by way of being topical (protection v freedom), and then building lots of events and plotting around it, and, when in doubt, finish every scene with either a dramatic pause or an action sequence.<br/><br/>It is a formula that mostly works. Okay, it is a genre film at the end of the day and the money is all up on the screen with great effects work and technical design which produces some noisy and exciting action sequences, but it is the rapidly moving and building plot that helps keep the viewer engaged rather than just pushed back in the chair as an observer. There is still an element of this though, and there are aspects of the film that feel too busy with so many characters coming and going, and so little time to really take a minute without guns and shouting. The broad topicality of the plot helps this but in addition the writers have just about scattered enough character and banter through the script to help that side too.<br/><br/>The cast are part of this and mostly they judge their performances right in that they have to appear to be more than caricatures, but at the same time nobody is looking for great character development here. Evans is likable in the lead, while Johansson, Jackson, Redford, Mackie, Grillo and others all know what they are doing and by the sheer force of presence, they help the film feel more robust than it is. Most importantly, even when the cast do essentially just become special effects, they do not feel like they are.<br/><br/>Winter Soldier is a big entertaining film with plenty of action and event, however it is still a genre movie and has its limits. The plot is not as smart as it suggests but gets by on topicality, while at the same time we have almost too many characters and plotting kicking around â€“ most notably the character of the sub-title is more about setting up another film and not delivering in this one. It still works though, with a good pace and action throughout, delivering good summer entertainment."
"haosstoposto","8","0","1","29 September 2014"," Excellent sequel with many interesting action sequences
","First installment of CA was a very ordinary movie. Thin plot and some generic action scenes. But this time we have something bigger with just a few plot holes. At the beginning of the movie we see Captain in a rescue mission on a ship and all the action scenes look fresh and well thought out. Main story of the movie in interwoven with the events in the series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and it is a nice move from the producers. As for the story I have one objection. The main enemy of Shield, Naci-organization Hydra wants to impose their world view on the USA. They realized that in the WW2 they failed because they tried to do this by force. This time they want to persuade the Americans to do that for them out of free choice. All good but why then did they try to eliminate hundreds of thousands of Americans to achieve that goal? They made the same mistake they tried to avoid, but blame it on Hollywood. Lately, there are many movies with some major plot holes. As for Captains opponent, the Winter Soldier, we have some real nemesis for our captain and hopefully we will see him in the future also. All in all, a solid action/sci fi movie. You will not be bored."

","Over the past few years, we have seen a flood of superhero films like Batman, Spider man, Iron Man, Superman, etc.<br/><br/>If you look closely, all Superhero films have a similar story...a battle between good vs evil and add to that the super hero fighting some demons inside him or adjusting to his double life.<br/><br/>Frankly, I thought Captain America - The Winter Soldier would be of the above but to my utter surprise..its none. And I would give a round of applause to the writers and the directors for the surprise.<br/><br/>What makes this movie different is that the writers blend a superhero story with a good old fashion spy story. So within an hour of the film, our superhero is a man of the run. He becomes the hunted and is hunted by the same organization that he works for. <br/><br/>The middle part of the films pans out into a good cat mouse game with the Captain and along with Black Widow seeking answers and staying ahead of SHIELD. We as the audience slowly get the answers leading to a well executed climax.<br/><br/>Even the 1st action sequence in the movie will put you in two minds whether you are watching a spy film or a superhero film..!!<br/><br/>Evans makes a fine Captain America and plays the part well. Johansson is top form as the Black Widow. Loved the running gag between them over the Captain dating a woman. Jackson is as usual as Nick Fury. But the surprise here is veteran Robert Redford who plays Fury's boss.<br/><br/>Overall...a fine film and a must watch especially for spy movie lovers."
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","1","25 September 2014"," Fits the Marvel standards and blends the past and present of the story well.
","So far, this ranks as my second favorite movie of the year behind the Amazing Spiderman 2. However, it will likely fall to third after I see the Battle of Five Armies. It adopts the popular theme of being a superhero movie that can appeal to more than just (please excuse this term) comic book nerds (I feel okay saying that because I am a nerd of various things myself). It isn't as cinematically dignified as the Dark Knight trilogy, but it comes closer than most. The action and plot line are a step up in intensity from the previous film from 2011. Steve Rogers is one of very few modern action characters that can be a one man wrecking machine without using any form of firearm. Even with modern weaponry, he can still be as potent as he was in the forties and more. As to the plot, it is fairly intricate with many double crossings, mostly involving Nick Fury. It keeps the trend that Marvel has been sticking with of basing the conclusion on the placement of a certain small but powerful object. Some of Steve's past comes back into play as well. Obviously, there can't be too many of the same characters from the first movie considering the time-lapse predicament. Still, the main role is the same and there are a few familiar faces from Avengers. Captain America wins the selfless superhero award. In all three of his recent cinematic appearances his intents are never focused upon himself. Now, this particular trait may not be humanly plausible, but most people alive now don't know what kind of things were valued back in the forties. Still, his selflessness becomes contagious in this installment as he convinces Nick Fury and Black Widow to put aside their directives and desires to do what is morally best. As a result, it is not surprise that S.H.I.E.L.D. meets its demise at the end. There simply is too much corruption in it for it to keep functioning correctly. My favorite new face was Sam Wilson/ the Falcon. His wings that he uses are pretty cool, and he's a good character besides that. He mostly serves as a trustworthy friend and battle partner to Steve, which is a pretty valuable thing considering the circumstances. Black Widow shows a bit more of her ability to be more than a brawny agent, something that Steve lacks in some areas due to his unfamiliarity with modern culture. Nick Fury has some of his dark side shown, but ends up remaining a protagonist. He proves that you can never count someone out in movies like this no matter how certain you are that they're dead. The biggest foe that comes up in this movie is Bucky Dent/The Winter Soldier, who sort of has to go through the same thing that Steve did, but with the added factor of brainwashing. He is the biggest challenge for Captain America both combatively and emotionally. Their face-off at the end is great in both conflict resolutions. The execution has no evident flaws and even a few notable strengths in some of the music and screenplay. As always, I will end with recommendations. It's good for any fan of Marvel, action, superheroes, or diplomatic intrigues. It has a fair amount of action that can fit into both spy movies and sci-fi war movies. There are dashes of humor in it, but that is sort of an added bonus rather than an actual element. So, if you're interested, it's worth the five dollar rental fee. Overall Rating: 8.5/10."

","Steve Rogers works with S.H.I.E.L.D. in the sufficiently successful second installment.<br/><br/>Rogers is the dutiful soldier following orders under the direction of Nick Fury and guidance of Natasha Romanoff while working for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. When it becomes apparent the agency is compromised, Captain America must contest authority to discover the rogue agents and combat the Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>Though Captain America: The First Avenger did not insinuate a clear plot for a sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier follows the Marvel movie method of success with excellent action scenes, cheeky dialogue and satisfactory story lines. To compensate for a mildly contrived and formulaic plot, Marvel Studios ups the action ante with seriously well choreographed action, fight and stunt scenes.<br/><br/>The first impressive scene occurs right at the cusp of disappointment, thankfully for the screenwriters. Not groundbreaking but saliently well orchestrated, figurative hats-off to the Stunts department and fight choreographer James Young and stunt coordinator Thomas Robinson Harper. The Winter Soldier action scenes have the unique ability to be easy to follow while being energetically charged and fast paced. A substantial downgrade regarding the overall impression of the film would have taken place were it not for the steady onslaught of remarkable but integrated imagery.<br/><br/>While still coming to terms and not quite okay with the casting of Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, The Winter Soldier features her prevalently to make up for the lack of her own film and story arc. In doing so, the whole first thirty minutes of the second film is a bit sluggish, forced, and complicated, in order to integrate her properly into the Captain America milieu. Once the film finally gains speed, the audience is relegated to inferior and basic textbook 'bad guy' behavior that cheapens the Marvel brand.<br/><br/>Though dubious at first, in the end the relationship dynamic between Fury, Romanoff and Rogers is reasonable enough to make way for the final Captain America installment of the franchise.<br/><br/>See FULL reviews of recent releases by going to our website!"

"bardia-moose","10","0","1","23 September 2014"," Marvel Studio's answer to The Dark Knight
","The best Marvel Cinematic Universe film there has ever been, with the exception of The Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is first and foremost a political thriller with the essence of a superhero movie. Returning to the role of Steve Rodgers, I can safely and assuredly say that Chris Evans is Captain America. One of the best parts of this sequel was the chemistry between the actors, especially between Evans and Scarlett Johansson. The dialogue they share stays compelling and doesn't feel forced at all. And speaking about not feeling forced, Anthony Mackie joins the cast as The Falcon. This could've easily been one of the weak points of the film, as history has proved that the addition of a sidekick tends to backfire on the film. However, Mackie does a great job in providing humour and playing a character that Rodgers can truly identify with and befriend, as they are both war veterans and have similar outlooks on life. Samuel Jackson has appeared in his fair share of Marvel films, yet he was always just a voice in the background. That couldn't be farther from the truth in Marvel's newest addition to their cinematic universe because Nick Fury finally gets down and gritty. The action has never been better and greater than they are here. From the martial arts style fights to the epic set piece battles to an incredibly shot car chase scene, this film will not only amaze superhero fans but action fans as well. Many people are interested about the Winter Soldier and if he is a worthy and menacing antagonist, and the answer to that question is an emphatic yes. Sebastian Stans's performances reminds me of Tom Hardy's Bane from The Dark Knight Rises in that both men have most of their face covered, with their eyes telling a story all on their own. Being the figure in the shadows and suddenly appearing out of nowhere throughout the movie was fantastic as it helped maintain the tone that the directors were gunning for. This is Marvel's response to The Dark Knight in terms of its dark and gritty approach, tackling spy and political themes that are very relevant in today's world. The Russo brother's directing of this film, I think, was probably the best aspect of it. They did a marvellous job in transitioning from the action scenes to the comedy, and then to the emotional character driven moments. Not to be out shined, the script was the best of the Marvel movies, and a large part of that was the character development, which some superhero movies tend to lack. Is it a great superhero movie? Yes. Is it a great MOVIE? Yes. Does it take the genre and go beyond its own limitations and journey into uncharted territory, just as The Dark Knight did? Yes. This is truly an exciting time to be living in."
"iamelte","9","0","1","22 September 2014"," An intriguing action spectacle
","The Winter Soldier provides visually striking action set pieces with a gripping plot that resonates various political themes that question the ethical considerations of national security and the limits of military control. <br/><br/>The audience is provided with an intriguing moral compass embodied in the character of Steve Rogers who serves as a perspective to the new elaborate systems that SHIELD intend to use as a means to fight foreign threat. While Captain America appeared in previous Marvel instalments as a proverbial image of the American way without much depth, here he is given the emotional and philosophical development needed to appreciate his character. The film is given an opportunity that was denied in the avengers due to the abundance of main characters to focus on the hero's struggle to adapt to the modern world that is both technologically and morally convoluted. <br/><br/>The fight sequences are also portrayed with intensity and realism without overblown special effects, which makes them more satisfying and comprehensive. There is also a great deal of emotional intensity created between Rogers and the primary antagonist of the movie making the fight sequences both visually and emotionally compelling and painful in some places. Along with its effective action sequences and political themes, The Winter Soldier is much more than an action film, it delves deep into the issues of national fears, paranoia, political exploitation and questions of morality which is a surprising mixture of elements to be found in a marvel film."

","We're done with Iron Man 3 and Thor 2: The Dark World, now Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe brings us Captain America: The Winter Solder. From Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors of You, Me, and Dupree- no, you didn't read that wrong- comes the follow-up to the 2011 superhero flick Captain America: The First Avenger. Taking place 2 years after the events from The Avengers, we find Steve Rogers working with S.H.I.E.L.D while simultaneously trying to adapt to the new world. But all isn't what it seems as Steve, with the help of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and the new-edition to the team Sam Wilson AKA Falcon (Anthony Mackie), begins to unravel a conspiracy in SHIELD and tries to uncover the truth behind the deadly assassin known as the Winter Soldier. There have been many superhero movies in the past 9 years or so. We've seen comic book material be adapted to the screen in a multitude of different ways. We've seen it done dark and gritty like in The Dark Knight, we've seen it done light and witty like in Iron Man, and then we saw whatever the hell Green Lantern was doing. If there is anything we've learned from all of this, it's that Hollywood hasn't completely nailed down a sustainable formula for how to make a great comic book movie. Both ways certainly have their flaws; many people don't like the constant comedy in the Marvel movies, and many people don't like the feeling of sadness and depression one gets from watching a DC movie- very hard to pick. Sarcasm aside, I find myself leaning towards Marvel. While I'm all for trying something new and I do think that The Dark Knight is the best comic book movie to date, it's also the only film using that formula that I really cared for. Batman Begins was fine, but The Dark Knight Rises and Man of Steel never sat right with me. Rises was probably one of the messiest and worst written superhero films I've seen, and Man of Steel was DOA by using a tone that didn't mesh well with the source material- in my opinion. So naturally, I went into this movie fully aware that it could be great or it could be a disappointment; especially seeing as how comic book movies seem to be hit-or-miss of late. I'm thrilled to say, it was great. In fact, it very well may be one of the best superhero movies ever made, and that IS saying a lot. There's so much that this film did well, like the action. The action scenes in this film were extremely well-choreographed and even better, they were timed perfectly. They were spread apart well so that each fight scene was included to move the plot forward, not to just have cool stuff on screen. It's just like what George Lucas once said, ""Special effects are just a tool, a means of telling a story. People have a tendency to confuse them as an end to themselves. A Special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing."" I of all people understand the irony of George Lucas saying this, but regardless, it's still true. The Russo brothers as well as the screenwriters have a grasp on this concept; something Zack Snyder needs. While the action was excellent, what really made this movie shine was the plot. The Dark Knight was so ground-breaking because it took it's comic book source material and turned it into a crime thriller. Captain America 2 is just as ground-breaking, for it decided to deviate from the past Marvel movies and effectively make a 70's-ish political spy thriller. At the beginning of this review I made a point of saying that there is a clear difference in tone when it comes to DC and Marvel. DC is dark and realistic, and Marvel is more fantastical and light. This was probably the first film in the MCU that began to cross that line. It brilliantly took the realism and seriousness in plot from DC, while also maintaining the witty humor in dialogue and fun from Marvel. A perfect combination for a near-perfect film. In the end, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is undoubtedly one the best comic book movies today, if not one of the best action movies today. It has a great plot and great characters. The lead villain is terrifying and actually poses as a good threat to not just Cap but everyone. There's great action while also delivering a thought-provoking and surprisingly heartfelt story. It may not reach the levels of epicness proudly owned by The Dark Knight and The Avengers, but it comes pretty darn close; and it gives me hope that we are on track to reach that level once again."
"bjhomeboy08","8","0","1","18 September 2014"," An outstanding action/espionage film that delivers a huge punch.
","After several months of hearing how good this film was I was giddy to finally have the opportunity to watch this on Blu Ray, and thankfully the film exceeded my expectations. <br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent action espionage film that keeps you glued to your seat but also delivers a message that closely hits home. I would easily put Winter Soldier with Skyfall and Ghost Protocol as the three best espionage films within the last 5 years. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is expertly paced, which is essential for any espionage film. And much credit to Chris Evans for his excellent performance as Captain America. One flaw I had with the first film was that Captain America didn't feel special, nor did I believe he was a true superhero; I identified him more as a soldier than a comic book super hero. But the Winter Soldier changes that and even propelled Captain America as one of my favorite superheroes to date. <br/><br/>This film does an excellent job in showing you just why Captain America is such a beloved character. Not only can he whoop some serious butt but he also embodies what we as people and as Americans should strive for and achieve, something that the other superhero films lack. <br/><br/>Another bright spot to this film was Samuel L. Jackson's performance as Nick Fury. Unlike other films, Fury is often times in the back- fold and plays more of a secondary character rather than a omniscient powerful presence that his character demands. But this film flips that, and even gives Fury the spotlight for one intense action sequence. <br/><br/>But the film is far from perfect. Scarlett Johansson's performance as Black Widow was exciting but lacked any depth, although the banter between Evans and Johansson was light-hearted and fun. My biggest problem of the film was the main villain Alexander Pierce, portrayed by Robert Redford. Pierce lacked that villainous presence and simply felt forced upon, much like the main villain from Iron Man 3, portrayed by Guy Pearce. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an incredibly exciting film that should please any moviegoer. The film is wonderfully paced, has incredible CGI, excellent actions scenes, and most importantly, it has a message that isn't shoved down your throat but has a lasting impact long after you finish watching. I'd highly recommend purchasing this film! I'll give this movie 8.7 out of 10!"

","Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) is now in the present day (he was in a suspended animation from 1945) has been told that Shield has been compromised and to trust no one. Hydra is the organization that wants to take over the whole world giving all freedom, but induced by fear - so no freedoms for us, you see. Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) are the only ones he can count on. Can they destroy Hydra? Inquiring Minds want to know. <br/><br/>I took this out for the CGI and found that this has a pretty good story, great cinematography, very good acting, great fighting/action stunts whether CGI or real and a pacing that kept me engaged all the way through. Yes, a lot of CGI and other stunts but there was time to get to know the story, and characters. Kudos. <br/><br/>In the beginning, Steve Rogers jumps out of a plane. Someone asks, ""Did he have a parachute on?"" No was the answer. How good is that? Thought so. <br/><br/>The stunts whether CGI or real were fantastic and didn't run too long like most CGI in other movies. Loud sounds accompanied many stunts and were spot on. Of course, I jumped involuntarily, of course, at the appropriate times. Didn't plan on it - just happened. You may jump at times, too. <br/><br/>Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson were very good. I think Scarlett Johansson could be considered the best Woman Actor on the planet. She is exceptional in everything. Hey, Clint Eastwood, take a look at the female side and let's hear from you. <br/><br/>Supporting cast members Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury were great. In case you are wondering, Jackson didn't pontificate and kept his voice conversational. I thought I saw him struggling with that. HA!<br/><br/>There is somewhat a surprise regarding the one known as The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). And you probably thought Captain America was the Winter Soldier. Not so. But, truth be told I thought so too. <br/><br/>One thing did bother me a little. Alexander Pierce says to Nick Fury, at one moment, in the beginning that Fury needs to get Iron Man to visit his daughter's party. Why mention Iron Man if he, Iron Man, wasn't to be used in here? Hey, the whole Avenger Crew could have been used. Didn't happen. <br/><br/>Stan Lee has a short cameo.<br/><br/>After the credits run the first time, stay with the DVD as there are scenes that purport to show us the upcoming sequel for the next time.

"KnightsofNi11","7","0","1","4 September 2014"," The Cap is finally cool
","Before the monster success of Guardian's of the Galaxy Marvel had one other 2014 release; the second installment in the Captain America franchise, The Winter Soldier. This time, we're out of the 1940's and into present day, allegedly two years after the events of 2012's The Avengers. The Captain is still trying to adjust to 21st century life, a task that becomes a lot more difficult when S.H.I.E.L.D. commander in chief Nick Fury comes to tell him that the agency in charge of organizing and peacekeeping with these superheroes, is compromised and that there's a great big shitstorm headed in the direction of Cap, Black Widow, Fury, and the rest of the ""good guys."" Then, to make matters worse, Cap's world is rocked when he encounters the film's sub-titular (assuming that's a word) character, an incredibly dangerous assassin known only as The Winter Soldier. <br/><br/>I really have to give Marvel kudos for what they are able to do with their wide span of stories and characters. With such a wide array they are able to make each of their films vastly different in tone and genre. In the span of a few months the studio was able to release a political espionage thriller and a tongue-in-cheek sci-fi space opera all part of the same wonderfully vast universe. I love that they are able to do this so effectively, and I have unending admiration for their ability to have each of their films feel like a breath of fresh air, never rehashing the same superhero narrative. <br/><br/>In the same way that Guardians of the Galaxy succeeded greatly at being a sci-fi epic with a comic book backdrop Winter Soldier works equally well as a political spy thriller with a comic book backdrop. It might not have the depth of films like Three Days of the Condor or All the Presidents Men, but it certainly succeeds at matching tone and style, and then injecting itself with a healthy dose of Marvel Studios explodey action set pieces. These two elements go together surprisingly well, albeit the superhero presence certainly helps. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is an unabashed action packed spectacle that never lets up on the explosions or gunfire for too long. This is a Marvel film that packs a punch and it's proud of that. The film, for better or worse, takes itself more seriously than previous Marvel flicks. The usual cheeseball sense of humor that Marvel movies has is far more subtle in Winter Soldier, with high stakes action and emotional weight attempting to take its place. On one hand the film's grave tone is a downfall because you can only take a movie about a a guy in blue following around a one-eyed Sam Jackson so seriously. On the other hand, it's nice to see a Marvel film geared towards a slightly older and more mature crowd, contrasting Guardians of the Galaxy's younger target demographic, a demographic that I guess I still fit into. Regardless, I still stand by my breath of fresh air comment. <br/><br/>Now I want to take a second to talk about the film's titular character, because some serious improvements were made here. The first installment of Cap's franchise didn't get me too worked up and I think the biggest reason was that I couldn't connect to Captain America's do-goody boy scout character devoid of any internal or personal conflict. Cap is the same golden boy as he was in the first film, but he's learning and coping with how you can't trust just anybody in a society full of deception and hidden agendas, and watching Steve Rogers as a man just trying to deal with this harsh reality is far more interesting to me than the do-no-wrong Captain of the first film. <br/><br/>Also, the Cap is just more badass in Winter Soldier. On top of being a more engaging character, he kicks literal ass. The fight choreography is wicked thrilling, and Cap's extensive use of his iconic shield makes him so much more memorable than he's been in his previous appearances. I think Winter Soldier finally made this superhero cool, and no longer just some pretty boy goody-goody. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier may not be the deepest story with the best acting and the best script, but when we're talking superhero films it's still pretty damn good. It suffers from on-the-nose dialogue and unnecessarily lengthy exposition, reminding us that this is a Hollywood franchise film, but still manages to be another Marvel success. Even if The Winter Soldier isn't the greatest movie in the world the studio should be immensely grateful to directors Joe and Anthony Russo who took the only Avengers member I hadn't yet warmed up to and finally making him a true American badass."

I liked that Nick Fury had more than just an extended cameo with maybe the most exiting part of the whole movie. The action overall is very good, with a number of almost Raid style hand-to-hand fights, only of course the're not as brutal or bloody, and there's more going on in terms of story here than the usual big-budget blockbuster.

He didn't want to kill anyone, he wasn't trying to get even with anyone, he just plain didn't like bullies. The Winter Soldier' not only satisfies with its plentiful action scenes, it also offers some intriguing commentary on the current political and world climate, and turns out to be a sterling character piece. Scarlett Johansson's sassy, snarky Black Widow provides some of the film's best moments, delivering quips and back flips with equal panache. Marvel did an excellent job to let Chris Evans play the role of Captain, I mean whole thrilling action through out the movie, Only some actors can do that and Chris Evans is one of them."
"CMTiago","9","0","2","31 August 2014"," Stealth action in Cap. movie makes for a terrific approach
","The Winter Soldier is the best sequel possible to the Captain America story arc. With fast and furious combat scenes, as well as some spy intricacies, Marvel has made a movie that has become a stand out, in the sense that it offers a slightly different product.<br/><br/>After being frozen for 70 years, Steve Rogers must now find a way to live in the modern world by coping with the changes occurred and his perception of things like they are. He is being used as an asset for SHIELD in missions but doesn't seem to fully agree with some of Nick Fury's more obscure intentions. When SHIELD becomes compromised by the resurgence of HYDRA, Cap, Black Widow & Falcon are framed for Director Fury's death and in the process are declared fugitives. Now they must find a way to overtake HYDRA, which means a confrontation with The Winter Soldier, who is incarnated by Bucky Barnes, Rogers's old friend, and may even mean the destruction of SHIELD itself.<br/><br/>Captain America may in fact present itself as an Superhero Action flick, with great emphasis on Action. The fight sequences in the film are quite possibly the best Marvel Studios has created. Knifes, guns, punches, kicks, etc. The fights are entertaining as is the overall presentation of the confrontations. The political and surveillance themes in the story are a good backdrop in the movie as they show us what a character like Captain America has to deal with. I usually tend to give the acting a pass in comic book movies, as long as it's not totally incompetent. In this movie I would say the veteran Redford was very natural and charismatic in his role and the one who stood out.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier is definitely a Marvel movie worth seeing as it brings great excitement and a solid plot to the table. As a fan of these movies, I can't wait to see more from Marvel and I sincerely hope they keep up the good work.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","Watching this movie I had but one thing in mind at first...how horribly horrendous the first Captain America movie was. About 30 minutes in I realized this is the kinda movie you'd expect the makers of Iron man and The Avengers to deliver. I might have even enjoyed it a bit more than I should because my expectations were seriously low, but that doesn't mean this wasn't a well executed Action blockbuster in anyway.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and actually one you can follow even tho it sometimes seemed like another clichéd bad guys take over the world thing, but lets be fair you could never really expect more of this type of movies. Chris Evan's performance was a major improvement over the first one but I still believe he was not appropriate for this role to begin with, he doesn't seem to be able to deliver the Patriotic Super soldier persona required in this movie like he could deliver the one needed for him to be the Human torch in the fantastic four (which he did really well, to be fair again)<br/><br/>The Action scenes and Cgi were pretty well done, the melee scenes were well choreographed as well, and the movie packs a number of plot twists that keep rekindling the suspense every half an hour or so.<br/><br/>This is a definite must see for anyone who ever enjoyed any Marvel and/or Superhero movies ever before...don't let the terrible experience with the first Cap America movie stop you"

Sure, the crazy Nazi Dr antagonist speaks for it. But the theme is all about the world of BIG data, the willingness of lawmakers to use it and the militarization of law enforcement.

"jbrowning-w","9","0","3","20 August 2014"," The price of freedom is high, but it's a price I'm willing to pay!
","Stunning. Epic. Perfected. This film hits the nail on everything. I am a huge comic book fan and not many comic book based films get my stamp of approval, but this, I have a soft spot for this film. It takes the classic American hero who helped us through the struggles of World War Two, and managed to show the finest human qualities through him.<br/><br/>If I am asked to think of the perfect superhero movie, will not think of The Dark Knight. I will think of this. The Dark Knight is the best film ever to me but not a perfect superhero film. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is so well structured that it allows space for Captain America, Nick Fury, Natasha (Black Widow), and Sam Wilson to grow and develop. Captain America becomes more trusting after he found he was too trustful in Avenegers. This film sees him find the perfect balance of trust. Natasha becomes secure about herself. Fury starts to think like a good guy instead of a soldier and finally, Sam Wilson, AKA Falcon, becomes Steve Rogers' partner.<br/><br/>I also love the reveals in this movie. Fury dying and then coming back. The Winter Soldier is Steve's best friend, Bucky (knew that anyway but still fun to see), and I was surprised to see that story of S.H.I.E.L.D and hydra being one and the same. Perfect way to connect all of the Marvel films so far.<br/><br/>The First Avenger really just connect all phase 1 films together. Winter Soldier does the same but uses multiple different connections like the politician from Iron Man 2 or the S.H.I.E.L.D agent from the Avengers. <br/><br/>I also loved Natasha and Steve's connection in this film. It felt genuine and exceptionally special for a superhero movie to have such a good, saphisticated and intrigue relationship between two characters.<br/><br/>The action is perfectly done and the fighting is beautiful. I love Mixed Martial Arts, so seeing the fighting made my heart skip beats. It even found a awesome way to add in a submission to the mix.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie amazed me and has brought me to appreciate Captain America once again. This movie is at the top of my overall favourite movies, let alone comic book based movies. This movie is a matter piece full with chills and epic action (chills best when Steve does the speech) which is why it has a special place in my heart. Well done."
"p-jonsson","9","0","3","20 August 2014"," Great superhero entertainment
","This is indeed a great piece of superhero entertainment. If superheroes and action, plenty of action, is within your sphere of interest then this movie truly delivers. There is even a story to support the stunts and special effects fireworks that is not too shabby. As a matter of fact, for being a Marvel-based movie, the story is more than acceptable.<br/><br/>As the blurb states, our hero is meeting a few adaptation issues after having been awaken into the modern world. Luckily the movie do not fall into the trap of making some silly comedy out of it but keeps these parts at a reasonable level where it stays funny without ruining the movie or disrupting the pace of the real story.<br/><br/>The story? Simple and not very original with the usual slew of traitors strewn about, you cannot trust anyone, our hero becomes a fugitive etc etc bla bla bla. It is however a pretty straightforward one which works quite well and is not getting bogged down in silly emotions and general idiotic behavior by our hero like for instance several instalments of Spider Man have done. Actually this is one thing that I really like with this movie. The hero is a true hero from start to finish without any of that modern Hollywood crap where the hero must be tarnished in one way or another to satisfy the directors and producers.<br/><br/>As I wrote above if you like superhero action movies then there is little not to like with this one. Acceptable story, plenty of action, good special effects, a cool chick (hey I am but an ordinary male, I like female actors in tight costumes) and a clear hero. None of the actors are really doing a bad job of it and in general the acting is as good as one can expect when portraying characters that, after all, are be totally ludicrous in real life. Its 8 out of 10 rating at IMDb (at the time of writing this) is well deserved. I am astonished that some people seem to have voted it down with a one star rating. It is a Marvel-based movie. You might feel it is more or less good but the style of the movie should not really be a major surprise to anyone and there is no way in hell that it deserves a one star rating unless someone really watched the wrong movie by accident."

","Captain America again has a shield the size of a large pizza. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods, and there are fisticuffs back and forth. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is a gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people, but it's also intelligent, heartfelt and riveting. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times."
"tomgillespie2002","8","0","2","18 August 2014"," Injects life and genuine excitement back into Marvel's increasingly tedious formula
","After a pretty uninspired first movie, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and given little of note to do in the superhero smash-up The Avengers (2012), Captain America (Chris Evans) was quickly becoming the dullest Marvel superhero of them all. Kudos then, to directors Anthony and Joe Russo, who have not only rounded Cap a.k.a. Steve Rogers into a sympathetic, old-school hero in the face of very 21st century dangers, but they have made the best stand-alone Marvel film to date, surpassing Iron Man (2008), and flipping the tired formula of hero- smashes-baddie completely on its head.<br/><br/>After the events of The Avengers, Captain America is finding it difficult adapting to modern life. He's working for S.H.I.E.L.D. and running rings (literally) around his fellow soldiers, such as Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), who he quickly forms a close bond with. After a successful mission taking out some pirates and rescuing some hostages, he learns that his mission differed from that of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who went along with him. Not wanting to be a mere pawn in the system and suspecting a cover-up, he confronts director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who reveals plans to launch three helicarriers, giant warships capable of great destruction and the obliteration of enemies.<br/><br/>The action soon turns to sheer paranoia, as Fury is attacked in one of the movie's best action scenes, and Cap is left to fend for himself as S.H.I.E.L.D., led by the shadowy Alexander Pierce (a wonderful against- type Robert Redford), closes around him. The only person resembling a true 'bad guy' is The Winter Soldier, a metal-armed assassin who seems to mirror Captain America's strength and agility, only with a clinical skill for murder. The Winter Soldier's identity is a poorly kept secret if you happened to be slightly paying attention in the trailer, and his presence is sadly fleeting, especially given the emotional impact his character has on Cap.<br/><br/>But this is a story skilfully told, drenched in a paranoia so prevalent in 1970's American cinema, when Robert Redford was 40 years younger and was usually running from the type he plays here. By taking this unusual and thoughtful approach, Captain America 2 truly enthrals, making us care about a hero that was once a goody-two-shoes, but is now a three dimensional man struggling to adapt to this new, crazy world, having everything he believed and loved about his country smeared in his face. Evans brings a humility to the role, and his scenes with Black Widow (given more screen-time here and lending more evidence to the need for her own stand-alone movie) sparkle with a real chemistry.<br/><br/>For all it's conspiracy plotting and character building, it's not shy on action. The slightly formulaic climax aside, we get to see Captain America finally let loose and lay a beat-down on some unfortunate fellas in close-quarters, Jason Bourne/The Raid (2011)-style. His shield is no longer just a sort of frisbee-boomerang hybrid, but a lethal weapon. But the finest, surprisingly, involves Nick Fury, a near-indestructible car, and a small fleet of cop cars. It's a fantastic film, not only down to it's well-constructed and emotionally-charged action scenes, or the inclusion of a plot you can sink your teeth into, but mainly for injecting life and genuine excitement back into Marvel's increasingly tedious formula.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"luckysud4","9","0","1","18 August 2014"," An awesome awesome move...
","It is an amazing movie. Written by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, this movie is awesome. Steve Rogers, Scarlett Johanson, Samuel L. Jackson are perfectly casted in the movie and have preformed very well. There are two organization name S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra. Hydra is criminal one inside the S.H.I.E.L.D.. A new character, the winter soldier (Sebastian Stan), introduced in this movie, makes it much more interesting. He was best friend of Captain America and now he is against the world by helping Hydra as some criminal scientists have changed his memory. Sometimes he is also called by 'Man with iron hand' as he has an machinery hand. He fights against the Captain and then there are some interesting action scenes. But Captain never wants to fight as he knows that he is still his friend and he tries to make him (winter soldier) remember the past life. So there are also some emotional scenes. In this movie, Captain America looks stronger and more refined soldier. The action and the fight scenes in this movie are just amazing. There are few twists; some of them are unexpected as the roll of Samuel L. Jackson(A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent) and some are just expected. This film deals with real life government issues such as how far should the government go to keep us safe. More the security we have; more we loose, both independence and security. Graphics in the movie looks pretty real. I enjoyed this movie very well."

","I am frankly amazed that this film currently has a rating of 8.0, this film is average at best. The metascore figure of 70 out of a 100 is much closer to the mark, although still a little high in my opinion. All I can surmise is that possibly the majority of IMDb users who have voted 8 or above stars for this film are teenagers lacking the forward thinking ability that comes later in life which renders many films, such as this, highly predictable and slightly boring despite the obvious fortune spent on CGI. That said, it is still, very much, worth a watch if you have nothing better to do, or your girlfriend is away for the weekend and you don't have any decent porn.......or friends..."
"Reno-Rangan","7","0","1","12 August 2014"," Time to have the sidekicks.
","The second movie in the series directed by Russo brothers. This time the story set in the modern world only if you are not taking 'The Avengers' in the account. The cast was expanded, I mean the sidekicks were introduced. Looked the strength of the 'good' has doubled, but the villain was also equally good. The first praising words goes the directors for handling it well and hope they are going to repeat the same magic for the next movie as well.<br/><br/>This story commence just after 'The Avengers'. Captain America and Black Widow are sent to free hostages and collect some data. Soon after the Shield director Fury is targeted by an assassin called Winter Soldier. After this incident the weight leans on Captain America, he becomes the prime suspect. With the help of Black Widow and a new wingman called Falcon, he seeks the truth. Unexpectedly the story strikes with a twist and exposes the man behind it. Once everything revealed the tension arise between good and bad before it ends with a convincing solution.<br/><br/>''Before we get started, does anyone want to get out?''<br/><br/>The escape scene of Samuel L. Jackson was awesome and I wanted it a little longer. The new addition, Falcon was another brilliant, just like the sidekick Robin from the Batman world. The story was okay, but the excellent performances and visual narration were the movie's strength. The 3D effects were better than I expected. In a few scenes I thought the villain Winter Soldier was better than the Captain America. He was a surprise package, if you just ignore the antagonist tag he can surely be your favorite from this movie. Even I liked his costume and he also performed some great stunts.<br/><br/>One thing I fascinated about this production house's movie are the post-credit scenes. Yeah, this movie had one too, but that particular scene created lots of curiosity. A good movie and will definitely pass the test being a follow-up either after 'The Avengers' or to 'The First Avenger'. Again Marvel did a wonder job. Just keep those coming, and it will be well backed by the audience if it is worth. The good days are just began for sci-fi and superhero themes. I think I said it every time during Marvel's movie reviews. One last reminder for all that don't miss any marvel's movies because the stories and characters are connected each other since the 'The Avengers' made a debut."

","As the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, I was pleased to see how DC connected completely different timeframes and plots into a unifying film. After a subpar first movie in this series, my expectations were low to say the least. The Winter Soldier surely surpassed them. <br/><br/>People consider Captain America to be freedom and justice encapsulated into a super-human body. As S.H.I.E.L.D (the organization Captain America aids) becomes more and more powerful, people with alternate perspectives begin to corrupt the freedoms of the public. When times turn dark, it's hard to see who's really on which side.<br/><br/>Sharing numerous parallels with modern society (and past cultures), it introduces how passive and compliant citizens are to governments that readily take advantage, commit heinous crimes and infringe on the very rights these respective nations are built upon. People are resistant to change when they have a pleasing, comfortable lifestyle. Unfortunately, their unwillingness to rebel blinds them by the valueless pleasures that are offered instead. <br/><br/>I enjoyed Captain America because it reminds everyone of the evil people are capable of, but also the good. We may feel alone fighting a battler, but truly never are."
"pcrprimer","9","0","1","10 August 2014"," Captain America cements its position as one of the best cinematic heroes
","The first Captain America movie set up a great backstory to Captain America, and the Avengers made the Captain even more likable. This movie shows just how cool the Captain can be. One of the standout points of this movie was the amazingly realistic fight scenes. During each fight, as a viewer, you could feel the impact of each punch and kick. Plus its interestingly realistic how the Captain literally runs from point A to point B, and also runs through each fight. One of the nitpicks of the movie was how with the Nick Fury story arc. There's a certain reoccurring pattern that you can observe in the Marvel movies, and it takes away some of the tension. Also, it really seemed that Black Widow was trying too hard to have quips."

"TBoSH-TDK","9","0","2","4 August 2014"," Very good movie, the best from Marvel Studios?
","Marvel Studios took a bold step back in 2008 with Iron Man (2008), which was both critically and commercially successful, but sadly things only got worse and worse from then on. When they announced Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it was clear that there was potential, seeing as how the first half of 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger is probably some of the best material in superhero origin movies.<br/><br/>'The Winter Soldier' delivers as much as it possibly could; Chris Evans becomes Captain America in this movie and absorbs the role of this patriotic ex-soldier who goes from seeing the world in black and white to noticing the gray in between and carries this entire film. Scarlett Johansson plays the Black Widow once again and she finally shows some more than just being cool and agile, but she's not a character that'll stay with you 'til the end of the year; at least you will remember she was here. Anthony Mackie is good as Sam Wilson/Falcon, even though he is very much two-dimensional and a comic relief, but he works and his action scenes flying (that could be counted with the fingers in one hand) are really impressive. Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier is, to me, on par with Chris Evans in both performance and overall character, being the only (?) other person from the 40's to be in present day and having his memory constantly erased to be a mercenary. Robert Redford and Samuel L. Jackson are good as well. The performances aren't exactly top- notch, but they're (arguably) the best on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Like Watchmen, this film takes the 'does the end justify the means?' question and uses it as a recurring theme throughout the film; there is also, as mentioned earlier, a lot of learning we don't live in a world in black and white anymore, and there's trust as well. Considering how much themes I've mentioned, this could've been as good as The Dark Knight, but it sadly is not. There are a lot of themes and a lot of commentary (that I'll get to in a minute) which could definitely be taken more seriously had there not been so many scenes that were dedicated mostly to comedy, but the way it's done it is, still, arguably the best usage of themes in the MCU.<br/><br/>The social commentary is mostly about, again, the ends justifying the means and more importantly, vigilance being the price of safety; in Benjamin Franklin's words ''He who sacrifices freedom for security deserves neither'' with (S.H.I.E.L.D.'s) Project Insight, which consists of targeting all possible threats and neutralizing them.<br/><br/>The score is mostly forgettable, which is a disappointment considering Alan Silvestri's jaw-dropping Captain America score in the first movie.<br/><br/>The villain is overall HYDRA, which means trouble, since we don't get to know Alexander Pierce(basically who represents HYDRA in this movie)'s motivations. Bucky is a victim, not the villain.<br/><br/>The film is, however, saved by technical aspects. The Russo brothers did a great job of mixing practical effects (God, I missed those) and CGI to create a more grounded in reality superhero movie that has action you actually care about.<br/><br/>Action, excitement, emotion, themes, commentary, solid performances, an intelligent script, and good characters make Captain America: The Winter Soldier one of the best Marvel films and hopefully also one that means they're finally starting to take things more seriously.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This is one of those movies that fit with the times of it's release. With a nation under surveillance, drones flying the globe, a questionable administration, this movie makes no bones about where it stands. It is probably the best political movie disguised as a super hero movie in decades. Captain America is still on a journey to understand his new present day. After a nice set up through a little humor where we meet Sam Wilson, after this fateful meeting we get started with Black Widow and Cap on a mission to save a ship full of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents being held by none other than Batroc the Leaper. After a fun filled action sequence, we find Black Widow doing what she does best, espionage. Cap not liking the fact the mission has sub missions he knew nothing about, he faces Fury about it, not knowing Fury set the whole thing up. Once Fury's superiors realize what he has done, he (Fury) goes to the one man he can trust. Cap. After telling him just enough to give Cap what he needs to start his quest. Cap and Natasha go on a mission against seemingly everyone and eventually team up with Sam Wilson, who nails his role as Falcon. As they search for answer against gov't foes and the mysterious Winter Soldier, the risks become more then anyone could imagine. To not give away the entire plot, I'll leave it there. This movie has quickly become one of my all time favorites. Probably one of the greatest super hero movies put to film. Great story, action and visual effects (only used when absolutely necessary), it is entertainment that makes you think. Certainly about current events, but not to the point of pointing fingers at anyone. ""This isn't freedom. This is fear."""
"cresd3","10","0","1","1 August 2014"," One Of The Best Movies Ever
","WARNING: This review contains spoilers for The Winter Soldier, may seem to dis The Dark Knight Trilogy (which I love, just not as much as this movie) and somehow, contains spoilers for Harry Potter and the Half- Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows part 1 and Deathly Hallows part 2. I seriously don't know how that happened. I left reviewing this film for so long and I really wanted it to be the first film I reviewed I think I may have over-thought. I have bracketed the spoilers in the word SPOILER! to warn you, so if you don't want spoilers, look out. <br/><br/>I seriously cannot believe that the entire Dark Knight Trilogy is rated above the Winter Soldier. I truly believe that The Dark Knight is the best superhero movie made so far (best but not my favourite-BIG difference)but Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises are long winded and (at points) boring.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier completely surprised me when it came out. The movie was truly brilliant and the plot-line was near perfect. In this movie they introduce some new characters and bring back some old ones. This movie was perfectly paced and the plot was not only interesting but also understandable. With many superhero movies the plot is often 'Stop the aliens in a heroic way' or 'Fight the bad guy in a heroic way' (this obviously does not take into account origins stories and sub-plots). This movie is truly different with a thriller/conspiracy storyline. It references past avengers movies and characters but is easily watchable as long as you know the basic story lines to The First Avenger and Avengers Assemble.<br/><br/>The characters were portrayed brilliantly in this movie. However, I will say there was not much character development besides with the winter soldier. Nick Fury was finally made likable to a wide audience while still being slightly manipulative. He is basically the Dumbledore of The Winter Soldier, using his 'death' to manipulate people.<br/><br/>The dialogue isn't the best in the world although it was delivered expertly. There was however beautiful dialogue exchanged between two characters who may just be mentioned in the title in the pivotal fight of the movie which- I'm not gonna lie- made me cry.<br/><br/>This of course brings me to what was truly awesome in this movie. The fight scenes. How the shield is used, how the setting is used, how sound effects and visual effects are used in this movie to create unbelievable fight scenes make the movie worth watching alone. They do what is possibly my favourite thing in superhero and action movies right now: They fight in broad daylight! Seriously, unless characters and weapons are lit up (which, if done wrong can look like a session of cool but tacky laser quest)then fights in darkness are just hard to see. Daylight adds more of a dramatic edge while also being perfectly visible. Yay! They use darkness in this movie, but thankfully, only for mysterious and tense moments. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie made me like Captain America and Nick Fury again, convinced me even more that Black Widow and The Winter Soldier are awesome, and even if your primary thought throughout this movie is 'IT'S ROBIN SCHERBATSKY'(the main comment from who I went to see this movie with and hadn't seen Avengers), you'll love it anyway. It is unbelievably underrated and was under-advertised. If you haven't seen it already (What are you waiting for? It's been months!)then I strongly (very strongly) suggest you do. I cannot wait to re-watch it when it comes out on DVD. I hope you enjoyed this review and love/will love the movie as much as I do."

","So in short, this is what happens when you get Ed Brubaker to write the story (If not the script in full) to a Marvel movie, especially one he started on - you get the finest story and plot for a Marvel Avengers movie yet.<br/><br/>You may notice I don't say best; I'll get to my nitpicks later. In this story, we get one of those pleasurable superhero comic book movies that is so enjoyable and engaging because it's ABOUT something, and in this case it's the Captain America movie for our times. Where the first film was a good old flag waving salute to world war two, and perhaps would be best seen in that context, Winter Soldier is for the America of Wikileaks and Edward Snowden, a time when secrets are being unveiled left and right and the NSA is probably everywhere and reading as I type out this review right now. And as a story I preferred only the first half of the first avenger more for its socio-political context before it became a two dimensional portrait of heroism - but here socio-political is the name of the game.<br/><br/>What happens in the film is fairly complex to go into spoilers which... ah screw it, its Hydra. they're back, they're really the ""I was the one- armed man all along"" sort of thing, and the conflict, what really gets the story to be so impactful, is the large scope of trust. Who do you trust, who do you become paranoid of (especially when there is already suspicion, following what happened with New York), and what happens when the Good American super soldier has to be surrounded by complete uncertainty ? And more than that, what if a certain winter soldier who appears to be a super assassin (his equal in fighting prowess and cleverly is designed and costumed like the dark side version of Cap all in black with dirty black hair and guns), is someone else entirely as well. Stakes stakes stakes.<br/><br/>That's all I hope to get in the substance of these movies, and I've gotten it more often than not in these marvel studios movies (even last year in the somewhat maligned iron man 3 we got a wickedly funny look at media manipulation). On top of this is clever casting - Also spoiler, Robert Redford is not who he appears either, and its using him in such a role that makes the film enjoyable as well. Here is a guy who is an icon of 70s politic thrillers, ie days of the condor And the candidate and all the presidents men - and his image is upsided but just perfect for a movie ABOUT America in uncertain times.<br/><br/>Its surprising for me too as I didn't think I cared too much about Sap after the first film, where he was the least interesting of the Avengers bunch; Steve Rogers seemed before to work best in the context of others, interacting with the other Avengers and the 'straight' guy. here that contrast gets amplified in a very compelling way, even against a character like Natasha Romanoff, who knows where she stands and tries to stay human - let's make a joke about a kiss at least - amid the chaos.<br/><br/>Another good thing as a side note, though it's a Captain America movie, it's also a Nick fury movie in some part and there it's also successful as you're never sure about this man in charge. What secrets does he hide, who is he protecting? needless to say as the audience you can't ever totally trust your own eyes. A question posed online recently was it this is the Best Marvel Movie Yet (in caps, pun intended). to answer this, if I still don't rank it completely on par with the two gold standard movies as far as just being great entertainments - the first Iron Man and the Avengers - it's some of the action from the Russo brothers that irked me.<br/><br/>Not ALL of it, and they're not as egregious as some of the offenders of quick cut/closely shot films. but as a personal preference I just didn't care for some of the fights and action set pieces (again, not all of them, I would love to watch the nick fury car chase/shootout in the streets of DC as it is intense and decent to follow (and even to compare to the slightly similar chase in the dark knight). In some scenes and shots at times I just couldn't tell what was going on as say a winter soldier and other gunmen attack the heroes.<br/><br/>But I can easily look past that enough to say this is a winner, a film that has something to say about the world we are currently living in, how times have really changed in 70 years and what happens when a man of total conviction as Steve Rogers is up against it (as well as some old revived villains). Its almost close to being a work, if one can see it as such, that could make people look twice and go 'maybe things should change when it comes to our government'. Oh, and it's a fun goddamn kick ads spy movie thriller as well where the story points feel organic and there's even pathos near the end for characters we haven't seen too much time together with but enough for it to count.<br/><br/>And Garry shandling as a senator!!"

","Saw the film today, my intention was to see 300 but no showings during the day in 3D so opted for Captain America, with some reluctance I might add. The original was OK but with so many comic book hero movie releases I thought this would just be another instalment of, keep the characters in public consciousness until we finally created a great movie ( latest wolverine an example of this).<br/><br/>This film re-writes the genre and takes cinema to a new level. Absolutely stunning visuals, compelling script and great performances especially from Redford - screen stealer every time.<br/><br/>I will not divulge the story because many reviews do this aptly so no need for me.<br/><br/>I was absolutely blown away and remember thinking throughout the film - i want more of this - up until the end when I was generally sorry to be leaving the cinema. This films grabs hold of you from the start, never lets you go or interest wain and throws you out at the end as if you have just experienced the cinematic equivalent of a fair ground ride.<br/><br/>Go, it will not disappoint."

","Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is now working for SHIELD alongside Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Agent Rumlow (Frank Grillo) as part of the Strike team. The Strike Team was on a mission to re capture a secret SHIELD ship captured by Batroc the Leaper (George St.Pierre). Rogers during the mission with Widow, discovers that she has another secret mission from Nick Fury(Samuel L Jackson) to extract data from the ship's computer. Cap growing tired of SHIELD's secrecy and the 'punish those before they punish you' attitude confronts Fury about the mission and about the secretive Project: Insight. Fury explains that Insight takes 3 high-tech Hellicarriers and links them to spy satellites to take out threats before they arrive. Cap leaves upset and Fury goes to decrypt the data Romanoff retrieved and finds that he can't. Concerned Fury goes to his friend and senior official for SHIELD Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) to hold off Insights debut until he can investigate his concerns a little longer. Pierce agrees and tells Fury to let him know what he finds. As Fury travels to meet his #2 Deputy Commander Maria Hill (Colbie Smulders) he is attacked by soldiers dressed as cops. Fury attempts to get off the grid but runs into the assassin know as the Winter Solider (Sebastian Stan).<br/><br/>The Winter Solider is an awesome movie. The plot is great, writers Christopher Markus and Steven McFeely do a great job making the plot not to overly complicated but still maintain intelligence. This film takes elements of Jonathan Hickman's Secret Warriors and combines them with Ed Brubaker's Winter Solider story from his Captain America run. Director's Joe and Anthony Russo made the story feel like it the comic book came to life. The action, special effects and sound were all top- notch. I did have one major beef with the movie and that was the lack of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). As an Agent of SHIELD and frequently Black Widow's partner he should have played at least a small role in this film. However the inclusion of Falcon (Anthony Mackie) made the film that much better. I love how Falcon's and Cap's relationship grows through the film. It wasn't too forced and that Falcon was more than just the token black guy mouth of the team. In the end I think The Winter Solider set the bar pretty high for Marvel cinematic movies surpassing even The Avengers in quality. It is definitely a must see film on any format but I prefer IMAX 3D."
"fdrt_45","10","0","1","31 July 2014"," Amazing Action Movie
","I'd have to rate Captain America The Winter Soldier as one of the best comic book movies ever made. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get. Superman has generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film even though it has some campy flaws. Spider- Man has generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character. Iron Man has generally held the most grounded and well liked superhero film. The Avengers has generally held the title as most highly rated and best film the genre has seen. Well, Captain America TWS can compete with them all in every category. It is IMO near perfect on every level. It's smart, intense, well acted, fun and superbly done.<br/><br/>The first film delivers a lot of action, a tantalizing and beautiful love interest, many humorous moments, powerful messages about internal fortitude and courage, a classic villain, fine acting and many of the basic essentials of any good action movie. This sequel adds an intriguing plot and does everything the first film did but does it BETTER. Including, incredible stunts, unbelievable feats and, not to be rude, but a climax that plays out like a multiple orgasm. The finish features one wave after another of edge of your seat moments. As fantastic of a movie that's ever been made in the genre and I'm not exaggerating one bit."

","Anthony and Joe Russo give Captain America the film he deserves with their 2014 film ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" This is a comic book blockbuster that has heart, wit, and a political message. It's a smart film that doesn't get caught up in visual effects and explosions. It has something to say while entertaining us with the things we expect from a Marvel film.<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" finds Steve Rogers/Captain America (played by Chris Evans) in modern Washington, D.C. and navigating through the politics of his new world. The good guys and bad guys are not as clear anymore and he has to face a new threat in the mysterious Winter Soldier. <br/><br/>This film has impressive action scenes, solid performances, and a well written script that balances humor, character, and story. It's a political thriller that makes us look at big brother government, drone technology, and the line between freedom and fear. You could watch this film at the surface level and enjoy it or you can look at these political messages and enjoy it just as much. That's what I like about this film. It doesn't want to dumb down the audience. It wants to make them think and have fun at the same time. <br/><br/>Personally, I think ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is the best of the phase 2 Avengers films. It might be too soon to say that with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" coming out in August, but I was disappointed by ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Thor: The Dark World."" ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" builds on ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and ""The Avengers"" very well. You don't have to see these films to enjoy it, but it gives more context for the characters and where they have been. <br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a really good film that gives everyone a fun time and something to think about it."

","Captain America: The Winter Soldier, film number 9 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a most relevant one at that. The directors, producers and writers all said it was the one that followed most closely to The Avengers and would go almost directly into Avengers: Age of Ultron and all-in-all a big game-changer; they weren't kidding. The movie is unlike the rest, it doesn't quite seem like a Marvel movie most of the way through but rather a really unique spy movie, which it is. The plot is extremely well done, I loved it from beginning to end, very good points that flowed the story and even some twists that pleasantly surprised me. The new characters they brought in were fantastic, the Falcon I especially enjoyed, his character was cool, comedic, and just an enjoyable person to watch; Robert Redford's political character was also on top form although the characters' traits and ambitions I have seen in other movies. Now talking of characters, the movie's subtitle the Winter Soldier was a fantastic, unique character who's life was deep and interesting to watch, the majority may know of his true identity already as Marvel haven't really done anything to cover it up as it is obvious from about 5 mins of casting research, but I felt the character wasn't used as much as I thought; his name is in the title but his story isn't the main arc, he was in less scenes than I expected. Another disappointer for me was that the climax seemed to have a lot more violence than previous ones, not as graphic as Thor: TDW, but certainly quite strong, almost distracting - although that may have been the cinema experience. In the end I thought Captain America: The Winter Soldier was one of the best of the MCU, and even Marvel movies in general."

However, this movie was one of the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>First off, the action and fight scenes in the movie are just awesome and there is plenty of action to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. There is also enough humor to balance all this. The characters all had their own amazing moments and the acting is decent as well. You get to see more of Nick Fury, and he was awesome in this. Black Widow is used much more in this movie and as well as being bad ass, she brings out more of the Captain's story. Sam Wilson (the Falcon) is great and is involved in some great action scenes. The villains in this movie were awesome as well.<br/><br/>Quite enjoyed the story as well. There were a few twists; some unexpected, some expected. And the reveal of the unexpected twists in the final third were epic. The story is not just about Captain America and the Winter Soldier, there are darker forces at play and causes the Captain to ask dangerous questions.<br/><br/>This movie is very entertaining, the story is decent, the ending is awesome and satisfying and I would recommend watching this. Makes for a decent political thriller as well. This will easily be one of my favorite movies."

Now they have changed directors and the (finally) decided to make a film about the main character of the title - Captain America (objectively, the first film did not do it). The film is a exciting, unpredictable, tense and has a few twists. Although the dream something figured out before what I've seen the movie, again surprised me. Plenty is a darker, has more special effects, fight scenes I liked them. Evans (finallyrepeat I know) played a real captain in contrast to the previous two films (first part and the Avengers). It's very well done job, I must admit that, at least to me, bigger and better than Superman of Superman from Man of Steel (I do not mean the ability, but the character). I have some minor criticisms (characters Marie Hill and Falcon), but overall I have no major complaints. I was expecting a solid popcorn movie, but I got a little more so this high rating.<br/><br/>P. S. The film even has two scenes after the credits, so idiot who got up and went before them!)

This movie is unbelievable, surprising, action-packed and just thrilling till the very end. The villain was unbelievable in the Winter Soldier he is bad and strong as well as a good friend of Cap but of course he has no clue of this yet. <br/><br/>So the movie started out a little slow i must admit but when it got going it was on fire. The scene where Nick Fury died started things off for me. This was thrilling and devastating as seeing Fury get knocked about by the Winter Soldier and his men. This then kicked off the trust status that Cap had to trust no-one as HYDRA caved in on S.H.E.I.L.D and hunted down Cap and the Black Widow. They soon found out that HYRDA was in with Shield as Cap had no-one to turn to. They were soon captured but rescued by Agent Maria Hill and taken to a secret place. A major twist occurred as Cap and Black Widow found Fury as he had somehow survived the deadly blows.<br/><br/>Cap, Widow and Falcon soon made Shield turn on HYRDA as the battle began. Fury had his revenge on Pierce as he was shot twice for being part of HYRDA as his last words were 'Hail Hydra'. Cap and the Winter Soldier battled in an epic battle as the Winter Soldier didn't have it in him to kill his old mate Cap. The two soon fell with the hellicarrier into the water as Cap looked to drown but was saved by the Winter Soldier. <br/><br/>It was a fitting end as the two survived but the Winter Soldier went his own way as the last scene showed that Cap, Black Widow, the Falcon and Fury would be back in action."

First time Marvel tries a different genre other than sci- fi/action/superhero style. Marvel treads in new territories of political suspense thrillers.

Anthony Mackie, elaborated: ""The Russos, what they did that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form...If they could build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great."" Robert Redford wanted to do the film because his grandchildren are fans of Marvel films and he wanted them to see him in one.

The mall/shopping center in which Black Widow and Captain America visit in order to find the origin of the encrypted USB stick is called the Tower City Center in Cleveland, OH.

It was essentially done in the Marvel Comic TV show, 'Agents of SHIELD'. The film was artistically done and well acted. But the plot devices were boring and were seen coming along a mile away. Too overused. Robert Redfort looked 'older than dirt' and should stay off the movie screen at his advanced age. He was boring and predictable in his performances. I'm glad the directors made a conscience effort to stay away from CGI effects and used practical special effects instead.

","Our hero, believe it or not, is a symbol.<br/><br/>It's not what you're thinking.<br/><br/>The Captain's a metaphor of America.<br/><br/>Look down. Did I fake you out of your shoes?<br/><br/>It seems a simple enough conclusion to arrive at, but ogle this concept through a different window.<br/><br/>Captain America encapsulates a philosophical notion; a mindset transcending time, war and politics. He is twentieth century patriotism. In the face of any enemy, be it systematically internal or external, while others may waver Captain America perseveres.<br/><br/>A hefty portion of this concept lies in his commitment to the notion everybody may live free. But it's something more than just freedom. It's an incorruptible belief; a manner of 'striving for righteousness' that lives on through the death of many American soldiers.<br/><br/>Speaking of, should you see the second installment?<br/><br/>The answer's 'yes.'<br/><br/>The Avengers: Age of Ultron is slated for release on May 1, 2015. Marvel will follow up two months later with Ant Man.<br/><br/>The use of negative space in the post credits sequence is smart, fun and intricate. Lend it five extra minutes if you appreciate this sort of thing.<br/><br/>The fight sequences are nothing short of spectacular. The use of different camera angles throughout the battleship in an early scene is elaborate and magnificent. <br/><br/>Overall, the narrative derives its strength from the movement of our hero through manufactured space. The shifting of the threats and the threatened assets often evokes the classic chess metaphor. On a more evolved scale of course; where time, height and game piece type become more varied and critical factors.<br/><br/>Things get really interesting when examining the intricacies of battle tactics and choreography. I won't dive in too much, but simply consider the strengths and weaknesses of the main trio. Consider the setting of an elevator; the more bad guys filling it, less the chance Black Widow has of escape. She can probably take upwards of five or six, especially because short range and close quarters are optimal combat conditions for her superhumanity.<br/><br/>The same can't be said for Falcon. At most he can handle two or three thugs trapped in a lift.<br/><br/>The depth to the settings is truly spectacular. The epic nature of it all is so fantastic, while maintaining a secure tether to realism.<br/><br/>So far CATWS contains the second-best Stan Lee cameo, after The Amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>I like how the Captain wears the old suit at the end. Solid costumes are a great touch.<br/><br/>A major criticism I can understand but don't share personally: Several moments are reminiscent of plot devices from other films. For example, Black Widow utilizes a similar means of concealment as Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight) in Mission: Impossible. But that was released in '96 so I give it a pass.<br/><br/>A similar example (spoiler alert) involves the fate of Brock Rumlow, the lead thug played by Frank Grillo. During a brief shot at the end, his broken body's raised on a stretcher, in a similar state to that of Kruger (played by Sharlto Copley) in Elysium. There's a major difference between their sustained injuries, but all bets point towards Brock rising again.<br/><br/>Another obvious connection mirrors a trend in superhero cinema: What I call, ""The Citizen's Call to Arms."" It's the moment when the fate of 'the good' is partially placed in the hands of the regular humans. This notion's explored in The Dark Knight and is part of the climactic sequence in The Amazing Spider-Man. <br/><br/>Robert Redford does a spectacular job acting as Agent Alexander Pierce, but it's to no avail. The highest upside to his performance is his appearance and demeanor are completely different from that of his last role in All is Lost.<br/><br/>He's easily the worst part of Captain A. His character isn't all that compelling, and it's a bit unclear what he wants and whom he poses a threat to. He's not a detractor but there's nothing exciting about him whatsoever.<br/><br/>Pierce isn't particularly menacing and neither is Hydra as an overall villain. But that's okay, it seems like an attempt to break convention; a good idea that sizzles out with Redford's uneventful performance.<br/><br/>The other thing I don't love is the glossing over of Falcon's background. The reveal's a delight, but further detail on his history (particularly his superhuman abilities) is highly desirable.<br/><br/>Major nuance derives from the supporting players. In the realm of sidekicks, Captain's got two complicated, original and fully-fleshed-out allies. <br/><br/>Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson plays a great sidekick to Cap. He turns in a subtly fantastic performance.<br/><br/>And so does Black Widow as the other co-goody.<br/><br/>Oh me, oh my, I love me some Scarlett Johansson.<br/><br/>But Widow's got me worried something fierce. She's up to something fishy.<br/><br/>This movie's final shortcoming is the lack of screen time for Natasha Romanoff. I'll scream from the mountaintop until Avengers 4 we can always use more Black Widow, both in combat, and just as much outside of it.<br/><br/>And for Pete's sake, I want Cap and Widow to fall in love like nobody's business. Sure it could happen someday, in another movie, but it's the fact that it also couldn't that worries me.<br/><br/>To wrap up, Captain America: The Winter Solider is another solid entry in the esteemed superhero canon.<br/><br/>The one I can't wait for?<br/><br/>The Hulk.<br/><br/>And he better be rocking purple slacks."
"robinski34","8","0","1","28 June 2014"," Captain America: World Police
","As the Marvel superhero with the richest history, and linch-pin of The Avengers, Captain America was perhaps the most eagerly-awaited of the comic book behemoth's properties to come to the big screen. The First Avenger resoundingly delivered on Cap's pathos, even pulling off the re-branding Chris Evans from hothead Johnny Storm to the steel-nerved Steve Rogers, chief among an across-the-board casting masterclass, from the spunky Hayley Atwell, thru square-jawed Sebastian Stan; gravel-toned Tommy Lee Jones; specky Toby Jones; via fatherly Stanley Tucci; and dashing Dominic Cooper to Hugo Weaving's devilishly evil Red Skull. Joe Johnston's film nicely evoked a never-say-die attitude and drab wartime aesthetic to the benefit of it's jarring final scenes. So how to follow TFA's success? The challenge was to now deal with a contemporary Cap, and directors The Russos (from the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely - who also penned The First Avenger) manage that with aplomb, not laying on the 'this is weird' shtick too thickly, while still reminding us where Cap has come from. But easily the smartest thing that they did was side-stepping the heroic trappings and big CGI (at least until the second half) to adopt the trappings of the political thriller, to great success. Why make a superhero movie at all? Why indeed, and to this end the presence of Robert Redford is a masterstroke. Scarlett Johansson is also on great form and sparks nicely with Chris Evan's Cap, while Sam Jackson's Nick Fury gets more to do in any Marvel appearance so far as the web of lies plays out. We can only hope that Avengers 2 and Cap 3 can bring such a fresh approach."
"abhi_b22","7","0","1","28 June 2014"," Thriller, Patriotic but overly exaggerated plot !
","This feature is total bad-ass if you want action, thrill and drama, but the core of the movie ""Project Insight"" was little to unbelievable if you think practically. I mean those helicarriers has capacity to kill millions of people at a time by freaking bullets. Think about it for a second.<br/><br/>And The Winter Soldier, He was a pure killing machine, there is no doubt about it. Powerful warrior. Fast. Ruthless.<br/><br/>And Cap, He is not a superhero, he is a super soldier. He has given everything for his country, a real patriot. His mentality might be old but he sees the world as it is and he tries to stop everyone from betraying his own country. His acting is OK as Steve Rogers but as a Captain America (In Action) did the ultimate job. <br/><br/>The movie was worth watching in 3D. Sound fx were good. Not happy with organic animation though, like the shot where Falcon gives Cap'n a drop on the helicarrier and the shot where Falcon and Rumlow are running inside the building on 41st floor because one helicarrier is right behind them crushing the building. But VFX were good, vehicle design were good, screenplay was nice, cinematography was one of the best part of the feature and timing of action sequences were pretty cool.<br/><br/>Overall, it was ""time well spent"" movie, they tried their best to make a good action movie and as long as I can see, They came close to their goal."

","The Germans have invaded the United States of America, but with our people. I guess that is how I want to start this review, but one can only tell. Last time we left our hero, he was in cryo-freeze for over 70 years and then S.H.I.E.L.D came and found Captain America a.k.a. Steve Rogers. Then much to Fury's surprise the company had been ambushed by the same evil that they thought they got rid ofHYDRA. But through the unlikely of sources, Alexander Pierce (played wonderfully by the greatest actors of all time Robert Redford) – for you see the Red Skull a.k.a Schidmit was just the birth and now the past has come to haunt.<br/><br/>But it all began when Bucky fell through the wintery snow of the Alps and Doctor Zola found him and made him into a killing machine and wiped all of his memories, including the memories of his best friend. I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for those of you who have not seen it yet, but I will say this – the war against Hydra has only begun and nowwell I'll let you decide that for yourself.<br/><br/>This movie was the best that Marvel has ever done all thanks to the creator, the master mind behind of all these movies and comic books – Mr. Stan Lee – personally, you are my hero and you are our Captain – thank you for bringing your world to ours."

","So I let my anticipation go away. I forgot about the reviews and critical acclaim and I just sat down and watched this film for what it is and not what others thought it was. And I have to say only one word. Wow. This is an outstandingly good movie. Everybody and their mother needs to go see this thing. It is one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far and I can without a doubt say that this is a great movie.<br/><br/>The performances are alone are a reason to go see this movie. Chris Evans has always been good as the character, but in this film you get a really good look into his life and you can tell that this is a Captain America movie that gives him the depth he deserves. Samuel L. Jackson is spot on as Nick Fury. He is perfect for the role right now and shows just how good of an actor he truly he is. Scarlett Johansson is not only just used as very beautiful prop. She shows how good of a performer she really is and shows us her range and her character gets so much to do. Robert Redford is a leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. and gets a really developed character. He is such a good actor and his talents are used very well and he fits in just like an other spy thriller he has done before. The Winter Soldier also gets some depth that you can really attach to. His connection and storyline with Captain America is a great one and really makes him another memorable villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Anthony Mackie also was a great character and not just some add on that I was put in there to bring in a new character to their universe.<br/><br/>The writing and directing is also outstanding. This shows that comedy isn't as easy to direct as most people say it is. Anthony and Joe Russo are guys behind comedy TV shows like Community. And they did a great job of really blending their comedy experience with some great drama and action. These guys deserve some credit of the success of this great movie. I can say that my only problem with Iron Man is that the last action scene, while really cool and awesome, isn't integrated into the story as well and seems a little campy. None of the action in this film is campy at all. No one is spouting ridiculous one liners and each one carries a lot of drama. Any action scene is also integrated very well into the story and each piece of action does carry a lot of drama and each punch has some kind of feeling in the to not only the characters, but the audience as well. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely did a great job writing this screenplay. This guys were a part of Thor: The Dark World and Captain America: The First Avenger as well and their balance of comedy and drama blends perfectly well. Everybody gets their time to shine in this film and really gets some laughs out each other. This film is a surprisingly funny when it could easily be a dark movie with no comedy at all. It is like The Dark Knight in that respect.<br/><br/>This movies score is also beautifully subtle in a great respect. You can here it in the most important spots and you can see the how it adds something to the drama. The special effects while not some of the best I have ever seen, are still really good and really cool looking. Polished very well and no complaints needed. They aren't just tricks anymore. Cinematography is also good because you get these cool shots showing some of these great wide open areas and some great shots of the inside set pieces like S.H.I.E.L.D.. All the comic book beats work as well. You have the awesome Stan Lee cameo in there even though he had little to do with Captain America's creation and you have some great shots of Captain America in his old outfit and the American shield in his arm.<br/><br/>This movie makes me question the standards of our society as well. Who has control in the government? Who should we trust? Who shouldn't we trust? Who has the control and how did they get it? Do they deserve that control? Do we really feel safe? All of these are well crafted into this fantastic story that really out does the first film in every respect. This is one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has great respect for not only its characters, but its world and crafts one that not only seems realistic, but stills fits into the universe they have created. It makes me laugh and makes me feel quite sad. This movie is a fun and exciting action film. It is an outstanding and well paced drama. It is a gripping spy thriller. But above all, It is an epic superhero film. I give Captain America 3.75 out 4 stars."

","At first when i was going to go see it everyone i talked to said it was a fun movie, but it was just to long and got boring after a while so i was kind of nervous to go see it. But after seeing it i have to say i was not at all disappointed i actually loved the movie. It was a lot better then the first one since captain America actually seems to have superpowers and not just some steroid soldier. It also kept me interested and excited throughout the whole movie. So to those who complain about it being boring. Im sorry but you are expecting something that is extremely cool if this didn't interest you. You should try man of steel."

","I thought that the movie was great, even though you know that Nick Fury can not be dead, for he is too important. It still has a great plot and keeps you entertained throughout the whole movie. Most now that all Marvel movies have an extra bit at the end, and if watched other Marvel movies you will know that Red Skull is alive. So I can not wait to see that unfold in the ones to come. And to see how he deals with the knowledge that Bucky is alive, and in fact was the one that he was after. Even though I has my suspicions about that, it was still nice to know that he did not in fact die when he fell. That he only lost his memory, and survived because of the things they did to him when he was held captive."

","It is really good. Watched in 3D. Full of action. Contains a very good storyline with connection to Captain America : First Avenger.There was a time, not that long ago, when the long Memorial Day Weekend at the end of May marked the official start of the lucrative summer movie season - that time of the year when the Hollywood studios roll out the big guns for popcorn-minded moviegoers who have nothing on their minds except having a good time.Markus and McFeely also infuse the smart, clever and twist-filled screenplay - which itself is based on a landmark 2005 comic book storyline - with an infectious sense of fun, wit, confidence and heart. In addition, directors Anthony and Joe Russo move the 2 hour and 16 minute proceedings along at a steady and engaging pace that favors character development and thrilling hand-to-hand combat over mind-numbing computer-generated special effects."

","The action in this movie was incredible. The camera moved a teeny bit too much, but other than that, the choreography was amazing. Seriously. I just watched Divergent last week and thought the moves there were amazing. It was, but the action here was way more impressive. Really well done. I actually really wanted to clap after one of the fight scenes. Visuals were amazing too.<br/><br/>To top it off, the plot lines were pretty suspenseful. It wasn't so intense, but it was definitely engaging though I agree with some that there was a bit too much talking during the first half of the film. It was important information, but I feel like they could've cut down on some of it. <br/><br/>I'm not sure what it is, but I don't quite feel the chemistry between the actors.

","When you go to see a Marvel movie you expect to see some pretty awesome stunts, God like superheroes with swoon worthy bodily attributes, dangerous villains, terror inducing and awe inspiring weapons and a thrilling experience which stays with you for days or even months after you have seen the movie making you go back and watch it any number of times with no loss in its appeal!<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier takes the audience on a yet another dangerous, thrilling, goosebumps inducing ride in present day Washington D.C where The United States, although free is now threatened by a covert and deeply rooted society called the Hydra. Meanwhile SHIELD's Director, Alexander Pierce played by Robert Redford, is planning on launching weapons which will eliminate any threat even before it itself realizes its potential! :)<br/><br/>Add a Nazi era villain to the mix, The Winter Soldier, who will destroy anyone and anything in his path to get the ultimate power over the world for Hydra and a super secretive and somewhat shady, Director Fury ( played by Samuel L. Jackson) and you have a spicy mix of secrets, grey situations and a suspicious outlook towards everyone.<br/><br/>Captain America is restless and undecided on his ideals in the present day world. Struggling to adjust to the present day situations and adapt to his changed responsibilities which often conflict with his ingrained morality, it is very interesting to see how he will face the ruthless, unemotional and his complete opposite opponent, The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>""Trust no one."" Fury tells him and so starts a battle where no one is to be trusted and anyone can be Hydra!<br/><br/>Will Captain America be able to save the world from the Winter Soldier and will he survive after this? Who is the Winter Soldier and why is he out to get Captain America specifically?<br/><br/>I loved Chris Evans as Steve Rogers or Captain America yet again with his classic good boy innocence, kind and beseeching eyes and his beautiful transformation into the super warrior Captain America without losing his very appealing innocence and idealistic morality. Only some actors can pull off this very difficult mix of innocence, fragility and strength at once and Chris Evans plays his part to perfection. He often seems almost naive and even frail very unlike the hardened fighter that he is and this is an appeal only present with him.Samuel Jackson as Fury is his usual splendid self and even when he is venturing in the grey, we know that ultimately he is the good guy. His presence is strong and his acting perfect as Nick Fury. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce is amazing and makes his presence felt in the movie with his classically great acting and throws the audience some very interesting but very shocking twists. Scarlett Johansson is the only woman character given so much limelight and she proves that she is one great actor by her flawless acting and dangerous stunts as Natasha or The Black Widow. Sebastian Stan as The Winter Soldier inspires fear and a chill in the hearts of the viewers with his picture perfect acting and even the lack of dialogues does nothing to diminish his presence. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson or Falcon is funny, vivacious and daring. His presence makes the otherwise very dark movie, so much fun. His acting is great, his stage presence strong and he is funny. :) Last but not the least, Toby Jones as Dr. Zola inspires fear, hate and anger with his classic acting and even though he has a very short role but still he makes the viewers remember him from among a hoard of characters. :)<br/><br/>The direction is crisp and the editing first class. As soon as you start feeling that a scene is stretching, the flow changes and you are thrown head first in another intensely satisfying scene connected beautifully with the previous and the subsequent one. The photography is skillful and vividly captures the surroundings, making all events and actions so real as if we are there. All aspects of the movie are beautifully handled to give us a story which is both captivating and thrilling.<br/><br/>Intense action, great editing, expert photography, elaborate sets, great makeup and costumes, skilled direction and great actors make this movie worth every rupee spent. A strong recommendation that you go watch the movie and do wait till after the end credits to ensure that you don't miss the secret endings. I am told that there are two of them in this movie. I seem to have missed the second one. :(<br/><br/>A full 4.5 out of 5 to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. So go watch, enjoy and I hope the next part releases soon. Do let me know if there really were two endings. :)<br/><br/>This review is also available on my blog Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff"

But when I watched this movie - BOOM !!!!!!! This movie blew my mind.... It is really AWESOME!!! There are many sequences that will make you jump up in your seats. I would like to recommend you to stay after the credits for two amazing scenes, now this is hardly a spoiler as everyone knows marvel always treats the audience with surprising after credits scenes. I shall say no more here. Marvel has done an excellent job on this movie.<br/><br/>Chris Evans has done some excellent work as Captain America. But Sebastian Stan as the winter soldier steals the movie in every scenes he show up.others to look forward to are Scarlett Johanson as black window and Anthony Mackie as The Falcon.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. Guys, this movie is really worth your bucks. Moreover, the movie runs for over 136 Min's, but never at a single moment during the movie you feel bored. And the ending of the movie leaves you craving for more and more.<br/><br/>The climax is terrific. I haven't seen such an awesome climax of a movie since the Avengers. So guys, go for this movie.... take your kids with you. They'll love it. It is a perfect start of summer blockbuster and one of the best movies of the year without doubt.. just wait for the bluray to watch it again ... and cant wait for captain America 3.............."

"brownbearmm","10","0","1","7 June 2014"," The Winter Solider is Amazing!!!
","Working for a spy agency is tough work, being a time displaced man from the 1940's working for a spy agency is near impossible. Captain America: The Winter Solider takes place in a world after the Chitauri invasion of New York and after the events of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is now working for SHIELD alongside Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Agent Rumlow (Frank Grillo) as part of the Strike team. The Strike Team was on a mission to re capture a secret SHIELD ship captured by Batroc the Leaper (George St.Pierre). Rogers during the mission with Widow, discovers that she has another secret mission from Nick Fury(Samuel L Jackson) to extract data from the ship's computer. Cap growing tired of SHIELD's secrecy and the 'punish those before they punish you' attitude confronts Fury about the mission and about the secretive Project: Insight. Fury explains that Insight takes 3 high-tech Hellicarriers and links them to spy satellites to take out threats before they arrive. Cap leaves upset and Fury goes to decrypt the data Romanoff retrieved and finds that he can't. Concerned Fury goes to his friend and senior official for SHIELD Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) to hold off Insights debut until he can investigate his concerns a little longer. Pierce agrees and tells Fury to let him know what he finds. As Fury travels to meet his #2 Deputy Commander Maria Hill (Colbie Smulders) he is attacked by soldiers dressed as cops. Fury attempts to get off the grid but runs into the assassin know as the Winter Solider (Sebastian Stan).<br/><br/>The Winter Solider is an awesome movie. The plot is great, writers Christopher Markus and Steven McFeely do a great job making the plot not to overly complicated but still maintain intelligence. This film takes elements of Jonathan Hickman's Secret Warriors and combines them with Ed Brubaker's Winter Solider story from his Captain America run. Director's Joe and Anthony Russo made the story feel like it the comic book came to life. The action, special effects and sound were all top- notch. I did have one major beef with the movie and that was the lack of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). As an Agent of SHIELD and frequently Black Widow's partner he should have played at least a small role in this film. However the inclusion of Falcon (Anthony Mackie) made the film that much better. I love how Falcon's and Cap's relationship grows through the film. It wasn't too forced and that Falcon was more than just the token black guy mouth of the team. In the end I think The Winter Solider set the bar pretty high for Marvel cinematic movies surpassing even The Avengers in quality. It is definitely a must see film on any format but I prefer IMAX 3D."
"pouge162","10","0","1","6 June 2014"," Close to perfect
","This is one of those movies that fit with the times of it's release. With a nation under surveillance, drones flying the globe, a questionable administration, this movie makes no bones about where it stands. It is probably the best political movie disguised as a super hero movie in decades. Captain America is still on a journey to understand his new present day. After a nice set up through a little humor where we meet Sam Wilson, after this fateful meeting we get started with Black Widow and Cap on a mission to save a ship full of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents being held by none other than Batroc the Leaper. After a fun filled action sequence, we find Black Widow doing what she does best, espionage. Cap not liking the fact the mission has sub missions he knew nothing about, he faces Fury about it, not knowing Fury set the whole thing up. Once Fury's superiors realize what he has done, he (Fury) goes to the one man he can trust. Cap. After telling him just enough to give Cap what he needs to start his quest. Cap and Natasha go on a mission against seemingly everyone and eventually team up with Sam Wilson, who nails his role as Falcon. As they search for answer against gov't foes and the mysterious Winter Soldier, the risks become more then anyone could imagine. To not give away the entire plot, I'll leave it there. This movie has quickly become one of my all time favorites. Probably one of the greatest super hero movies put to film. Great story, action and visual effects (only used when absolutely necessary), it is entertainment that makes you think. Certainly about current events, but not to the point of pointing fingers at anyone. ""This isn't freedom. This is fear."""

","First of all i was confused of the title, because i did not know what 'Winter soldier' stands for. Than when i watched trailers and movie i realized that the title is great. Winter soldier is a great surprise, i love surprises and i loved Bucky. The length, the direction and the music is awesome. Especially when the winter soldier is coming in the cadre. It is just incredible how i loved it all, especially when they are all funny and witty... thats just why 'CA;WS' is superb.<br/><br/>I can not compare any previous movie of Thor and Ironman to that of Captain America. It has completely different aura and atmosphere. And thats the best part, it really follows all other stories of Thor, Ironman, Avengers, and of course Captain America first Avenger. Also it inspires me and my work, i am an artist and enjoy all the films even more, because i can use parts of colors and toys they all have to fight with, i can interpret heroes in my own way and play.<br/><br/>i really recommend to enjoy this film while watching! Chris Evans and Scarlet Johannson are just great actors and all others of course. Wish for more young and new actors, did not like Robert Redford in the film. But i am glad his role is finished with this movie. :)<br/><br/>loved it, enjoyed it and am looking FW to the third part.... it is really the best Marvel movie i have ever seen."
"sboulama","10","0","1","3 June 2014"," Fascinating action thrilling-chilling out scenes.
","First things first, this movie isn't shot as a movie. I explain: if you see the scene where Captain is fighting is enemy(scenes totally shown in the trailers), you'll see that Joe and Anthony Russo shot this film as something new, something revolutionary. Just a moment ago, i watched again and counted(I may have mistaken), 71 shots in that scene. This film isn't just taking itself seriously, it is a serious film, it really is. In the theaters, I was divided between fascination and incomprehension. Absolutely incredible. This is more than what I could have ever imagined. This is the best superhero film i have ever watched in my whole life, even better than The Dark Knight, which was already extremely good. This s pure entertainment for superhero fans. Conspiracies, betrayals, friendships, leaderships...But personally, this movie is a true source of motivation, the fact that they are ""super humans"", that their body steams regenerate, that their endurance is, like, four times increased, and that they simply have a better resistance to everything that hurts. Because a movie isn't just a pictures-gathering: it's a mentality that leaks through those same pictures, those characters, those stories. And that's what gives this film: a motivation, a true symbol of hope. Oh, and the music of Henry Jackman is so outstanding. Also, the technology here is wonderfully used. Everything is simply perfect!"
"matic-boh1","7","0","1","2 June 2014"," An action-packed adventure
","The second installment of this superhero's film series does not disappoint, as Captain America: The Winter Soldier combines a solid story with a heavy dosage of exciting action. As any sequel should do, it offers the audience an overall improvement of the first film in all departments, with all the main characters being further developed and the action sequences also being upgraded to much higher levels of exhilaration. Although the first Captain America film proved satisfying, the continuation of the franchise is far more compelling, as the film is able to optimize its capacities, allowing Captain Steve Rodgers to truly shine, thus enabling the viewers to appreciate his role as the ultimate soldier. Along with it being well-designed and fiercely action packed, the film also manages to use a very interesting storyline to reinvigorate the Marvel Universe and the world of the Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is therefore perhaps the best Marvel film following The Avengers, surpassing the likes of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, as it sets new standards of quality, both in terms of story and execution."

","I gotta say and this is probably gonna sound pretty pathetic but I think That I can do at least a decent job justifying this. These Marvel movies have gotten to the point where they take up a decent chuck of my life. Now let me try to make that sound less pathetic real quick. I LOVE movies I love becoming immersed in different worlds to the point of where the real world does not exist for the 2 and a half hours that I'm watching a good movie and Marvel has done an amazing job building this world and Captain America the Winter Soldier is yet another amazing piece of the worlds story. I have loved all of the MCU movie so far (yes even Iron Man 2) but The Winter Soldier has probably had the biggest impact on the MCU next to The Avengers. So between actually seeing these movies and reading new details about upcoming movies I spend a fair amount of time on this movie world.<br/><br/>As soon as this movie starts you know that you are in for a different kind of superhero movie. This movie plays out more like a spy movie than a superhero movie. It's like if James Bond was a superhero. This movie is full of rather unconventional superhero action a lot like the first one was but I think it was done much better in this one. Instead of massive and over the top fights the big battles in this movie (Involving Captain America anyway) are more like watching super powered UFC fighters going at it. Aside from the fight scenes the rest of the action is also really well done. A great example is a very intense car chase/shoot out involving Nick Fury.<br/><br/>When there is not crazy intense action going on this movie has a very eerie tone to it. With all the mystery surrounding shield and the supposed death of Nick Fury Cap has no idea who he can trust and that gives this movie an eerily calm sense of urgency to stop whatever bad things may be coming. One of my personal favorite scenes in the entire movie is when Cap and Black Wdow find out the Shield has had HYDRA growing within the organization from the very start. When Arnim Zola is explaining how HYDRA infiltrated Shield you really get a feeling like wow this is really bad ( if your immersed in the world anyway). The overall plot of this movie just shakes the foundation of the entire Marvel world and it's really awesome to see that. When the movie ends you kinda get this feeling like the hero's lost which does not really happen that often in superhero movies.<br/><br/>Now I definitely need to talk about my favorite villain sense Loki. The Winter Soldier is just an amazing villain who you can really sympathize with. He's brainwashed and forced to be a Russian assassin for around 70 years before Captain America is finally able to at least begin to save him in the end of this movie. The actor who played him as well as all the actors did an amazing job in their rolls and seeing as how Sebastian Stan has signed on for 9 more movie that is a very good thing. I can't wait to see him in future movies grow as a character even more than he did in this movie. There are rumors that he will replace Chris Evans as Captain America in the future and with a 9 film deal I think that that rumor is probably true. I really look forward to seeing him transition over from a villain to one of the most important heroes in the franchise.<br/><br/>So overall Captain America the Winter Soldier was a really fun time at the movies and a great installment in the MCU. Given everything that happened in this movie I really can't wait to see what kind of state the world is in at the start of The Avengers Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>I'm giving Captain America the Winter Soldier a 10/10"

","If you have not seen this movie after you are done reading this DRIVE TO THE THEATERS RIGHT AWAY!!!!!!!! The plot was very strong. The cast was AMAZING!!!!! Especially Scarlett Johansson!!! SHE WAS BRILLIANT!!! Chris Evans also did an AMAZING job! The whole movie was AMAZING! The special effect were so realistic. Especially when you see the movie in IMAX 3D you feel like your right there with them. Samuel L. Jackson also surprised me. He was AWESOME in it. Maria Hill was also incredible. I also greatly enjoyed Marvel introducing the Falcon. I really want to see him in a future film. I would love if he had a cameo in Avengers: Age of Ultron. The soundtrack in this film also enhanced the experience of the movie. I think that the soundtrack of a movie plays a huge role. You could have an amazing movie, yet not have a good soundtrack and it can make the movie not as enjoyable. Also Sebastian Stan as The Winter Soldier = EPIC!!! Bucky was kind of creepy! The movie was so intense and kept me on the edge oft seat! There was also some very good humor that made me laugh. Overall it was one of the best films I have ever seen and I recommend EVERYONE who is in to comics and action to see this movie. Comic book fans NEED to see this. Honestly this film was BRILLIANT!"
"wsheumaker","9","0","1","31 May 2014"," Best Marvel film to date!
","Marvel's latest installment into their Cinematic Universe is mind-blowing. It is clever, suspenseful, and has incredible action sequences. The casting is spot on as Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans are fantastic in their roles but most surprising was Anthony Mackie as the Falcon. I was left in high hopes that Joss Whedon will find a way to incorporate him into Avengers: Age of Ultron and future Avengers sequels. Robert Redford and Samuel L. Jackson did very well in their roles also. The mystery and thrills of this movie really blew me away. One of downsides was Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier. He hardly had any lines and it was hard to get to know him as the new brainwashed assassin he had become. More character development was needed there. It was hard to see him as a strong, powerful villain when we hardly knew him. It was nice to see Bucky again as a villain but he needed more development and a motive. He was only following orders from Alexander Pierce and really had no personality until the final showdown between him and Steve Rogers. I am excited to see Captain America and the Falcon continue their search for him and maybe see him again as friends with Steve and having more character development. Aside from that, astounding. The fight scenes were awesome but shaky cameras make some of them hard to enjoy. Worth the 3D ticket, but again, shaky cameras may give you a headache. When there is humor, it is hilarious and it's mostly between Evans and Johansson. Overall, this is a great, funny superhero film that takes first place in Marvel movies!"
"bpalmer118","5","0","1","27 May 2014"," Winter Soldier: A film with unlimited potential to be the next great superhero film but falls short
","Captain America: Winter Soldier sputters in the first half of the film that comes to life in then second half but by then it's too late. Chris Evans returns to his role as Captain America trying to fit into the role of a super human being that is the ultimate display of the best that mankind has to offer. He gives the role too much goodwill and it's hard to buy into his character because he's too perfect. Maybe it's just me, but I prefer to have my protagonists flawed. <br/><br/>The film has incredible potential to stand above many of the mediocre superhero films of the last six years with a series of interesting subplots, but fails to explore or follow through with any of them. The most interesting subplot was the relationship between Steve Roger and his late wife who is now an old woman at her death bed. I would've love to see the filmmakers explore this aspect of Captain America's life but it's only given one scene. Black Widow also teases about an complex backstory but it is given little attention. The relationship between the Winter Soldier and Captain has incredible amounts of potential for a great story, but it is only introduced near the end of the film and not given enough time to make it work. <br/><br/>Even if you have an all-star cast does not mean your dialogue will work. You could sense the discomfort on the actors faces especially Robert Redford as they struggled through plot-driven dialogue that sounded like it was written by a ten-year-old. The acting ability from the whole cast was never utilized no thanks to the poor directing of the Russo brothers. They pushed the CGI too much in various sequences which showed their lack of respect for the audience. We know it's all done in computers, but we want to believe that it's real life, don't make it look so fake where we know how you did it. Even the theme of the film was pushed too hard and came off as forced like a schoolboy grudgingly doing a homework assignment. <br/><br/>The tipping point came from the laziness of the Director of Photography, Trent Opalach, who shot with an ordinary style about an extraordinary man. Many shots were done on a steadicam with little thought to composition or color. Recent comedies in the past few years look far better than this film. <br/><br/>However, Winter Soldier surprised me on a few occasions. There were a number of impressive action sequences that even had me on the edge of my seat. Scarlett Johansson never fails as Black Widow and had more screen time than other of her previous appearances in the Marvel universe. <br/><br/>I end with a word to the producers and the corporate heads of Marvel Studios: Invest more money in screenwriters and cinematographers than CGI and explosions. Audiences will be more appreciative and more loyal long after the credits roll."

","If you like to see movies depicting literally hundreds of people getting shot all through the movie, then this is right up your alley. To me, that makes for a poor story line.<br/><br/>There are pieces of the movie that are quite interesting, but there are many more that just don't feel like they fit. Where things didn't quite line up - well, let's splash a bunch of blood on there from people getting shot, and call it a movie.<br/><br/>They're dealing with a piece of technology that they can't decode and don't even mention Tony Stark?

"tariq-hossenbux","8","0","1","25 May 2014"," An Intelligent Action Film
","Besides being a great action movie, Captain America is an intelligent film that asks us to consider some important questions about America today and its future role. You will find splendid martial arts and gun fighting sequences. <br/><br/>The direction is great with well put together scene cuts switching perspectives at a frantic pace. The story line is complex requiring our continued attention and keeping us guessing in a whodunnit fashion at points. Captain America is solidly played by Chris Evans with his assistant Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) helping him through some tough predicaments. Comedy relief is provided by some very witty quips at well interspersed intervals . All the weaponry and high octane chases that you could ever expect are here in good quantity, and the special effects are first rate. There are some well imagined futuristic weapons that are probably not so far off from what is being made today. <br/><br/>The film also questions whether America's role as a beacon and example of freedoms are being changed and compromised in the name of a new order. In an age of drone strikes we are asked if taking on the role of world judge and jury tarnishes the principles of justice that have long been tenets of the American ideal. Captain America's old fashioned values clash with a new system where human and democratic controls over the actions of a government in war might be in a process of erosion. The balance between freedom and fear since 911 is acutely symbolized in the final battle sequences. It is no coincidence that you see and hear words like 41st floor and the letter IN-01 in some of those scenes. <br/><br/>At the end of this film I think you will be considering the question of at what point does the erosion of personal freedom and privacy equal the loss of what America once was to the world."
"sean-devitt","7","0","1","25 May 2014"," Captain America the new Superman
","This movie was better than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Captain America has usually been done badly on screen and there's the political problem of how to portray a man called Captain America in a world where many people don't like America or its foreign policy. The usual answer is to have everyone talk about how anachronistic he is, how his values no longer apply, how the world is no longer black and white and blah blah.<br/><br/>This movie does just the same but fortunately it gets on with things and keeps moving before you have time to spot the problems. Chris Evans looks uncomfortable and I'm not sure if that's because the character is supposed to be uncomfortable in the setting of the movie or because the actor knows he's the C list character in a B list franchise (The Avengers have the comic book characters that other movie studios didn't want). I will give the benefit of the doubt and say Chris Evans played the confused superman well.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson gets to do a lot more and fills the role of the comedy sidekick as well as action hero. Pairing her up with Chris Evans was a good idea and it worked well. Robert Redford stands around doing his man from the 1970s stuff. Samuel L Jackson is the same as always although he is starting to blend into the scenery. The other characters are competent and none of the performances were bad.<br/><br/>The action was fast paced and more suited to an action thriller than a comic book movie and that was a good thing. People are getting shot in large numbers in this movie and there was a seriousness that I appreciated. There were times when Johanssons character appeared to be in real danger and looked scared.<br/><br/>The problems. After the destruction of New York (the Avengers), the damage to London (Thor Dark World), the terrorism in Iron Man and the money spent on Shield (the cost of those hover carriers!)the economy in this universe must be in a shambles and the population traumatized by Alien invasion, men mutating into green monsters and Shield being blown up in front of their eyes. There seem to be no consequences following these huge events. Society seems to move along fine and the shops look full.<br/><br/>Finally with Man of Steel showing Superman to be a brooding over powerful ET who smashes up cities, thinks he's a god and threatens the military it seems like Captain America is the new superman. He's the one who now promotes truth, justice and the American way. Give him Tony Stark's suit."

","Captain America the winter soldier is a great example of how to make a super-heroes film serious, but also fun. It isn't just my favorite marvel film, but also my second favorite super- heroes film after the ""The Dark Knight"" and it is surprising because captain America was always my least favorite avenger. The movie is clearly the darkest movie in the marvel cinematic universe, and is a must watch for anyone who is planning to watch ""The Avengers Age Of Ultron (avengers 2). This is also the best performance of the black widow, nick fury and Maria hill, and of course a big plus for the captain itself that get more personality and become more bad-ass. The only problem I had with film is the title ""winter soldier"" that doesn't appear in the film as much as you would think."

","Seldom do I rate rate movies unless they are really good, or really bad. Most movies fall in the middle, and we all know which one those are, action for actions sake. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not a middle of the road movie, it takes action, adventure, plot and characters to a level not seen since...well...the original Die Hard. This movie surpasses the original Cap, as well as the other Marvel/Avenger movie tie-ins by sheer momentum, character growth, and of course....plot! This is the movie all action movies have wanted to be since the debut of Die Hard in 1988. And I do believe it has surpassed even that. 9 out of 10 as the other Avengers were only mentioned and never seen, otherwise, sit back, relax, and enjoy one of the best action movies made in 26 years!"

Even his own attempt at self sacrifice doesn't kill him (that's 2 movies now!). <br/><br/>They try to balance the action out with the ethical issues being faced, but we were never really given an indication of the true horror of what is being proposed.

Yeah go for it. <br/><br/>Or maybe it was because I had become desensitised by the shaky camera action scenes that just left me cold and made me want them to end as soon as possible.

","I wasn't a big fan of Captain America: The First Avenger, but looked forward to seeing The Winter Soldier due to the trailers and early reviews. Captain America: The Winter Soldier delivers one of the best films Marvel have made so far. There's plenty of action in the film to keep you entertained as well as a conspiracy that will have you guessing as the film progresses. The overall tone of the film is more serious than the previous Captain America film, but still finds room for plenty of humour. I have found Chris Evans to be quite dull in his role of Captain America in previous films, but his best performance as the character so far is definitely in The Winter Soldier. Scarlett Johansson gives an impressive performance as Black Widow and steals a lot of the scenes she's in. Samuel L. Jackson is as great as ever in his role as Nick Fury. I think the film did an excellent job of how they portrayed The Winter Soldier and Sebastian Stan did a fine job as the character. I would definitely like to see Anthony Mackie as The Falcon again in future Marvel films. I also enjoyed the fact UFC Welterweight Georges St-Pierre made a brief appearance. Overall I give Captain America: The Winter Soldier an 8 out of 10. It's a must for any Marvel fan!"

It had a good mix of plenty of action, some unexpected twists and very relevant, meaningful themes at the moment (i.e. the loss of privacy and government spying). The acting was good enough for me to care about the story (admittedly, it was straight forward) and the film spends a bit more time creating some depth to Captain America, Nick Fury and The Black Widow. Chris Evans is more an more believable in the role as the films in the Marvel series progress and I enjoyed this a lot more than Captain America: The First Avenger.

While the movie never left its main target, there was a bunch of side plots that never get answered at the end. The twist to the film however, was AMAZING! The whole S.H.E.I.L.D was a lie was excellent! It's a twist I never saw coming! At times the action sequences would drag a bit, overall the movie was WAY better than the first!"
"slicedbread117","10","0","2","11 May 2014"," Marvel knocks it out of the park, and rivals The Avengers
","There's no way that any solo Marvel film could top The Avengers right? Wrong. Captain America: The Winter Soldier has effect of immediately moved past the superhero team-up blockbuster as the best entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), as well as one of the top superhero movies of all-time.<br/><br/>So what makes The Winter Soldier (TWS) so incredible? Well, there are quite a few good reasons I assure you. I'll begin with what was the icing on the cake for me: Captain America himself along with the sensational action sequences surrounding the film. Cap has simply never been portrayed the way he is here and the result is breathtaking. Cap is finally given the power he truly holds, including his unmatched superhuman strength, agility, speed, smarts, and the brilliantly expanded use of his famous shield, which gets more action in this movie than in Cap's first two films combined. The sheer power of his kick and the momentum he carries while running is displayed perfectly, something Cap needed. Captain America is truly a super soldier in this film, and compared to his first two appearances, he's like an aluminum bat versus a wooden one and the new Cap is exceptional.<br/><br/>Marvel has played it pretty safe with their stories so far, but TWS changes the game for the better. Taking a form of a political thriller, the plot is full of excellent twists and presents a new way to approach storytelling in the MCU. The movie's plot is extremely engaging and there isn't a dull moment to be found in the story thanks to stellar pacing, wonderfully displayed themes and an overall sense of a thriller that the other Marvel films just don't have. Without a doubt the best story that has been told in the MCU thus far, and gives Phase 2 of the MCU a fresh shot in the arm in terms of diversity in its storytelling.<br/><br/>Now there is the action. If I had to describe the action in TWS in one word, I would say exhilarating. The combat is fast paced, intense and diverse. Captain America isn't the only hero in battle of course, as Black Widow and Cap's trusty sidekick The Falcon also join the fight and their added skills and action scenes help further my point of tremendous action. To expand, Black Widow just keeps getting more and more awesome in every film, and her smarts and lethal attack are at the top of her game once again. Furthermore, the addition of The Falcon is an excellent one. Sidekicks don't really fly in superhero movies these days, but by giving The Falcon a unique skill set and equipment, along with a lovable personality, he is a welcomed addition to the MCU. The hand-to-hand combat is a sight to behold, with some of the best choreography I've seen in a movie in a long time. Combat is simply a blast to watch, it keeps you hooked all the way through. Some of these action scenes couldn't be complete without our main villain, who also happens to have his name in the title. The Winter Soldier, one of Cap's most deadly and complicated foes, posses a huge threat to Cap and the people around him. The action scenes between The Winter Solider and Cap are addicting to watch. High energy fights pave the way for a thrill of a ride, so fasten your seat belts.<br/><br/>Marvel has yet to cast a dud, and a good majority of the solidified cast of characters from the first Captain America film and the rest of the MCU are here. The aforementioned Black Widow, played by the lovely Scarlett Johansson and staple Nick Fury, played of course by Samuel L. Jackson, return for the sequel and both give grade A performances. Chris Evans reprises his role as the Star Spangled Avenger, and gives his best performance yet, with better controlled and displayed emotions to go along with his ability to play the serious leader, while providing a perfect blend of humor. Sebastian Stan returns to now play the villain role, and channels his inner Bane as the Winter Soldier, with a terrific performance as a brainwashed terrorist who can evoke fear with just his eyes. Throw in rising star Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/The Falcon, who also provides great comedic relief, and star Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, and you have one of the best, most well balanced casts seen so far in the MCU.<br/><br/>The Avengers was a superhero epic, putting together the big team of heroes on the big screen for the first time made movie history and the spectacle was phenomenal. But with Captain America: The Winter Solider, you have a whole new ball game. A new and enhanced version of The First Avenger is the foundation of a political thriller with adrenaline- charged action sequences, superb acting from the cast, with memorable characters, exciting storytelling and a perfect blend of humor and pacing. Marvel keeps setting the bar higher and higher for itself, and now with this supremely brilliant Phase 2 entry, Marvel now must deliver an even more memorable Avengers sequel on May 1, 2015 to beat out the Captain.<br/><br/>10/10"

Although I never would have guessed that Dr. Zola survived and landed a job at SHIELD.

You could really relate to what was going on with Cap. I also really like how flawlessly this movie mixed action and humor. In Thor: The Dark World, I felt like they were trying to force in the humor, but not in this movie. They really did a great job mixing the two together. The character's were also written so well.

Samuel Jackson really grasp the character as the head of the secret security force. Some old enemies in the Russians pop up but the Cap is ready to take them on with some good ole American know how.

"helloimyellow007","10","0","1","8 May 2014"," The Best of Phase Two & the Highest Stake Marvel Film so Far.
","There was a moment where I though I would quit my continuation with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), I always felt that after phase one the series for me had more of a direct audience appeal towards kids with films like The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World and even Iron Man 3. However, Marvel's most recent release, Captain America: The Winter Soldier directed by Anthony & Joe Russo is one of those movies I never really expected out of universe from what I've seen so far within the MCU. Focusing on more conspiracy and espionage related themes within, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is something fresh from what Marvel has to offer and in this humble reviewer's opinion: the best out of phase two so far.<br/><br/>For starters, Marvel had to know that this was going to be their riskiest film to date because a lot of these films are mostly catered towards a younger audience. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is probably the most mature, dark and sinister film to date in the MCU. Themes such as trust and conspiracy are thrown around really giving that feeling that any of the characters can turn against you. Instead of a straight up action film like a lot of these Marvel movies are, the film has a more espionage feel to it, basically think of it as Captain America meeting ""The Bourne Ultimatum"".<br/><br/>The film as a whole, mostly focuses on Steve Rogers' adjustment to the new world that he was brought upon and he's trying to come to grips with it. He shows that he isn't used to the customs within the modern era like his disagreement with SHIELD's idea of freedom and security saying that it is instead fear and oppression. I would say that Chris Evans does an excellent job at making Captain America a better character in this film than the previous Marvel films. He has a more logical and involving role than in The Avengers with him just jumping over cars, doing gymnast moves and does something cool with his shield every now and then (if others can be critical of Man of Steel, I can be critical of The Avengers). I feel that with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Cap's role is given reason and helps establish his presence throughout. <br/><br/>Another character that has been developed surprisingly well is Nick Fury. I could say that this was also Nick Fury's story as much as I can say this is Captain America's story. Black Widow's back and she's great as ever in this film with the arc of conspiracy and her being a spy there is some conflict that goes on between Steve Rogers (also the visual appeal of Scarlett Johansson is always a good thing, let's all be honest here). They also introduce Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson aka. The Falcon. He's an amiable character and all around dependable guy within the story and the action. A surprising favourite character that I didn't really expect to like in this film is Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce. he gives a captivating performance as the head of the World Security Council and his presence gives that espionage feel when you first see him on screen. (I'm sure this is just me, but still he's my favourite). He creates a lot of the uncertainty with Captain America with Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D because they haven't really been that trustworthy when first experiencing the film. The Winter Soldier in my opinion is probably one of the most intimidating individuals in the MCU. Every fight when the Winter Soldier is involved you feel that the action going as you're watching it, also the design of the Winter Soldier is just awesome.<br/><br/>In terms of the action in this movie, there's far less CGI type action in this film than I expected. Judging from the trailers prior to the release of the of the film there were a genuine amount of scenes that were computer generated (especially the helicarrier parts). To my surprise there isn't much, most of this movie takes place on the streets with more practical effects and the fights scenes are really fast paced and well-choreographed overall. A lot of the large scale action is near the end of the film. <br/><br/>Even with all great things about Captain America: The Winter Soldier, there are still some gripes that bothered me in this movie, and them involving the Winter Soldier himself. While he is a cool looking character, they try to make you care for the character with certain flashbacks which should create some emotion with the audience. The problem with this is that the flashbacks aren't that effective as it should be and would require a viewing of Captain America: The First Avenger in order to do so, however going into more detail here would be entering spoiler territory. The final thing I want to note is that to understand The Winter Soldier, watching Captain America: The First Avenger would help you understand the flow of what is in the Winter Soldier. Even with all this, I still recommend Captain America: The Winter Soldier as its own stand alone film for the MCU just like the first Iron Man in phase one. <br/><br/>Overall Captain America: The Winter Soldier is strong entry in the MCU as it holds together as an alright standalone film, it is also the highest stake and riskiest film that Marvel has attempted so far. Great performances by the main cast, great action and also a great story all tying in to make Captain America: The Winter Soldier an awesome film.<br/><br/>8/10:(Awesome)<br/><br/>PS: Please provide feedback and like this if this was helpful.<br/><br/>It's much appreciated if you guys follow my blog at:<br/><br/>http://haukeye-reviews.tumblr.com/<br/><br/>Thank You very much for taking the time to read this and considering the thought of following me."

","There was something rousing about the first ""Captain America"", with a heroic turn by Evans who adapted quite well to his newly found mission. The ending was of course a bit disconcerting, as we saw him make an uneasy transition to the modern world. It becomes more complicated in the sequel where we find out that those darn agencies are hiding way more than we expected, and that the competition might be tougher than we believed possible.<br/><br/>Steve and Natasha need to join forces and work carefully in order to stop Hydra's ultimate takeover. The problem is that their main source of support is handicapped when treachery strikes. If you add to this the fact that there is another soldier out there who match Captain America's powers, the fights become more intense and exciting.<br/><br/>The script is intelligent, designed to give us quite a ride because it is a combination of smart dialog, quick to deliver the gist of the plot, without tiring us with convoluted scenarios. The editing and special effects provide the perfect balance as we are treated to some spectacular visuals showcasing some terrific technology which includes great fight choreography. It will please most of us in the audience.<br/><br/>I was thinking we're being flooded with the characters from the Marvel universe, and it would become too much. However as long as the story draws us in, the actors more match our preconception of what these characters have become for us in our respective imagination, we will have a marvelous time at the movies."

Don't worry if your favorite character is killed, they seem to reappear.<br/><br/>The action is almost non-stop with bullets flying all over and cars flipping and exploding.

","this movie is amazing , its packed with action and complex story . this movie kind of reminded me of iron man 3 for some reason.from the beginning when the movie starts to the end you wont get bored at all. the Avengers first 45 minutes were boring but this movie does a great job keeping the audience entertained.the movie has a great plot.falcon and black widow made a huge difference ,if they weren't in the movie, Chris Evan would have had hard time ,but he is also great. I wish there was a bit more depth to the villains character.there were so many twists that even if you have to pee ,you wont go.This is my favorite Marvel movie, by now .Yes! even the Avengers and iron man 3.Anyways great movie .<br/><br/>must watch!"
"jonngu99","10","0","2","7 May 2014"," A captivating story with amazing action
","Like most other Marvel movies, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a film definitely worth watching in theaters. If you are not a die hard Captain America fan you won't feel left out, but if you didn't watch the first film, like me, you may want to. Everything that happens in the movie has a purpose and nothing feels out of place the entire way through. The movie is filled with action packed battle scenes and the effects were very jaw dropping. <br/><br/>The best part about this movie and all other superhero movies, in my opinion, is the escape from reality. Right from the beginning of the movie I escaped reality and lept into the world of Marvel. Escaping reality is important due to feeling empowered and feeling like anything is possible. The film is very creative and manages to stay original in some aspects considering how many of these types of movies have been released. After the movie had ended several reflections of reality floated around in my head. For example, S.H.I.E.L.D, a large hitech law enforcement agency, is very similar to our government and our enemies may be closer than we thought.The movie needs to be watched to understand this but, the movie may challenge some beliefs that you have of our own government. <br/><br/>Chris Evans did an excellent job as Captain America. He really suits the role by being a amazing enthusiastic protagonist and is very fit. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was also a treat. She did an incredible job of being the sidekick of Evans and deserves to be in her own movie. Samuel L. Jackson has always been an outstanding actor and his portrayal of Nick Fury, one of the leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D, is no exception to his flawless career.<br/><br/>The movie has a clear meaning all the way through which is the good guys always win but, evil will always be present. Without spoiling the ending of the movie, the heroes make a very tough decision because they knew it was the right choice. This shows the true nature of humans and how everyone is good. Overall this was a great movie and will need more viewings to find flaws that I may have missed. The second installment to the Captain America films is fantastic and will definitely be one of the best movies of 2014."

","I Know there are probably worse super heroes out there. But Captain America is probably my least favourite of the more well known ones. A Superman rip-off who throws his shield at people? Ye, great. I almost gave this one a miss. But when almost everyone recommended it too me. I was nice enough to give it the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>Now I haven't changed my mind about the first movie. It was still fairly lame, rushed, and had a lot of poor decisions in it. But they really tried to up their game in this one. I have to say. As Much off a goof-ball as Captain America is. The More straight forward, yet action packed approach this film takes works more in its favour. I was entertained by a movie that I thought was going to suck. And I always love when that happens.<br/><br/>""Captain America â€“ The Winter soldier"" is a stand out ""Marvel"" movie, in that its rekindled my interest in the series for the first time since ""The Avengers"" was awesome. These guys are making so much money now, and they've got most of their origin stories out off the way. That I guess they can just get on with making some great movies. Onwards and upwards I say!"
"KineticSeoul","9","0","2","6 May 2014"," Epitome of a better superhero sequel
","This has got to be one of the best Marvel movies I have seen so far. It has just about everything I wanted to see in a Captain America movie. The first one was alright, but this one just blows the previous movie out of the water. It's just really cool to see Cap integrate and utilize his skill sets, and the movements and fighting skills was just super entertaining to watch. As a matter of fact this has one of the best hand to hand combat fights ever. The plot flows really well and the editing is done just right. The chemistry between the characters is good and just about all the characters are not wasted and actually has roles to play. Especially Nick Fury. When it comes to the action it's some of the best sequences I have ever seen. Especially since Cap doesn't really have legit superpowers all that much. So his vulnerability makes it fun, thrilling, and cool when he throws down with other human villains. Mainly because Cap and some of the villains pull of all kinds of maneuvers instead of just relying on powers and weapons (unless you count fists as weapons). And even Cap's main weapon his shield is utilized to another level. I think the bar for superhero movies when it comes to action has just gotten set to another level with this one.<br/><br/>9/10"
"addietomic","7","0","1","6 May 2014"," Realism instead of fairytale
","As ""Captain America:The Winter Soldier"" began its release in the US and both the world it was fairly evident, due to instant super-success, we're facing something of somewhat finer quality. Let's get with the program, flicks that break quarter of a billion dollars income (which is merely now a question of date) at the States usually don't have to blame only their commonly strong commercial propaganda. We only need to remember ""John Carter""'s 2011 misfire for that matter. The true reason for its fortune grossing is the realism of the combat sequences much closer in spirit with Daniel Craig's James Bond than say, ""Captain America:The First Avenger"". Further more, the real world everlasting problematics of war veteran reintegration among society, which is here probably the leading subtle plot line. All that combined result in a fast pace, confident and never-childish action thriller that delivers on many levels. Chris Evans is convincing and unusually calm as the all American unstoppable superhero, Scarlett Johansson is daring, sexy as well as illusive, Sam Jackson does his usual similar performance as ever and Robert Redford as the conniving billionaire utters his first time ever bad guy role with extreme prejudice. All together a strong 7,5/10. Thumbs up."
"infernalaffairs1980","Null","0","1","5 May 2014"," The Captain moves Marvel forward
","The latest instalment of the Marvel franchise has landed in the muscly form of Captain America. However the main attraction is neither the size of Chris Evans arms (sorry ladies) nor the pout of the beautiful Scarlett Johansson (never mind boys). Instead, the whole film is nothing short of a game changer for those that follow the Marvel universe and the TV series. Without giving too much away, watching the old films will never be the same again.<br/><br/>Mr Evans does a fantastic job as the man out of time trying to make sense of the world he now inhabits. Joining him this time is Ms Johansson as the arse-kicking Black Widow, and Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, aka, Falcon. Both are great in their sidekick roles; Black Widow gives the girls a reason to cheer by holding her own against the men of the movie, however these moments seem to be inter-cut with several lingering shots of her tightly clad bum. Mackie also plays his part well without looking like he is just auditioning for his own solo film.<br/><br/>The film is action sequence after action sequence but this doesn't detract from the plot. The only negative I have with the faster paced scenes is that sometimes the punches and kicks are a blur (but that could be something to do with my age).<br/><br/>And now onto the titular Winter Soldier. I won't reveal his identity, even if it is pretty much an open secret now. However I will say that, although he is an excellent foil for Steve Roger's Captain, I would have liked to see him a lot more. For a man whose name is in the title, he plays second fiddle to some of the other bad guys.<br/><br/>Despite my Winter Soldier gripe, this is a fantastic film and really does open up the future for the Marvel film franchise. There are little nods to other Marvel characters, both old and new, which should keep every fan boy (and girl) happy. As usual please stay until the end of the credits for two post film sequences, the first of which had me squeal with delight... thank goodness there was only my boyfriend and daughter in the cinema (who were just as excited).<br/><br/>www.silverscreensnob.blogspot.com"
"katieanderson1985","8","0","1","4 May 2014"," Good, But a Little Less Might Have Been More
","I saw the movie at as drive-in theater two days ago. I will say one thing; the film is entertaining. I guess that's the most important thing. Personally, I could do with a few less explosions and over-the- top martial arts-type fights and instead have a little more plot and character development. I think the thing is; with a little more character development, the viewer cares more about who will win the fight, or survive the explosion, rather than just being mesmerized by the loud special effects and fights that are, in reality, so wildly absurd they are to the point of being silly. Maybe the movie is trying for ""silly"". There's nothing wrong with a movie giggle. I'm just not sure that I was giggling with them, or at them. <br/><br/>I was surprised to see Robert Redford not only as a villain, but in a relatively small role. I think there was a time when he did not want to play bad guys for fear it would hurt his star image. Apparently he feels that that day is over. But we should wait and see if he ever cuts his hair for a movie part. He hasn't yet and its been over four decades."
"FairlyAnonymous","8","0","1","4 May 2014"," Taking Superhero movies to the next level
","I'm not going to lie:<br/><br/>I had no idea what I was in for with this movie. I didn't watch any trailers because it didn't sound interesting to me. <br/><br/>HOWEVER when I did see it, it turns out to be arguably one of the greatest directed Marvel movies since Iron Man.<br/><br/>The thing about The Winter Soldier is that the movie works very well. The plot is actually the movie's greatest aspect. There is no part in the plot I can complain about. In most Marvel movies there are times where I question why people did certain things, but in this movie I didn't have any questions about the character's decisions. It all worked out and it all made sense.<br/><br/>I will mention that I actually almost despise the first film. For a movie series to turn around so perfectly is a real shock. I won't give away any spoilers because this movie is full of secrets. The action in this movie is really good and The Winter Soldier has a really great and eerie soundtrack that always adds to his presence. He isn't just super strong, but he uses any weapon he can from guns, to knives, to grenades etc.. This makes him better than just a walking fist. He is a walking killing machine.<br/><br/>I lied: The movie does have one questionable part near the very end in regards to Black Widow which seemed almost stolen from Avengers... and cheesy. <br/><br/>All in all, The Winter Soldier was shockingly good and I would recommend it as long as you can handle its much more serious tone (believe me, this movie is much darker).<br/><br/>On a side-note: I would mention that after Thor 2 I feel like Marvel is getting carried away with the ""skill"" kills. For me to sympathize with a hero, they better not be ""entertaining"" themselves while killing other people. To me it's kind of like having the hero scalp an enemy. It's not really necessary and it doesn't lead to sympathy."
"MCMAYNERBERRY","10","0","1","4 May 2014"," Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson make this the best Marvel film to date
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier isn't just a phenomenal sequel, its the best Marvel movie in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Chris Evans is back as Captain America, and I feel we should all give Evans the credit he deserves. He provides the character with a likability that allows you to sympathize with him. <br/><br/>I find the highlight of the entire film is the chemistry between Evans and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. This being their fourth film together, they manage to deliver a believable relationship that evolves from mere partnership to a strong friendship (maybe even romance in future instalments). This is the first Marvel film to have two Avengers actually have a connection between one another depicted fully. Widow is implied to have history with Hawkeye, but we only saw one scene with them actually building in that.<br/><br/>Though the villain kind of serves more as a plot point, The Winter Soldier breaks Marvel's streak of forgettable bad guys (Whiplash, Malekith). He's not even really a villain, but I won't spoil anything.<br/><br/>I'm glad to see more of Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill as she's not been given able time to show off her abilities. She's cunning and quick, and serves more purpose in this film than the trailers would show.<br/><br/>The additions of Anthony Mackie and Robert Redford are welcome ones, with both their characters providing us with a more detailed character arc and plot then we've been receiving in the post Avengers sequels.<br/><br/>If I was to nitpick, I'd say Frank Grillo and Emily VanCamp as Brock Rumlow and Agent 13 were pretty underwhelming. Rumlow appearing as the typical bad guy and Agent 13 only appearing to further the plot and set up the rest of the MCU.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier makes me hopeful that future Marvel movies play out like this one: suspenseful, entertaining, funny at times and overall exciting.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier 10/10"

The movie is really moving and its really match one of the most important thing for a movie, a logic story line, but I also found the story too related to the previous Captain America. Another thing that I prefer in this movie is the hand to hand combat for Chris Evans as it is very thrill all the audience inside the box office, for a martial arts fans like me I found it the combat inside this movie is quite astounding. But overall the effects of the movie is not bad, as it is almost as natural, and it feels like there's no computer assisted. That's is great. The sound system is brilliant too.

The second half of the movie begins to appear fragmented and less coherent omitting some phases; seems that Captain is forced to survive otherwise the story cannot happy ends. Ending is too much obvious and sometimes the movie seems to loose all the intelligence of first half: example (SPOILER): the evil boss has the possibility to defeat all opponents but he waits allowing black widow to spread secret informations. Evil boss easy eliminates some secondary opponents but gives enough time the heroes to react. It's so stupid. I wonder as directors don't understand how much is stupid villains stop to act allowing heroes to prevail... Reality should give the hero a small opportunity, so to make a movie REALISTIC and credible. Other HUGE error: the combat areas lack of MILITARY FORCES... there are only CAPTAIN, Black Widow and Falcon... a great battle, huge destructions, but none knows what is happening (this is so stupid!). The first half a director, second half a different director and story maker."
"rcolgan","8","0","1","29 April 2014"," A great continuation of the Marvel Universe
","Once again Marvel's brilliant cinematic universe is continuing to expand with it's universe being shaken by it core by this great film. This somewhat surprised me seeing as the first Captain America was a fairly standard film offering nothing but character origins and exposition in the lead up to the avengers. Similarly this one has a lot of that too, the difference being that it had a good story and exciting actions sequences to go with it.<br/><br/>The film follows a much more realistic plot than the previous Marvel films as Captain America becomes on the run from SHIELD with it being corrupted from the inside and starts to hunt him. At the same time as this he has to deal with the new threat of the Winter Soldier and the mystery of his identity.<br/><br/>Despite the tense tone of the plot, the film still gets in a lot of good humour just like the rest of the Marvel films, one of the best being a glimpse at a list of all the things Captain America has to catch up on over the past 60 years, which I'm sure will have us all reaching to the pause button when the film comes to DVD.<br/><br/>Also just like the rest of the Marvel Universe we have a strong sense of comradeship within the film as characters like Black Widow, Nick Fury and the Falcon all come together to face the threat and fight very closely as a team. This theme is particularly emphasised when they become uncertain of who they're able to trust from SHIELD leaving them more isolated and more reliant on one another as we really get to see within the fight scenes.<br/><br/>Some of the fight scenes really are impressive with a good mixture of hand to hand combat, gun combat and a lot of shield based attacks. One fight scene stood out more than any other though which is Nick Fury's first full fight as we watch him fight off a small squadron after he is ambushed in his car. Not only is it the first time we see Fury in a full combat situation, but it's also an impressive scene with some great use of various weapons, incredible tension as he becomes quickly overwhelmed and some really good humour thrown in to boot possibly making it one of my favourite action sequences so far this year.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the film was that the Winter Soldier himself was not as well done as the trailer had led me to believe he would be. Obviously they explain the mystery of who he is and why he's doing this, but it comes late in the film and we don't really get to see much of the aftermath of how the Cap deals with it and instead chooses to focus more on the action. Saying that it does seem like they will be going in to it more in the sequel so hopefully we'll see more of him in the next one to improve upon it.<br/><br/>In spite of this small flaw this remains a great addition to the Marvel Universe and really raises my expectations for both the Avengers and the rest of the Marvel universe that's yet to come. A huge improvement over it's predecessor this one is definitely worth a watch."

","Things got off to a bad start when I went to see CAPTAIN America 2: thirty minutes of TELEVISION COMMERCIALS preceded the movie. Shades of MAN OF STEEL... Sure, I know we're all living in a Corporate Culture, now, but gimme a f***in' break! (The Corporate Culture of which I speak permeates the movie: The Falcon himself wears clothing sporting the infamous logo of a notorious, internationally-reviled sweat-shop operation wherein 1,135 worker-slaves died. Apparently, he has no qualms whatsoever about said building collapse...) On a more positive note, our heroes DO end up taking down the Neo Reich, whose intentions are to bring back the Old World Order. (They even mention Dr. Stephen Strange as ""a person of interest."" That's DR. STRANGE, for those of you who don't know- ""Master of the Mystic Arts."") It was good to see former UFC welterweight champion Georges St. Pierre as Batroc the Leaper, though his part was much too small. Most of the PHYSICAL hand-to-hand fight scenes are good, though some of the cgi are (as usual) forgettable. (The Falcon soars all too briefly in this movie, and gets his wings clipped far too soon.) The yellow-orange makeup slathered on Scarlet Johannson gives her a sickly, yellow-jaundice look and the ""secret"" of The Winter Soldier comes as no surprise to anyone who paid attention to the ""foreshadowing."" (And how DOES he get through metal detectors...?) All told, it's not a bad movie, but it IS long and talky for a superhero show. Hail Hydra. (Jack Kirby- who, along with Joe Simon, CREATED Captain America- also created a far more interesting character late in his comic book career- OMAC, The One-Man Army Corps, set ""in the world that's coming."" It's almost prescient, OMAC. It's set ""in the era of the Super Rich,"" when a rich man can literally rent an entire city and populate it with hired assassins. You can also upgrade and get ""new bodies for old."" There's also Brother Eye in the sky, and the Global Peace Agency. Sound plausible...?)"

He displays the personality fit to be of a humble yet effective leader.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) is as usual 'dangerously hot'. She manages to give good fight scenes, given that Captain America is far more ahead of her in this aspect. Her character displays ample confidence throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson (Nick Fury) as the S.H.I.E.L.D. boss is also impressive. He keeps you mysterious about the turn of events and makes you use your brain.<br/><br/>All the characters have been given appropriate time in the film. The story is good, keeps you hooked up. The Captain alone manages to kick dozens of butts in the film. The actions scenes and the CGIs are terrific. There's no chance that you can't love it.<br/><br/>And last special mention goes to the Captain America's shield which proved to be tremendously useful weapon/defense through out the movie. He hits everything with the shield, literally everything; people, doors, airplanes, walls, wires, road, windows, engines, the villain, locks etc. It's really amusing to see all of that. You shouldn't miss this.<br/><br/>Enjoyable action scenes. Watch out, many more for you to see in the movie. The movie's a real delight for the viewers. Missing it would be so WRONG on your part, if are a marvel and/or avengers fan, or even a good action movie fan.<br/><br/>P.S. I haven't even mentioned about the tech stuff, guns and machines. Those will thrill you when you see for yourself . Now don't just sit there, grab a ticket and watch the movie."

","Well, Where to start? I loved Falcon, Cap and Winter Soldier. Next episode of this movie will a blast. First thing that annoyed me is that S.H.E.I.L.D who created the Avengers to compete and fight for New York in Avengers all of sudden is nothing but working for Hydra.For all those years Hydra was in it and they done nothing. This was so difficult for me to not believe in S.H.E.I.L.D. Hope i didn't understand the movie so i'm gonna watch it again.Falcon was great and but he and Natasha had some little role in the movie.Winter Soldier was good but story line for him was not enough to satisfy me. Overall action was very nice but story was little weak.Acting was great. This is my personal opinion. No offense to any one."

Unlike other recent action films (Iron Man, Superman) the powers that be opted for a no nonsense approach and spared us from the usual 'too much talk too little action' and treated us to some high quality, impressive spectacle.<br/><br/>Captain America seems to find it hard to cope in the modern world but this struggle would come to an end when he must encounter an old foe from the Second World War.<br/><br/>In times of great danger, the world needs the sort of hero to stand up to the challenge.

Remember them? When movies about aliens and natural disasters were all the rage! Those formula movies appeared to be box-office proof...assured cinematic gold! Under the category of ""Where Are They Now?""...well now they are the SyFy produced movies of the week! And this is were Marvel and the whole superhero genre is heading, though at this point in time it might appear impossible!<br/><br/>""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is not technically a bad movie, hence the 7 out of 10 rating. What has changed, for me personally, as a movie-goer, is the fact that I have reached saturation point with these genre movies.<br/><br/>Superhero movies are not a new venture by any means, yet for a long while they lay dormant with only scant and often appalling examples coming out in movie cineplexes around the world.<br/><br/>When back in the early 2000's they started trickling back in, I was at once excited and hopeful, so many interesting characters, so many interesting stories to tell. But as time passed, the trickle became a flood and now everywhere you turn, there is some franchise, sequel, prequel, re-boot, re-boot of a re-boot, all under this large tent-pole of the superhero genre, and Marvel is clearly the standard bearer when it comes to this cinematic universe we seem to be stuck in.<br/><br/>And while at this point it seems highly unlikely, as the latest offering(""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"") from this all-you-can eat cinematic buffet has proved , Marvel and its superheroes do run the risk of going the way of the dodo bird...<br/><br/>All it takes is one or two gigantic missteps or outright failures for this house of cards to come down. Since these movies and their budgets are increasing at an exponentially ridiculous rate (I mean a quarter of a billion dollars?!?!?!?), a few duds could literally push a movie- studio out of business, or at the very least seriously cramp their style! <br/><br/>As I said, not a bad movie, but the end, as far as I can see it, is nigh...the point of saturation is impending. It is no longer a matter of how, but a question of when? <br/><br/>And given the fact that the movie industry seems to have largely abandoned original ideas and projects, and has come to rely so heavily on these large franchise/sequel type of movies (yes, YA- Young Adults included)...when they collapse the movie-wasteland they could leave in their wake may be tremendous!"

","I initially enjoyed the first Captain American, though, after seeing this, I see how it pales in comparison.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier, while it has great action set pieces, solid acting and enough twists to keep people guessing, also features a retro-spy thriller plot that was refreshing in this particular context.<br/><br/>Captain American is under attack. Not just by the Winter Soldier, but by the forces who he is fighting on the behalf of. This leads to some moral questioning and some re-evaluating what he stands for and why.<br/><br/>This sort of introspection is a welcome reprieve from wall to wall action. While The Winter Soldier has plenty of that, it offers a plot that borderlines on The Captain's paranoia, which, as it turns out, is well placed."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Many were unimpressed with the first Captain America movie, though I have always had a soft spot for the most heroic and genuinely pure of the superheroes. This sequel opens with Steve Rogers trying to acclimate after a 70 year sleep ... he thinks the internet is pretty cool. It is a bit surprising that the Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe, known for You, Me and Dupree) are the ones who load up on plot lines within a Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Starting off with big time action sequences, the movie then morphs into a geopolitical weave of intrigue between SHIELD and HYDRA. New to this maze of distrust is Robert Redford ... proving once again that Hollywood doesn't trust guys wearing suits in fancy offices. In a twist, Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves the target of a manhunt by those they work for. Then they drag The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) into this ... his flight suit is a nice effect. All of this happens after an unexpected action-packed sequence featuring Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson).<br/><br/>The multiple plot lines and emphasis on trust issues all correlate pretty well to some of the things going on in the world today. That adds an enjoyable element that really brings relevance to the Captain America character. Because of this the repartee between Cap and Natasha is limited ... we get some, but much less than what we have come to expect from other Avengers-related films. And it's probably a good idea to go a different direction with the Avenger who really is different from the others. Don't miss the extra scene in the closing credits ... it's the lead in to The Avengers movie coming in 2015."

"jamieradford","6","0","2","16 April 2014"," Couple of hours of fun, but nowhere near as good as the first
","I was never a big Captain America fan growing up. I cannot recall buying a single comic book of his, even though most of my pocket money as a child was spent on comics. That being said though, I thoroughly enjoyed Captain America: The First Avenger, released in 2011.<br/><br/>The most impressive aspect of the first film was the credibility of the storyline. Albeit, one based on a comic book character. It did not overuse computer generated imagery (CGI), and the way in which Captain America was brought from the 1940s, to the 21st century was (given the genre), plausible.<br/><br/>The same cannot be said for its sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>Even for a movie based on a comic book superhero, the storyline is, dare I say it, comical. While the premise and origin of the assassin known as 'the winter soldier' is perfectly acceptable, everything else in the film is just too over the top. However perhaps the films' biggest fault lies in that it seems to completely ignore the existence and events of 2012's 'The Avengers'.<br/><br/>Given the circumstances Captain America finds himself in, it is unreasonable to think that other members of The Avengers would not be called in to assist him. Particularly given that the algorithm the film centres on comes up with Bruce Banner's (The Hulk) name as a future threat. Not to mention the discovery that Tony Stark's (Iron Man) father's death was not an accident, as previously thought, and the fact that the fate of the world is at stake.<br/><br/>This was not the case with either Iron Man 3, or the second Thor film. Both were released after The Avengers, yet both followed on smoothly from the events of that film. In Iron Man's case, coming to terms mentally with what occurred in The Avengers, and Thor having to team up with his adopted and now imprisoned brother Loki – the villain of the ensemble film.<br/><br/>The film makers could have concentrated more on the antagonism and personal connection between The Winter Soldier and Captain America. Instead it is just one small part of a convoluted myriad of senseless sub plots that do not really come together, nor fit in with previous films set in the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>Of course the special effects are amazing, but there is nothing new of note, and it has all been seen before. If anything, the film relies too much on CGI, which while being momentarily satisfying, is hardly memorable.<br/><br/>The acting is solid, but nothing more. Although given what they have to work with, the cast hardly be criticised for that. Even Robert Redford's presence in the film cannot raise it above its own mediocrity.<br/><br/>However, despite all of the above Captain America: The Winter Soldier does provide a couple of hours of escape from the real world. And as long as you leave logic, and any great expectations at the door, those two hours can also be entertaining ones."

Its impossible to comprehend. Where did all the money go? We went shopping, at Shopper's Drugmart. They gave away these two free Movie Passes if you spend over $75.00 in the store. So we actually needed a bunch of items, and it was a nice surprise. I said, ""Lets go see Captain America!"" ""Yay!"" said my children in unison. Off we went, would have cost our family $80 to go to this movie in 3D, I would've saved my money, and at the end of the year, $80 every Weekend x4= $320/Month X12=$3,840.00 , we would book our flight to Hawaii, and Vaycay there for 9 days.<br/><br/>Everything adds up in life, Vacation to Hawaii, or $80 movie that cost $170,000,000.00. Now there are approx. 500 Children at my daughter's elementary school. average 300 in family of four doing the same thing would be 300X$3,840.00= $1,152,000.00 Now lets divide that SUM into $170,000,000.00 and see how many families it would take if they didn't go to the movies for an entire year, and instead we all invested in one huge blockbuster budget of a movie like 'Captain America'. $170,000,000.00 / $1,152,000.00 = 147.5X300<br/><br/>= 44,271 families to make this movie.<br/><br/>Therefore we can say, 44,271 families saving $80/Week for a year, by NOT going to the MOVIES, and instead contributing their money together, could budget this film..of $170,000,000.00.<br/><br/>So I say to my daughters, make friends with 44,271 individuals, get them each to invest approx 4 GRAND , and you can make a movie just like CAPTAIN America!!!"

"ghost_dog86","7","0","2","10 April 2014"," From the directors of ""You, Me and Dupree""
","After director Joe Johnston's savagely disappointing attempt to bring the Marvel superhero Captain America to life three years ago, the creative minds that brought us ""You, Me and Dupree"" (Anthony and Joe Russo) somehow get a crack at the sequel, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". Though it sounds like I'm ready to rip this movie, to my surprise ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" was (for the most part) quite entertaining, with visually stunning action sequences throughout. But even more surprising, especially because this was made by the guys who directed ""You, Me and Dupree"" (I don't know if I mentioned that disturbing bit of trivia already) is how this theatrical release also contains much more well timed laughs than I bargained for.<br/><br/>If I'm not mistaken, Captain America is less of a goody goody and more of a ""bad ass"" in this installment. Right away we get to see him in action, throwing people around and basically kicking major butt. Thus, a huge reason as to why ""The Winter Soldier"" works as well as it does, has a lot to do with the directors keeping the octane at a relatively high level and not boring me to tears. Any real flaws here (and there are a few) would only be noticed by audiences who attempted to actually break the plot down.<br/><br/>The Synopsis: Just as Captain America aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has nearly adapted to life in the modern world, a beaten and bloodied Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) shows up in his apartment, where we learn that S.H.I.E.L.D has been compromised by a villain from Captain America's past. He is also confronted by a bad guy who goes by the name of the Winter Soldier, whose strengths seem to match up suspiciously well to that of the Captain's. The story itself is pretty good, even though it is bogged down with a lot of double and triple cross espionage-type twists and turns that I didn't quite understand. But much like the last Iron Man film, where ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" runs into trouble is with its villains; one played by Robert Redford and the other the aforementioned mysterious Winter Soldier. Even though the movie starts out with an awesome fight sequence between the Captain and George St. Pierre, the main villain is an old man named Alexander Pierce (Redford) who spends the whole movie in one room and the other is the infamous Winter Soldier, who is made to look pretty intimidating for a while (again, kudos to the direction) playing an evil version of Captain America. But even his storyline leads to revelations which softened his villainous exterior and a final battle which left me cold and wishing that I could fast forward to the post credits teaser clip. The fact is, for having his name included in the title, the Greek tragedy-esque connections between Captain America and the Winter Soldier was far more fascinating than actually watching the Winter Soldier do anything; which is a problem.<br/><br/>Side Note: I guess I must mention that this film also stars Scarlet Johansson, who by design plays a huge role, reprising her character, Black Widow. As if audiences had demanded she get more screen-time, Johansson is in 80% of the movie, wearing her signature form fitting one piece and seducing every male ""bad guy"" to nearly an inch of their lives. Anthony Mackie is also in this playing the Falcon, a sort of side kick to the title character. He flies around and stuff, but that's about it. Moving on.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is impressive for a Marvel sequel, but still (as far as Marvel films go) its more along the lines of the first Thor film than the first Iron Man film, mainly because the character of Steve Rogers is still very two dimensional. And before I get hate mail, this is not a direct knock on the movie, but more so of the character himself. I understand that the ""total good"" characteristic of Captain America is by design. My point is, I don't believe it translates all that well to audiences who nowadays would rather see a shades of grey antihero, than an old school hero whose morals are impervious to a dynamic character arc."

","Captain America: The Winter Soldier was not just a great comic book movie, but a great movie that can stand on it's own. The movie begins with Steve Rodgers (Captain America) running through Washington DC and constantly passing and at the same time annoying, soon to be friend Sam Wilson. Rodgers and Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) are sent on a mission to rescue a boat full of hostages. Discovering that Natasha was given a separate mission, Rodgers confronts Nick Fury (head of S.H.I.E.L.D) regarding the lack of communication and trust between the two men. Fury discovers a security breach with S.H.I.E.L.D.s special helicarrier defense system, which allows them to eliminate targets at any time anywhere in the world. He approaches longtime friend and senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce and requests the project be put on hold. <br/><br/>Fury is hunted and eventually shot by the mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier. Before he dies, Fury hands Captain America a secret flash drive and tells him to trust no one in S.H.I.E.L.D. Captain America is summoned by Pierce and after refusing to divulge information that he received from Fury he is declared a fugitive and is now being hunted by S.H.I.E.L.D.<br/><br/>Together with the Natasha and Sam Wilson (the Falcon), they discover that Fury's assassination and the security breach within S.H.I.E.L.D. come from HYDRA, an organization that opposes S.H.I.E.L.D. and whose goal is world domination. <br/><br/>After being rescued by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill Rodgers, Romanoff, and Wilson discover that Fury faked his own death and he now has a plan to disable the helicarriers and defeat HYDRA. Natasha and Fury kill Alexander Pierce and with releases all information about S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA to the public At the same time The Falcon and Captain America neutralize two of the helicarriers. On the last helicarrier, a battle between the Winter Soldier and Captain America ensues. Captain America eventually triumphs and disables the last helicarrier while at the same time helping the Winter Soldier remember who he once was (Steve Rodgers' best friend Bucky Barnes). With HYDRA thwarted and S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Fury heads to Europe to search for additional HYDRA cells. Natasha goes underground as all her covers were blown. Captain America and the Falcon go searching for the Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>What I feel separated this movie from other Marvel movies was the storyline, interactions between the characters and the cinematography. The storyline progressed and nuances were explained so that anybody walking into the theater could watch the movie and understand everything even if they have never read a comic. At the same time, it stayed true enough to the comics that those nuanced with the character and history were not upset. One of the main conflicts within the story was how Fury and Rodgers, while working for the same side and wanting largely the same thing, have very different ideas and approaches on how to achieve their goals. This issue was apparent throughout the movie and was never resolved, but I do not feel that it was meant to be resolved. You can see the characters slightly change throughout the movie. Fury reevaluates how far is too far when the safety of the world concerned. Rodgers begins to accept that there are shades of gray and he needs to adjust how he sees the world. <br/><br/>The actors assembled for the movie were first class and gave excellent performances. Samuel Jackson was superb as Nick Fury and came across with the seriousness that one would expect of a grizzled spy tasked with protecting the world. Robert Redford's performance as Alexander Pierce was compelling and he came across as sinister, but at the same time honestly believed in what he was doing. The interaction between the characters and the acting was superb. The dialogue was interesting and presented well. Humor was injected into the film at the appropriate times as to not take anything away from the characters and events. From the moment Rodgers and Wilson meet, you can instantly see the chemistry that they have with each other. They get along in a way that leads you to believe that they will work together and become life long friends. Scarlet Johansson was excellent as Natasha Romanoff. At times she was sexy and serious without putting forth too much effort, but at the same time she was able to come across as fun and vulnerable when the situation called for it. She did a great job of engaging Rodgers and getting him to open up. I appreciated the fact that they chose to have her come across as the concerned friend/little sister instead of attempting a forced romance between the two characters. Fury's interactions with Rodgers were great and it definitely showed the differences between the characters. One grew up in the 1930s and 1940s where good and evil were clearly defined and the enemy was always known. The other is the modern day soldier where the world exists with shades of gray and your allies and enemies are not always known. The interaction between characters shows the human side of these super heroes and keeps you interested and invested in the characters.<br/><br/>The cinematic aspects of the film were done very well. It was chock full of explosions, up tempo music, gunfights, and combat. But what I feel sets this film apart from the other Marvel movies was the fact that they chose to stay with as much live action as possible. They avoided CGI as much as they could. While I understand that CGI is important, when it is used too much, it makes the movie look fake and definitely takes away the movie and action itself."
"FilmMuscle","6","0","2","13 April 2014"," Caps, a Widow, and Fury
","Boy, after last year's mess that was Iron Man 3 and the proceeding mediocre Thor 2, my expectations couldn't get any lower for Marvel movies. I mean, there's really nowhere to go but up, and the hype and praise surrounding Cap's latest adventure had me curious on whether or not this would be the movie where Marvel would finally dare to take more risks and establish a less goofy and embarrassing tone. Now, of course, this is one of those crowd-pleasing blockbusters where if a critic bashes the film for a certain flaw, all the rabid fans will suddenly enter a defensive, fanatic stance and refuse to accept the criticism. Frankly, I don't care. I'm not a comic book fanboy. I'm not a superhero fanboy, and I'm certainly not the biggest fan of the countless dumb blockbusters we have nowadays. Basically, what I'm saying is that I'm going to be completely honest, fully aware that everyone else has only been saying good things about the movie. <br/><br/>First of all, let's, at least, credit the film for its substantial improvements in certain areas. Guess what? This follow-up isn't pervaded with cheesy humor like Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 was. With those installments, every other utterance exiting the characters' mouths was a one-liner or quip. With such excessiveness, it began to feel like all the characters in the Marvel universe have the exact same personalities: witty, smug, and not taking anything happening around them seriously. Given, we still have those same recurrences here, just to a thankfully smaller extent. There's more drama and intrigue this time around—you knowactually making it feel like a superhero movie and not a parody of one. In fact, The Winter Soldier is a fresh take on the superhero genre as we're suddenly presented with an espionage thriller that implements quite a bit of suspense and mystery into its plot. How surprised I was to discover that there was no unnecessary on-screen romance tossed in (big shocker for Hollywood!). Wait, you mean Captain America doesn't stumble into a bar and catch the eye of a horny blonde in the back, stimulating a pointless and interfering arc throughout the rest of the film? No! None of that happens here because the focus is all on the threat and the large ensemble of characters involved. <br/><br/>Instead what follows are incredibly intense, entertaining action sequences and monumental set pieces that introduce a fine amount of more close-quarters combat rather than non-stop gunplay. It's definitely more amusing to see Captain America fight than his peers, Thor and Iron Man. In addition, and more related to the story, itself, I found the arc with SHIELD and its outcome utterly fascinating as the big militaristic organization draws interesting parallels with America's undeniably aggressive agencies and foreign policies. I consider the notion of completely flipping things around and casting SHIELD in a whole 'nother (evil) light a pleasant risk that Marvel Studios took here; the most compelling of which is the conception that there's really a lack of variance between Hydra and SHIELD. People might be brainwashed into thinking one belligerent organization is better than the other, but in the end, they just have different targets but essentially the same methods, perfectly exemplified by the line ""we don't negotiate"" as an enemy is taken down earlier in the film. <br/><br/>However, now that I've applauded the film, let's get down and dirty. I know that everyone's so excited about how much of a spy thriller this new chapter turned out to be, but that doesn't erase the fact that Marvel Studios still hasn't learned how to produce an unpredictable, high-stakes superhero film yet. In every Marvel movie thus far, we face an enormous, over-the-top conflict/threat that means the end of the world, but the whole irony is in the actuality that there's absolutely no peril felt. This could be a spoiler for the film, but the studio is just really scared of killing off major—minor, you name it—characters, or, at the very least, inserting some form of loss for the danger of the situation to actually be discerned or for the villains to be proved formidable. I haven't thought much of any villains in the Marvel universe to this point because they never cause a shocking permanent amount of damage to society/institution or never even kill any of the major characters. See, what makes this all even more infuriating is that Marvel constantly teases the idea. With every film, a significant character is killed off at some point in the film only to return later on due to whatever nonsensical excuse like being revived thanks to some deus ex machina or a silly scheme that was planned out from the get-go. By now, I never believe that any of the deaths which transpire are totally real. That, alone, kills most of the suspense that any other espionage thriller absolutely needs. <br/><br/>Continuing on, I honestly don't find Captain America that captivating or, frankly, that necessary of a superhero. ""Oh, look at me. I'm powerful because of my rebounding shield!"" There's not much creativeness that was put into the construction of his character and not enough distinction to separate him from the other superheroes. And on a completely unrelated side note, man, was that last post-credits scene totally wasted and lame. All in all, though, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is clearly a vast improvement on its predecessors with its smarter, more thoughtful plot and its merging with the thriller genre, but it still suffers from being too damn predictable in how its characters end up and the lack of impactful, truly threatening villains."

","...Then, one day, Captain America came to the present. As expected, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" must have in most reviews the word ""entertaining"" or closest synonyms, but still the overall magnitude of the new Marvel film is uneven. The big problem that dilutes the new release is that the writing and execution do not break the mainstream, but the film is a puzzle with pieces of other hero products that have circulated in recent years. ""Collage"" is an appropriate definition, where the show always ends up triumphing before the few lucid moments of exposure of the plot<br/><br/>Making a timeline with ""The Avengers"" the most American hero is in this second movie today. This leads to a couple of personal problems for the protagonist: has now become a museum relic, his wife of the 40's has aged to old, and no longer has his old friends on earth. But because a Marvel superhero movie has no time for drama, all the psychological and emotional wounds of Steve Rogers (because the drastic change) are discarded as fast as possible (the committee think ""we do not want this to become ""Hulk 2003""). On the other hand, the plot and its execution is not great: the plot has the thriller format in the style of ""Iron Man"", but is more likely to follow the flow of the James bond films (one can seriously think that this is a recycled ""Moonraker "" and ""The Spy who Loved Me""); as for implementation, there are too many symbols that desperately re-call ""Batman: The Dark Knight"" (the epic or motivational speech, the infiltrated police). Fighting (except the final show) also follow the trail of ""The Dark Knight"" and the latest James Bond film, with fights where are needed hands and muscle or a few weapons, without favoring exotic gadgets. And of course, occasional humor of these projects<br/><br/>As you can see, there are many ideas and recycling, which inevitably culminates in an inert point . The drama, as we said, is lukewarm, like motivational speeches; humor ranges from the funny to lukewarm and predictable (even the one- liners are not as impressive) or sometimes bizarre (some platitudes to fill time, eg Johansson asking the protagonist if the kiss he gave her is the first after the 2nd world war); the argument is lukewarm and the excuse to kill 20 million people to establish a higher order sounds, according to the statement made ??by the film (with videos of different social stages), more fitting for revisionist conspiracy theories as Zeitgeist, rather to a sophisticated villain (This continues in: http://reviewsandthecity.tumblr.com/post/81957637320/captain-america- the-winter-soldier-film-review)"

","Somehow this felt like a major letdown, even the introduction of Bucky as Winter Soldier felt forced. It's not a bad movie per se but worse than the first one, to me personally.<br/><br/>Maybe it would've been better not to make the movie hard to understand for people who are not that familiar with the Avengers etc. - my girlfriend didn't understand a lot even tho she knew about Hulk, Iron Man etc. yet without having seen the Avengers movie it was hard to understand more about SHIELD and what was going on.<br/><br/>I really like the MARVEL universe as a whole and hope there are lots more movies to come, hopefully better ones than Captain America 2 - it's not bad but just doesn't stand out."

","I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. Hopefully that prevents my review from suffering many unhelpful votes from Marvel fans just because I think Man of Steel and TDK trilogy are more watchable, more interesting, and I felt more involved in those movies.<br/><br/>This movie had its moments and to be honest, nothing is really wrong with the movie. It does what Captain America is about. Maybe that is the problem. I agree that this movie is fun, but I don't think it is great. It did seem somewhat predictable and maybe that is why I don't feel this movie is a 9 or 10 like many others.<br/><br/>I think Marvel is smart in cashing in on the 'to be continued' type of endings for all the Marvel movies. Like others of the Marvel Universe phases, this had some type of ending after the credits. But to be honest, I had no idea what it was even talking about. Similar to Winter Soldier. If you aren't a die-hard Captain America fan, you just won't feel satisfied as you would with Batman or Superman.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is good, not great."
"DarthVoorhees","7","0","2","12 April 2014"," Marvel has given me some hope. This film is all about Captain America and not 'Avengers 2'
","I make no apologies and am very frank in my admission that I have been disappointed with the vast majority of Mr.Feige's cinematic endeavors. 'Thor: The Dark World' and 'Iron Man 3' do nothing for the characters other than remind you that Joss Whedon will use them again in his grand 'Avengers' follow up. I walked into 'Captain America' with a fair degree of cynicism and some low expectations. I was blown away. 'Captain America' is Marvel's best offering since the original 'Iron Man'. This is no small praise. 'Captain America' does everything a good superhero movie should, have a hero with convictions who has to actually suffer to bring justice to the world. 'Captain America' not only stands up on it's own but it also actually gives weight to the Marvel cinematic universe. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, this is a very gritty action film. The Russos stage fights that could happen in an R rated action film. The movie uses the least C.G.I of any Marvel film. And thus the film is great benefited because we are not disconnected from our heroes. Characters bleed when they get hurt. Captain America isn't fighting monsters or men in Iron suits who wield flames. This is like the best of the Bond films. It has more in touch with Daniel Craig's Bond then 'Avengers'.<br/><br/>A major problem I had with 'Avengers' was that it blatantly advocates the use of SHIELD as a secret police. Upon re-watching Whedon's opus recently I actually thought that Loki and his monologues about 'freeing mankind from freedom' had more or less the same intent as Powers Boothe and his world security council. Sure there are moments when the gang question these overlords but the entirety of the Avengers become Fury's lapdogs by the end of the film. I was so disillusioned by this. It would seem that the screenwriters were as well. 'Captain America' is so timely in the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations that the film has an eerie quality to it. It is challenging territory indeed and in lesser hands I don't think the film would have worked so well. The marriage between pulp entertainment and political commentary has been rocky but this movie is seamless. I think that this is because we have a perfect hero to represent these themes. <br/><br/>Captain America is a great hero because Marvel at their best really do try to make the character match the spirit of Americanism. That spirit has often come in conflict with the government and the secret security agencies set up to ""protect"" us. Chris Evans really stresses the strong convictions of the character. I think the film could have worked just as well without Hydra or even the Winter Solider character. The idea of SHIELD violating the liberties Captain America holds so dear is villain enough. This isn't a film about villains. It's a film about a strong hero fighting a righteous fight. Marvel films haven't been about that aside from the original 'Iron Man'."
"TomTomH","7","0","2","12 April 2014"," A huge improvement over the first with a touch of tone from The Avengers! Let's hope it carries on that way.
","It's been three years since the First Avenger made it to the big screen and has made his move going through the Marvel marathon starting with his first solo movie and then continuing with 2012's crossover Avengers movie. He's played by Chris Evans, the guy (the actor not the other one) that played Johnny Storm/Human Torch in Marvel's Fantastic Four movies if that sound's familiar to some.<br/><br/>As Captain America/Steve Rogers still struggles settling into the world he's living in after defeating the Hitler-like villain Red Skull in World War II and then waking up in the modern world in the disappointing first movie, a new threat comes in sight: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier. But with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury (the 65-year-old Samuel L. Jackson), Falcon (Anthony Mackle) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) beside him, he can defeat the threat once and for all. If it is possible to stop him.<br/><br/>Unlike many badly developed super villains like Parallax from the dreadfully disappointing ""Green Lantern"", Red Skull from the first Captain America movie and General Zod from the last year's dreadfully unevenly paced Man of Steel, the Winter Soldier is not a badly developed super villain; he could be one of the best. He wears a mask that seems far more complex than the one Tom Hardy's Bane wears in The Dark Knight Rises. At one point I thought it was played by The Hobbit's Richard Armatage (Thorin Oakenshield) but he wasn't, it was played by Sebastian Stan.<br/><br/>There's a new hero in town: Falcon (Sam Wilson, real name), a new superhero that can fly like a talented bird of prey. He is played by Anthony Mackle who you may recognise from last year's ""experimental"" Gangster Squad. When he and Cap have screen-time together, I thought it was familiar to the Iron Man duo (Robert Downey, Jr. and Don Cheadle). Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow probably has more screen-time than in previous films. Her hair style's changed from short to long, but her fight scenes certainly haven't changed.<br/><br/>This is probably a Marvel movie we've been waiting for. If you've watched 'Avengers Assemble' you may find a few elements in this a little familiar. This is proof that the Marvel movies are getting better. Before 'Avengers Assemble', some of the Marvel movies were average. It was the 'Thor' and 'Captain America' predecessors that sucked, and a little of the Hulk remake (not completely) but no way the Iron Man predecessors sucked, although it was said that Iron Man 2 wasn't as good as the original, it doesn't mean to say it sucked.<br/><br/>So this is how the sequel is and should be taught as: bigger, better, and darker than its predecessor. Because the predecessor was set back in World War II time, it had old fashioned superhero set-pieces meanwhile this one has modern Avengers-like set-pieces. Although this is way better that The First Avenger, I'm not sure whether this even beats off Iron Man 3 but it is the best Marvel film since it though.<br/><br/>Like I've said, it keeps close to 'Avengers Assemble', but doesn't beat it (probably next year's Age of Ultron will very well do). The action is exhilarating but unlike Iron Man 3 and Avengers' action, this action had less excitement in its heart to thrill me. I'm not completely criticising it all, but one little inch in perspective. This is a BIG sequel but its action had no heat-pounding substance to blow me away; I don't know it may be me or 'it'; you'll have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>Ah yes, the one I must never forgot: the 3D. Now here's my verdict: good but not challenging enough. It's eye-popping, with the close-ups of faces, but in this one no stars and stripes shield comes flying at you or other catchy effects. It could be worth seeing in 3D if you're really bothered, but I don't think it matters, the experience is probably mainly for 2D but it's up to you.<br/><br/>Like Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, The Winter Soldier is a ""true"" sequel, even if it's trapped within the Marvel universe. It's not like Star Trek into Darkness where you could actually watch that sequel before the first one and it actually makes sense, the first Cap America you need to see before this one otherwise you probably won't know what the heck is going on (well maybe in the first act).<br/><br/>Although this is probably the best one since Iron Man 3, its hero probably isn't the best of the Avengers. Some may find him a little boring. He has a steel shield that can be used for throwing and bouncing off things like a boomerang; without it, he can only use his fists. Not many powers for him. He's like Thor: he has a steel hammer that he throws and comes back to him unhanded. Don't you like superheroes with only one piece of weaponry and that's it? I don't really notice that. I just respect superheroes the way they are; not with how much weaponry they've got.<br/><br/>Marvel still goes on with humour, especially after 'Avengers Assemble' that was funnier than probably any other superhero movies at the time. A little amusing when Sam Wilson/Falcon asks Cap which people would be the bad guys during a fight. I would ruin the answer for you. There are still some wacky action moments too. There's one when Cap single-handedly takes down a ship in less than 10 seconds. But it's too quick to get you enthralled.<br/><br/>Captain America is going well and hopefully will keep doing it as well in the future. Who knows what he has in store for his next outing. And by the way, stay for the end credits; otherwise you'll miss something special"
"kgprophet","6","0","2","11 April 2014"," A Clash of Real World vs. Comic Book Action
","I was a fan of the first Captain America primarily because the director chose to evoke the pulp comic version of WWII (like Indiana Jones and the director's own Rocketeer). This film decides to steer into political intrigue territory, a genre I happen to be a fan of. To make that evident, Robert Redford is cast to represent the political characters he played in the past (3 Days of the Condor, All The President's Men, The Candidate, and later in Spy Game). The action centres in Washington D.C., with S.H.I.E.L.D. turning into just another bureaucracy.<br/><br/>Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers, a man who seems lost in time and place. He is a superhero, but can't settle in an era that he didn't grow up in. The hole in our main character becomes a problem in the screenplay. At one point he is asked what he makes him happy, the answer is ""I don't know"". If the audience can't a get a sympathetic grip on this somewhat two dimensional character, will we care if he gets in harm's way? The main problem lies in how Captain America is so broadly drawn. Like Klark Kent, he has an unobscured view of right and wrong, and the only motivation needed is what is good for our country. So it is necessary to depend on the supporting characters to fill that hole. One could fault the actor Chris Evans, who unfortunately did not help his career being in the mid-2000s Fantastic Four. In that short lived franchise, he played an annoying show-off, again somewhat two dimensional. Does that mean Evans lacks depth in his acting? Since I liked that boy scout mentality in the first Captain America, I find it appropriate he retains that naivety as he tries to discover who is corrupting SHIELD's intentions. Scarlett Johanssan is the female lead, providing the kind of sexy and tough role that Angelina Jolie used to dominate. She has become well established as Black Widow, and doesn't need much character exposition. She is given plenty of opportunities to fight bad guys. Samuel Jackson has the most to gain from any of his appearances in previous Marvel films. His background gets a boost by making him a protégé of Robert Redford, and anchoring the character of Nick Fury in a more gritty real world situation compared to a more fictional comic book history.<br/><br/>The balance between action and tension building drama can seem a little talky, especially as the true villain is explained in the third act. This can be a welcoming moment of character development, especially if Steve Rogers can find happiness. But his relationship status still remains unresolved (as plot bait for subsequent sequels). I found that the big twist about the main villain to be a little lame, but my understanding is that the comic book universe prescribes it. I thought it helped to bring back some of the more appealing elements from the first film, so it has good potential.<br/><br/>I am still a fan of Captain America as much as perhaps Ironman. His bright-eyed view of justice is appealing and does a lot of inventive moves with his shield that he carries as a projectile, amongst other things. All the action scenes are up to snuff in high caliber destruction and high volume firepower. I was less intrigued by the bureaucracy, but the screenplay smartly injects action just when the dialogue needs a spark (at one point borrowing from 'Mission:Impossible""). Once I returned to the theatre to watch it a second time, the comic book elements seem to clash with a real world approach. The character of Falcon, for instance, has a backstory from Afghanistan, and attends PTSD meetings. But it is hard to keep that kind of grip on real world when in the next scene we are back to the James Bond gadgets and superhero flying vehicles. Trying to please both worlds and kind of getting away with it is better than not trying to build intrigue and leaving us with empty characters destroying lots of stuff.<br/><br/>Compared to the similar price tag given to the most recent Marvel release, Thor 2, the film feels big and sure of itself, keeping the momentum going after the big-bang explosion of the Avengers. I still prefer the first film for it's style and nostalgia, but the Russo brothers find their own tone and keep the momentum chugging along past the two hour mark. There is a big story to tell, and I didn't feel like there was any wasted screen time. I guess the best compliment to how well this Marvel machine is humming is the sense of excitement of what the next installment will provide."

"tgrock","7","0","2","8 April 2014"," Big Improvement on the Original!
","I hated first Captain America (2/10). I thought Iron Man 2-3 were only average (6/10). I've never seen the Thor films as they definitely do not look appealing to me. The Avengers was an above-average popcorn flick (7/10) similar to the original Transformers film.<br/><br/>So, my expectations were not high going into Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Yet, not since the original Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk has a Marvel film impressed me so much. I thought after Disney bought Marvel, that we would never get another actual good film. That's what this film is though.<br/><br/>For 3/4 of the movie, I was very engaged in the plot and the action, because in between all those moments were genuine heart-to-heart moments between the main characters. Another plus for this movie is that for once in a superhero film, there is no romance subplot. Instead, you just get friendships.<br/><br/>Anyways, the last 1/4 of the film dropped down the score for me as it was cheesy. It also undoes some of the emotional weight of the previous events of the film, which at the time these events happened, I thought it would be comical if what eventually does happen in the film actually happened. The whole idea of what the villains are about is kind of ridiculous too. It makes no sense that anyone would want what they want. Yet given the stakes of the last battle, which was very hit-and- miss, you'd think Iron Man or The Hulk would at least show up. Instead, you get a new hero character that just does not work in this particular battle situation. I was just cringing a lot during this whole scene which was probably about 25 minutes long.<br/><br/>After this big battle is over, you still get an epilogue that has one part that is quite corny too. However, the last scene of the movie sets up at least part of Captain America 3 and I would like to see where that story goes, depending on the reviews of that film of course."

","Thank you Captain America. Thank you for reminding me that while Hollywood may by a cynical churner of money-making goop, when its done right it's really done right. Ignore the naysayers who claim the film is too ostentatious or too predictable. They fail to realize that movies like this are not meant to be inceptive or beholden to reality. It's still the golden age of superhero movies and the genre is well on its way to making as big a mark on the American cinema firmament as the western, the noir and the musical.<br/><br/>Captain Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is back from the 1940's and back from saving the world with the rest of The Avengers (2012). He carries with him a little notebook of things he has to catch up on including Rocky (1976), the 1966 World Cup final and Marvin Gaye's Trouble Man Soundtrack all while working as Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson) glorified henchman. He's not a fan of what he has to do for his ""boss"" but he soldiers through, especially if it means keeping America safe.<br/><br/>Things however get turned upside-down when attempts are made on Fury's life prior to the launch of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new Heli-carriers. Narrowly escaping multiple assassins and a frightening ghost story known as The Winter Soldier, the only man Fury can trust to get to the bottom of things is the man who trusts him the least. Can Captain America get to The Winter Soldier before it's too late? Is there a sinister connection between tenuous ally Natasha Romanoff aka The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and the bad guys? Who ultimately are the bad guys, and who are the good guys?<br/><br/>Co-starring Robert Redford, Anthony Mackie and Cobie Smulders, all actors take a backseat to the razzle-dazzle of high-flying special effects provided by Daniel Sudick and his army of Imagineers. Every wham-bam explosion, hail of rat-tat-tat gunfire and snap-crackle-pop fighting sequence rivals Joss Whedon's work in The Avengers yet thankfully never quite reaches Transformers (2007-2014) level idiocy.<br/><br/>Before I continue to shower Captain America with complements and jabbering onomatopoeia I might as well take the time to address those who have not seen it and those on the fence about it. You really do have to go in with the proper mindset; and that mindset is ""fun"". Those who praise the film for its introduction of themes like the modern surveillance and data collection complex and how it can turn sour are deluding themselves into thinking the movie is smarter than it really is. I doubt the Obama administration is going to be knocking on Stan Lee's door asking questions while George W. Bush releases a statement defending the NSA on account of this movie. <br/><br/>The film isn't as smart as it is incredibly pulpy. There are Mexican standoffs, emotional flashbacks, disguises, traumatic deaths, hostage situations, big reveals and double crosses; it pulls out all the stops to provide panem et circenses to the masses. The grabbed-by-the- headlines Wikileak angle is just a cherry on top of the massive all- American sundae that we're all eating and loving. ABC might have cancelled All My Children (1970-2011) but soap operas are alive and well in the world of superheroes to which Captain America is only the most recent example. <br/><br/>Yet unlike most of your grandmother's soaps, the script is bare- bones; mostly show and less tell. It's exactly what you need in an action movie. I just wished that all the advanced technology on full display has less of a Deus ex Machina, everything-works-exactly-as-it- should- type feel. I'm a little jealous that S.H.I.E.L.D. has a portable laser capable of piercing armored trucks and concrete with ease yet my Galaxy 5 can't call outside the U.S. and Canada. Though I suppose these movies are less about giving the guys at Google something to work on than they are selling action figures and red, white and blue Frisbees.<br/><br/>Yet despite my natural cynicism, it's hard not to love movie. It takes itself a little more seriously than The Avengers and the Iron Man series (2008-2013) which might disappoint some viewers but since the films protagonist is supposed to be the fuddy-duddy of the ensemble that can be forgiven. There are just too many well done special- effects and too much childlike wonder to escape Winter Soldier's bombastic charm.

Moments inside, having welcomed by the extraordinary physique of Chris Evans, I got imbibed into the screen and the 3D glass was my medium.<br/><br/>Mind you, 3D did justice to the film and towards the end I am sure you will realize your money didn't go waste. Continuing with where it ended last time, Captain America finds himself putting his brain into work. Teaming up with Black Widow, done over-smartly by Scarlett Johansson, Steve Rogers finds himself in a high-octane war where he cannot trust anyone. Many twists are thrown at us which look credible enough to follow. Characters are well-built but I don't know what Cobie Smulders was doing here. Even Robert Redford looked like he just ditched his old boat from All Is Lost (2013) and suited up. Chris Evans is very good, both in action & prose. Samuel L Jackson is good.<br/><br/>I liked the humor & its timing. Moreover, the adrenaline pumping chase sequences, stunts, airborne action scenes - all were charismatic and well-directed. But, a superhero movie is a superhero movie & they say one & only one thing. This one tries to slightly differ and gets caught up with its past. That is equally justifiable as it is interesting.<br/><br/>I never got bored in these 130 minutes. Now, this 8 I am rating is the greatest I can give for a superhero movie and it is for the special type of fun it endorses. So if you want to experience one good film this year, go for The Winter Soldier and find who he actually is.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Recommended!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

","CA3 The Winter Soldier is the first Marvel film that I felt compelled to see in the theater since Avengers. I heard a lot of good things about it, and so in the midst of my curiosity, I grabbed my umbrella and traveled in a rainstorm just to go see it, hoping I wouldn't waste $11, and hoping the film would be worth soaking my boots for.<br/><br/>I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed. This film was tightly written, tightly paced, and had less camp than most of the Marvel Studio films as of late. Sure, the Marvel humor popped up out of nowhere, but it wasn't over done and cheesed up. This film had just enough plot driven and character driven elements, and makes for a mature, political conspiracy thriller that even mature audiences would enjoy. After just 5 minutes into the film, I knew that this film was a different animal than the first Captain America film. High production aside, the acting and directing were way better, and most of all--it made Captain America much more likable and appealing than the first film.<br/><br/>The action scenes were superb, and this is the way Captain America SHOULD have been depicted in not only his debut film, but in Avengers as well! Not since The Terminator have I been awed by a super-human's physical prowess. The choreography and stunts in this film are second to none. Outside of Asian Kung Fu flicks, this film takes the cake when it comes to hand to hand combat. A lot of real stunt men, real car crashes, equals a formula for success.<br/><br/>Now I docked a few stars because I'm rating it in comparison to other superhero films. After leaving the theater, I didn't feel the same buzz that I felt when I saw Man of Steel or The Dark Knight films. And it wasn't as emotional as the Spider Man films. And so...a 7/10."
"alexcomputerkid","7","0","2","7 April 2014"," Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a disappointing sequel to say the least.
","It might have not came as a shock to others but the first Captain America movie of 2011 came out of nowhere for me. I found that the Captain American origin story in that movie to be one of the more interesting origin stories around and very much original. Steve Rogers was the slightly built soldier in World War Two who makes his way to the present day through a block of frozen ice. Captain America was a superhero that eventually brought the war, the Nazis, a cool villain and different time period to the Marvel universe in Captain's first ever film.<br/><br/>Now in 2014, Captain America is back with the sequel Captain America: The Winter Soldier directed by new directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. After Nick Fury (Samuel J. Jackson) is gunned down by a villain named White Soldier, Steve Rogers is now is a fugitive on the run and who must get down to business and solve the S.H.I.E.L.D vs HYDRA espionage battle in the Nation's capital.<br/><br/>Like the first movie, this sequel has a nice cast. Nick Fury is given more to do in this movie and even though the character goes some predictable ways, he still should be the character you most look forward to in upcoming Marvel films. As he was in the first movie, Chris Evans is flawless as Captain America. He plays the character as a very likable Captain America and adds depth and chemistry to the role. Scarlett Johansson is back as the Black Widow who again brings sexuality through her tight outfits. The newest member of the cast, and a very impressive character indeed, is Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce. Redford's character can be described as unlikable and it is very impressive for an actor like Redford at the age of 77 to be doing high levels action scenes as he does here. The only character that is lacking is Falcon (Anthony Mackie) who really does nothing noteworthy or interesting but a character that maybe I could see some change or development for the next film. Last by not least is our great villain, the White Soldier who does come off as creepy and pretty cool twist comes to him yet again.<br/><br/>I do question the film's running time and structure. You have to question as to why this film is as long as there are many obvious places that it could have been cut down. The pacing is all over the place and the action often comes randomly. The action scenes are still very well done and do show off the big budget of this film but they are all kind of the same. The settings are numerous and kind of all over the place and the movie does drag big time.<br/><br/>Of course, one thing this sequel is doing is setting itself up for another sequel that has already been announced for 2016. This one works fine for what it is but between the other recent Marvel movies including two Thor films, three Iron Man films, the Avengers and the first Captain America film, it really comes up lacking. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a disappointing sequel to say the least."
"quincytheodore","6","0","2","7 April 2014"," It has solid cast and action, but cautious delivery of espionage premise, persistent flaw of plausibility and shortage of humor make the movie rather uninspiring.
","Improving on live action stunts and using a more contemporary plot, Captain America: The Winter Soldiers is a better movie than its prequel, although it's somewhat dry in humor. The movie is what one might expect in a superhero flick, great explosive action scenes, and perhaps more with its spy thriller aspect. However, the chemistry between characters isn't maximized, the humor is severely lacking and with a social commentary element of national security, the movie could've done more instead of resorting to unenterprising conclusion.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around espionage, a modern subject which strings together conspiracy theory and relatable cause. This gives the original comic identity a fitting rejuvenation of modern day interpretation, but it lacks depth and only scratches the surface of the issue. Enemy of the State from more than a decade ago did a better, more harrowing portrayal of information surveillance. The movie is also vexed by several action movie flaws, such as characters conveniently meet or flee in certain scenes, quizzical plot device and a rather cliché use of indoctrination.<br/><br/>Chris Evans plays the role of Captain America / Steve Rogers pretty well. He's not a simple minded patriot rather a man given the position of hero and yet still has his doubts. The cast of Evans is a good choice, he looks suitable for the character without trying to be a superhero. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff delivers as the femme fatale, although this might be a restriction as well. There are some scenes where the character could be more genuine or emotional, but bravado remains a more prevalent trait.<br/><br/>Anthony Mackie as Falcon / Sam Wilson does a proper job of creating a partner persona for Captain America. Even though he's still in sidekick role, the character as a veteran and counselor for others with PTSD can be developed further. He shows some compatibility with Captain America, plus the bond of soldiers is a good foundation. Samuel L. Jackson is undoubtedly charismatic as Nick Fury. There's an imposing and sly atmosphere he brought as the leader role.<br/><br/>Despite the decent cast, they don't have much affinity. Evans and Johansson look awkward, granted their on-screen relationship isn't a romantic one, but it doesn't feel that they possess much sense of camaraderie. The jokes between characters just fail to entertain; they are written in mediocrity and delivered with the same level of lackluster nature. It tries to display more personal appeal or witty charm, but doesn't really excel in either.<br/><br/>The stunts are definitely better than most superhero or action movies. Instead of relying too much on CG, the movie opts for faster more aggressive live action fight scenes. This is a great direction due to raw intensity it presents during the action; the way the Captain's shield is intriguing as well. It doesn't mean that it's short on CG spectacles as there are many mandatory shootouts and explosions throughout the movie, and they are also appropriately translated to 3D, the computer generated effects are simply used in moderation effectively.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter brings great solid cast and mix of action and CG, but cautious delivery of espionage premise, persistent flaw of plausibility and shortage of humor make the movie rather uninspiring."

","Chris Evans is crazy hot. I mean the guy is physically perfect, so I will gladly pay to watch him in any movie. I wasn't crazy about the first Captain America flick but the previews for this one looked promising so I went to the theater with high expectations and super excited to be staring at Evans on the big screen. I mean I would pay to watch the guy eat a burger. The movie though, fell a little flat. The action scenes were OK but a little gratuitous. <br/><br/>The winter soldier was bad ass, but when they revealed his identity, the cheese factor of movie went from zero to 100 and I was turned off. Couldn't the writers come up with anything more original? I thought the fact that Rogers cute neighbor was also a shield agent was cliché. Also Scar Jo looked like a Jersey Shore guido with her fake tan and 4 shades of bronzer and circa 2000 frosted pink lipstick. <br/><br/>Anthony Mackie's character the Falcon added absolutely nothing to the movie. Was he supposed to be some kind of token or something? He pretty much came across like Capt. America's door mat. And for the love of me I don't understand why they made Capt. America use the same costume from the first movie; the costume from 1944. What happened to the Avengers version of his costume? Even though the director of this movie did not want to use it, why didn't they come up with a 2014 version? So the winter soldier has a cool modern cutting edge costume and the star of the feature has a dusty, baggy museum ensemble from 1944? Evans has this amazing anatomically perfect body and they hide it behind this unremarkable getup?"
"oscaralbert","7","0","2","7 April 2014"," The lesson being taught here seems to be . . .
",". . . ""don't trust the chain of command."" In CAPTAIN AMER1CA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, there are two types of military personnel depicted: those who follow orders from their commanding officers, even when it means carrying out a ""Pre-Emptive strike"" on 20 million civilians, including the valedictorian of an Iowa City High School (who will presumably become the grandmother of a freedom fighter in the distant future, along the lines of the TERMINATOR franchise), and those who think for themselves, such as Chris Evans, Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, and Scarlett Johansson. Since this movie was not made in a vacuum, it obviously is ""preaching"" to the U.S. military, which owns more than half the world's martial resources. The writers no doubt are aware that a former C.I.A. chief\defense secretary who died last week--James Schlesinger--had to ""go outside"" the chain of command so that President Richard Nixon could not nuke either Vietnam or Cleveland (or perhaps both) as he fought to save his presidency. A military coup was Nixon's ""Plan B,"" but Schlesinger defied the chain of command to stop both. On the other hand, polls show many if not most Americans believe the White House plant in 2001 ordered the USAF to ""stand down"" during the terrorism attack on America, to further the interests of the oil men who put him in the Oval Office even though he lost the election. Therefore, if you have a child in the U.S. military, advise him or her AGAINST seeing CAPTAIN AMER1CA, unless you want them to prevent the next 9-11 by going against the chain of command, as Schlesinger, Evans, Mackie, Jackson, and Johansson all have done."

","Funny thing is that I haven't watch CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011), but the raving reviews of this sequel lured me into the cinema, but unfortunately monopolized by a 3D- exclusive treatment here in Egypt. <br/><br/>First of all, what is the real motivation behind the scheme of Alexander Pierce (Redford), the evil mind working for the HYDRA organization, the foe of the S.H.I.E.L.D. apparatus? Randomly obliterate a few citizens, for what? As in THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10), probably in the entire Marvel's kingdom, it gets harder and harder to create any refreshing motive for its super-villains, sometimes, all the intelligence of those sinister brains is undercut by manufacturing overly- elaborate and secretive schemes which end up in as some more or less preposterous mess. Anyway, it is not a main problem since the picture is a superlatively polished action flick, laden with stunning visual spectacles, anything else all reduces to plot device to impel the narrative slide on its designed trajectory as planned. <br/><br/>Captain America is an avatar of American spirit, but fundamentally he is a WWII relic who is adapting a strange world, unlike Tony Stark (the spendthrift tycoon), Thor (a gallant deity) or The Hulk (a mutant scientist), he may fall into the category of being too fair and square, there is no dark side in him, that's why Bucky, the Winter Solider (Stan) has been deployed to trigger a poignant bromance which exceedingly exploits the latest trend of male-bonding fantasies. Chris Evans is a deft action star and conforms to the token as an orthodox American Hero, while Sebastian Stan blends his pretty-face daze with the ruthless killing instinct in a credible way which secures his further involvement with Marvel's adventurous bigger plan. <br/><br/>Underused in THE AVENGERS, Black Widow (Johansson) is another stand-out in the show, she is not a sidekick (a definite co-lead role with astonishing action sequences to flaunt her awesome elasticity) and deserves her own independent franchise, hopefully Johansson can be the first triumphant female superhero on the big screen, 10 years ago, I would wager on her being an Oscar winner by now other than a sui generis action star, her career path is rather interesting. Falcon (Mackie) is the bonhomous sidekick, a true black superhero should also be on the slate now. Robert Redford is urbanely vicious and we would love to see the devil is actually among real human beings (not some mutants, aliens or robots). Samuel L. Jackson finally has several minutes of his own moment with some ass-kicking car chase scenes which instigates the first high point of the picture. <br/><br/>Director-duo Anthony & Joe Russo (from TV sensations COMMUNITY and Arrested DEVELOPMENT) did an amazing job (please ignore their previous filmography), it is a white- knuckle experience congested with fun, excitement and sincere emotion, I would give it a sounding 8 out 10 if and only if it was not in the sloppy 3D format, burden added but no benefits at all, alas, a distasteful shtick to charge more admission fee, which is over-abused in the money-grubbing business presently, not a good sign for film lovers."

And here's the spoiler bit - If the whole SHIELD thing is about to go off the rails and over 20 million folks are about to be killed because of the launch of those three ships in unison - well why not call Iron Man?

","Captain America: The Winter Soldier turns out to be about some guy named The Winter Soldier, rather than Cap himself being a winter soldier (you know, because he was in deep freeze). Well, with that mystery solved, I settled in to watch what has become a rather typical comic-book movie: intelligent, evocative, thrilling, and entertaining.<br/><br/>Here's your quick-and-dirty summary to set the scene; comic-book nerds out there, please correct me if I'm wrong, because that'll prove someone's reading this other than me. The movie takes place after the events in The Avengers. Captain America (Chris Evans) is trying to assimilate into the present day, and he leads an elite forces team. In the opening scenes, his team, aided by Black Widow (Scarlet Johanson), infiltrate a SHIELD boat that's been commandeered by terrorists who have a beef with SHIELD. Cap and the Gang roust out the bad guys, but Cap is somewhat surprised to see Black Widow grabbing info from hard drives. He's soon briefed by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) that SHIELD is involved in a huge defense program called Project Insight: three enormous helicarriers that are linked to spy satellites, the better to knock out threats before they happen. Shades of Minority Report.<br/><br/>Fury has joined forces with the World Security Council and its leader, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) for this enterprise, and true to comic trope, there's soon skulduggery afoot. It's not hard to see who's treacherous and who's not, but that's part of the fun of these movies, anyway. As a result of the cloak-and-dagger atmosphere, Captain America and Black Widow, along with new superhero Falcon (Anthony Mackie), who sports an exoskeleton with wings and weaponry.<br/><br/>The movie forces Steve Rogers, aka Cap, to face parts of his past that he might be better off leaving alone. His girl from back in the 1940s, Peggy Carter, is convalescing in a home for retired people, Steve's apparently last living link to that past. But Steve's straight-arrow, black-and-white moral compass seems oddly out of sync with the gray areas of the present, which makes Black Widow a great match for him. You know, opposites and all of that.<br/><br/>This is a movie in which secrets upon secrets are revealed, like layers of an onion and often just as odorous. Anyway, although it's not tough for Cap and Black Widow to determine who the bad guys are, stopping said villains is another problem altogether. This leads to several fantastic action scenes, very well choreographed and a treat to watch - even in 2D, or perhaps especially in 2D.<br/><br/>I sat, by necessity, in the second row for this movie, which meant that my head was inclined as if I were talking to a giraffe with an overactive pituitary gland. It also meant that I needed to focus harder on the action before me, because at that distance the illusion of the celluloid tale can more easily be broken. This movie captivated me throughout, pardon the pun, and it's a terrific vehicle for both Captain America and Black Widow, not to mention the slippery Nick Fury himself. <br/><br/>I did wonder, as the plot centers around something that could endanger the entire world, where was the rest of the Avengers squad? Tony Stark is mentioned once (but not Iron Man), and we see a portrait of his father, but that's it for connections to The Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, and Iron Man. If the world's about to be harmed, you'd think that would rise to the importance level of those guys, right? Okay, that's nitpicking.<br/><br/>It's true that the movie's plot is familiar and that many of the characters, being based on comic-book characters themselves, lack real depth. But these problems are minor, because the action scenes - hey, this is a comic-book movie, not some weepy melodrama! - is so exhilarating. Great care has been taken to curate the Marvel Universe in cinematic form, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not only a fine standalone picture but also a elegant lead for the next Avengers movie - not to mention future Captain America movies. Watch those end credits!"

","I seriously can't believe it's been 3 years since Captain America: The First Avenger! I was so happy to see this on the weekend with my gang. I have to admit, I'm actually more of a DC girl, and Cap isn't my favourite Avenger, but who doesn't love a good ol' superhero flick? I'm sorry to say that I wasn't a big fan of the first film, not to say I didn't think it was good, but the story just didn't grab me. I'm not overly excited by war films, and yes, I do understand that's kind of Cap's thing, but that's just me! I'd heard great things about the new one though.<br/><br/>Safe to say it didn't disappoint me. This was the perfect mix of action, funny one liners, and explosions. There were twists, some expected, one very much so, but some that took me by complete surprise too and I love that. Also, as much as I can't stand Scarlett Johanssen, we got to find out a lot more about her character, and the inclusion of Falcon was a great move too.<br/><br/>There are plenty of easter eggs for the die hard Marvel fans; Black Widow's necklace was my favourite one, I may have squeed a little in the cinema! The main thing that disappointed me though was that the film didn't really set us up for Avengers: Age of Ultron, which I was expecting it too.<br/><br/>Nonetheless though, I really enjoyed this, Oh, and as usual, make sure you stay till after the credits! They don't play with you like Iron Man 3 did, don't worry."

","I liked Captain America: The Winter Soldier more than the first film but only marginally. While I thought it had more action and ""badassery"" it felt like it was a bit void of the developmental elements that made the first film strong. I also thought there was a bit too much humor early on. The Falcon character is where the lack of development hurt the most as he felt forced on us. It felt like he existed only to make certain scenes and plot points possible. To me, that's lazy writing. Either develop him more and add a bit more time to the film or leave him out entirely and find different ways to make things happen. I also thought Scar Jo's character still lacked much development. She had more screen time than in any of the previous movies but I think her and Cobie Smulder's character, agent Hill, continue to be the most underutilized characters in the series. Nonetheless, the action and special effects were amazing and the acting was good enough."

","Why can't Iron Man, Thor or Hulk be more like the Cap?<br/><br/>Growing up, Captain America was so uninteresting to me, I barely looked at his covers as I collected and read dozens of other comics weekly. It wasn't until his ""First Avenger"" movie – which I had previously dreaded and waited to see – did I become a huge fan. That movie was fantastic and oodles better than Tony Stark's second and third films as well as both Thor movies.<br/><br/>And so is Cap's follow-up ""stand-alone"" adventure: Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>I truly liked this movie and strongly believe it will improve with each viewing. It was a much more adult comic book movie, but not overly serious, like the Dark Knight trilogy or Man of Steel. It also knew how to handle multiple agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. efficiently. (A lesson learned in The Avengers but lost on most comic book movies, i.e. Spider-Man 3 and the original Batman sequels.)<br/><br/>The Captain continues to doubt anyone as patriotic and heroic as himself in this chapter, and with good reason. The age-old ""trust no one,"" though annoying and overused, is this movie's tagline, or should be. But, with the help of his friends, the so-called ""mystery"" is unraveled and Cap, (a personal favorite) Black Widow and a new-comer agent fight all over the place, but mostly in (and above) the D.C./East Coast areas.<br/><br/>I'm totally not giving away the synopsis as I normally would, but not to avoid spoilers. This movie isn't plot-heavy, and most of its been done before many, many times, so there's really not much to give away here and you can, and should, just sit back and enjoy the inside jokes, the sometime surprises, the other Marvel mentions, the action and the sly winks at the audience. I.E. make sure you read what's on a character's tombstone at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Definitely a high recommendation for this film: Great action, depth of the characters, another shot to see Black Widow in pretty much the whole movie, more great lines and action from Chris Evans's fantastic portrayal as the Cap and, of course, the never-ending and wonderful Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury (and attitude.)<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: DO NOT wait to see the final TWO Marvel spots during the credits. But, if you do – again, don't, they're really blah – look for all the ""Steve/Steven/Stephen/Stephan""s in the credits. Either I must be truly popular, it's homage to Steve Rogers or just an amazing coincidence. Yeah, probably the third one."

","Don't believe the hype. I heard one reviewer declare that this is the best Marvel film. ""The Avengers"" was the best Marvel film--I felt that before and after I left the theater.<br/><br/>Captain America is a bit too serious and on the verge of being cranky in this film. Scarlett Johansen looked a bit too gaunt. She--along with Morgan Freeman and Sam Jackson--has suffered from overexposure in films. I'm frankly tired of seeing her. I also couldn't watch Robert Redford without wondering how horribly he has aged. Stan Lee's cameo was funny.<br/><br/>This film had little of the first film's charm--and patriotism for that matter. The best scene was in the elevator when Captain America beat up a bunch of would-be assassins.<br/><br/>In summary, this was good but nowhere as good as the first film and certainly this was not the best Marvel film. I noticed that the newer generation of Marvel films (IM3, Thor 2, CA2) were distinctly inferior compared to their respective predecessors. I shudder to think with such a trend what the second installment of ""The Avengers"" holds."

But some other people on the team have some additional duties involving securing intelligence, a part of the mission that Evans is not told about. <br/><br/>Things get dicey when his mentor and supervisor Samuel L. Jackson is shot and killed and Evans becomes a wanted man.

American establishmentarian figure Robert Redford goes against his all American hero type image to play the evil genius behind all this dirty work. Redford who probably came closest to a villain role before in Indecent Proposal looks like he's thoroughly enjoying himself as a bad guy.<br/><br/>I have to say I've enjoyed Chris Evans as both Captain America and Johnny Storm the Human Torch. It's sad in this day and age that real heroes are to be found in comic books as source material for films. Back in Hollywood's golden age Evans would have been a great cowboy hero.<br/><br/>Those who love Marvel comics will go for Captain America: The Winter Soldier in a big way.

","The future sure has been quite a time for Captain America (Chris Evans). His first encounter with the modern world saw him running through Times Square, confused and scared. Next, he assembled with some other Superheroes to save the world from the disgruntled brother of a fellow Avenger. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Cap faces off against an internal threat and an organization that is just as powerful as S.H.I.E.L.D, as well as a familiar face and new adversary from his past. Life is rough for Cap. On top of everything, he is still trying to find a way to successfully assimilate himself into present day society. You think saving the world is hard? Try figuring out the internet, getting back on the dating scene, and making new friends at the age of ninety-five. Thankfully, there are only a few things Cap needs to get through the day; his trusty vibranium shield and his handy notepad with a slew of suggestions for catching up with the last seventy years, and Cap is ready to take on the world–or corrupt government organizations. Either or, Cap is always ready to save the day, even if he has to take a beating while doing it.<br/><br/>When I first became aware that the directing/producing brothers behind episodes of 'Community' and You, Me and Dupree were going to be responsible for extending the Captain America canon, I may have gotten a little worried. Thinking that Joe and Anthony Russo were going to follow in the same footsteps as Captain America: The First Avenger director Joe Johnson, focusing more on the comedy and special effects of the Superhero genre and less with the complex, unflinching patriotic mentality of America's greatest super soldier, the Russo brothers sure proved me wrong. It's movies like these that make happy to swallow my words and stand corrected, knowing that audience members are able trust that the television medium is one that can be used as an adequate platform towards advancing characters in film as well.<br/><br/>Substituting as much VFX work as possible for a very organic and old-school action approach, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is certainly the best Phase Two Marvel film so far, and may perhaps be the standard film to compete against in a post-Avengers film world, or at least up until the Avengers: Age of Ultron. <br/><br/>Always on a mission, it seems that Cap lives to work, not works to live. Especially since he has been in deep sleep for the last little while. While the United States government is surely getting the most out of their ridiculously expensive investment, the government trusts that their super solider is never compromised and his dedication and hard work to his country is never skewed. When a secret organization with similar interests to those of S.H.I.E.L.D threaten to kill twenty million people, Cap is sent to fight at sea, on land, and in the air. Accompanied by his trusty sidekick Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the two seem to always be pitted within the same missions but always having ulterior motives. Commanded by their one-eyed superior Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), S.H.I.E.L.D must face off against their most ruthless enemy yet.<br/><br/>One of the biggest issues I will continue to have with Marvel's stand-alone films from now on, is the fact that once conflict reaches a certain level of danger, like lets say a global level, I will always ask, ""Where the heck are the Avengers? And if not the Avengers, where is Tony Stark? The Hulk? Someone? Anyone?"" No problem could be too big for the super-powered team of freedom fighting Superheroes. This is one film where I questioned the presence of Tony Stark? Was he just waiting to see what Cap would do on the other side of the country while he sat at home on his couch?<br/><br/>Essentially, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a team effort in crime fighting, with Black Widow and Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) helping out are star-spangled Superhero this time around, Cap sure doesn't seem to be without powerful friends. What was also refreshing was finally seeing Nick Fury get in on the action, providing the film with one of the best car chase scene Marvel ever assembled. One of the virtues of Captain America: The Winter Soldier stands by is the fact that, you don't need to wear a mask to be a Superhero–which might explain why Cap always insists on removing his.<br/><br/>At times, the film may seem like Marvel's take on Minority Report anticipating danger before it even happens, and upholding the idea of 'peace' for the sake of the world. But as the Head of S.H.I.E.L.D operations ironically points out, ""peace is not an achievement, its a responsibility"". So when S.H.I.E.L.D is corrupted from the inside, right under their noses and Cap is left to face-off against a super-soldier baddie, later known as the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), the organization really has some explaining to do. The Winter Soldier, developed and equipped with the same agility as Cap, with of course the addition of a metal arm, the masked soldier gives Cap a run for his money. The only person the Winter Soldier ever seems to have any trouble fighting is Romanoff, which raises the question, why doesn't anyone give her the serum to make her a super-soldier? She would surely kick some serious ass!<br/><br/>Can't get enough Captain America? Check out the rest of the review at www.nightfilmreviews.com!"

","Captain America: The First Avenger was somewhat strange – it combined an interesting origin story with goofy plot elements and dumb action sequences. In the world of superhero movies, there is an unofficial rule that the sequel is better than the first movie. Luckily, this is the case with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Not only is 'The Winter Soldier' clearly superior to 'The First Avenger', but this movie is also (arguably), for now, the best movie in the Phase 2 of Marvel Cinematic Universe. That being said, Captain America: The Winter Soldier isn't as good as everyone makes it out to be (it currently has pretty high ratings on both IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes).<br/><br/>The movie follows Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) as he tries to find his place in the modern world, and that definitely isn't easy for him – the world clearly changed and even S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't what it used to be. He is most worried about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s project Insight, which is basically a plan to launch 3 next generation Helicarriers to the sky to neutralize, from above, any possible threat. The situation gets more complicated when Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) gets attacked in broad daylight, and Steve Rogers doesn't know who to trust anymore – could it be that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised? Of all the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America: The Winter Soldier feels the least like a superhero movie. There's a certain James Bond/spy movie vibe to it, and Kevin Feige, the movie's producer and President of Marvel Studios, went as far as to describe it as 'a 1970s political thriller masquerading as a big superhero movie'. In spite of being described as a '1970′s political thriller', 'The Winter Soldier' is still a relevant movie, in the way that it deals with some major recent events (the post 9/11 world and WikiLeaks). This new direction in Marvel movies is definitely a brave one and should definitely be applauded.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie looks great, which could be explained by another novelty in the Marvel Cinematic Universe – the use of visual effects is reduced to the minimum (which was the decision of the movie's directors, the Russo brothers). The action sequences are well shot and edited and rank amongst the best ones I've seen in Marvel movies. As for the actors in the movie, some of them played their characters so many times now, they need no special analyzing (Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson & Scarlett Johansson), and the newcomers did a satisfying job – Robert Redford was believable as Alexander Pierce, Anthony Mackie's The Falcon was nicely introduced and Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier was alright (despite he doesn't really play that important a role for someone who has his name appearing in the movie title).<br/><br/>Even though Captain America: The Winter Soldier does many things right, it still suffers from the same flaw many movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe do: the villains are not that good. By now, 9 movies have been released in the MCU, all of them producing only one memorable villain – Loki. The villains in Captain America: The Winter Soldier are forgettable at worst, and average at best. Not that a movie necessarily needs a great villain to be great itself, but it definitely helps if the audience has an interesting villain to help them sit through the movie (with its runtime of 136 minutes, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the second longest movie in the MCU, which is a little too much for a solo superhero movie). Also, as the movie progresses, it gets increasingly worse, with its action packed third act suffering from some ridiculous elements. Undoubtedly, all these elements – the bland villains, the runtime, the inconsistent quality – are precisely what keeps Captain America: The Winter Soldier from reaching its full potential.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"

","Saw Captain America: The Almost Redundant Subtitle yesterday. While I was thrilled and highly entertained for large sections of the film I couldn't help but feel a disappointing lack of heart at the end of it. Despite having few arcs to play with the cast did a great job with the characters, but the enormous amounts of crashing and banging, while executed with aplomb, meant that the key themes and scenes were rarely allowed to settle with any emotional heft, and the overwhelming number of characters and elements to the plot, some detractively silly, meant that only lip-service could be paid to the real questions we should have been asking ourselves, and to the 70s thrillers it was clearly referencing. I'll presume there was an iteration of the film where the Winter Soldier element was far more relevant and personal to the story but here it was all but a sideline to the explosions. Enjoyable then, but not the film it purported to be at the outset.<br/><br/>p.s. The post-credit stings would have worked far better the other way around, so people should stay to the very end.<br/><br/>p.p.s. I'm sure that a World Security Council ought to have more than five members on it?"
"swalton123456","9","0","3","4 April 2014"," The Winter Soldiers lives up, Cap disappoints.
","This movie overall disappointing me. At least we know the theme is Trust. But honestly theirs no real story it's just Trust no one, squeezed into 136 mins. Chris Evans overall gives a pretty disappointing appearance as Cap, Sebastian Stan however, 10/10 I thought he made The Winter Soldier feel so real, and so scary. The whole film felt very futuristic however, Fury's truck... It just didn't feel real. That device Peirce uses to kill the council... wtf. NATASHA'S FACE MASK IT DOESN'T EXIST! I thought this film would be a lot better than it was, there were 2 main things i liked however. 1) CGI, This is the best CGI I've ever seen, Those Helicarriers, words cannot describe it. It was breathtaking to see, soon movies are just going to be CGI. 2) The fight choreography, amazing, the fight scenes were great, especially the Ship one. They felt so real and really made me feel like I was there. Overall it was a great film, 2nd best in the MCU after The Avenger's. But disappointing for what I was looking for."
"daniel-elmore9","8","0","1","3 April 2014"," Exciting, Humorous, and Anticipating.
","Alike many of the Avenger franchise films, Captain America: The Winter Soldier appeals to both the die-hard fan-boy's (and girls) who have followed Marvel before the films, and those just recently being introduced into the Marvel Universe. The film contains enough action to appease the taste of excitement while delivering a solid storyline that both intrigues the audience. <br/><br/>Although the storyline at times seemed a bit rushed or confusing, Captain America: The Winter Soldier delivered what most anxious viewers were anticipating. Anthony Russo and the writers of the film did an excellent job of combining multiple introductions and sub-plot lines into the short span of roughly 2 hours. The general audience eagerly await the return of Cap and the rest of the Avengers soon."

","Its for you , if you like Marvel Entertainment's movies such as X-Man, Avengers , Spider man. I saw that in Xtream Theatre and it was awesome.<br/><br/>Lots of action and pretty damn good sounds. <br/><br/>But I did not liked some part of story, It was really not to get. such as :<br/><br/>1. Falling from a high building Cpt. A. <br/><br/>2. The triangular ending machine war , I did not liked that.<br/><br/>3. And The brain room of that Dr. Arnim Zola , I could not understand an brain room ( let it be fictional ) of 1950's can start with a usb device of this present. May be I missed something. <br/><br/>However Natasha the Black Widow was as usual of her own. Cpt. was looking cute I should say. <br/><br/>Surprised to see the second eye of Nick Fury , though still could not understood If his password , retina data was erased how come it will happen that you have erased retina data of one eye, still I hope I missed something. <br/><br/>AWESOME, RECOMMENDED, ACTION, MIN-DRAMA, MIN-TWIST ."

","After almost dropping the ball with last year's fiasco – Iron Man 3 – Marvel is back with a bang and it's a good bang for your buck. Captain America: Winter Soldier is a smack-down superhero film that finds itself wedged in the higher echelons of the Marvel franchise. <br/><br/>X-Men: First Class (2011) was one of the first films in Marvel's nine film franchise to successfully graft superhero fiction with real world events. Picking up on the ethos that the world as we know it is not what it appears to be, Winter Soldier begins with a prologue similar to classic espionage thrillers. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), our titular star spangled super soldier, is air dropped onto a S.H.I.E.L.D vessel captured by Algerian pirates. Standard fare breach and entry tactics if you asked me, but before you know it, Rogers finds himself entangled in a web of conspiracies perpetrated by sleeper cells within S.H.I.E.L.D. Barely able to bridge the gap between the 1940s and modern day advancements in technology, Rogers is now weary of who he can trust. To connect the dots he must now backtrack all the way to the origins of S.H.I.E.L.D. and figure out who is the friend and who the foe – Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) or senior official Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). But even before Rogers unmasks the villain, an old threat resurfaces and proceeds to wreak havoc with a secret weapon – the deadly stealth assassin known as the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). <br/><br/>Going in for a superhero film, it is only natural to expect high doses of CGI fuelled action. But what happens when you are 'fed' a lot more than you expect? The three-word answer to that question is Man of Steel – DC Entertainment's self embarrassing rendition of brawn over brain. In comparison, sibling directors Anthony and Joe Russo, along with returning screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely work with plausibility by wisely choosing mind over muscle. That doesn't mean action takes a back seat either. After the low profile opening act, wait exactly thirty minutes for the action to pick up and then surge towards a cliffhanger finale. Despite the plot looming towards world domination, albeit a familiar theme in similar films, the setup is layered with a background story that develops like photographic film. This is where we learn why the Winter Soldier is a diabolic mirror image of Captain America - a pawn (or should I say Trojan horse?) in a terror threat orchestrated by a shadow organization that has manipulated worldwide chaos for decades.<br/><br/>Once again, Evans doesn't disappoint as a superhero who is a patriot first and a hero second. Supporting Evans is the super suave Scarlett Johansson returning as Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, a highly skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who turns out to be more than just a pretty face. Also scripted for this film is Marvel superhero Falcon (Anthony Mackie), an ex-paratrooper who becomes Cap's friend and vital aid during some white-knuckle aerial battles. Jackson and Redford blend in as the 'powers that be' while Stan puts on a terrific show as a villain who is as cool and powerful as Cap himself. They all contribute to the film's look and feel and each of their characters comes with at least one witty line to boot. This again echoes my sentiments on how well this film is written and directed. Captain America: Winter Soldier is a good film if you have a thing for superhero movies. On the other hand, true Marvel fans will march a step forward and even call this a 'Great' film and a welcome addition to Marvel's long running superhero franchise. And by the looks of it, this franchise is far from over; two end credits scenes reveal more to come, where the first one introduces viewers to Magneto's children. Stay seated and buckle up, that's all I'll say!"
"under-represented","7","0","1","2 April 2014"," Captian America saved by story
","I wasn't expecting much story in the movie. I was expecting some world destruction like ""Man of Steel"" or ""Thor: The dark world"". But this movie is much better in terms of story, characters, humor and action.<br/><br/>This movie has no jaw-dropping special effects of awesome CGI imaginations, which is good because we had enough of that already. Instead the scrip rely on humor to make the action scenes more interesting. The writers have kept the story interesting so that you don't just yawn through the talking waiting for the action scenes. Of course the movie has usual, predictable, lucky escapes and some logical loop holes here and there, but that doesn't distract much to reject the movie before it ends.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good movie, worth the cinema ticket and some way adds to the marvel universe that's developing pretty quickly. I wouldn't watch this movie again but I won't complain if I am made to."
"thealphakeno","7","0","8","31 March 2014"," Its good but not like Ironman 3 and Avenger level.
","I' am not a big fan of Captain America so I'm not totally into it. I only got my eye to Black Widow, the other are invisible to me. It was a good movie with lots of actions and explosions. Although, there is lack of special effects due to the characters only fights hand to hand combat and guns. The story is quiet interesting which tackles about his past life and problems. I totally smell Civil War storyline behind it but still ended differently. As a marvel fan, there s no plot twist when watching marvel movies so everything is predictable in my mind.<br/><br/>What amazed me and complete my day are the after credits. They show the Maximoff twins which excites me at all, yet disappoint me on seeing Pietro with black hair. Wanda looks creepy which totally perfection. Loki's scepter is involve too which I'm guessing the cause of the Ultron comes to life and gain mind of its own.<br/><br/>I can say you will enjoy the movie if you love action but it's not an Ironman 3 or Avenger level of movie."
"dragonmysterious","Null","0","4","30 March 2014"," Best Movie of Marvel's Phase 2... (So Far)
","Compared to Iron Man 3, which felt like comedy, and Thor 2, which was nothing really special, Captain America The Winter Soldier is the best. It is also considerably better than its predecessor. Nick Fury brings along his usual badassery, but plays a pretty large role this time,as well as showing his vulnerable side, since he is just a human, like Coulson and the other agents of SHIELD. His actions also lead up to what seems like would be a big change in the MCU, opposed to what we would be expecting. This time, more people die in a Marvel movie, some of which were pretty unexpected. Plenty of great action scenes, but were not too overwhelming. Every appearance of Winter Soldier was pretty badass. The movie manages to wrap up well, since it is over 2 hours long, and also leaves enough story to lead up to Captain America 3. Best end credits scenes out of all MCU movies. *Related to Avengers 2."
"Prismark10","7","0","3","26 March 2014"," Who watches the protectors?
","Thor: The Dark World underwhelmed me. A run of the mill nonsense plot, epic action and Loki getting some funny lines.<br/><br/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier steps up to the plate and throws a curve ball. In fact it takes a wrecking ball to the Agents of Shield and strips it bare as a malevolent, infected bug that is not fit for purpose.<br/><br/>Captain America has to go off the grid when Nick Fury tells him to trust no one. Agents are going rogue, Fury is left impotent and the ultimate question we ask ourselves, is Robert Redford's character Alexander Pierce a turncoat?<br/><br/>The writers and directors of this film hark back to the 1970s conspiracy thrillers when filmmakers focused their attention in wrongdoing at the heart of government in an era of the Watergate scandal. They wanted to imitate with a Marvel twist films such as Three days of the Condor and All the President's Men, films that starred Robert Redford.<br/><br/>With the revelations that various governments in recent years in the name of national security have monitored vast amounts of computer databases to track our internet or phone usage, this film has touched a nerve.<br/><br/>We still get Marvel action heroics, we get set piece action and fights. Captain America is more questioning but Chris Evans still cannot bring much life to what is a sturdy but dull comic book character. He still gets a better deal than The Winter Soldier who seems to be in deep freeze. Scarlett Johannson and Anthony Mackie provide able support and the veterans Redford and Jackson ask us to think about the here and now."
