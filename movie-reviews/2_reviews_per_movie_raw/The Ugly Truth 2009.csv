","I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is ""r"" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together."

","I now believe that 2009 should be dubbed the year of the Romcom.<br/><br/>I was dragged to see the proposal by my girlfriend and thought it was hilarious. When she wanted to go and see The Ugly Truth I found myself putting up less of a fight this time. And I'm glad.<br/><br/>This film is HILARIOUS. I have to say I enjoyed almost every second from start to finish. It truly is designed for both men and women with fantastic views on romance, sex, attraction etc from both sides.<br/><br/>Acting is great, story is great and the chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler works very well on screen.<br/><br/>To sum this film up I have to say watch it. Make your own mind up. But I bet you won't be disappointed and I bet you can't stop yourself from one agreeing with some of the points made and two laughing out loud."

","So as I was forced to watch this movie with my sister and her friend, the original stereotypical thoughts towards all love movies seem to be bursting throughout my head- corny: guy meets girl, girl hates guy at first, girl meets another guy then realizes that the first guy was the love of his life, girl goes back to guy and the movie ends with a touching make-out scene. Well, of course this was the case. HOWEVER, I wouldn't exactly call this movie a chick-flick. It seem to be the ""battle of the sexes type,"" and it did not disappoint. I can easily say that I had some great laughs in this movie; surprisingly, and I am not even a comedy/chick flick guy. The whole moral of the movie is something both guys and women can you relate to, and some scenes are just hilarious for all types of audiences. The whole plot of the story was actually pretty solid for this style movie. In fact, the approach of this movie is so unique that I believe it belongs in its own category. Gerard Butler gives an excellent performance, both funny and charming. The humor had tremendous variety that kept audience laughing hysterically at some points. Overall, I really do recommend this movie for the male audience (Especially couples) and guarantee that they will not be disappointed after seeing this flick."
"inkblot11","7","79","131","27 July 2009"," You want the truth? You can handle The Ugly Truth, a fine romcom, but be forewarned that it deserves its ""r"" rating
","Abby (Katherine Heigl) is an intelligent producer of a local morning show in Sacramento, California. She lives with her cat in a beautiful, lushly-gardened apartment complex but, the lovely lady longs to meet Mr. Right. One day, bad news arrives, twofold. One, since the show's ratings have slipped, the owners of the station have decided to go in a new direction. And, two, that direction would be south, Abby believes, for they have hired a brash, I-don't-mince-words talk show host, Mike (Gerard Butler) for a reprise of his late-night call-in program, The Ugly Truth. Mike will do small segments of advice, where he will counsel women on what a man ""really wants"". Since Abby has a past with this gentleman (she had recently called the late night show to tell Mike to take a hike) the young producer is mighty peeved that he has been hired for ""her"" program. Instant dislike reigns supreme. However, Mike does seem to know about affairs of the heart, even in his twisted fashion, and starts to give advice to Abby, on how to ""catch"" the very handsome young doctor, Colin (Eric Winter) who has just moved into her complex. two doors down. But, since this requires Abby and Mike to actually converse and confide in one another, could it be that Cupid's arrows could go astray? This is a very raucous and funny romcom but. it is definitely not in the Doris Day tradition. Therefore, if you are easily offended or prefer ""sweet"" tales of love, with just a touch of spice, this one may not be for you. That said, the cast is really delightful, for Heigl and Butler make a most attractive. sparring duo and Winter turns heads with his looks and smiles. The supporting cast, with Cheryl Hines and the rest, is quite nice, too. Also, the Sacramento setting is lovely while the costumes are terrific and the production values high. As for the direction, it is full of energy and mischief, as befits a script that is clever but rather risqué. All in all, if you love romcoms or any of the stars, you will probably embrace this one with gusto. For the truth is, it is very romantic at its core, and that's the best ingredient a comedic love tale can possess."

","What a fun movie! Don't pay attention to the critics - they need to just go and enjoy a movie sometimes. If you don't like crude, sexist humor, then don't go see this movie. However, if you can relax and just go watch a movie, then you will enjoy this one. The entire theater was rolling with laughter during this movie. I haven't laughed so much at a movie in a long time. This movie was a mix of romantic and slapstick humor with a little bit of crudeness thrown in for fun. This movie is definitely not one to take kids to - but that's why it is rated ""R."" It is full of adult humor (some crude), but that is nice for a change. All I can say is...go and enjoy this movie!!!"
"chocokitty11","1","50","83","11 June 2011"," Painful to watch
","This may be one of the most abysmal movies I have ever seen. It surprises and disgusts me that it has a rating as high as it does. First of all, it basically sets the feminist movement back to the 1920s. It is offensive to both genders and portrays women as up-tight whiny control freaks and men as heartless and and arrogant jerks who only want sex. I hated the main characters and I honestly didn't care what happened to them. The jokes weren't at the least bit funny. I did not laugh once in this movie, mostly just cringed at the horrible dialog. If you like annoying, unintelligent, and disgusting humor, by all means go out and rent The Ugly Truth. If you you like Romantic Comedys that are actually funny and not grossly insulting, I highly advise you to watch something else."
"jaredmobarak","5","33","55","21 July 2009"," It's called a Stairmaster  The Ugly Truth
","Do you want to know the ugly truth about The Ugly Truth? Well, besides being obvious and banal cinematically, it made me laugh  a lot actually. Romantic comedies usually have one thing going for them and that is predictability. While this one has it in spades, what surprised me was how crude and crass the humor ended up being. And that's a very good thing because those instances brought on the biggest laughs of them all. One could guess there would be a few moments, especially after watching the trailer and seeing Gerard Butler's character being the epitome of alpha male, however, one would never anticipate a dinner party scene involving vibrating panties and a young child that loves objects resembling remote controls. But I'll tell you, set-ups like that were what kept me invested in the mediocre story, it definitely wasn't the manufactured chemistry between the leads.<br/><br/>Everything revolves around our heroine Abby, played by Katherine Heigl. It is definitely a role that she has proved herself willing to portray, the strong-willed, professional beauty left by the wayside in regards to the other sex. She produces a successful morning show that just can't win in the ratings. Her cohorts are as conservative as she, willing to do a piece about the mayor to try and drive viewership back their way, shaking their heads when risqué ideas are batted around. Her boss, however, decides to hire ""shock-jock"" of sorts Mike who has been cultivating a following on cable access with his insight into the truth about relationships. His callous nature and unwavering ability to say exactly what is on his mind breaths life back into Abby's show despite the trepidation of lowering herself to the kind of television she has always abhorred. She can be swayed, however, once Butler's Mike agrees to play Cyrano to her Christian in wooing her dating checklist approved neighbor Colin. Like that French film, though, and all its many copies, we all know who is really falling in love in the end.<br/><br/>Legally Blonde's Robert Luketic is behind the camera for this one and I'll admit that he tries his best to use the script in order to keep the audience on their toes. With subtle silent tricks, (introducing Mike's nephew and sister in a way to make us completely believe they are his son and wife), as well as a fearless use of language and sexual innuendo, (bravo to the studio for letting them take the R-rating and run with it), definitely got this guy—as in me—to stay alert while awaiting the next comedic gag. And while I didn't quite believe the romantic chemistry between Butler and Heigl, their relationship as buddies worked swimmingly. The beginning of their pact—to get her Colin and he respect on the set—where Mike coaches her on how to recover from the desperate call for a date is paced perfectly and acted just right. His over-zealous confidence and her naivety to it all becomes a great one-two punch. One that works just as well when she turns the table by proving she can flirt after a very funny shopping sequence where Mike is the one approving her wardrobe.<br/><br/>And it's that aspect that worked for me too, seeing the guy be the relationship guru for the girl. Sure you want to think that he is wrong, you want to take offense to things he is saying as a guy—willing yourself to believe that he isn't speaking about you—but the sad truth is, it's all probably not that far off. He is so right when he says he doesn't understand romance or love, but that he is a master at lust and manipulation. His methods work and they are foolproof, but as we realize towards the end, along with Abby, the bond they acquire is never lasting. If you have to be a generic type to win someone's heart, well, you will never be happy. The ugly truth, therefore, is that dating is hard and relationships take work, but if you aren't honest with yourself or your significant other, it is all a lie that will only end in heartbreak.<br/><br/>I'd like to give some credit to the supporting cast, but, frankly, they aren't on screen very much. This is the Katherine and Gerard show through and through. John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines do their best to steal some thunder, yet, thinking back, their most successful moments are a result of reactions to what Butler and/or Heigl did. If there was one guy that I really enjoyed in the background, and he is very quietly effective here, it would be Jesse D. Goins. His brief seconds of screen time, with either a facial expression or quick quip, are gold. The rest of the movie does rely on the stars and I applaud them for doing an admirable job. Why Butler needed to fake an American accent is beyond me, (his face just looked weird as he tried so hard to hide the Scottish), and Heigl's smugness rubs me the wrong way every time, but I was able to look past those crutches. If I could give The Ugly Truth any words of encouragement, it would be that my girlfriend loved it. So, if it fires on all cylinders for the demographic it's marketed to, and kept me laughing enough to forget how mediocre the actual story was, I guess, when all is said and done, it does do a pretty darn good job."

","Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a high maintenance dater, producer of a lowly rated morning show about to be canceled. Her boss hires male chauvinist call-in show host Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler). Mike and Abby clash even before their first meeting. On the opposite end, she thinks her new hot doctor neighbor Colin (Eric Winter) fits the bill perfectly.<br/><br/>This character actually fits Heigl's persona. So it has some potential right off the bat. At least, she's not the sweet girly girl in a rom-com.... until she meets the neighbor. She doesn't do that broad comedy that well. She looks ridiculous and stupid. She's better off as angry girl, sort of like Katherina in The Taming of the Shrew.<br/><br/>This movie is completely predictable. Everybody can see everything coming from a mile away. The good news is that Heigl and Butler has some chemistry in their combative relationship. That's about all there is in this movie."

","My husband and I saw this at a sold-out sneak preview on July 17. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time at a film and the audience seemed to find the film as funny and bawdy as I did. My husband was happy to watch a romantic comedy from the male perspective as well as the female for a change. The leads are attractive but not the usual ""perfect"" specimens we usually get in these films, and the situations, while often over-the-top, are quite humorously portrayed. The typical fairy tale elements seem to go by the wayside here and we're left with a harsher but very funny battle-of-the-sexes comedy for the times in which we now live."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","37","65","4 September 2009"," Better than I expected, it's honestly not that bad, it had better potential though
","Romantic comedies, I've said it before and I'll say it again, we always have the hit and miss formula that comes with this genre. For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.<br/><br/>Abby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, ""The Ugly Truth,"" run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.<br/><br/>Now things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.<br/><br/>But there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog. Honestly I think most of the theater had a hard time catching their breath on that joke, no one could stop laughing. Katherine and Gerad do have great chemistry on screen, I just think it would have worked better as a friendship. So I would say this is better suited as a rental vs. a theater view. It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I like Romantic comedies, they humorous and never try to preach to much. Last good one I saw was Knocked Up and it was sweet. But according to the female lead in it was Sexist. Yes... okay what's your move Miss Heigl<br/><br/>*Katherine Heigl stars in The Ugly Truth*<br/><br/>There is no way nice way of putting this. There no kind way to lay this out. But this movie is freaking sexist. It paints men as sex crazed dogs, without an ounce of romance within them and everything they do is solely for sex. Move over Knocked Up, a film that made me laugh that was beautiful that really told a wonderful story.<br/><br/>Here we have a film that speaks down to woman, objectifies them and actually says this is right. That all men want is sex therefore woman should accept this and dress like whores, act like whores and overall listen to misogyny.<br/><br/>This film hurt me, it made me sick, I'm so glad only saw review because nothing about this movie appealed to me. The characters, the script, the music. It was all to paint men as sex crazed Neanderthals.<br/><br/>I'm 19, I want love, I want a relationship, I don't want sex for sex sake. And I'm demographic this movie aimed at.<br/><br/>Honestly it claims men only pretend to listen, that men only care what will get them laid. It doesn't have any nuances doesn't have any redeeming features and it's so contrived.<br/><br/>How can you call Knocked Up sexist and then go to star in this? It's beyond me.<br/><br/>There only one ugly truth here hypocrisy, making a film that attacks men rather than woman is just as bad as sexism against woman.<br/><br/>Trust me girls, this movie isn't realistic to any degree of real people.<br/><br/>So it just depresses me, how much people love this movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1142988/<br/><br/>Gender wars is a pathetic use of anyone time, once you see people as anyone other than the shallow superficial crap you think of us as, then truly there will be less of this contrived and jaded nonsense.<br/><br/>God this movie annoyed the hell out of me.<br/><br/>Don't watch."

It seems that many people saw the film in ""preview"" showing - they all loved it. Could those posts be planted by the movie production or distribution companies? Because, frankly, this movie was not funny, it was filled with vulgarity, and it was poorly made, with choppy scenes, poor character development, etc. <br/><br/>If the creators of this film were trying to emulate a Hepburn/Tracy-like relationship on screen, they failed. Seeing a beautiful woman say the word c*** repeatedly is not humorous, sexy or intriguing. It's just plain bad film-making. A terrible script, stereotyped characters and, overall, a bad career choice for the actors involved. <br/><br/>Very inappropriate for high school aged kids who love the romantic comedy formula and go to these movies because they feel good that the couple ends up together happy.

There are some funny ideas here, which don't quite play out. KH is not believable as Ms Hoity-Toity. In fact this is the sort of romcom that KH usually sends up. Gerard B is okay, he's just not funny. Some people aren't. Successful romcoms, I think, are like souflees; they seem insubstantial, but they're delicious when they're just right – light and fluffy.

The cast is formed by Gerard Butler (300) and Katherine Heigl (27 Dresses) in the leading roles.

","""It's a little sexist. It paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys... I'm playing such a bitch; why is she being such a killjoy?"" The Ugly Truth star Katherine Heigl there, talking to 'Vanity Fair' in 2007 about Judd Apatow's 'Knocked Up.' <br/><br/>Fast-forward a couple of years, and stone me, if Heigl's not playing another shrewish, humourless and uptight media-professional, in yet another opposites-attract romantic comedy. Is this her idea of progress? If she's atoning for her early role in 1994's American remake of 'My Father, The Hero', in which her 14-year-old character wears a white, one-piece thong bikini while claiming her dad Gérard Depardieu is actually her lover in order to appear more womanly to boys, then perhaps it is. But right now Heigl's range is proving slightly more limited than John Wayne's, who at least played both a Mongolian *and* an ancient Roman with a Madison County accent.<br/><br/>Heigl plays Abby Richter, a Sacramento breakfast TV show producer, and the kind of frightening valkyrie who background-checks her dates. This glamorous professional remains inexplicably single - until the execs pair her up with shouty shock jock Mike Chadway (a dodgy-accented Gerard Butler) to boost the ratings with his lame 'Men are from Bars, Women Need a Penis' shtick. Chadway's 'Ugly Truth' segment claims to spill the beans about the sexes while advising pent-up women to flick the same. ""Men are simple, they cannot be trained! You wanna win a man over, you don't need ten steps, you just need blowjobs!"" While women who want 'relationships' are advised to talk dirty, dress like Streetwalker Barbie and ""get a StairMaster"". Given that Mike has already called Abby a ""dog"" and a ""lesbian"", what happens next is frankly extraordinary: the shriekingly strange control freak falls for her neighbour, the young orthopaedic doctor Colin (Eric Winter), and challenges Mike to be her very own Cyrano-in-an-earpiece. And, well, we all know how 'Roxanne' turned out. (Or not: Mike doesn't actually get off with Colin.) <br/><br/>If one were to take a buzzsaw to The Ugly Truth, its arterial spray would drip down the wall to form the coagulated word 'Generic'. Among 37,000 similar rom-coms, it is markedly close to 2001's 'Someone Like You', in which Ashley Judd uses roommate Hugh Jackman's womanising outlook as raw material for her sexist advice column. And then falls in love with him. This lack of any originality whatsoever wouldn't be so insulting if there existed any actual chemistry between the leads; if the supporting cast weren't as slight as snowflakes (wimpy Colin is barely even human); or if, with its trash-mouth, oral-sex gags and casting, it didn't so desperately and transparently want to be a Judd Apatow movie. Just one without the insight. Or soul. Or wit. Or anything. Why is Mike in love with Abby? ""Beats the s*** out of me, but I am."" And that, boys and girls, is how you tidily dispose of character development when your script ain't worth a fart.<br/><br/>Its leading lady exec-produced this (rarely a promising sign), and so did her mum, but this film seemingly exists only to utterly humiliate Heigl via three farcical set-pieces; the lowlight of which sees her remote-controlled vibrating sex knickers (a gift from Mike, with the honest-to-goodness words ""this isn't for you, it's for your bean"") being 'accidentally' activated while she's out having dinner with clients. Meg Ryan's got nothing to worry about but Nora Ephron should sue. ""Thanks for coming tonight"" says Mike. ""For dinner. That kind of coming."" Sure, we get it. Who wrote these gags, David Brent? Well actually, a trio of women wrote this film (two of them also being the brains behind 'Legally Blonde', 'She's The Man' and 'The House Bunny'), demonstrably proving that chauvinism isn't the sole preserve of one sex."

","I did not expect much from this film and it didn't even live up to those small expectations. I actually didn't laugh once, and so I was in disbelief when the rest of the cinema started to crack up at the obvious and smutty jokes. Therefore I'm guessing I'm probably in the minority who really really hated this film, although the two friends I was with also felt this way. All three of us knew the ending when we saw the trailer, but we had also felt this way about The Proposal trailer and had found that film really really funny, so we thought we'd give The Ugly Truth a try. I wish we hadn't bothered! I feel bad for Katherine Heigl, I like her as an actress and I know she can be funny because I've seen Knocked Up. This film is just terribly clichéd and really rather dull, dull, dull. The fact that Gerard Butler's character had been hurt in the past and that's why he doesn't believe in relationships but underneath all his dirty talk he really is a nice guy because he lives next door to his sister and looks after his nephew who just wonders into the news studio during recording! (How did he get in?!) And the ending in the hot air balloon was ridiculous, the assistant producer said they were off air, then the balloon takes off and their conversation and make out session is apparently going out live. I have already mentioned The Proposal and I have to say go and see that, not this. Although the ending is equally predictable it has a more original story and several great moments. And if you've already seen The Proposal, go and see it again, because it has to be more enjoyable than sitting through one and a half hours of The Ugly Truth!"

We walked out after 45 minutes wondering why we did not have the wisdom to do so earlier."

","Now I do like this genre of film, but only when the comedy is funny and the romance touches or moves me. The Ugly Truth I am afraid to say, did neither.<br/><br/>The film does look quite nice with striking cinematography and locations, but sadly that is the only praise I can give. I was disappointed in the soundtrack, I did find it very generic and forgettable, and in the direction which was so smug and unfocused.<br/><br/>When it comes to the acting, it wasn't very good really. Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler do try to bring some life into their roles, but the two have no chemistry together and it doesn't help that their characters(and all the characters of the film for that matter) are so shallow and clichéd that I couldn't care for them at all.<br/><br/>The worst assets were the script and the story. The script is incredibly unfunny and mean-spirited, and the story is predictable and hackneyed with an ending you can smell a mile off. Also the pacing is so sluggish, and with everything else so poor the whole film was a dull chore to sit through, and on top of all that with how some of the characters behave and treat each other here some of it felt sexist.<br/><br/>Overall, I disliked it, because I found it dull with a poor story and script with characters I felt nothing for. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
"EUyeshima","3","12","22","15 November 2009"," Standard Rom-Com or Gross-Out Comedy? A Belabored Movie That Can't Make Up Its Mind
","This 2009 movie proves that women - in this case, screenwriters Nicole Eastman, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith - can write romantic comedies just as poorly as men can. As directed by Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde""), the idea behind this misfire is to cross-pollinate the most tired conventions of the female-focused genre with the sensibilities of the recent spate of raunchy, man-boy comedies, this latter genre having found its unequivocal leader in Judd Apatow. However, unlike Apatow, who has figured out how to make films that are insightful as well as funny like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" (ironically featuring this film's star, Katherine Heigl), Luketic shows no such finesse as everything in this film feels labored with the principal actors Heigl and Gerard Butler overplaying their opposites-attracts roles to near-cartoon proportions. Moreover, there are so many absurd gross-out gags inserted in this film that it feels like the creators (including executive producer Heigl) completely miscalculates who its target audience appears to be.<br/><br/>The strictly by-the-numbers plot centers on Abby Richter, an uptight, overachieving producer for a ratings-challenged morning talk show in, of all places, Sacramento. Her workplace is full of the stock characters you would expect in this type of formulaic movie - the demanding station manager, the show's vainglorious co-hosts with empty smiles and non-ironic deliveries, the inane segments that make up Abby's struggling show. Predictably, her personal life is burdened by an incessant, programmatic search for Mr. Right, and consequently, her one-time dates become a series of qualification interviews. Prospects don't look much better at work with her show's ratings, and so enters local cable-access celebrity, Mike Chadway, a chauvinist personality who regales in providing sexist advice on what men are really looking for in women. Naturally, it comes down to guys wanting nothing but sex and how women should do everything they can to encourage it.<br/><br/>Ratings rise based on the prurient content and Mike's unapologetic behavior, and even Abby recognizes his prowess in tapping into the public's psyche, so much so that on a stay-or-get-fired wager, Mike convinces her that he can be her Cyrano to help her land her neighbor, a handsome doctor who meets all of Abby's superficial qualifications. As tired as the premise sounds (and it is), the movie's pain points are exacerbated by the constant need to humiliate Abby, mainly through simulations of sexual acts in public. Obviously a knock-off of Meg Ryan's fake orgasm scene in ""When Harry Meets Sally"", the most notoriously contrived episode involves a pair of electronic panties that cause her to writhe uncontrollably in front of her corporate sponsors. Heigl seems to be playing the same model of efficiency in all her big-screen roles, and as Abby, she plays her stereotype on hyper-drive, for instance, hanging upside down from a tree in her underwear or doing her happy dance repeatedly.<br/><br/>Burying his Scottish brogue under an accent that sounds suspiciously like Mel Gibson's, Butler should be careful about accepting roles like Mike because he could otherwise turn into a Matthew McConaughey-type of actor, a promising career start (""Dear Frankie"") followed by bad commercially-driven choices. The other actors make little impression with even the comic talents of John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines wasted as the shallow talk show co-hosts. The ending is predictable and poorly matted on a hot-air balloon, and the denouement brings an unnecessarily cynical exclamation point to the whole venture. The 2009 DVD is unsurprisingly, mostly filler - a gag reel, a set of alternative endings, and a couple of featurettes – the first about the differences in the male and female points of view and the second about the apparent hilarity in making this film. I'm glad the cast and crew had a good time, me not so much."

Personally as a woman I liked ""Knocked Up"" I thought that it was intelligent, witty, and great fun- unlike this piece of garbage called ""The Ugly Truth."" Hiegel thought that ""Knocked Up"" made women look like shrews who didn't like to have fun well this movie brought the shrew up to the upteanth billion factor.

"rooprect","6","2","2","10 February 2020"," Light entertainment. Unfortunately they cut the parts that would have made it great.
","If you're looking for a breezy, predictable romcom that pokes fun at gender stereotypes, ""The Ugly Truth"" will fill the slot. It's basically a watered-down rehash of the classic ""When Harry Met Sally"" gender war romcom (right down to the orgasm at a restaurant scene) with nothing really new. Unfortunately the angle that would have given it a fresh spin ended up on the cutting room floor. I'll get to that in a sec. First let's summarize the story.<br/><br/>Abby (Katherine Heigl) is an uptight, prudish tv producer who is forced to work with a loud-mouthed, misogynistic talk show host named Mike (Gerard Butler). Each presents an extreme stereotype of the sexes: Abby is a control freak who expects her man to be straight out of the Hallmark Channel while Mike treats women like he's ordering at the McDonald's drive thru. The plot revolves around a bet: Mike tells Abby that if she follows his neanderthal advice, she can snare her perfect dream man.<br/><br/>So there's an interesting sort of role reversal, where the prudish female is taking lessons from the neanderthal bro in order to achieve her ideal Hallmark romance. That itself was a great start, but this clever spirit of the film got lost when they cut a few critical scenes (I guess because those scenes focused on character development and didn't have enough zingers).<br/><br/>The scenes that were cut showed exactly how hopelessly neurotic Abby is and why she keeps scaring men off. And they focused on the important, yet mostly lost, subplot of how fake Abby must become in order to snare her man. 4 or 5 scenes were cut, and rather than understanding the degree of Abby's ""Pygmalion"" transformation, we the audience are rushed through the process. Also cut are some scenes that show Mike to be more sensitive/human, giving his character depth which is otherwise lacking. The result of these cuts is, instead of this film showing more of a complex gender-role-reversal switcheroo, it simply falls back on the black & white stereotypes of men being neanderthals and women being prudes. Nothing exceptionally clever, but still entertaining enough.<br/><br/>So in the end, yes, I can understand why the watered down message could offend some. What we get is mostly the male perspective of Mike, reducing Abby's role to being his clueless sidekick. And the rest is predictable.<br/><br/>The angle of them on a tv set with a producer/talent relationship is interesting, but it's nothing really new if you've done your romcom homework. On that account I would sooner recommend ""Groundhog Day"" which has the identical setup--Bill Murray playing the narcissistic tv talent with Andie McDowell playing his more sensible-minded producer--except that Groundhog Day rightfully focuses on the narcissist coming down to earth, not the other way around which we see here.<br/><br/>A final note worth mentioning. I've heard it said that any movie that ends with a hot air balloon is insulting to the viewer's intelligence. There is indeed a hot air balloon in this one. So be prepared..."

","Seriously, i don't know what movie studios are thinking now a days, releasing movies like these into the cinemas. I went to watch this movie, not with high hopes (after all the whole opposites attract formula has been used millions of times in romantic comedies, so it wasn't very original) but i thought it could be fun. I mean the trailer had it's moments, and i am a Gerard Butler fan, i thought maybe he could have good chemistry with Katherine Heigl (she did OK in knocked up). None of it was there, no chemistry, no good acting, no script, no laughs. The only reason i am not giving it a 0 to this movie is because i had a few laughs in the vibrator scene (is not a spoiler because it appears in the trailer). I am a big fan of Gerard Butler, but i don't know what he was thinking, is like he accepted the movie without even reading that awfully unfunny script. He did very good in 300 (some people say his acting was stiff, but i think it was very powerful, his approach to Leonidas was chilling) so i guess he should stick to those kind of strong quiet type kind of roles. Another thing is his accent, he cannot pull it of, his American accent is jut plain awful, Gerard if you are reading this for any reason whatsoever, i am a big fan but stick to your native accent or at least get a better American coach. Katherine Heigl does a lousy job playing this highly annoying network executive, her whole character is just annoying, and the way they approached the character was just unreal. As i said earlier the script is painfully unfunny, i mean they jut used clichè after clichè of the macho stereotype for Butler, clearly trying to emphasize how different he was with Heigl's character: Guess what? this time it didn't work. The characters were so cliché'd that they just became caricatures, i never cared for any of them, i didn't care if they ended up together or not. All in all is an awful movie, and i just couldn't repress my feelings towards this mess of a movie. Horrible performances, Horrible movie"

","(The movie has already done extremely well at the box office earning a very respectable 5x return on investment according to box office mojo. So I feel like I am swimming against the current when I disagree with the rest of my fellow moviegoers. Nevertheless, here's my view) No matter how cute the girl next door /played by Katherine Heigl/ is and how suavely cool the macho man /played by Gerard Butler/ is, this film is beyond saving.<br/><br/>I understand why Katherine would take up this role, she is trying to break out of Greys Anatomy and I also understand why this is good for Gerard Butler, he is trying to soften his 300 image to give him a broader appeal. And to be fair, both of them have done a very commendable job. Despite the talent and the funding involved, how could this project lack the spinal cord of a decent script is beyond me.<br/><br/>Effects/Action/video quality... requires money but Script requires creativity and hard work. So when it comes to the story, a couple of guys out of film school are at par with the best and brightest of the mega studios. And that's why, for me, lack of a good script is an original sin which cannot be forgiven.<br/><br/>This is a big step down for Robert Luketic from 21.<br/><br/>Hopefully we get better entertainers going forward when you have a team similar to this one.<br/><br/>This review was originally posted on my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2009/12/ugly-truth.html"

Most of the hot women I know in my life excel socially and none have had a hard time getting men.<br/><br/>3. Romantic comedies are usually predictable (probably their greatest downfall) and this one is more predictable than most. It doesn't help that the hot doctor's character is never developed.

","This film is probably the most unpleasant pile of trash I've seen for a long time. Perhaps they were going for some kind of sophisticated battle of the sexes comedy a la Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn but they were way, way, way off the mark! This film seems to pride itself on the perpetuation of the stereotype that men are void of emotion and only seeking sex and women are controlling harpies who have a checklist of requirements that must be met in order for them to give a guy a second glance. Yes, the main characters get together at the end but only after we are subjected to a stream of disgusting clichés, insults and sexist 'jokes'. The contrived set-pieces, such as the vibrating knickers scene, are dismally unfunny and actually embarrassing to watch. I have no idea what drew either Katherine Heigl or Gerard Butler to think this was a worthwhile project.<br/><br/>The messages put forward by the film are extremely toxic e.g. that the best way for a women to get a man is to strip herself of her own identity and change herself completely into a stereotype of 'what men want'. Equally, I imagine that many men would be insulted to be described in the way they are by Gerard Butler's character, who essentially portrays them as nothing but sexist pigs. The fact that Heigl's character dumps the man she deceived into asking her out and that Butler's character realises at the last minute that he loves her doesn't exonerate the filmmakers from the crime of crassly pedalling sexist rubbish throughout the majority of the film. Both sexes have worked hard to counter these stereotypes over the last century but this film seeks to resurrect them for the purposes of a few cheap laughs. <br/><br/>I felt pretty undermined and violated by the end of this film. It was like going back at least 50 years to the worst periods of sexism and gender politics, with excessive swearing and copious amounts of vulgarity thrown in simply for the sake of it. I would strongly advise against wasting your time watching 'The Ugly Truth', which while certainly ugly, gets nowhere near to representing the truth about modern relationships."

And Heigel's character is so real with all those issues about the relationships and frankly vulnerability. Of course, life is much more complicated but leaving the theater you feel yourself happy and mighty in the questions of fascination. Thanks to the writers, the story doesn't fall in dynamics and doesn't bore you until the credits."

At least Gerared Butlers' character was too vanilla to even be a stereotype. There was not an original thought in the whole of this movie. I saw the restaurant scene coming from a mile away, as I recognized it from When Harry met Sally (a movie where Meg Ryan's character was at least allowed to think!). The only differences were: 1. Meg Ryan's Character used her IMAGINATION (evidently, the writers in TUG have never even heard of the word)instead of power tools, 2. Meg Ryan's character was in control of the situation, and didn't submit to being pleasured by a little boy. On a related note, when Katherine Heigl received the ""Present"" of ""vibrating underwear"" from Gerard Butler's ""character"" (or lack thereof) did anyone one else notice that the box it came in was worn and ""used-looking""? EWWW! What king of nasty skank would accept or even worse, a use second-hand masturbation device? It says a lot that the ""actress"" would allow her character to be portrayed that way.

"boblipton","5","9","17","29 July 2009"," Erratic
","I have just come from a movie theater where I saw the new romantic comedy ""The Ugly Truth"" starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. It was directed by Robert Luketic with three screen writers, two of whom worked with the director on an earlier hit, LEGALLY BLONDE.<br/><br/>With a title that suggests the great Leo MacCarey comedy THE AWFUL TRUTH, this movie has been taking an awful lot of criticism, mostly directed at Miss Heigl, a beautiful and competent actress who has, it seemed, been called upon to carry a script which is mostly distinguished by the fact that her character, as written, is composed of a number of seemingly immiscible characteristics, none of which are ever sorted out; and which seems to attempt to move between standard screwball, standard romantic comedy, with occasional Farrelly-Brothers-style freak-out jokes tossed in, with no presagement, rhyme nor reason.<br/><br/>The whole thing ends in such a predictable manner in a sky filled with balloons that the film might have been written by simply taking discarded parts of other scripts and tossing them in.<br/><br/>In short, while Miss Heigl does not distinguish herself in this indistinguishable mess, laying the blame at her feet strikes me as cruel and foolish. While she is given an 'executive producer' credit, there are a total of eleven producers on this film, which is up near the John Woo level. Miss Heigl carries out her acting assignment competently, and she has good chemistry with Mr. Butler. While she has appeared in other romcoms to better effect -- I did enjoy 27 DRESSES -- surely her job as an actor is not to rewrite the script, nor to insist on a character that makes sense, but to perform the role in a manner as plausible as possible, to milk the funny lines for what they are worth and to be generally of interest when she is on screen. She accomplishes the last, but surely the fact that her character makes no sense and that the gags are thrown in at random cannot be laid at her feet.<br/><br/>Mr. Butler is given a much more interesting role, that of a chauvinist pig whose TV producer Miss Heigl is forced to become. However, the audience is swiftly assured that this is simply a pose to cover a warm heart and Miss Heigl comes to recognize this gradually -- and telling the audience quickly and Miss Heigl slowly is another problem with the script. <br/><br/>There is also the third wheel, played by Eric Winter, who plays an unattached doctor with a body that looks like he spends three or four hours a day working on his abs. Although my early assumption that he would turn out to be gay were not borne out, he serves no real impediment to Mr. Butler's and Miss Heigl's inevitable romance.<br/><br/>The result is that this is a poor but fitfully watchable romcom, distinguished mostly by Mr. Butler's macho maundering on What Men Really Want. If you miss it, you won't miss much, but I doubt if the actively painful scenes -- including the aftermath of a discussion of masturbation that the Farrelly Brothers would reject as neither funny nor realistic --will cause you to walk out of the theater."

This was the first time. We were watching it quietly for half an hour and then at the same time we said: What is this?! It seemed like a nice movie, it had decent reviews, not great, but we loved 27 dresses with Katherine Heigl, and that movie was smacked down by critics. This movie was just vulgar and discriminating. I have no idea how Katherine Heigl or Gerard Butler can watch this movie without being completely embarrassed and ashamed. The acting was awful, the script was awful. The entire story was so made up, totally unbelievable. Please, trust me and never buy it or rent it. It is such a waste of money!"

I rented this because I like Gerard Butler and he owes big time with his next few movies otherwise I'm signing off of him for good.

","Abby (Heigl) is forced to increase ratings of the TV show she produces by allowing Mike (Butler) to show the women in the TV audience what men really want from women.<br/><br/>After 10-minutes, I shut this down. Too embarrassing to watch. Nothing funny, no good lines. The only thing it had going for it was watching Katherine Heigl. Then I tried again the next day hoping it got better, but shut it down again after an additional 10-minutes. Simply really bad and crude dialogue mostly by Mike (Butler) who was a non-stop Raunch Machine. Even the beautiful and talented Heigl fell into the trap and mouthed a few unfunny more-than-risqué lines. Enough was enough. <br/><br/>So now the DVD sits waiting to go back to Red Box where no one should ever take it out. Will the movie save itself? Probably, but I will never know after experiencing the first 20-minutes head start of garbage it produced. Yes, I know a lot of people like the dirty talk, especially hormonal 7th and 8th graders. But, they, too, grow up at some point. Let's hope. Sometimes the risqué has it's place and is funny, but not in here.<br/><br/>When I found out that three women actually sat down and wrote this, I kind of understood why all the raunch. Apparently, good lines, and comedy take a back seat to x-rated dialogue. Perhaps they felt they had to prove something. Oh, wait a minute, they thought they were writing funny stuff. HA!<br/><br/>I did laugh at one thing. Abby's cat poking his head into the goldfish bowl trying to get at the goldfish.<br/><br/>A magic show is mostly successful because we do not know how the illusions were done. We are not shown what made the trick work. In this movie all nuts and bolts were shown to us and there was no magic.<br/><br/>I like Katherine Heigl and I hope in the future she takes more time in deciding what scripts to indulge in.<br/><br/>Maybe I should try it again, this time without sound. Hmmmmm.<br/><br/>Violence: Not sure, didn't watch it all the way to the end, but I doubt it. Sex: No. I think they let the raunchy dialogue speak for itself. Nudity: No, ditto.

","""The Ugly Truth"" is a definitely better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. It stars two lovely, charming actors: Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl. Other than that, there is nothing good to say about this movie. It really, really stinks. The critics got this right.<br/><br/>First, memo to Gerard Butler. You were gorgeous in ""Phantom of the Opera."" You were buff in ""300."" In ""The Ugly Truth,"" you are fat, and fat does not work on you, darling. Some actors can carry it off – where would James Gandolfini be without those extra 200 pounds he carries around. On you, Gerry, the fat just does not work. It settles on your face, and you look puffy and too much like Ernest Borgnine to star in any romance outside of a remake of ""Marty."" The rest of the movie is simply not worth talking about. It is vulgar, trashy, and badly made. I was astounded by the poor quality of the film stock. It's as if you are watching ""The Ugly Truth"" through rancid fish aquarium water. The direction isn't up to high school drama class standards, and the lines fall flatter than Kansas.<br/><br/>All of this is a crying shame, because the premise is promising and the actors are game. We could really use a good romantic comedy right about now. The script, direction, and production values just, simply, stink."
"xamtaro","6","10","22","23 September 2009"," Nothing ugly about this show. Thats the truth.
","Over the years, i have found few romantic comedies suited to my taste. Be it live action or in the form of anime, romantic comedies tend to be very mediocre IMO with only a handful that turn out really funny and enjoyable. Through some unforeseen circumstances i ended up not watching ""Gamer"" starring Gerald Butler and instead watched ""The Ugly Truth"", also starring Gerald Butler. To be honest, it was my curiosity at seeing ""Mr 'This is Sparta'"" handle a comedy lead role that convinced me to give this movie a shot.<br/><br/>THe premise is as such. Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a perfectionist, ""control freak""-ish morning show TV producer whose show is on the verge of being canceled due to low ratings. One night, she comes home from a disastrous date and happens to watch a segment of a TV show, ""The Ugly Truth"", hosted by ""shock jock"" by Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler). Abby calls into his show and argues with Mike on-air, in response to cynical attitude about relationships prompts, which leads to her quite literally ""hating his guts"". The next day, she discovers that the station she works for has hired Mike to do a segment on her show in order to boost ratings. This kicks starts a very storm tossed relationship between the two which lends itself to numerous comedic turns. Sooner than expected, Abby just so happens to fall for her doctor neighbor and she grudgingly goes to Mike for advice at ""netting"" the man of her dreams(actually the only man who fulfilled her listed criteria). The unlikely pair cut a deal in that if she is She agrees to his advice and is successful, it would prove Mike's theories on relationships and she will work happily with him. However if Mike fails, he agrees to quit.<br/><br/>Anyone with experience in this genre of movies can more or less fill in the rest of the story. Unlikely pair work together, more jokes, fall for each other, more jokes, Love triangle develops, tragedy strikes, touching finale. Finish.<br/><br/>In this case, I would admit that the usual formula actually works to a certain extent. It allows the audience the satisfaction of actually knowing what they are watching, and getting exactly what they are expecting. This is not avant Garde cinema, but it is entertainment. Also the formulaic story allows one to focus more on the scripting and acting, which IMO is where this movie truly shines.<br/><br/>Witty banter and a cornucopia of innuendo-ed jokes fill up most of the film. Sexual references abound but are written in such a tactful way that they do not come off as crass or crude. Most sexual innuendo jokes tend to be rude and sometimes offensive; thankfully thats not the case here.There is wit to the humor in this movie that utilities word puns and double meanings in their jokes to good effect. Thankfully, the humor is not over-played and the more serious moments of the movie are spliced very well into the overall narrative. The characters and situations are written in such a way that anyone could easily identify with them, which lends to a greater emotional involvement in the film.<br/><br/>Stellar acting by the cast also helps. Special mention goes to Gerald Butler who proves to be an exceedingly versatile actor. He nails the carefree, in-your-face, yet internally bitter character of Mike Chadway to the point that it is easy to forget the actor playing the role and just become so involved with character himself. Katherine Heigl does a satisfying job as Abby, lending both her acting chops and eye candy to the complex lead role. <br/><br/>My only beef with this movie is that it could have expounded on the relationship themes a little more instead of falling back on ""the usual thing"". Having a clearer conflict of ideals between Mike and Abby and maybe going deeper into the strengths and flaws of the ideas presented would have turned this film into a more thought provoking experience. ""what men really want"" , ""what women really look for"", ""loving the 'me you want to see' or loving 'the real me'"", all those little tidbits would have made benefited from a more central role in the film which would have given this movie a ""fresher"" feel instead of the stale standard story.<br/><br/>I was personally very entertained by ""The Ugly Truth"" especially in the laughs department, not just because the jokes were extremely funny, but that they were also well written, witty and made sense without being offensive. I loved superb acting by the leads, excellent cast chemistry and an overall sense of escapism. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, All i can say is that unless you are already a fan of romantic comedies or unless you have an open mind when it comes to various movie genre(<---like me), its best to stick with what you like. ""The Ugly Truth"" won't convert staunch action movie junkies or epic fantasy aficionados anytime soon, that's for sure, but just sit back relax and enjoy a good laugh that is easy on the brain. A hearty chuckle and a few quick tugs at the heartstrings now and then is good for body, mind and soul.<br/><br/>Note to the ""not so proficient in English"" crowd: Keep your ears open for all the double meanings behind the jokes, its funnier that way."
"PegEntwistleDOA","3","7","14","29 November 2009"," raunchy alleged romantic comedy
","Katherine Heigl needs to rethink her career. She's too blatantly beautiful for moviegoers to continue buying the notion that the characters she plays are incapable of finding love. Puh-leeze, give that a rest. Further, she's always got a librarian-type look at the start--then blossoms into a babe. Another tired Heigl movie signature. But what really kills this picture (don't waste the $$ for a DVD rental) is that it suffers from an identity complex. It's R-rated for its very vulgar language and innuendo...but nothing is really shown. So men will be disappointed that there's no T & A on screen (though there's plenty of talk of it) and women will find it too crass to be romantic. On top of which, there's barely a spark of chemistry between Heigl and Gerard Butler (are we really supposed to believe she'd fall for such a thuggish type...oh, wait, maybe he's got a secret soft side...gag...). Didn't anyone make these two do a screen test? Guys, save your time; go buy a copy of Playboy or Penthouse. Ladies, read a romantic novel, instead. And Katherine, fire your agent!"
"AlanSKaufman","Null","7","14","31 July 2009"," The Truth Is Truly Ugly
","I chose to view The Ugly Truth for two reasons.<br/><br/>First, I had last seen the star, Katherine Heigl, in a remarkable 2002 Twilight Zone episode, Cradle of Darkness. She's from the future sent on a one way trip back in time to the year of Hitler's birth where she's to try killing the baby. She gives a riveting performance, ending with a shocking twist. I naturally wondered how she'd do in a comedy.<br/><br/>Second, the title of her new movie intrigued me. The truth is seldom told precisely because it is ugly, hence unpopular. Many people prefer comforting lies from movies, politicians, and dates. It would be refreshing to have a film uphold a principle regardless of its consequences.<br/><br/>Paradoxically, while discovering the movie rewarding on both counts, the truth was so ugly that I don't wish to see it again, and can better appreciate Katherine's fine acting skills in her earlier performance.<br/><br/>Here's a succinct summary: The male lead portrays a sexist pig believing that men want only one thing, and women who romanticize for something more are losers. Katherine plays a modern woman with old fashioned virtues, finally meeting a nice guy. The sexist pig, confident she'll fail, offers to help her get a date with the guy. However, when she appears to be heading towards a relationship, the pig gets jealous, so he makes an R rated pass at her in an elevator. The result? She coldly dumps the nice guy because she found the sexist pig sexier. The movie concludes with an even stronger R rated scene of our heroine in bed with the pig.<br/><br/>Disgusting, yes, but true to life, isn't it? Just look in your own mirror. If you're a nice guy, you've probably finished last. If you're a romantically inclined woman, you're probably pining away. And if you're a happy couple, well, please spare your lonely neighbors your X rated chatter, and watch out, 'cause the sexual excitement will diminish and you'll cheat on each other seeking fresh conquests!"
"down-emily","3","5","9","25 June 2010"," This ugly thing...
","I am pretty sure Katherine Heigl attempted to hit herself with a brick several times after realizing she has done probably the worst movie in her career, and that's saying a lot. This woman never learns. She goes from one bad movie to the next. She is unstoppable. Soon, this won't even be funny anymore. The Ugly Truth is her statement that she hates movies. That must be it. Why she would produce this is beyond my feeble understanding. Why she would let herself be man-handled and made a complete idiot by Gerard Butler is still a mystery that haunts me. Oh and speaking of Gerard Butler, why do I have a feeling that he actually enjoyed shooting this? I think he just wanted to say loads of crap about women and didn't know how. I'm assuming he wanted to take advantage of them in the lowest way possible but had never had the chance to do so before. Or maybe he isn't a big fan of Katherine and just wanted to trash her for ninety minutes. Either way, both actors should feel ashamed and appalled for starring in this half-assed sex-ad. The three stars that I am honouring this movie with are a token to probably the best actor in this pile of dump: the little kid that got hold of Katherine's remote (for her you know what)"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Robert Luketic has never been able to recapture the charm of his Legally Blonde film, which in fact, was only charming due to Reece Witherspoon.

"ironhorse_iv","6","4","7","25 July 2013"," Here is the ugly truth about this movie. It's nearly unwatchable.
","This movie, not only insults straight men and women, both gay and lesbians, and different countries social customs relationships. It's not good to insult your viewers like this. I don't find this movie directed by Robert Luketic, decent at all. Some critics really hate the film, some people says that this movie does tell the truth. I have to disagree. While I do say, it's a film that shouldn't be taken serious and I don't hate it, it does need some good old fashion criticize. If anything, I'd call this movie chauvinistic, as it exaggerated implies that all men are sexist pricks who only want to bang as many women as possible, and that all women exist only to be shrewish, egotistical money grabbing naive romanticism. In truth, yes, sex does play a role in relationships, but not all relationships are about sex. People also go into relationships for other reasons, like loved, cherished, made to feel special, safe and secure. Is it a bit selfish to want those things or all in a relationship? Yes, but it doesn't mean, people in relationships are pricks and shrews. It's because we differ from some animals because we don't only take, but give back as well. It is the ability to go against our natural instincts and treat the opposite sex with respect and equality that helps define us as humans. If this movie was indeed ""the Truth"", then it seems to say we should all just give in to our primal desires for sex and make horrible choices with it. But why stop there? Why not give into our urges to murder those who invade our territory, rape at will, and lose all trace of progression and civility we have left! This is why this movie fails. Believe it or not, there are people like Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) and Mike Chadway (Gerald Butler). Really, they do exist. I have seen them, just not a daily basis. These people are the true annoying pricks and shrews. In no way does they represent society as a whole. Mike host a TV Show call 'The Ugly Truth' where he advice women into getting relationship with men by being an over-the-top misogynist. Heigl stars as the producer, Abby who disagree with Mike and try to control him every step of the way. Both make a 'battle of the sexes' deal with each other to see which idealism works on getting a relationship. How bad this movie is, obviously comes from these three women who wrote this. Like any other romantic comedy, you know deep in the end, these two would end up falling in love with other. Romantic comedies are so predictable and unrealistic. I doubt these two can ever fall in love, but in weirdest cases, it could, but most unlikely. I can never bring myself to feel for someone who has seemingly gotten themselves deeply involved with the totally wrong person only to turn 180º and abandon said person for that one true love, nor for a couple who manages to get back together after spending the entire movie hating one another, nor a case like this where both leads have such serious defects you don't want to see either one of them have that happy ending. Invariably, the audience is asked to sympathize with one or both leads. The three female screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz, Kirsten Smith, and Nicole Eastman who wrote this probably sympathized with Gerard Butler quite a bit, and make the other women leads as unsympathetic trollops as possible. Every woman in this movie, including Abby, was a shallow, dumb, selfish, or arrogant. I guess they were saying, while women might hate men; women hate other women even more. The movie never solves the real problem with Heigl's character that is that she was a control freak, she has ridiculously high standards, and she overly judgmental of the men she meets. Both just naïve fall in love. The movie mocks naive romanticism, yet in the end, the movie have naïve romanticism win out. Talk about being hypocrites here. The jokes are a hit or miss here. I do like the remote control scene at the restaurant and the odd baseball game scene, even if it's seem out of place. It wasn't that funny, but it was decent. The whole random rape joke was a miss for me. It kill the mood. Was that supposed to be funny? Both actors did a pretty good job, even if their characters are unlikeable. For a date night movie, I have to say, it didn't work. Watching this movie on a first date would be awkward. I think watching this movie will sent more people apart, then bring them together closer. I might not know that much about romantic comedy, but that's not good in this type of a genre."

","If Apatow and Meg Ryan movies had a child, it might be The Ugly Truth. Its a cookie-cutter romance filled with lots of cuss words and scatology to make it seem ""edgy"". As much as the actors want there to be more involved with the movie, the bones just aren't there, and after a few early giggles, The Ugly Truth is exposed as a poor effort.<br/><br/>The Ugly Truth opens with Heigl's character Abby as a depended-on news producer who's love life is in shambles due to her obsessive need for control (she has a checklist of ten things she expects in a man). This is only made all the more clear when she calls into a male romance show led by the a scruffled Mike Chadway (Butler), who chews her out and calls her fat. Of course, Mike is soon hired by her network as a correspondent to increase ratings. Cue shenanigans.<br/><br/>When Abby meets her new 8-packed doctor neighbour (I think he may have extra abs), she falls head over heels and is absolutely clueless how to proceed. Mike finds out and teaches Abby to treat the good doctor as a man, and no one knows men like Mike, who becomes Abby's Mr. Miyagi of men in order to get her to stop complaining about his show.<br/><br/>There is some basic truth to what Mike says. Yes, men don't like being controlled. Yes, men don't fall for personality at first sight. However, the movie works in broad strokes, and as such ends up as both male AND female chauvinistic. Mike's a pig and Abby's a bitch. Somehow through each other they get a little closer to the middle.<br/><br/>Of course, that's because the genre demands it. The movie follows the flow of rom-coms to a ridiculous extent. There really isn't much original at all going on in this plot. The ending is particularly terrible, the character shifts being far too sudden.<br/><br/>The movie has some funny bits at the beginning, with Butler playing the over-the-top pig. Unfortunately, once we get over the fact that there's some particularly nasty cuss words in a rom-com, most of the rest seems pretty stale. A half-hour of mildly-funny does not make up for a very unfunny next hour. Admittedly, there were a few unintentional laughs towards the end.<br/><br/>The actors do their best. Heigl is cute and annoying, as she should be, and has a future in these kind of movies. Butler shouldn't be wasting his time, but does what the script demands quite well. Eric Winter seems to be fit enough for the dreamy doc role, even if his face is a little creepy. Cheryl Hines and John Michael Higgins are the saving grace of the first third as the husband-and-wife co-anchors, but they quickly fall to the background after their time is up.<br/><br/>The Ugly Truth is just another entry in the wasteland of summer rom-coms, even if its one that earns an R-rating. No amount of dick jokes can make up for that."

","There are a lot of things that separate how men and women see relationships. And the end of the movie goes into a question women often ask guys : ""Why do you like me?"" . The reason is because for women liking a guy usually means he gets x/y of her checklist of requirements. That is why the more relationships a woman has the more requirements she adds to the list and the harder it is to stay with one guy too much. But us men do not really know why we like women: we either do or don't , we are simple like that. There are things we prefer in women true but is not a checklist. We can like a woman that has 0 points on that list and do not like one that has all of them.

","The Ugly Truth (2009): Dir: Robert Luketic / Cast: Katherine Heigl, Gerard Butler, Eric Winter, Bree Turner, Nick Searcy: Romantic comedy that bluntly states the obvious. In this case it regards the difference in how genders perceive each other and often make miscalculations in our judgements. Katherine Heigl produces a T.V. segment where station management insist that she accept a hardcore talk host whose views of relationships are blunt but needed for ratings. They will hate each other but ultimately arrive where viewers know it. Director Robert Luketic is backed with decent comic wit by his leads despite a screenplay that is flatter than paper. He previously made the underrated Win a Date With Tad Hamilton as well as Monster-in-Law and Legally Blonde. Heigl and Butler have superb chemistry as she reluctantly takes his advice regarding a doctor she is interested in. Butler plays off the wild antics of the daring talk show host who has wounds of his own. The ending unfortunately has them in a contrived scene involving a hot air balloon. Eric Winter as Heigl's romantic target had potential but is mainly a product of observation. Other roles are the usual flat and wasted appearances played by those hoping that this will not be their biggest career highlight. A strong message exists that points clear to a uniting of personalities when all is said and done. Score: 5 / 10"

","Truthfully, I'm not a huge fan of Gerard Butler, and I'm really not that familiar with Katherine Heigl, so I can't say that I went into this movie with particularly high expectations. But I have to confess that I was surprised. This is actually a very enjoyable movie, and at times (I'm thinking of the scene in the restaurant) it's downright hilarious. Heigl plays Abby, the uptight producer of a local Sacramento morning TV show who's always on the lookout for love but never finds it. Meanwhile, Mike (played by Butler) is the obnoxious host of an obnoxious talk show about relationships who gets hired for the morning show (against Abby's wishes) in the hopes of boosting ratings.<br/><br/>OK. You can pretty much see where this is going to end up so it can't be considered especially original, and it's true that once it takes its predictable turn (which is thankfully fairly late in the movie) it becomes rather formulaic as opposites attract and romance blossoms, etc., etc. But the story goes on for a while before that angle gets introduced, and there's a lot of fun along the way, especially as Abby and Mike first become friends and Abby tries to reinvent herself with Mike's help in order to snare a local doctor she's attracted to (who's played by Eric Winter.)<br/><br/>Yes, by the end it's quite predictable and the last 20 minutes or so become a little dull to be honest. But before then this movie does have a lot of laughs. Butler and Heigl also played their parts well and worked well together. It is at times (fairly often actually) a bit crude, so it's not for those who are looking for a sweet, innocent romance. But for a few laughs, this is worth watching. (7/10)"

Gerard Butler gave a surprisingly brilliant comedy performance and a great American accent that if you didn't know, you wouldn't realise at all that he is Scottish in real life and quite the Scottish accent too. Since ""300"" (which I think is one of his greatest acting achievements), Gerard has really shined in the film industry revealing his acting talent in big films like ""RocknRolla"" and ""How to train your Dragon"", performing a variety of characters and now this film. <br/><br/>The main actress of the film Katherine Heigl (one of those big actresses who I don't know, but my parents do for some reason) gave an equally talented performance, making it great casting for a comedy duet display. This is a film that if you saw it on paper, you wouldn't think to watch it but 'The Ugly Truth' is so crudely funny, it's good to watch with not just witty comedy, but also a glowing romantic story."

","While there are some entertaining moments in it, mostly the movie relies too much on filthy language and unflattering sexual references for its ""comedy."" For those of us who are past the juvenile stage, it just isn't funny. It becomes tiresome very quickly.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl is a TV show producer Abby Richter. She is particular and controlling, and starts out to get the ideal guy, armed with a checklist. She has so many hangups that she can't ever seem to get very far.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is Mike Chadway, a profane bachelor who comes on board at the TV station with the show ""The Ugly Truth"" which paints all men as uncaring morons who only want one thing, sex, and will do anything to get it.<br/><br/>Abby is of course appalled, but Mike gives her a challenge -- if he can tell her what to do and say to get the affections of the guy of her dreams, a handsome young doctor who lives near her, will she accept Mike? They make a deal, and all Mike's advice works. Of course she has to eventually reject the man because she has not been herself, and he will not like the real person she is.<br/><br/>Predictably (from a simple plot point of view) Mike and Abby fall in love. Not a very inventive ending to a rather poor effort at a romantic comedy that isn't really that funny, isn't really that romantic."

","Love Gerard Butler, but don't waste your time with this one. It goes for cheap, crude jokes and has very little romance. The story-line is weak and by the end you're left wondering what the two leads could possibly see in each other, because that is never more than hinted at in the story-line. Never a big fan of Ms. Heigl, I did not think her bad in 27 Dresses. To be fair, her performance in The Ugly Truth may be more a case of bad writing than bad acting. There doesn't seem to be any chemistry between her and Mr. Butler, which also hurts the movie. The ending is also one of the worst endings to a movie that I've ever seen. I hope that Mr.Butler will be more discerning in future roles. I know that I'll be less likely to watch a movie solely because he's in it."

Take note: not all guys think alike and not all ladies think alike. It is just that simple. In not so many words, that's what this movie is saying. There could never be a better title than ""The Ugly Truth."" You cannot go PG or PG-13 with this one.

This is why I am happy to inform the new romantic comedy, The Ugly Truth is no 500 Days Of Summer, but it is fun and raunchy. It is not smart, but it is thoroughly enjoyable. It is not perfect, but I had a good time. The movie stars Katherine Heigl as Abby, a TV-news producer who has some trouble with men. Enter Mike Chadway (Gerald Butler), a dirty, scheming, degrading-to-woman TV show host of a local access show called The Ugly Truth who's hired to Abby's TV station much to her disgust. Abby meets a nice, handsome surgeon named Colin (Eric Winter, who you might know from Days Of Our Lives and Brothers And Sisters.) Although Abby likes him, she doesn't know how to get him. Mike agrees to teach Abby how to flirt. Mike says if Abby can't get this guy by his methods, he'll quit. This is not your lame romantic comedy, but a funny and raunchy one. I will tell you now....these are the following appeals to guys and the following to women: guys- it's as raunchy as Old School or The Hangover...women- it's a sweet romantic comedy.

First, both Hiegl and Butler are great at their craft, and I've enjoyed both in their previous work. They could have saved this film by leaving out the 'F' word (all of them), crude references to body parts, and deleting the stupid final scene. Parts of the film ARE funny, and laugh we did, but it didn't overcome the rest.<br/><br/>If you want to see a really funny movie based on male/female relationships, I recommend Will Smith in ""Hitch"" instead.

Almost each and every dialogue between Abby (Katherine Heigl) and Mike (Gerard Butler) is filled with adult jokes or implies sexual content, but it achieves to keep it at a good quality and does not go down to a cheap level or end up in boring clichés. I for one would recommend it to all those looking for a light, fun movie anyday, just to have a good laugh (or two)."
"blamb147","4","3","6","1 January 2010"," Gender in the Ugly Truth
","The only reason this movie is not as bad as it could have been is that Butler's character comes to the realization that his gender doctrine is inaccurate, e.g. ""men are simple,"" ""men only care for women who look hot."" One of the deleted endings shows Butler confessing the partial truth of his soapbox, and this is point of the running theme in which Butler's personal history of letdown is revealed and his final hypocrisy when he realizes that he is in 'love' with Heigl's character, that is 'love' not 'lust' as the distinction is made by Butler himself on the Ferguson talkshow. My worry is that instead of a shift to something better, Butler's gender doctrine regresses from bad to worse. The conclusion of the movie, adapting the title, would be the truth is not ugly, but actually what Hollywood thought all along: bachelor sexuality is OK for a little while until monogamy and family obligations triumph.<br/><br/>What does Butler's character represent? He is an archetype for a very real masculinity although he is simply more articulate and blunt than his fellow machos about the premises of hegemonic masculinity. So Butler's character is somewhat separate from your average joe: he represents a liminal space of sexuality, neither conservative but nor is he a radical in any sense since his views conform to the heterosexual matrix. He is full of contradictions: an irresponsible womanizer yet also a traditional dad-figure--maybe there is no contradiction though...it seems the reason it is hard to pin down Butler's archetype is because he is simultaneously a provocateur who challenges social norms AND a sexist. Yet this is a position that more of us may be in, of all genders, than we like to admit."
"mexicospidergreen","6","4","11","5 August 2009"," The truth isn't pretty, but Heigel and Butler keep it far from being ugly
","The battle of the sexes begins as Butler teaches Heigel The Ugly Truth. Abby is a successful TV show producer with a perfect job and body. The only problem is she can never seem to find Mr. Right. In comes Mike, a perverted and demeaning correspondent for a TV segment called ""The Ugly Truth."" Mike willingly helps Abby land Mr. Right, but what she doesn't know is that the guy who she really likes might be the one standing in front of her all along. Though predictability and believability are the films biggest flaws, the chemistry and wit between Katherine Heigel and her co-star Gerard Butler keep it from being another run of the mill Romantic Comedy. There were many hysterical moments I found myself laughing at from slightly crude but inventive gags to scene stealing comedy by Butler himself. His perceptions on what men and women want manage to keep you on a laugh riot but are also shockingly true and honest. Heigel on the other hand plays the same role in most of her movies, but can still manage to keep a likable balance of comedy and drama between her as well. The supporting cast also sharing the spotlight (including John Michael Higgins) too managed to make me smile no matter what the situation was. For fans of Hegel's recent movies (eg: 27 Dresses) keep in mind that this is much cruder, vulgar and might not even be on the same league. Some will find the sexist stereotyping distracting and appalling but at the end it's message is that it's being who you are that matters, and that the one who likes you for who you really are (not by your looks) is the one that's right for you. All in all despite it's clichéd and predictable plot Heigel and Butler turn it into a refreshing, entertaining and welcoming rom/com."

"p-stepien","6","2","4","27 May 2013"," Crass chemistry
","Romantic comedies sometimes need so little to be somewhat successful. Here the key to success comes from the abundant chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Sam Butler, with an especially hardy performance by the latter. Uptight and rigid Abby (Katherine Heigl) works as a producer for a flailing TV morning show in Sacramento. On the verge of being cancelled it is time to experiment with extreme: the uncouth hard-hitting Mike (Gerard Butler), former host of cable programme ""The Ugly Truth"", the ultimate in-your-face reveal on relationships (churning out advice about men preferring their women to roll around half-naked in jello). Despite obvious distaste for Mike's cynical methods and views, Abby is forced to accept his brash on-screen attitude. Nevertheless, she soon finds herself taking love advice from the burly news host in a ploy to entice the 'perfect man'.<br/><br/>Despite its somewhat misogynistic pretence, fortunately introduced purely for laughs sakes, not to preach about the banality of love, ""The Ugly Truth"" works surprisingly well. Mostly due to the well-strung pairing with great comedic timing and a underlying tension bringing about colours to the story. Heigl naturally fails straight into her comfort zone of being a stringent obsessing female, but her charm is relentless. Together they form a duo that makes any shortcomings of the mannered and formulaic script fade into the background. Fortunately also several jokes are extremely well handled, even if not particularly ingenious results of brainstorming sessions. Clichés may be especially annoying, but somehow with Heigl and Butler taking centre-stage, it becomes something of an enjoyable guilty pleasure. Not an entirely memorable one, but still above average TV fodder for comedic release."
"bigl6168","6","2","4","24 May 2012"," The Ugly Truth
","""The Ugly Truth"" The ugly truth, what we all fear. In this movie, that fear is turned upside down into a funny, romantic view that surely had many heads turning. Starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler, the movie brings to light what we all choose not to acknowledge, as well as what we want, and sometimes need. Other stars in the movie include Eric Winter, Cheryl Hines, and John Michael Higgins. Produced by the producers of Legally Blonde, it was written by three women, and was a big hit in theaters. <br/><br/>The movie begins with Abby, starred by Heigl, who is a romantically challenged woman looking for 'True Love.' She reads books like Chicken Soup for the Woman's Soul, and believes truly in a 'Prince Charming.' One night, after a horrible date, her cat accidentally turns the channel to a show dubbed 'The Ugly Truth,' where Mike Chadway, or Butler, stars in making fun of love, saying it doesn't exist. To him, love is simply an intense form of lust. He explains that men don't like women because of their minds, or their money, they like them because they're willing to spread their legs! During a 'call time,' Abby calls the show and tries to throw him off-track, saying that love does exist, and he's a sexist pig. She describes her 'Prince Charming,' who happens to not exist, and Mike hangs up on her. The next day passes, and her cat jumps out a window, which Abby follows up a tree where her new neighbor, a surgeon named Colin, is dressing. Blushing brightly, she falls out of the tree and sprains her ankle, which he tends to. The next day, Mike has been hired at her news station in Sacramento, and finds out that Abby was the 'crazy caller.' They get into a debacle and it ends up with a bet. Mike bets that Abby's man is false, and if he doesn't turn out to be false, he'll quit the show and stay out of her life forever. If not, she has to admit that he was right. Weeks pass as Abby, after a makeover by Mike, dates Colin, all the while slowly falling in love with the person she thinks is a pig. During this time, Mike appears in the morning show with Larry and Georgia, Higgins and Hines, and brings 'The Ugly Truth' right to them, explaining how Georgia 'demasculines' Larry because of her success. <br/><br/>There wasn't really any special effects, other than effects from the camera, zooming in and out. There are a bunch of camera changes, however. Towards the end of the movie, it gets really intense with those in the hot air balloon, where Abby, after having finally found out she's in love with Mike, is going on about how men are big chickens, while Mike is standing there, saying she's stupid not to realize that he loves her. Finally, after saying it three times, they end the scene with a kiss, and the news station caught the whole thing on camera. <br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie would probably have to be the times where it could happen to anybody, but it isn't usually shown on television or movies. I like how it brings a whole new look to movies in general, putting a 'real' twist in things. Nowadays movies are all about fantasy and science fiction, but this movie keeps it real, with a slight romantic twist in it as well.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd give this movie three stars out of five, for the new light it brings and the way the directors kept it real, showing that everyday things can, and does, happen in love. It doesn't always need to be white horses and fairies, though they are pretty nice. Just be yourself, and love will find you, this movie states, and it wears that on it's sleeve well!<br/><br/>~Yours, Ashley Bigler"

"thesar-2","2","2","4","3 January 2010"," I'm guessing they learned the ugly truth with the box office receipts
","The ugly truth is this movie is enormously unfunny and predictable. The uglier truth is that only a handful of actors, dead or alive can pull off screwball/slapstick humor and Heigl/Butler are not on that list. The ugliest truth is that I appear to be the same man-pig Butler describes in the movie (a trait I despise) as I only watched this movie for Butler.<br/><br/>Now that's out of the way, The Ugly Truth isn't truly the worst movie I've seen, or in 2009 and it wasn't 100% unfunny. I might have laughed two times. Unfortunately, I cringed at almost all the attempts at humor or the blatant crude behavior/talk just to be like the Judd Apatow films. The difference is, Apatow is generally fresh, original, funny and actually contains a story. The Ugly Truth harbors none of these qualities. (In fact, the only similarity was Heigl, who was oodles better in Knocked Up.) We've see it all before. Uptight woman (Heigl) is looking for love, but her standards are too high. Easy-going, smart-alecky and fast talker male – with a past!, (Butler) helps said woman romance her neighbor when, you know he wants, well, it's obvious thatreally? Is this a spoiler? Roxanne anyone? Sure it mimics a hundred or more movies, plots, stories and honestly, that wouldn't be a problem if it was well executed or at least you cared about the characters. Heck, maybe you could throw in a surprise or two. Not one person did I give a second thought to, not one scene in this movie wasn't foretold; even the poster gives it away. It makes you wonder why they even tried.<br/><br/>Butler was the only saving grace. He was funny once or twice – he did have some quick moments, and it was nice to see a male be so unashamedly open and honest about what (majority of) men want. I'm sure a lot of what he was saying is true, but he blanketed the entire male population, whereas there are gay males out there who don't really care that much about breasts. (I'm sure some do, but you get my point.) And speaking of which, I guess his character and/or this movie could be described as homophobic, if I cared enough. I mean, the character is really a low-life himself, so I don't give him enough credit to worry about his anti-gay remarks.<br/><br/>As for Heigl's character, she was so predictable, literally boring and so clichéd I barely could watch her on the screen. And the secondary characters? Oh mythe neighbor looked like he belonged on Desperate Housewives, although since he's so dull, I'm sure one of them would kill him off within the first few episodes. The newscaster ""hot-n-heavy"" older couple was so incredibly over-the-top and unfunny, they were hard to look at. What were the writers thinking? That their problems are so hard to find in their marriage that TV guy's man/butch host Butler can bring them together on the air live, have them perform sexual acts in front of the audience and BOW! we'd like them or even laugh along? I'm absolutely no prude, so when it came to them making me feel uncomfortable, it wasn't about the sexual nature; it was about how incredibly bad their attempts at humor were and how far they fell. They belonged on the Mary Tyler Moore show or any 1970s sitcom – not in modern comedies.<br/><br/>I love hearing the phrase: ""If you see one movie this year"" or ""one comedy"" For this movie, you're best off if you have never, ever, in your entire life, or past life, seen a movie. Then you might enjoy it as something fresh, original, funny and surprising. However, if you've seen more than one comedy, or dramedy, then skip this one. It's just too painful to watch and I'm only guessing here: comedies aren't meant to be painful."

Everything in her life is in tight, perfect order, and that's how she likes it... she's a control freak.<br/><br/>Gerard plays Mike, the star of a local access show called ""The Ugly Truth, "" which gets picked up by her mourning show for regular episodes. This Show is aimed at men, teaching them how to pick up women and tell them what women want- however, he's got it ALL WRONG, i.e. he tells men instead of taking women on a romantic singer date, we'd prefer you take us to Jello wrestling! So, as you can guess, they butt heads!<br/><br/>Enter Eric's Colin. Abby sees her cat outside in a tree, the limb breaks outside his window, he rescues her, gives her his number. When she gets the nerve to call him from work, Mike over hears, and interferes. Now I ABHOR spoilers, so I won't be giving any away, but know that Mike plays Cyrano, and just as with Cyrano, he learns more about himself than anything, and it backfires on him.<br/><br/>Being someone who doesn't like ""Chick Flicks"" I LOVED THIS MOVIE! And if you're reading this review, that means you're considering watching the movie, so you probably like them, and will LOVE this movie too! What are you waiting for? Pop that popcorn and chill that champagne!!!"

","Producer of a local news program is forced to take on a piggish cable TV host when her ratings fall. He's supposedly an expert in what men and women really want and his inflammatory style is ratings grabber. She's both horrified and charmed. Can romance be too far away? Low brow comedy that is trying to be more than it is. Give the film points for trying to deal with men and women's baser instincts but take a few away for not always leaving the sewer. In all honesty my attitude has changed since I saw the film three or four days ago. Initially I thought this was an occasionally funny but terribly foul mouthed film was a complete failure. Since then, in the process of talking and thinking about the film I find that the film has grown a bit on me. I don't think the film is the total disaster I first thought. Now I find it to be more an foul mouthed misfire that doesn't quite work. Personally I find it interesting that any Hollywood film is dealing with the battle between high brow and low brow, especially when the whole industry is rapidly dumbing itself down. Lets face it the industry is moving more and more toward the brainless and enforcing the baser stereotypes of men and women. Here is a film about that battle. Thinking about the film after the fact I still think the humor only occasionally works, but I don't think its as mindless as I first thought. Clearly there is, or was something to the material that drew its stars to it other than the vulgarity, and I think if one looks at the finished film I think some of that is still there. Is that a thumbs up recommendation, no, but its not a total pan. I don't think you should pay 12 bucks to see it (I'm still stinging from that bad move) but I do think that if you see this on cable with a beverage of your choice you might enjoy it in a Neanderthal sort of way."

It' not like the classic romance where love was obtained the old fashion way by holding hands and using manners.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl is an uptight and by the book California TV news producer who's programs are starting to fall in ratings. Enter a new sight when one day she sees a public access program that's outspoken as the host(Gerard Butler)tells it like it is about love, life and relationships. So the TV station up and hires this loud and outspoken mouth and what do you know ratings increase! In what was a traditional and uptight controlled news cast is now a sex advice hit! The Butler character starts to give the Heigl character advice on relationships it works at first yet not with some growing pains.<br/><br/>Yet thru it all in the end it's a growing experience as each polar opposite will find their true selves and discover unexpected love. Overall this film is nothing great maybe a watch for it's sass and make believe as how many TV stations would really let the Butler character be that foul.

","The protagonists aren't ugly and the film's not truthful. Apart from that it's... well it's not great. It's a romcom that ticks all the convention and cliché boxes, never once straining from the confines of the genre. The truth here, it is claimed, is that men are simple, butt hen the 2nd half of the film goes on rather predictably to show that the protagonist who claims this is precisely capable of being the ideal man he claims doesn't exist. But as this is fairly recognisable from the outset the only remaining question is whether the journey is worth it? Not really - there's one funny scene at a baseball game which involves a gag done much better in many more films, plus a When Harry Met Sally rip-off scene that misses everything that was funny about the original film. We get the expected montage(s) and a dance scene with a total chemistry vacuum. It's not awful - i did laugh once or twice, but the overriding hypocrisy, the total dearth of chemistry between the leads, and the single dimension in which the characters are drawn makes any kind of empathy whatsoever with the protagonists nigh on impossible."

","Kathrine Heigl stars as a character that she plays a lot and Gerard Btutler stars in his best film of the year, The ugly truth. To say that this is his best movie of the year says a lot. Because I didn't think this was that great. As a matter of fact, I think you should take a pass on it. <br/><br/>Heigl, like in Knocked up, stars as a television producer named Abby. Abby's news channel hires Mike Chadway(Gerard Butler), the host of a guy's show called The ugly truth. Abby is romantically challenged. As shown on the first date she goes on. <br/><br/>She needs a little help. So Mike helps her and at first they don't like each other. To me, it seemed like they didn't like each other throughout the entire film. Except five minutes when they are in an elevator and out, and the last minute where they in a balloon.<br/><br/>As I said, Butler and Heigl do work well together while on screen. But this film has many flaws that can't quite save this movie. I like both actors,and they did well with what they had. Unfortunately, what they had wasn't all that good.<br/><br/>Am I saying that this movie is awful? No. But here are the reasons why it doesn't quite work. Both of the main characters aren't good people, I think. The ending to this movie, is predictable just by watching the trailer. The film is very foulmouthed. What am I saying? So was Superbad, everyone loved that!<br/><br/>Also, 3/4 quarters of the movie, I sat there not laughing. Vibrating panties was kind of funny but really? Like Kathrine Heigl needs help in this film, so does the film itself. It's not a horrible film as I said earlier. I can't quite give it a thumbs up. I am a little mixed on this movie.

Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl prove to have wonderful screen chemistry. Each one's presence is enhanced by the presence of the other.

Yes, some women carry checklists to which a suitor must conform to be seriously considered. But the wildly, totally absurd, delightful truth about it all, as Mike and Abby illustrate for us, is one we should all bear in mind as we navigate our personal minefields of the heart:<br/><br/>You can't hunt it down, you can't predict it, and you can't rationalize it.

The two leads really work well together and have great chemistry. There are also some pretty funny physical gags in the film. Yes, it's pretty formulaic and yes it's pretty predictable, but it's still a very enjoyable fun and often times warm hearted movie. Katherine is really just so lovable and great in her role!

","At the first sight ""The ugly truth"" goes more like a common, ordinary movie, but wait until you watch it. You can make yourself comfortable and get the portion of laughter for a whole week.<br/><br/>This movie starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler in the leading roles, creates you a much more real image of how men and women tend to think. There are two tipics, Mike Chadway the confident strong successful man and Abby the control freak who is looking for Mr. Perfect as his future life partner. How this two different personalities manage to deal with each other generates a comic bomb which is about to explode in every scene.<br/><br/>Abby, on her road of finding Mr. Perfect, makes a ""pact with the devil"", the man-whore, Mike, in which she agrees to follow his playing rules to get the big pot, a well ranked doctor who lives across the street, in hope of getting rid of Mike who is messing her job. Here starts the variety of comical situation in which Abby is the one that always end up bad.<br/><br/>The director, Robert Luketic, made a great choice for the actors and that is the reason why the movie is a different one, because you'd never expect to see ""Butler the Warrior"" in a romantic comedy, wouldn't you? Moreover all the other characters fit perfect their roles and create the battle field for the main actors.<br/><br/>This film is good for all ages because it provides you a clearer way of thinking and it also makes you see the truth in how men think and what they really want at the end of the day. Women are not described as better creatures, Heigl is doing a great job interpreting that kind of woman that you'd always find as being a part of you.The ending is the problem because is written in that American prototype and doesn't alway fit the reality; the ones that tend to be so predictable that at the 90 minute you stop watching the movie. However it's worthed to see it all, for the good as gold lines of the characters and for the ugly truth that is about to be revealed at the end."

","At the start of the movie, one of several terrible songs is played. These songs represent a musical style that is apparently either enjoyed by Katherine Heigl or by her fans.<br/><br/>Abby is the uptight yet attractive producer of a morning news program, though in recent years the program has become mostly fluff, something Abby does not approve of.<br/><br/>While she is watching TV at home, Abby's cat D'Artagnan accidentally switches the channel and Abby finds herself watching Mike, a man with outrageous (though not unusual for men) opinions about relationships between men and women. It could be worse; one of his competitors says things like ""No really means yes"".<br/><br/>Mike takes calls from viewers, so Abby calls and gives him a piece of her mind. Mike also figures out what Abby's ideal man would be.<br/><br/>The next morning Abby is shocked to find Mike at her TV station as the newest member of the cast of her TV show. His segment will be called ""The Ugly Truth"".<br/><br/>D'Artagnan helps Abby find her ideal man. When the kitty gets trapped up in a tree, Abby must go rescue him. When Abby gets hurt trying to get out of the tree, she is rescued by her new neighbor Colin, a doctor who is everything Abby wants. Abby turns into a giggling teenager. The next day at work, she is her uptight self again, but with prettier hair.<br/><br/>Mike helps Abby prepare to date Colin. She needs to do a lot to make herself pretty, including buying new clothes. At this point it becomes clear that although Abby absolutely despises Mike, we surely believe that by the end of the movie she will end up with either Mike or Colin.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mike does so well it is possible his show will go national and Abby will have to find a replacement.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl does a very good job. At first, she is too hard to like and I find myself not even caring what will happen to her. She's not even good looking. Later, she is gorgeous and even easy to like. The fact that she can go from uptight rhymes-with-witch to a giggling teenager helps a lot.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is a challenge to like (I would have preferred a Tim Allen type) but he's just right for the role. As a guy I would find myself liking his wild ideas on women. But even I found myself sort of hoping he would get the girl rather than Colin.<br/><br/>I know Nick Searcy best as the Frank Burns type head of security on the time travel series ""Seven Days"". Here, he is much easier to like and does quite a good job as Abby's boss.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie it had a TV-PG rating with a D for dialogue, though some of the sexual humor is quite potent, and I would definitely not call this a family film. I did like one gag involving a product one would buy at a store selling sex toys. Seeing this movie helped me get a joke I heard recently on TV's ""Rules of Engagement"". <br/><br/>Of course, the movie follows a formula, but I like the formula. The challenges are silly and we do ride an emotional roller-coaster, but everything will be all right in the end, right?<br/><br/>I actually think the truth is quite pretty."

","I am currently taking a class where we are asked to watch many varieties of movies and recently a friend of mine recommended I watch the movie, ""The Ugly Truth"", a romantic comedy and I must say this movie is by far my favorite from this genre of movies. The films main characters consist of a successful women TV producer named Abby Richter (Katherine Hiegl) who recently got news that her TV station was getting horrible reviews and if they didn't go up soon they would have to cancel the show. It was then that the Abby's boss decided to bring in a fresh new piece to their show which brings us to Mike Chatway (Gerard Butler) who at the time worked for a late night call in show giving advice to women in his opinion of what men want. Here is where Abby first sees Mike and winds up calling in to tell him off because she thinks his vulgar opinions are obscured. It is then the next day that it is announced that the new addition to the show Abby produces is going to him. It is here where the theme begins. The theme of this movie is the battle of man versus women. All throughout the movie these two battle it out with Mike with his charm and vulgarity and Abby with her intellectual smarts and control freak personality. It is then when Abby meets a guy who she believes is perfect and when I mentioned control freak earlier she has a check list of the perfect guy for her. This is when Mike comes into play and shows Abby how to win the guys over or in other words shows her what guys really want. While Abby was hesitant to think that Mike even had the least bit of clue what he was talking about in the end he was right. Mike winds up coaching Abby all the way into her dream guys arms and in this process his vulgar wit and charm and her smart snappy comebacks keep you laughing the whole way through."

","The Ugly Truth tells the story of Mike (Gerard Butler) a host of a TV show of the same name, in which he bluntly tells single women that the crap of prince charming they believe in and the advice they get from self-help books won't help to get them a boyfriend. After moving to a new TV network, Mike meets his producer Abby (Katherine Heighl), who initially hates him, then tolerates him for the sake of the ratings, and ends becoming buddy with him to get her the love of her hot neighbor.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that the script uses all topics and tips that self- help books offer to women, even though Mike states in his program that he's against them. In other words, there is an absolute incongruity between what the character of Mike preaches and what the script does. I could not be otherwise since this is a romantic comedy targeted to women. A pity that, by doing so, treats the viewer as if we were all blind idiots.<br/><br/>The most daring element of the film is that it is a romantic comedy where sex and sexual vocabulary are explicit and unsweetened. Said, this, there is not one single nude sex scene (actually just one sex scene), and even the orgasm scene is more comic and tasteless than daring. More unexpected than daring I would say. If you want to do something really provocative go all the way, with all the consequences.<br/><br/>The leading couple, played by the always charming and hot Butler and the ultra-feminine Heighel, has a great chemistry on camera. However, their individual performances are uneven. Heighel starts the film overacting and she's not believable in her role until midway the film. On the contrary, Butler has a surprising easiness for romantic comedies, and plays his role with charm and cheekiness; in fact, he's perfect for this sort of roles, although he seems to be choosing bad quality movies that don't showcase his talent, but melt it away.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining and has some funny scenes, but is full of stereotypes both in the script as in the drawing of the characters, and mediocre acting overall, which really ruins the whole thing."

","A complete middle-of-the-road attempt. For a movie with an R rating one would think there'd be some nudity, but it was just for language. Even the jello-wrestling girls kept their bikinis on. Gerard Butler doesn't really come off as funny, just as crass and trite, which is fine as I suppose that was his character. But, if he was doing this movie to show he's a comic actor, then he didn't really hit the mark. Also, he should have used his own accent; he'd have been more appealing. It was weird listening to him try to sound American. Katherine Heigl is beautiful and I was hard pressed to believe she was ""turning guys off"" or unable to get a date. It was OK; not worth watching twice."

","Here we go again. Another one of those movies that have been done a bazillion times already. Granted, it had it's funny bits but overall the whole thing just felt so darn clichéd.<br/><br/>So here's the basic storyline. A pretentious woman looking for true, passionate love and a guy who's a complete jerk and believes men only care about looks of a woman, hate each other. But wait, what's this? After a bunch of random bullcrap they end up together! Did you see that coming? I mean, who would've thought? Oh right, just about anyone who's seen romantic comedies before. Yes, just kill any shred of potential this movie had by destroying the plot line and making it generic romcom ending no.992. Most other characters excluding these 2 are basically props and add nothing to the story. The basic argument of the whole movie is 'men are afraid of love' and 'women are control freaks'. Ah, just shut the hell up with your dumb morals and just give us a decent funny movie. Oh, that can't happen because just about everything in Hollywood has to go by the dumb rulebook. Yes, never try to be original, always repeat what has been done and be very predictable.<br/><br/>Like I said before, some of the jokes are good but most of them have been already done so they felt pretty bland. Even in the good jokes, none really stood out. This is a very forgettable movie and is definitely not worth watching because of a few decent jokes. Unless you're a big romcom buff, avoid. That's the real ugly truth."

However, the reviews have been Luke warm and negative, and I wanted to see the film anyway and was not disappointed. I loved the romantic conflicts which are set up in the story, and the chemistry between Heigl and Butler is fantastic. I also loved the realism of the dialog in this film and the way it is utilized for character development and moves the story forward.

"Psyche-8","8","2","7","25 August 2009"," When Pygmalion met Doris Day
","There's no denying it. 'The Ugly Truth' is yet another predictable rom-com where you can see the ending coming a mile off. But then it's films like this that you watch for the journey rather than the destination, and 'The Ugly Truth' differs somewhat from other rom-coms in that it's ruder and more sexual in nature.<br/><br/>Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a successful T.V. producer for a morning show in Sacramento. Faced with falling ratings, her boss decides to pep things up by hiring outspoken Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler), host of 'The Ugly Truth' a late night show where Mike shares tips and personal anecdotes in an attempt to dispel common 'myths' about relationships. Abby clashes with Mike immediately, seeing him as arrogant, outspoken, chauvinistic and the complete opposite of her idea of the ideal man that she believes she's found in her handsome neighbour Colin (Eric Winter). In turn, Mike thinks Abby is a control freak but his highly accurate insights into her personality further serve to infuriate Abby, and the two bicker constantly. Nevertheless, Mike is a ratings winner which leads Abby to reluctantly accept his advice about how to attract Colin. Mike begins to instruct Abby in what to wear, what to say and how to act around Colin. The plan works and Colin and Abby begin dating but Mike has developed feelings for Abby in the process and is jealous. Sure enough, against her better judgement and in spite of her relationship with Colin, Abby finds herself falling for Mike. Who should she choose? <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this non-demanding film. Other reviews have mentioned Doris Day films, most likely for the'I can't stand him' becoming 'I can't resist him' plot, but in my opinion 'The Ugly Truth' owes more to 'Pygmalion' or 'My Fair Lady' with the creator falling in love with his creation. In this case, Mike 'creates' his ideal woman in Abby and falls for her. Katherine Heigl plays the same nice girl she plays in 'Knocked Up' and '27 Dresses' (but then hey, I like that nice girl and it works for her). Meanwhile, Gerard Butler simply sizzles as Mike, oozing with masculinity and charisma next to the good-looking but rather asexual Colin. You can totally understand that while Abby is attracted to Colin with her head (as he possesses all the qualities she thinks she wants in her ideal man), her heart and body are drawn to Mike. The two leads spar nicely throughout the film and the sexual tension between them continues to bubble before boiling over completely when the two share a sexy dance and afterwards a passionate kiss (two of the best scenes in the film during which you truly believe that these two people are crazy for each other). Plus, the ending was a bit of a departure from the usual rom-com – while you normally see the couple walk off into the sunset together, you hardly ever get to see what they do once they get there if you know what I mean! Loved it.<br/><br/>The other characters in the film were so-so and had little to do as this is very much Heigl and Butler's show, but the chemistry between the two leads was spot on and made the film for me.<br/><br/>I'll definitely be getting this one on DVD."

","I'm a kind of guy that is not into the mushy, romance, chick-flick stuff like ""You've Got Mail"", ""The Lake House"", ""The Notebook"", etc. The only chick-flick that I can sit through was ""What Women Want"" With Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. I thought that move was pretty good! Then ""The Ugly Truth"" came along and while I was watching the trailer of this film I thought to myself, ""Is this the next funniest chick-flick of 2009?""<br/><br/>The film is about a TV news producer, name Abby (Katherine Heigel), that is juggling with her career and her personal sex life but both in jeopardy because of her uptight, strict personality. The only person that can help her, but despises him, is a raunchy TV personality host name Mike Chadway (King Leonidas...Whoops! I mean Gerad Butler). Mike teaches Abby what guys want in a girl inside and out in order to win her ""Mr. Right"" and that the same time, he keeps the ratings up in her TV program. Then, the raunchy comedy continues...<br/><br/>Back to asking myself the previous question, ""Is this the next funniest chick-flick of 2009?"" Well my answer is YES! This movie will make you laugh and laugh and laugh! Mostly, all the crude sex jokes that you heard in your life is all crammed into this film and you'll just keep begging for more. It's cute, humorous, wacky, and most-of-all fun! Their hasn't been a chick-flick like this since ""What Women Want"" in my opinion. My advice, bring your boyfriend/girlfriend to this one and he/she won't regret it!"

","If you want a clue as to who's going to end up with whom in THE UGLY TRUTH, listen for this line of dialog (""Tap-water is great!"") and you shouldn't go wrong. What else do you need to know for deciding whether to see this movie? Well, one of the most important considerations for many (after the ""little surprises"" tucked away in the recent American wide-release movies FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, OBSERVE AND REPORT, and BRUNO, to name just three) is that there is NO MALE FRONTAL NUDITY here (flaccid or otherwise). Furthermore, though much of the plot revolves around sex and sex advice, the dialog can be described best as ""tastefully raunchy"" or ""polite smut,"" as compared to the total gross-outs aimed for by the Judd Apatow-Seth Rogen crowd. Therefore, if you and your date want something in the mainstream of modern sensibilities which is unlikely to leave you cringing, give this short but sweet romantic comedy a go."

","26 July 2009. This romantic comedy had two gut wrenching bully laugh scenes along with a more in your face sexist look at the differences between men and women which in some ways could be closer to the truth than more ""enlightened"" people may want to admit. There are layered characters, not two-dimensional ones in this movie and by the ending credits we are provided with the authentic, honesty moral of relationships in this predictable but entertaining movies. It is understandable why most critics didn't have much positive to say, but this politically-incorrect sexist comments have at their core some resonance in how men and women actually feel and think. Interestingly the weakest scene seemed to be the more anticipated, highly expected interview on a late night show which didn't really seem to come off consistently with the tone of the rest of the movie. This is a movie that actually says what many of us want to say, but are afraid to admit, but also enlightens the mass audience with some actual relational truths by the end of the movie. Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler do have their own chemistry and there is a hidden playfulness that comes out that for some critics might seem childly crude, but in many respects is so real. 8/10."
"bayisatool","4","1","3","19 March 2014"," just what I expected
","I am a sucker for rom coms. I am aware that many like this one are not very good. They all draw from a short list of popular clichés and then they mix them up and cast the movie with the ""it"" girl of romantic comedies at the moment. The clichés featured in this movie are, but not limited to; the chauvinistic man whore who acts the way he does because he was hurt, the liar revealed, the bickering couple who ""secretly"" love each other, and topped off with a cheesy public outburst to declare their love. The result is a generic rom com that will disappoint the film critic. I enjoyed this movie because I knew exactly what it was going to be when I saw it. Sometimes I enjoy predictable movies because I don't want a surprise. I enjoy knowing what is going to happen throughout the movie. It's like eating a frozen pizza or a hot pocket. You know it's not very good for you, some would even debate whether it is actual food, but sometimes you can't help but enjoy a substandard meal because it is a guilty pleasure. For me that is what this movie feels like. Nothing in this movie is spectacular and some of the things in this movie are down right awful. That being said I don't regret seeing the movie and enjoyed it despite its many many flaws."

But will his experiments help her find love, or is she just a hopeless case? <br/><br/>The film also has some good supporting cast members with Cheryl Hines, Bree Turner, and the actress who plays Shirley from ""Community"".<br/><br/>There is some pesky cinematography, with a cliché use of cameras circling people in conversation. And a really bad hot air balloon scene. Most of the time it is standard with nothing of note -- not surprising, as no romantic comedy has ever been made by a notable director or cinematographer.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler's character is harsh, crude and somewhat immature, but as the host of his own show, he is actually fairly accurate. In some ways, he is the more rational version of Tom Cruise from ""Magnolia"". And what a deal, too, since Butler is the discount version of Russell Crowe. Although I was somewhat shocked at times, I liked the male lead.<br/><br/>Another reviewer talks about Heigl: ""Despite her big talk about portrayals of women in film, she returns again and again to gender stereotypes that are so formulaic they make me cringe."" This review is becoming standard, with Heigl speaking out about one-dimensional women (whom she calls ""shrews"") while still starring in romantic comedies, which are the epitome of films pushing flat female characters.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert says ""the comedy bogs down in relentless predictability and the puzzling overuse of naughty words."" He also finds it amazing that ""this raunchy screenplay was written by three women.""

"bob the moo","Null","1","3","22 August 2010"," Fairly generic and obvious but still passable on a sort of genre level
","The Ugly Truth is summed up by the poster which sees the two stars leaning and turning their bodies away from one another in the time-honoured way that suits a film that has no intention of doing anything new or challenging but rather just turning out what the viewer expects. So it is that two people who initially hate each other are forced by a plot device to spend time together – I wonder if it is possible that they will somehow fall for each other at some point? No, surely not, I mean they clearly dislike each other from what I can see.<br/><br/>And so it goes. Anyone who cannot see where the film is going within 5 minutes (or even just the poster) has simply never seen a film in this genre before – because it does almost exactly what you expect from start to finish. Along the way we have comic misunderstandings that are as basic as they are elaborately set up and of course a general emerging chemistry developing – none of which will be a surprise to the vast majority of viewers. The plot is secondary to the comedy though and in this way the film does have a certain obvious charm to it thanks mainly to the enthusiasm of Heigl in the lead role. She is likable and she commits to delivering the material and really does sell it in the most part. It is a shame that the supporting cast (including several famous faces) could not have been better used to deliver lots of side laughs to strengthen the film, but they were still reasonably good.<br/><br/>Butler overplays his ""gruff real man"" role, slurping his coffee quickly used as a character shorthand – stuff like that. I didn't really like him that much and I don't really see the appeal – nor did I think he worked particularly well with Heigl, although this was perhaps down to the base material more than just his performance. He does what the material asks of him though, so in regard I guess he is OK for the film. As I said, seeing people like Hines, Higgins, Brown and others not really given the material to work with was a shame – normally a cast is populated with people like this so they can provide colour and one-liners in the background to help provide a sort of comedy base for the main plot and cast, this wasn't really the case here.<br/><br/>So The Ugly Truth does just what you expect it to do across a film filled with the elaborate and unlikely comedy situations that you can see coming and often hope don't arrive. It is not a particularly good film but it is not a bad one – just about doing enough to provide the easy, undemanding and instantly forgettable genre fill that the majority of viewers will have come to it for."

In Abby we see a controlling women that scares men away, and furthermore, she has a hopeful view of finding a perfect guy someday. In Mike, we have someone running from any entanglements and seeking conquests. He has a negative view of women but still wants sex with them. He presents and ugly view of relationships, but has a sense of how to fix them to get to win win. As a side project, he helps Abby become the woman that men desire. But at the same time, she becomes someone she is not comfortable being. We also find out along the way, that Mike's negative view of women was forged by numerous negative experiences he has had in relationships with women.<br/><br/>The final step to bring the movie to its very predictable end, is that Abby must lose her dreams and Mike lose his pre-conceived notions and take a risk based on the feelings they have developed for each other."

I learned so much more from this movie than I ever could have from getting advice from my best friends or from people who have been in relationships before.<br/><br/>Abby (Katherine Heigl) is a producer for a morning show who has this list of qualities that she would like in a man. Mike (Gerard Butler) is this rude TV star on his own show called ""The Ugly Truth."" Abby's boss ends up hiring Mike to work on the morning show because they need a way to boost their ratings. Abby is absolutely livid about this because she finds Mike to be obnoxious and that he does not understand the idea of relationships at all.<br/><br/>Mike tries to show Abby that he has serious expertise in relationships by helping her land her ""perfect"" guy.

Well apparently Mike's advice is helping boost Abby's love life drastically because she lands this ""amazing"" guy.<br/><br/>The Ugly Truth is a wonderful portrayal of the actualities of relationships with hilarious memorable lines. Heigl and Butler work so well together that you would actually think it was not a movie and you were watching real life. Their characters really help to balance each other out in their beliefs and their portrayals of the male and female genders. Though I found the movie to be hilarious and even a guy friend of mine said he enjoyed the movie, there were times that it contradicted itself which really bothered me. They showed the truth of relationships but they also showed an exception to what really happens at the end. It was a predictable ending that I did not really enjoy as much as I would have if it was something that was not as classic in a romantic comedy."
"KineticSeoul","7","1","4","11 November 2009"," Yep I can handle ""The Ugly Truth""
","Now I liked this romantic comedy, it was cliché at times and if you seen the trailer for this movie the chances of you knowing how just about everything is going to go down is pretty high, but still it is ambiguous and entertaining romantic comedy. Okay so Abby(Katherine Heigl) is producer of a local morning show in Sacramento, California. But she is a control freak and shallow which tends to turn most males off. Now I will say I don't particularly like Katherine Heigl as an actress but she actually fit in quite well with her role in this one. Anyways the ratings for the show starts to decrease, which isn't a surprise and the owner of the station decide to go in a different direction by hiring a brash talk show host Mike(Gerard Butler) who is a expert on male and female interaction and also the epitome of a alpha male. And Gerard Butler was just perfect in his role, even if his character is a know it all sleaze bag, but the thing is he is still likable and in this one even when he claims that he doesn't know romance or love, but that he is a master at lust and manipulation. Actually Gerard Butler is likable in just about every film he is in. So Mike takes up the offer to reprise his late-night call-in program ""The Ugly Truth"" for the station. And the battle of the sexes begins between Mike and Abby, and they have some good chemistry together with some good dialogue mixed in while Abby tries to have a affair with her neighbor who she thinks is her ideal guy. But since most guys have difficult time having a affair with Abby which isn't that shocking, Mike makes a bet with Abby and gives her advice on how to please her so called ideal guy. And while doing this Mike and Abby start to bond with each other. Now like I said, it's a predictable romantic comedy but I enjoyed it, it is wicked fun even if the ending seemed to be really rushed. It's a romantic comedy that both sexes will enjoy and have a good time with, it was just simply satisfying.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Former model Katherine Heigl is a beautiful young woman with real comedic talent as an actress as evidenced by her performance in ""Knocked Up"", but it's a mystery why she should want to take a role which presents such a one-dimensional, utterly anal character as television producer Abby and a total enigma how such a sexist script could come from three women and Heigl herself could be one of the (eleven) producers.<br/><br/>At least the unreconstructed male with whom she stars and spars - Gerard Butler as relationship 'expert' Mike - is given some back story to excuse his Neanderthal behaviour, but Abbey's persona is utterly inexplicable.<br/><br/>There are some funny bits - especially the restaurant scene - but too much of the script is coarse and crude.

","Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a seriously uptight TV producer. Her show is bombing in the ratings and she scares away any guy she dates. Then she is forced to add sexist, out-spoken Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) who gives advice on ""The Ugly Truth""--a short segment where he tells the truth about relationships. Abby hates him but the ratings soar. To make peace Mike tells Abby he'll help her get handsome Colin (Eric Winter). If she does she backs off. She agrees and gets Colin and then the predictable complications ensure.<br/><br/>OK--I KNEW who this was going to end 15 minutes in but I STILL loved it! It starts off great with Katy Perry's ""Hot N Cold"" roaring out during the opening credits and just keeps getting better! Heigl is gorgeous and an excellent actress. She nailed all the comedy completely. Butler--all hot and handsome--matches her perfectly and the interplay between them really works. I heard they got along great on the set and it shows. Eric Winter is charming and handsome but the guy is (purposely) not given much to work with. The script is sharp, moves quickly and has plenty of funny moments. What I like most is the script has VERY frank adult sexual talk--it doesn't dumb it down to a PG-13. It's rare to get an R rated romcom aimed at adults these days! My only complaint is Heigl's character is treated a bit TOO cruelly at times (especially in a pantie sequence). That's why I'm only giving it an 8 but it's still well worth seeing."

The advice that Gerald Butler gives is humorous but also true to some point. Katharine Heigl is really funny, I love her, she was great in 27 Dresses, another pretty good chick-flick. Both of the main actors do an incredible job for what they were given, yes it could have been better. It's funny because normally my husband like most guys, don't really care for chick-flicks, and he said he'd love to watch it again.

Katherine counter acts as Abby, the award-winning producers of a news show, that hires Mike.<br/><br/>Abby decides to use Mike as a date guru on the terms, if his advice helps her, they work together side-by-side, and if the advice doesn't work, he quits.<br/><br/>I find myself even more so amazed that Gerard is able to play another versatile role and being unrecognizable. He is such like an amoeba changing his appearance with each movie and being something completely different from his last film.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the two stars is quite incredible to watch. Unlike The Proposal, a similar themed movie, Katherine and Gerard have better chemistry than Bullock and Reynolds, and the comedy is not playing awkwardness. The comedy is sarcasm, witty banter and ultimately the hilarious truth.<br/><br/>It's well cast, well written, well acted and everything goes perfectly together.

So is it a spoiler to say the inevitable will happen here too? <br/><br/>I don't think so, but just to make sure, I put the spoiler tag up there. Gerard Butler delivers a very good performance and together with Katherine Heigl they elevate the stuff they have to work with. The realization of both that they actually love each other works and even the silly ""tap water"" thing moment does somehow work ... I mean if you think about it, it's pretty lame ... tap water a sign of love, really? <br/><br/>The ending is fine, too, although the very last scene, was a bit too much.

","... based on some of the reviews here, and also on the fact that I've seen a number of critically panned movies that I liked quite a bit, but I have to agree with the pros here. I didn't find this movie to be particularly funny or romantic, and certainly nothing original (which isn't necessarily a reason to dislike a film). There was some laughter sporadically in the theater where I attended, but many of the jokes fell really flat, and what was supposed to be funny was met with complete silence (even my girlfriend didn't laugh as much as she normally does). ""P.S. I Love You"" was a much better romantic effort from Butler, and I haven't really liked Heigel much since her film about the Special Olympics (can't remember the name off-hand).<br/><br/>For me, ""The Proposal"" was a much better effort than this, and I'm looking forward to ""Couple's Retreat"" to pull me out of the rom-com doldrums. Hopefully it lives up to it's previews. I don't recommend ""The Ugly Truth."""

The protagonist in the film, plays a person who tells the Ugly truth about dating. In the end, he was right. The movie's message was about if one has a check list for the perfect mate, and he or she has to fit his or her mode then the relationship will not last; I see this thesis as the Ugly truth about love. The movie had a few funny parts, and a few Amerian Pie style humor in it. In the end, I would give The Ugly Truth a six out of ten. I think my wife would give the movie eight out of ten.

"siderite","8","1","7","4 October 2009"," Better than what I expected
","The problem with romantic movies is that they are plagued by recipes and formulas, relentlessly walking the same path until nothing remains but a dusty, barren, tasteless thing. And then they reinvent themselves, making fun of their former selves, like high school children entering a new phase and then dismissing anyone not sharing their view. But somehow, romcoms always get back to the same idea, like the tail eating snake.<br/><br/>This one started as these 2.0 types, with the manly type showing a control freak beauty the ways of true love. And then it went the usual way. The thing is that Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler really had chemistry (even if I dislike the chick personally) and then the whole thing kind of made some sense. And I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>And then the clichés started butting in where they had no business doing so. Somehow, there must be a guy with a cliché checklist for romantic comedies and he insisted that at least half of them should be checked by any movie. Something like a romcom MPAA, maybe?<br/><br/>Bottom line: I rated the movie high because it really was better than the crap in the genre. But it could have been so much better without some of the obvious, shoddy scenes in it. Less is better sometimes! So, the final feeling was of disappointment, as the whole thing held so much promise and yet, it ended up just another romcom."

"ArizWldcat","5","1","7","2 August 2009"," Not wonderful, but not totally horrible, either.
","After listening to and reading many, many negative reviews from (of course) male movie critics, my expectations for this film were extremely low. The same critics who loved Borat and Knocked Up and Superbad are now complaining that THIS movie is ""too crude"". Since no one brought excrement to a dinner table in THIS film, I am thinking that this one isn't nearly as disgusting (or mean!!) as Borat (which I will admit I haven't seen...after hearing about that scene, I didn't want to). But I digress. The other reviewer who mentioned that certain critics just can't handle mixed genre films must be right...my view is that it's okay (to the male critics) for ""guy"" movies, or movies sold as straight comedies (The Wedding Crashers comes to mind) to have crude language, but if a ""chick flick"" has bad language, then it's disgusting. I don't get it. I DID think much of the dialog in this movie was unnecessarily crude. However, I didn't think it was the worst film I've ever seen. I do think I enjoyed it more than ""The Proposal"". I am a fan of Katherine Heigl (I loved 27 Dresses), and Gerard Butler. Another wee criticism I have for this movie is that I just don't understand why they felt the need to HIDE Butler's accent. Why not just let him be Scottish? It was distracting to hear him slip into his natural dialect. I found myself wishing they'd just had him speak in his normal voice. I also enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would."
"snowball-15","8","1","7","26 July 2009"," Not bad at all.
","I was surprised that it was getting panned by the critics. I guess most of them like their comedies to be firmly in one category without any suspicious genre mixing. This movie tries to marry romantic comedy with crass male oriented one. I thought that it actually was not that bad at all. The fact that the main male character, played by Gerard Butler, spews lots of crude stuff about men wanting only sex and not wanting gals to behave needy, is nicely balanced in the end, when he himself falls for the Katherine Heigl's character, even though he knows her to be not the natural pleaser and admitted control freak. The plot works because most of the stuff Mike (Butler) spews is for shock entertainment, although it does contain some universal grains of truth. Like men fall in love with their eyes first and only then discover the inner qualities of the ladies. Like no one likes being criticized, especially in the beginning of the relationship. That sex is important. In the end, both main characters are very decent human beings making some silly mistakes (ok, the gal makes most of them, but I am not offended, she found the guy who cared for her despite all the tough talk) and getting in some funny situations. Both have been in the situations the viewers can relate to, being hurt in previous relationships and having tough time finding the right person. It was not the best comedy I have ever seen, but it was highly enjoyable."

It's good to floss every day. Tall women dating short men is a little uncomfortable. It's not smart to take the liberty of printing out your date's profile or talking points then present them during dinner on your first date. Women love cats. Men love dogs. Men are simple and cannot be trained. It's good to exercise sometimes. Women love to fantasize with men. Katherine is not ugly, at all. No one watches intimate profiles of the mayor. Eavesdropping's okay. Men like a woman on top, just kidding. It's polite to knock. Men love local public access television programming. Women tend to get angry and bitter. Sex is healthy for you. Keep the doors closed so a bird doesn't fly in the office. The truth's offensive. Men and women wouldn't even speak if not for social pressure, status, and sex. Women are funnier than men. It's no big deal to say erection on network television. A married man and woman news anchor team is good for ratings. I love Bree Turner. Answering machines are old school. You're supposed to always be mean to 25 year old girls who think they're hot and can get any guy they want, NOT 14 year old girls. Blondes have more fun.

Men aren't smart enough. Men love naked weather girls. Bad dreams aren't real. Katherine and Gerald are funny together. Women shouldn't listen to men's bad dating advice and should do exactly the opposite of what they say. Women tend to get desperate. Women know about mature emotions and deep abiding love and men know about lust, seduction and manipulation. Men and women work well together. Men are predictable. Women never criticize even if it's constructive because men are incapable of growth, change, or progress, for men self-improvement ends at toilet training and laugh at whatever he says even if what he says isn't funny, that's irrelevant because a fake laugh is like a fake orgasm, it's not good but a fake orgasm is better than no orgasm at all. Men are very visual. Women's choice in clothing makes a statement. All men are perverse. It's a woman's responsibility to inspire an erection, it's not his job. Katherine has a beautiful face, and a super hot bod. Women don't know how to flirt, and men can't handle it when they actually do. Katherine turns me on, there's no maybe about it. Women love baseball. Women tend to be clumsy. Katherine Heigl is sweet. It's okay to talk about sex to children. Primates are very intelligent. Women love men who are good with children. Gerald and Katherine are sexy together. It's fun to picture the opposite sex when you masturbate. Love starts from within.

","I mean sure, it's a big, fat, moist ball of cliches, but despite the opinions of the current social climate hypocritical language & intent nazis, it's fricking hilarious, smart, charming and a subtly and nearly flawless examination and commentary on the interaction between romantic and potential romantic partners. The leads, Heigl & Butler have genuine chemistry and the affection between the two is apparent quickly. They are both a complete surprise to each other, proving again that it's lunacy and incredibly shallow to judge a book by it's cover. Yeah, the dialogue is raw. Once upon a time so was the reality. Social change is needed, and as a son, nephew, cousin, brother and father, any abuse directed at a woman/girl enrages me and compels violence in my heart. The #MeToo movement, in it's intent and heart is long overdue but is being undermined by extremists of a different sort than the standard issue creep. I'm not going to point fingers but I'm certain that everyone knows of what I speak. It's tragic that a significant portion of males are misogynistic toolbags and have no business being anywhere near anyone let alone a creature as complicated and wonderful as your average female walking amongst us. It's dangerous and emotionally and psychologically crippling to see the world in black and white. You automatically lower your potential for growth through basic human interaction immediately by limiting the field, platonically and romantically. We need to make sure that policies and attitudes are in place to insure that the abuses of the past cannot be repeated and although it's challenging it can and hopefully will be done. In lockstep with that change there needs to be social dialogue between everyone who might be reasoned with that it couldn't hurt us all to recover some of our humor and find a balance between keeping the scumbags at bay and yet also not being too rigid and paranoid that you make yourself unable to enjoy a joke, have a sense of humor. This film isn't perfect but it's a simplistic role model for that balance and quite frankly I miss the girls I used to be friends with, amazing ladies that gave as good as they got and actually usually got the best of men in our hilarious verbal light saber duals. Interesting, intelligent, sharp women and girls who wouldn't take crap from anyone and could easily handle your basic everyday creep and use their remarkable wit and words to make him regrets his shallowness and ignorance and hopefully felt inspired to do the work to be able to engage with the opposite sex or any potential partners with respect, empathy and sometimes crass and vulgar silliness providing everyone with mutually beneficial laughs in an ever darkening and stupid world. See the movie!! Lighten up!! Fight for what's right but stop taking yourselves so seriously because you're missing out on a complete and fulfilling experience with another person by employing a linear unforgiving baseline of expectations to and for your relationships. We need to smack the creeps down every time, so hard they never come back but we also very much need each other and need to enjoy each other and hopefully have some genuine if not always clean laughs along the way. The Ugly Truth is funny and if you don't laugh then I kinda think that maybe it's not the movie that's rude and wrong headed, it's you."
"Gideon24","4","0","2","30 November 2015"," Katherine Heigl sucks
","For those who wonder why Katherine Heigl's so-called movie career was such a bust might want to check out a tiresome 2009 comedy called The Ugly Truth.<br/><br/>The title of the film is the title of a cable access show that takes the male outlook at relationships, hosted by a sexist and obnoxious guy named Mike (Gerard Butler) who has been hired to beef up the ratings of a Sacramento morning talk show and finds himself going head to head with the show's tightly-wound producer (Heigl).<br/><br/>It was way too many so-called romantic comedies like this one that killed Heigl's film career. Filmmakers seem to have wanted Heigl to be sort of a contemporary Doris Day who men lust after but have to work REALLY hard at melting her icy exterior. Unfortunately, unlike Doris Day, Heigl's movie characters are usually bitchy and unlikable and you find yourself scratching your head trying to figure out what the leading man sees in her and this film is no exception.<br/><br/>Nicole Eastman and Karen McCullah's screenplay is overly cute and director Robert Luketic tries to disguise this by having all the characters speak 100 MPH so that the viewer doesn't really notice how lame the story really is. Gerard Butler appears to be having a ball here, but that doesn't necessarily make it a great performance and his chemistry with Heigl is non-existent. There are a pair of funny supporting performances by John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines as the co-hosts of the show, who are also married off-screen, but unless you live for Butler or Heigl, I'd give this one a pass."
"Seraphion","6","0","1","28 August 2014"," A suggestion-less suggestive movie
","The movie's main theme is really directly depicted in the suggestive nature of the scenes. The comedy is full blown geared up for mature audiences. I like to compare this movie to Hitch (2005). I think that this is quite the opposite of Hitch, especially on the methods and the conflicts the two movies presented. But The Ugly Truth hits it harder and rougher to those who have the symptoms of serious passionate relationship issue syndrome. This movie's appeal comes from all those suggestive scenes, which also sets it way apart from Hitch. The acting is just another okay overall. Gerard Butler provided the right amount of balancing to Katherine Heigl's lead performance, which is for me not very special. I like how the movie builds just enough of the complimentary characters such as Joy and Colin."
"eti55","6","0","1","30 April 2013"," Not Bad but Could Have Been Better
","I'll admit that part of the reason I have a soft spot for this movie is that it's set in my hometown of sorts, Sacramento, and it involves the broadcast industry (I say ""of sorts,"" because although I never lived in Sactown, I worked there for years..in the broadcast industry). There are some really good shots of the downtown area in particular (Director Robert Luketic obviously likes to open his movies with relatively low view-from-the-sky city shots..""21"" opened in similar fashion in Boston).<br/><br/>The movie's principals are Abby (Katherine Heigl), a producer for a local morning news show who's also an anal retentive control freak with no sense of humor. She's under pressure from her boss because the show is tanking in the ratings. Contrast that with Mike (Gerard Butler), a foul-mouthed misogynist with his own cable access show called ""The Ugly Truth,"" where he discusses ""relationships."" Abby runs across the show by accident after coming home alone from an unsuccessful date (which seems to be a common occurrence with her), and proceeds to call Mike during the show when she takes exception to some of his remarks (among other things he tells women who want a relationship to get on a stair master and get some trashy lingerie). Mike proceeds to skewer her on the air. The next morning, she gets a surprise: Her boss has hired Mike and is incorporating ""The Ugly Truth"" into the show, which up until that point has been a milquetoast local version of Regis and Kathie Lee, featuring a husband and wife team who put on a facade of wedded bliss but in reality can't stand each other (he's a moron and a wimp, she's an angry, shrill-voiced harpy). The first thing Mike does on the show is expose this for everyone to see. Needless to say, Abby is furious, and is still unhappy even when ratings improve.<br/><br/>Abby then discovers that she has a neighbor who has all the qualities she's looking for in a man (she's so anal she actually keeps a checklist of said qualities). Mike makes her a deal. He'll help her get the guy if she'll get off Mike's back, and if she can't land Mr. Perfect, Mike promises to quit. This is where the movie starts to degenerate into the predictable rom-com M.O.(boy and girl meet, hate each other at first but ultimately end up together). Of course, ""Mr. Perfect"" isn't really the right guy, and you know who's she's going to end up with.<br/><br/>That said, there are enough laugh-out-loud moments in this movie to make it relatively enjoyable as ""chick flicks"" go, even for the guys. Gerard Butler is especially entertaining in this, but what makes Mike's misogynistic rants even funnier is when they're played off of Abby's ""what's so funny, I don't find anything funny!"" attitude. This movie is raunchy..definitely deserving of its R rating. Some parts I found hilarious; others made me cringe. In spite of this, and in spite of the fact that it falls into the standard rom-com formula, there are enough genuinely funny moments in The Ugly Truth to keep you entertained."

Katherine Heigel and Gerard Butler did an excellent job, not to mention the supporting cast who were also great. The script was really wonderful and witty. There were some crude elements in the film, but it is rated r and intended for a mature audience. Altogether I really enjoyed this flick, it's not something I'd watch with my parents but it really is a versatile chick flick. I think men would enjoy it just as much as women!"

","*May contain spoilers* I'm not a Heigl fan any more (loved her in Roswell and that's about it), but this film turned me into a Butler fan! He is meant for comedy- his comedic timing is perfect! There was depth to his character as well, which I appreciated. Heigl kind of falls flat next to him, unfortunately for her. I couldn't quite fully buy into their attraction (they don't seem to have that much chemistry to me), but I was able to accept the ending. The supporting cast is hilarious! The actors that played the anchors outshone the leads for me (believe it or not). A light, fluffy film meant for a Saturday night. I commend the writers on this one because nothing felt over-done. I appreciate how there is progress made for the characters (the leads) and how there really is more to Butler's character than originally meets the eye."

","Contrary to user fontroy5's review, this movie is most definitely a watch-worthy flick. The movie travels around society's stereotypes towards genders and gives a funny yet witty outlook on the truths behind them. If you aren't the type to read too deeply into things and keep in mind that this is a >comedy< romance, then this movie is definitely for you! While there are some things on the movie that could of gone without (Like the ending, I won't spoil it but it's not the most tasteful ending), The Ugly Truth most certainly is The Ugly Truth, because while most of it can be simply disregarded, there's a lot of real thought behind what's spoken of. 9 out of 10, a must watch!"

","I liked this film so much I went out and brought a copy to keep so I can re-watch it whenever I like. Somehow this romantic comedy passes the average mark, to the point where I can say I love this film. Romantic comedies are hardly ever original nowadays, and the idea of two mismatched people falling in love against the odds or expectations is certainly not new. But Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl make it work, with the help of a quirky and fun script. In my opinion Butler is the one who really saves this film, because even though his character is a jerk most of the film, in quieter moments he shows us a softer side – with just a look – that makes the audience aware there is more going on below the surface of his character. The end scene between the characters in the hot air balloon is all Butler, as he sells the love story ending everyone wants. I really was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film, and highly recommend."
"chains01","7","0","3","14 May 2010"," The Ugly Truth
","Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a producer for a local TV station's morning news program in Sacramento. The show is struggling, pulling in less viewers than reruns of Geraldo, and her boss Stuart (Nick Searcy) is looking for something to draw viewers to their morning show. When he finds out that a cable access show called The Ugly Truth run by Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) is pulling in viewers thanks to Mike's brash attitude toward relationships, he brings The Ugly Truth to the morning show as a regular installment on the morning show, much to Abby's chagrin.<br/><br/>Best known for his turn in 300 Gerard Butler has amassed a somewhat large female following (I'm sure the uniforms in 300 didn't hurt), making him something of a recent go-to guy for romantic comedies as of late. Katherine Heigl, originally of Grey's Anatomy fame, found her in to movies when Anne Hathaway dropped out of Knocked Up allowing her to jump into the lead female spot. Since then she seems to have taken a spot in the lead in several romantic comedies appearing next in romantic action comedy Killers with Ashton Kutcher. So coming from somewhat different backgrounds how do these two play together in the movies? <br/><br/>Fairly well. In a movie like this, you need to believe that the main characters despise each other, and Heigl embodies that in this movie. And while Chadway, if played improperly, could come off as totally unlikeable, Butler makes you like this sexist neo-perv. It's in the characterizations and acting that the movie grabs your attention and pulses with the ability to make you laugh. Another thing that I found more welcome on my end, was the R rating for a romantic comedy, something that you don't typically see in most romantic comedies. The willingness to push things just a little further was kind of refreshing.<br/><br/>I can't really say there's much that I didn't enjoy with this movie. As I've said before in my review of The Proposal, this movie doesn't reinvent the romantic comedy, nor does it need to. In the end it's fairly by the numbers, but does more to bring in audience members from both sexes, making it a much better date movie than you can typically come to expect from most romantic comedies. I recommend this movie, especially to guys who need a romantic comedy to watch with their women.<br/><br/>3.5/5"

Gerad Butler is Mike, host of the Ugly Truth, whom is the new hit on the TV show. Abby doesn't like his chauvinist ways, but soon begins taking his advice while pursuing Dr. Colin.

"callanvass","5","0","2","31 January 2010"," A bit too cynical, and mean spirited for my liking.
","The Ugly Truth passed the time for me easily enough, but it was a bit too bland tasting for my liking. I liked the idea of the message, The Ugly Truth was trying to send out, but it did it in a mean spirited way. I'm a male, but believe in the respect of a woman, and this movie basically trashes them. The crude sequence of a kid holding a vibrator remote or whatever it was in the restaurant, turned out to be more disgusting, more then anything else, completely inappropriate in my opinion. Katharne Heigl is a very charismatic actress, but she can only do so much with the material, same goes to Gerad Butler. I didn't like the concept of the movie to be honest. Having A woman lie about her true identity, and who she is, to get the guy, didn't seem true at all to me, I always believe you should be who you are. Heigl and Butler's chemistry carry this movie farther then it should have gone, because this is a pretty ugly movie, and very hard to like. It's original, and the idea had potential, but they did it for all the wrong reasons, and in the end, I didn't care for it, even if it did pass the time.<br/><br/>Performances. Katherine Heigl is beautiful, and makes for a very charming lead, just like she did in 27 Dresses. Here she is robbed, with the nasty material, and as a result her charisma can only take her so far. Gerard Butler is a guy who i've been high on now, for quite a while. His charisma is off the charts, and manages to make a potentially unlikable character, into a heart throb for the woman, and someone to root for, with the fellow guys. Eric Winter is a somewhat likable, if a little bland love interest of Heigl's. Cheryl Hines may be familiar to ""Curb Your Enthusaism"" fans, and she did fine here.<br/><br/>Bottom line. The Ugly truth, is ugly all right, and that really hurt the film in the end for me. It's not a terrible film, far from it, just a rather average one, that's too cynical for my liking. Worth a look, but there are better Rom Com's out there.<br/><br/>5/10"

But, nevertheless I will tell that anything special in this film that that clever and interesting I have not found.<br/><br/>About what a film? Plainness of a plot which is invented for no reason, absence of interest to which speaks that lust and platitude is present at it through every minute-two. Specially for ""the dark"" people who are not understanding anything in a life and relations between the man and woman Dzherard Butler which has played the leader of the program on TV «the Naked truth», tries to ""throw light"" on sex and everything that with it it is connected. In its opinion, each person thinks only of sex. The interesting statement, but nothing confirmed and nothing meaning. Therefore also there is at me, (and I hope not only at me), a sensation of delirium and groundlessness.<br/><br/>As to Ketrin Hajgl, its character in a film first does not trust the leader, and then, on the contrary, completely trusts in its ""councils"" in which anything as I already spoke, clever, instructive it is not observed.<br/><br/>What as a result? As a result — the usual comedy melodrama created in what it is impossible to be surprised, in the USA. After the only thing, fortunately, viewing of this ""creation"" I have even more doubted that the director of this film can create something worthy, for reception of pleasure from a film, at least in a genre a comedy/melodrama. I wish it sincere successes, but, I hope that platitude which ""is normal"" for a modern cinema of the USA, will not be absolutely."

","This one had me laughing to tears. No dull second! The lines are sharp, funny to cracking and although sometimes low, hey, it is a romantic comedy. Don't expect witty literary stuff. The comic angle is everywhere, from the anal retentive archetype Abby(Catherine Heigl) to the uneducated street smart Mike(Gerard Butler) who does not get the reference to public figures. So, they do say some words like sex, erection, and even the part where Abby says the word cock is funny. Heigl does a good job playing a ""When Harry Met Sally"" - Meg Ryan scene both ways, one where she's for real and another where she fakes it. And they're both funny! This is not a chick flick. The laughs were very loud watching this among guys. It might be a bit awkward with a date because this movie stabs at many more romance fallacies than all the other RomComs I've seen. But in my opinion, if you are on a date, it might actually serve to separate the sport from the prune and her reactions will give you some pointers on how to continue. I might even come back to write again and tell you how it is with the wife.... When Harry Met Sally, Bridget Jones's Diary and Two Weeks Notice, are all nice Romantic Comedies and the top rated. This one takes the cake and creams them all."

","'The Ugly Truth' follows the similar storypath as other romantic comedies but this one has a doze of 'adultness' to it. The adult jokes work very well and the treatment to the story is interesting. The battle of the sexes is well depicted even though at times it gets a little overshadowed by the Abby and Mike love story. Heigl acts and co-produces. Her acting is very good. She totally nails the part. Butler, however, comes across as a little uncomfortable in his role. Sadly, the rest of the cast doesn't get much scope. The refreshing Sacramento setting was something different from the usual New York setting that has been overused in romantic comedies. Music is well utilized and the camera-work is pretty decent. The most enjoyable sequences were the ones with Butler and Heigl where their characters challenge one another with their polar opposite viewpoints, trying to prove the other wrong. Overall, it's a decent adult romantic comedy."

","As I type, ""The Ugly Truth"" sits at a measly 15% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The so-called ""Top Critics"" were even less kind, awarding it a 10% approval rating. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it ""ugly crap."" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post called it ""crass and contrived."" It might seem then that ""The Ugly Truth"" scrapes the bottom of the romantic comedy barrel (a bottom, I might add, that was scraped bare a decade ago)...but I must raise my hand in modest protest, providing what I hope will be a reasonable response to both this decidedly good film and all of its many naysayers. Certainly, it is contrived, plotted out by a shockingly predictable formula, and it is indeed vulgar, though I would not go so far as to label it crass. Why, I wonder, is it wrong for a rom-com to use words like the f-word or any of a variety of sexually-focused words when so many other films have used them far more often and far more inappropriately? <br/><br/>Perhaps it is because these words are coming from the lips of the newly-crowned queen of the romantic comedy: Katherine Heigl. That could have been the case, of course, had Ms. Heigl not starred in ""Knocked Up"", a film in which she and Seth Rogen seemed to be in a battle to see who could say the f-word and its derivatives the most. Perhaps it is because they come from Gerard Butler...well, now, that is just plain ridiculous. After all, he bared his bum in ""300"" and has never been known for being G-rated. I am left then with the belief that it is because this frank dialog, including bad language and lots of blunt conversations about sex, was written by three women rather than by one of the male screenwriters in Judd Apatow's passé. This is, of course, not a condemnation of Mr. Apatow or any of his colleagues, who I happen to believe use the f-word better than most anyone else. It is just that, in the grand scheme of things, I thought ""The Ugly Truth"" used it quite appropriately as well.<br/><br/>Please read my full review on my blog: www.whathappensincinema.blogspot.com"

"DICK STEEL","8","0","5","15 September 2009"," A Nutshell Review: The Ugly Truth
","How my friend and I got to watch an advance preview of this film is an interesting story in itself, given the circumstances and what we had experienced and observed, somehow playing a little bit on the theme of the movie, but I suppose that is something for another day. The Ugly Truth didn't fare all too well when it got released in the States, perhaps most people found the content too hard to swallow, in self-denial, or basically too prudish to let the hair down and guffaw at the situations being presented, however unlikely they could be.<br/><br/>If you had thought the trailer had some of the best lines in the movie, then may I assure you that you'll be up for a lot more. Maybe it's because I have bad taste, or a potty mind at times that took over, and found that hey, I could be the equivalent of a Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) too, with filth that comes out of the mouth without thorough processing. Butler's Chadway is a shock jock, who on late night cable television hosts The Ugly Truth, passing on sound but cynical judgement about the state of modern relationships to his viewers. Katherine Heigl's Abby is a television producer whose languishing ratings on her show translates to a threat of cancellation, until Mike gets contracted to present his pointed viewpoints on a segment of her news programme.<br/><br/>Needless to say, sparks don't fly between the two because the control freak in Abby is automatic loggerheads with Mike's loose cannon (pardon the pun), and made worse when Mike is deemed as the saviour of her show and career. The two enter a grudging professional relationship when Abby seeks help from Mike in order to snag the man of her dreams (according to a checklist, no less!), and I guess for a romantic comedy you can fill in the blanks all the way to the finale.<br/><br/>Sure the story isn't rocket science, full of fluff that could be used to fill a king sized mattress, but who cares about the story when you have insane, chauvinistic situations (and this is written by three women!) plastered left, right and centre full of sexual innuendos and references all targeted squarely at making you laugh, probably sometimes at yourself when you realize that you've utilized the same tips and tricks, or found yourself stuck in the exact same situation where the advice become ""words of wisdom"". It's pretty much the games people play, laid out flatly on the table, and as such, adds to your ability to identify and participate in the film.<br/><br/>The film worked wonders because of its star pairing of Butler and Heigl. I always thought Butler could do action and romance with his eyes closed, but who would have realized that he makes an awesome shock jock who's convinced with exactly what he's preaching, and practising those lessons to the T. If anything it adds to his versatility that he can do comedy as well. Heigl needs no introduction, and she amplifies her comic timing a lot more in this one, which I think easily endears her. Playing essentially two proverbial roles like the Librarian and the Stripper in her real, and perceived, fake self thanks to Mike's creative input, it's a little bit of fantasy thrown in, as who can imagine anyone looking like Heigl, having a lack of suitors lining up her doorway. That goofy dance of hers each time she literally jumps for joy, should be immortalized.<br/><br/>Hold on, did I actually enjoy this film? Yes, really, so don't laugh (at me). I have to admit again that it relied plenty on clichés, cardboard characters, and unreal situations crafted just for laughs (such as the one just begging to challenge When Harry Met Sally's iconic scene in a restaurant), it's quite inexplicable how I could have come to really laugh at nearly every moment, and had a field day with it. Inexplicable, just like falling in love with someone is."

","The minute I saw the trailer for this film I knew the ending, but then again after watching any trailer for a chick flick, you usually know what's going to happen. This was the same with another summer release this year, The Proposal. It wouldn't be a chick flick without the happily ever after of the two lead characters getting together. However, many chick flicks are still made and many people, both men and women still go see them. The outcome is always the same, it's the getting to it which makes the films different and this film is different.<br/><br/>This movie starts with a television producer, Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl), a control freak who finds it extremely hard to find love; it has been eleven months since she has had sex to be exact. After a dreadful date, she comes home to the company of her cat that accidentally steps on the remote and turns on a show called The Ugly Truth. It is presented by a man, Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler), who tells people how it really is and his topic is sex and how men think. Abby, who is absolutely disgusted by his opinions and what he is saying, phones in and has an argument with him live on air. The next morning, she finds out that she has to work with him (typical!). At the beginning, she hates everything about him, until she realises he can help her get the man of her dreams. This man just happens to be living opposite her. He is good looking, intelligent (he's a doctor) and just so happens to have saved her from falling out of a tree. They go on a series of dates and her actions are all lead by Mike who is telling her exactly what men want. However, whilst doing this, he realises he is falling in love with her and the dilemma begins.<br/><br/>This film is for both men and women. On one side you have the woman who is desperate to find love and then you have the typical man who only cares about one thing ... sex! Put them together and you get an incredibly funny movie. The humour is a mix of witty one liners and cringe worthy moments.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl does what she does best in this movie, it's her typical movie role and she pulls it off as always, whilst always looking stunningly beautiful, may I add. Gerard Butler, on the other hand, is stepping away from his usual macho roles and takes a different direction and he does it quite well. At the beginning of the film, I didn't like him much and thought the casting of him was wrong, but as the film progressed he acts the character well. He can do the vulgar ""man-whore,"" but he can also do the sensitive guy who has just realised he is in love and he does it well.<br/><br/>This is your typical chick flick and if you like that sort of film you will probably love this film. The thing that makes it different is the humour and the fact that it talks about adult subjects and has expletives.<br/><br/>The problem with this film though, is that it lacks depth. The storyline is a bit bland and the conclusion of the film happens before anything has really happened in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good entertaining film, but it won't be nominated for any Oscars, so if you want a little fun, go see this movie, unwind and laugh until it hurts."

","The Ugly Truth about Julie & Julia The Ugly Truth, as Gerald Butler tells us in the movie of the same name is that nobody wants to f**k a woman who dresses for comfort and efficiency. This caveman wisdom, and other harsh realities of the dating scene, are the core of this enjoyable chick flick.<br/><br/>The obvious plot revolves around a gorgeous Katherine Heigl, who for some strange reason, is not gunning for the most handsome successful man she can land, except for her face in the lap (literally) of the sexy and hunky surgeon next door. Instead, she is intrigued and tormented by Butler's sophomoric Man Show TV personality. They inevitably get together in the end, but along the way, he manages to educate a smart, sexy and successful TV producer (Heigl) of his wisdom and foresight in all things related to man and women and dating. As if.<br/><br/>As if girls at age three don't already know that their looks are important. As if girls at thirteen don't already know that boys are excited more about having sex with them than they are about them. As if a smart, sexy and successful blonde would have any trouble getting the hunky surgeon next door interested in her.<br/><br/>With over 30 movies already to her credit, most notably Judd Apatow's Knocked Up with Seth Rogan, actress Heigl seems poised to capture the American ""sweetheart next-door"" void so aptly filled by Meg Ryan and Sally Fields.<br/><br/>Scruffy Scot Butler (P.S. I Love You) also seems poised for larger roles, though the pair never generate the heat of classic on-screen pairings such as Tom Hanks and Ryan, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.<br/><br/>Nowhere in this movie is the implicit sexual tension that roiled the black and white classics. We don't have passionate couples held apart by thin bed sheets. We don't have headstrong women swimming, perhaps naked, in the middle of the night with men. Instead, we are left with the pithy lines that count as humor these days: Heigl: My cat stepped on the remote. Butler: Well, be sure to thank your pussy for me.<br/><br/>This movie is a mindless, but entertaining, dumbing down of what women need to do to catch and hold man's basic desires.<br/><br/>In stark contrast to The Ugly Truth are the roles portrayed by both sexes in Nora Ephron's Julie & Julia. Ephron writes romantic comedies, such as You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, and When Harry Met Sally.<br/><br/>In yet another awesome performance by the incredible Meryl Streep (and Amy Adams, both in the wonderful Doubt), we see not just how intelligent, charming and beguiling real, full grown, adult women can be, but also how strong, sensitive, and supportive their real life husbands are. The movie builds from the real life insights of Julie Powell (http://blogs.salon.com/0001399/2002/08/25.html).<br/><br/>The Ugly Truth shows that to catch a guy's fancy, women need to be sharp, sexy and a bit coy. Julie & Julia shows that to have an honest-to-god real relationship with an honest-to-god real man, women need to be kind, intelligent, thoughtful, honest and open.<br/><br/>Don't have a relationship yet? Then by all means, go see The Ugly Truth. It is a funny, entertaining date flick. Already got a relationship? One where somebody does the cooking, or has ambitions? Then go see Julie & Julia. The first is a fantasy where gorgeous blonds can't get the attention of hunky doctors. The second is two true stories welded together with honesty, compassion, influences of the outside world and true honest-to-god commitments."

","The Ugly Truth is quite simply hilarious. Any comedy that doesn't just make me laugh but at least once during the course of the film makes me howl into tears deserves seeing for anyone. The Ugly Truth is the perfect 'R' rated comedy. There is plenty of crude jokes, plenty of sexually hilarious moments, and it never overdoes either of these things which is a customary mistake for the Judd Apatow/Will Ferrell comedy world. Certainly the chemistry for the cast helps carry the plot amazingly. The entire character of Mike Chadway is brilliant and only the perfect actor could carry it and pull it off. Chadway as a character is a complete pig. The lines he delivers, the things he gets caught in are completely sexist and disgusting and yet the story writers had to make sure that Chadway became a lovable and charismatic guy that men wanna be because he's a good guy, and women love him because he changed and he's hot. So the film makers managed to nail the perfect guy for the role and him and the rest of the cast carry off the comedy absolutely perfectly. There is a little bit of every type of comedy...physical comedy (which I love when performed well), one liners, dry humor and hilarious double entendre comedy.<br/><br/>The perfect guy I mentioned? Well that is 300 star Gerard Butler. How versatile is this guy? He is the perfect pig and even while he's being a pig, you love the guy. Then you love him even more as the story unfolds and he changes and falls in love. He is charismatic and hilarious. The beautiful Katherine Heigl plays high powered TV executive Abby Richter. Heigl might be concerned about being type casted on Grey's Anatomy but her roles in film as of late don't help matters as she usually plays the same powerful but scatter brained woman looking for love. Still Heigl is adorable enough to pull it off and her chemistry in this film works and best of all her and Butler are phenomenal together and have the perfect banter back and forth that keeps the movie going. Eric Winter is the object of Heigl's affections. Unfortunately for Winter his character has virtually no depth. He is supposed to look good, play into Heigl's comedy and do nothing else and he does exactly that which doesn't fare well for an actor. The supporting cast all do great but no one person particularly stands out or does any more than the two leads.<br/><br/>Given the experience coming from director Robert Luketic. In particular I am referring to his original three films that embody romantic comedy. The adorable classic Legally Blonde, the zany and more intelligent Win A Date With Tad Hamilton and finally the (in my opinion) completely under rated Monster-In-Law. All three of those films have something uniquely common with The Ugly Truth. Character. Luketic obviously has a way of bringing out the best in a character and you just really relate and you feel like you know them and care about them making everything they do more entertaining and essentially more funny. The Ugly Truth is truly the perfect date movie because guys and girls will love it!! Guys will love Butler in all his masculine glory being as filthy as possible and the crude humor is the best!! And girls will love Heigl's strong female lead who loves guys and essentially changes her man into Mr. Perfect. Check out The Ugly Truth for a good time!! 8/10"

","In The Ugly Truth, Katherine Heigl plays Abby, a TV producer whose magazine programme is going down the tubes until, against her wishes, crude, crass Mike (Gerard Butler) is brought on board with his segment The Ugly Truth in which he examines relationships in a crude, sensationalist, oafish way. And ratings go up.<br/><br/>Abby (established early on as a humourless control freak), having not been able to establish a relationship for ages, recruits Mike to advise her on how best to hook new neighbour doctor Colin, which he achieves for her. The only thing is that she and Mike.... well, you get the drift.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty straightforward. The film, as seems to be the fashion these days, is sometimes fairly clinical in its examination of sexual matters (notwithstanding that the vibrating knickers sequence is pretty funny). Some serious issues are exposed even if conclusions aren't always reached. Gerard Butler does OK as Mike despite the fact that he has little apparent screen chemistry with Katherine Heigl.<br/><br/>But Katherine Heigl is fantastic. She is a gifted comedy actress and a decent serious actress (she gets the opportunity to do both here). Plus she does demure and outrageously sexy at the same time. One hopes that her fabulous looks won't eclipse her undoubted skills.<br/><br/>This is a decent romcom in the modern manner, suitable for the broad minded."
"songs-ajay","6","0","4","10 August 2009"," One time watch
","The movie is the usual - guy in love with the girl....n she isn't initially but does finally - kinds. The movie is good in the sense that it goes fine and you are not bugged with it at anytime. There are sequences which make you laugh, but not enough to make it a great romantic comedy! Its a one time watch, with your girlfriend. Nothing different except for the ""Ugly Truth"" portrayed, which is nothing but the problems that keep the love life apart for today's generation, which is done in a humorous way. The script is well written and would give it a 7, but when you watch the movie, it can not be that interesting at times. So I would rather give it a 6."
"brad-kruse","7","0","5","8 August 2009"," Aside from Heigl, surprisingly gentle fun
","The crux of the movie is Heigl's discovery that her ideals of relationships, her self image as a romantic partner, and her understanding of her job are all unrealistic and flawed. She learns better, begins to care about valuable goals and to be connected and responsive to those around her.<br/><br/>The cross stories, that Butler's cynicism, though less dysfunctional in his own life, is also overly defining, the way entertainment ratings depend on fickle audience perceptions - and the way modern feminism and gender role redefinitions might threaten romantic and intimate relationships - are important.<br/><br/>Overall, the story tells fairly trite but true lessons in fairly useful ways.<br/><br/>The R rating is apparently by design, to attract a prurient audience. I didn't find the partial nudity, or the language to be that far from common usage, though some of the topics were certainly more adult that we want to think of for preteens.<br/><br/>But I think Heigl was miscast. There were a very few scenes where she is appealing. In the scenes where she is portraying a cold and emotionally unavailable woman lamenting the lack of ""quality"" intimate partners, where she laments loss of control of her life and work - she diverts attention from the story to her over-the-top withdrawn portrayal. From stories of her caustic behavior on set during production, I have to wonder if that is the best that the director could get from her - or left her looking that bad as a subtle retaliation for unprofessional conduct on the set. Presumably the editing was unable - or unwilling - to overcome the snub or weak performance, whichever was the case. I found most of Heigl's performance off-putting and artificial.<br/><br/>Other than Heigl, this was a fun movie. I enjoyed much of the interplay between the main characters and watching the supporting characters delight in how the main characters interacted.<br/><br/>The Ugly Truth turns out to not be that ugly. It treats the characters and the theme about how honesty and commitment are required for a real connection with respect and loving care. There are no real villains, the conflict is all about the fall of cynical preconceptions. And I enjoyed that aspect of the movie as much as anything."

","Fun Film~ full of over the line,very tolerable ruff and tumble talk on relationships. These two play it all perfectly and the film sets aside life's seriousness to get down to what's really going on with people in their personal lives in the midst of life. It's just fun and what's wrong with that... Thought it was going to be a Harry met Sally (which was Great!)drawn out conversational story that goes through so many people's reasoning about finding who's who and what works. But it's quick, It's flirty, it's messy & It finds those sentimental parts~ doesn't dwell to long with them and has funny little messages and leaves you wanting more ~ which is what all great films do! They did a great job. For people who wants to analyze this about what it says about relationships as a whole and what it means for women and what does it say about men.... I think they are missing the entire point of the movie:-) The Doc, he's adorable too!"
"kmm111313","9","0","5","26 July 2009"," Hilarious throughout -- many/most critics are clueless!
","I thought the Hollywood Reporter (or maybe it was the Tulsa critic) that got the basics, at least in part; this romantic COMEDY has a male viewpoint, as opposed to what's been offered for more than a couple of years now in romantic comedies. Quite simply, ""the relationship adviser as a crude Alpha Male"" premise is a surprise, especially with some defeats, insecurity, caring and polish is weaved into his interactions. He is not a misogynist, nor even a sexist, given his early recognition of Heigl's producer skill and contribution to the show. Perhaps one can't be certain of that, unless you sit through the laughs in entire film... <br/><br/>By and large, other (up tight or elitist?) critics just don't get it! I'm reminded of the 70s, Mr. Mom's role-reversal film premise decades ago -- the critics blew that too. Neither plots were ""predictable"" except that in such films, it almost always ends well for the main players. But make no mistake, the key plot and broadcast scenes were original and hilarious -- parts reminded me of Mad's old, ""TV scenes we'd like to see..."" <br/><br/>In our showing, the audience was filled almost entirely with mixed-gender groups, who laughed though out this film. Note: there were few kids as it should be. The plot and dialog were both situationally and language surprising, because we're not used to THE UGLY TRUTH being shown an spoken in it's most basic form. <br/><br/>Finally, we care about the characters. And in spite of the Relationship Alpha Male vs. Business Alpha Female premise, I expect the gender score ended up pretty close overall. Our matinée discount was completely unnecessary; this film was well worth it even at the over $10 full price + our time."

","""Legally Blonde"" director Robert Luketic's latest movie ""The Ugly Truth"" qualifies as the ideal date movie. This giddy, lightweight, battle-of-the-sexes, romantic comedy about polar opposites pitted against each other, Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl, has chemistry to burn, and the chemistry is incendiary! Mind you, the narrative conceit of opposites attracting is as ancient as the Harold Lloyd silent comedy ""Girl Shy"" (1924) and ""The Ugly Truth"" is just as predictable. Recent examples of similar romantic comedies include ""What Women Want,"" ""Maid in Manhattan,"" ""Failure to Launch,"" ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" and ""You've Got Mail."" Nevertheless, the Nicole Eastman, Karen McCullah Lutz, and Kristin Smith screenplay works like a charm, particularly because the leads, Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl, play such charismatic characters. Butler displays a genuine knack for comedy, while Heigl shows no shame when she makes a buffoon of herself. Indeed, Heigl acted as an executive producer, and that is saying a lot after you see the hilarious scenes at the baseball park and in the restaurant.<br/><br/>Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl of ""27 Dresses"") is a smart, capable, good-looking, blonde television producer of a local Sacramento morning talk show with less-than-spectacular ratings. She is also controlling and manipulative and hasn't been on an exciting date for eleven months. In other words, she's got man problems, the kind of man problems that mean she doesn't have a man around when she needs him. Abby and her assistant Joy (Bree Turner of ""Joe Dirt"") do research on every guy that our heroine dates. When she goes out on a date, Abby has already run a background check on the guy. Furthermore, she comes with a list of topics to discuss in case the conversation dries up. Predictably, at the end of an evening, Abby winds up walking herself back to her apartment.<br/><br/>Abby is about to go to sleep when her cute pet cat D'Artagnan mashes the remote control and changes the channel to a 'live' public access cable program called ""The Ugly Truth."" Abby cannot believe her ears as the unshaven chauvinistic male host sets fire to three bestsellers about dating and relationships in a barbecue grill. Mike Chadaway (Gerard Butler of ""300"") epitomes the typical, politically incorrect, shock-jock host who speaks plainly about men, women, and sex. According to Mike, men hate to hear about a gal's problems, they only want oral sex. Abby phones him up and informs him that men are sensitive, too. When he asks her about her current boyfriend, she lapses into silence. Mike labels her 'Lassie' and cuts her off.<br/><br/>The next morning at work, Abby is shocked when her boss, Stuart (Nick Searcy of ""Runaway Jury""), announces that he has hired Mike Chadaway to boost their sagging ratings. Initially, Abby hates the idea, but she perseveres. Stuart, who fears for Abby's job and his son's college tuition, persuades Abby to give Mike a chance. Not surprisingly, Mike wins them high ratings. Abby tells him about her next door neighbor, Colin (Eric Winter of the soaper ""Days of Our Lives""), an orthopedic surgeon with a body like a Chippendale dancer. Mike bets her he can show her how to win the guy or he'll quit the show. Abby agrees and Mike begins what looks like the modern day equivalent of ""Pygmalion."" Mike takes Abby out to buy new outfits, longer hair, and tells her to stop behaving like a psycho control freak. He teaches Abby how to hang up on a guy and know if he is going to call back. Abby is flabbergasted when everything that Mike tells her to do works. Mike's magic not only works on Abby, but also the couple that hosts Abby's morning talk show, Georgia (Cheryl Hines of ""Along Came Polly"") and Larry (John Michael Higgins of ""Yes Man"") who having been hitting off lately. Basically, they are unhappily married because she earns more money and she won't let him be the man.<br/><br/>Eventually, all the coaching that Mike gives Abby and their constant bickering with each other takes a toll of their at-arms-length relationship and the ice cracks in ways that you wouldn't expect. Mike is being courted by the networks and he gets an audition on the ""The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson."" Of course, the network loves Mike's personality and he is tempted. Abby and he step on an elevator and things change.<br/><br/>Although this harmless fluff carries an R-rating, ""The Ugly Truth"" is clever, frivolous, borderline crude but lacks nudity. Sure, some of the subject matter and the language might prove offensive, but this guy-wants-gal, guy-loses-gal, and guy-gets-gal back is infectiously entertaining stuff without a mean-spirit to be found anywhere in its trim 96-minutes. If ""The Hangover"" was a good way to get the summer cranked up with a comedy, then ""The Ugly Truth"" is a great way to wrap it up with laughs galore."

","""And when that I had geten unto me/By maistry all the sovereignetee . . . After that day we hadden never debat!"" Wife of Bath, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales<br/><br/>From Chaucer to Apatow, men have always wanted to know what women want (In the bard's case, it was ""mastery"" over men). So The Ugly Truth is a pleasant summer breeze which looks at what men are and what they want. It's a romcom with witty moments (too few for me): <br/><br/>Mike: You're all about comfort and efficiency! Abby Richter: What's wrong with comfort and efficiency? Mike: Well nothing, except no one wants to f___it.<br/><br/>Its philosophy gently reminds us that although men are from Mars, women may like that just fine, and, whoa, they may not want ""maistry.""<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl (Abby) is not quite as bright as she was in Knocked Up, but she is as uptight and controlling. Gerard Butler (Mike), the current rage of chick-flick audiences briefly replacing Colin Firth, is not as lovingly attentive as he was In P.S. I Love You. Although both actors play at a screwball comedy's fast-paced lingo that's not up to the literate caliber of say, His Girl Friday, the attempt is worthy given the paucity of witty comedies this year. <br/><br/>The restaurant scene where Abby has inadvertently worn vibrating panties remotely controlled by an unsuspecting kid at another table is amusing (showing Heigl's chops) but misses the impact of Meg Ryan's fake orgasmic scream in When Harry Met Sally. <br/><br/>Abby is a wound up morning show TV producer faced with supervising a new talent, Mike, whose cable show The Ugly Truth has a big audience that loves his frank talk about men's libidinous natures and women's manipulation. She hates his macho routine, and he tries to change her into an attractive woman. Do you think they will fall in love? Silly of me to doubt your insight.<br/><br/>While the whole movie is a cauldron of clichés and expectations, it has a core of truthfulness about the misperceptions between the sexes. It may confirm the suspicion of some like me that hard-core controlling women could soften their ""mastering"" gene, and men could, well, shift slightly into less lecherous and more sensitive Martians. It's summer fantasy fun with ugly truth that goes down like a warm gin and tonic."
