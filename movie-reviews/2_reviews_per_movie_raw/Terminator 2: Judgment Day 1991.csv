","A Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) in the original. Now, that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: Protect John Connor. John Connor(Edward Furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill him;The T-1000(Robert Patrick). Sarah, John, and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day, with a trailing, shape-shifting Termiantor trailing from behind.<br/><br/>This is the greatest of the Terminator trilogy. I have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that Cameron could have improved on. The move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. Schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. He isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. He is a machine. I hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.<br/><br/>The special effects are incredible beyond belief. The shape-shifting T-1000 is some of the greatest animation I have witnessed in cinema history. It absolutely blew my mind when I first experienced this visual extravaganza. The animation looked so real(remembering this was a good ten years). The movie included fast-paced action along with some clever sci-fi drama/horror. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. But the T-1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.<br/><br/>Sci-fi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. This is one of the few exceptions. The prediction of judgment day with Hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of Armageddon. The theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by The Terminator"" It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"". This brings the movie to a whole new level of sci-fi.<br/><br/>Overall, Termiantor II: Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it, buy it! Because once you have seen it, you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. There never be the same movie like T2. What else I can say about this film? A Must see for everyone."
"ivo-cobra8","10","164","194","6 January 2018"," The best action sequel of all time and one of the best Schwarzenegger's movies my personal favorite
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (1991) is the best action sci-fi flick movie from the 90's ever made of all time. Terminator 2 is my personal favorite film I absolutely love this movie to death! Is my number 1 best movie ever till today the best of the best epic movie of all time. T2 was nominated for 4.Oscars the only movie of the franchise was nominated for an Oscar. If you watch T2 carefully and follow the story you never got bored and you are very entertained. This movie kicks ass! I love the hospital scenes mostly at night, the Cyberdyne building action sequences and of course steel mill action sequences are perfect for this film. This film deals with a lot of action, sci-fi and does involves a lot of paradox past travel. There is a lot of explosions and automatic weapons used in the movie and they are used well thousands of bullets are fired and explosive projectiles are fired at the police cars. <br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger as the good terminator T-800 did an awesome Terrific real job, he acted believably as one of his best characters I ever saw on screen. Terminator walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. Than ignores the police's order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun with Chainsaw grip at the police cars below, avoiding the humans. The helicopter pilot moves away. Terminator than uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more vehicles. Its heads-up display indicates no human casualties. The film has a heart and is the best film in the world. <br/><br/>Robert Patrick as T-1000 is ""a mimetic Polly-alloy"" or ""liquid metal."" He can shape shift to match other people he touches, after first arriving in present time, he decides to have his base form be that of a nearby cop he killed and passes himself off as a cop in that form. The truck chase scene is awesome and the crash is also awesome. The truck that hit in to another column in the canal and explodes, T-1000 emerges as a shiny, featureless, liquid metal figure. Its features become more pronounced and its colors return to normal, returning to the form of the unharmed pseudo-cop is awesome. It shows what his character can do. <br/><br/>Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor she acted her character perfectly here she played her character genius and very convincing and real, tough beyond all belief and completely focused on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety. Sarah Connor is her best performance ever in the both Terminator films. Little out of her mind with paranoia and anger: amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to). <br/><br/>Edward Furlong, is the only John Connor for me, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom told him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well. Earl Boen plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden Dr. Silberman from the first film The Terminator (1984) that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick did there best acting performances, those actors who played there characters are beloved till this days and Terminator 2 has since been ranked as one of the greatest action, science fiction sequel films of all time. <br/><br/>Twin sister of Linda Hamilton also appeared as Leslie Hamilton Gearren as Twin Sarah in dream she was for real there wasn't no CGI in here. Twin brothers Don Stanton and Dan Stanton both of actors appeared in here one as Lewis the Guard the other as Lewis as T-1000 who kills lewis they were for real no CGI, except special effects for T-1000 knife. Terminator special effects were designed by Stan Winston R.I.P. who has done incredible job making those effects. <br/><br/>The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments. T2 is James Cameron masterpiece. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. James Cameron writes, produces and directs brilliantly this film. Brad Fiedel does a perfect music score to the film. American rock band Guns N' Roses wrote a single for this movie ""You Could Be Mine"" and Schwarzenegger appeared in the music video as T-800 in the music video for this movie. <br/><br/>The chopper scene that crashed in to a SWAT van and explodes was awesome. The CGI and special effects are awesome. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task actors, stunts, puppetry, models and special effects designed from Stan Winston. <br/><br/>It is Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language, it is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval"
"red_core","10","796","979","23 February 2004"," the best action film of all time, and NOT due to the CGI
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers arthouse-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a few sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.<br/><br/>This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1991!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.<br/><br/>This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CG. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.<br/><br/>But, a little bit of background is due. This is the sequel to the Terminator (1984), whose premise was that a near-indestructible cyborg is sent by evil self-aware machines from the near future to destroy the mother-to-be of the military commander who would lead the humans to a victory over the machines. Oh, and this terminator machine would come from a time of war between men and machines which followed a nuclear exchange that left billions of people dead, first. In Terminator 2, John Connor (the commander-to-be) is about 12 years old, and his mother (Sarah) is feverishly trying to prepare him for his fate, even as she tries to stop the factors that will lead to the nuclear war and the entire terrible future that made all this necessary. The machines now send a superior, more intelligent, shape-shifting cyborg (T1000) into the past, to kill John himself. Meanwhile, future-John reprograms the ex-evil Terminator (T101) from the original film, and sends him into the past to PROTECT John against the T1000.<br/><br/>That's your basic plot. It does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can't really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don't, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.<br/><br/>What happens after the two terminators appear in the past is a wild ride rife with macho action, dark reflection on the nature of man, and a few rays of hope, here and there. Schwarzenegger (the good terminator) and Patrick (the bad one) make for such effective foes that the times they meet on-screen are completely breathtaking (and odd, given that you repeatedly see the relatively slim T1000 through Arnie through a wall or two). Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, is a wonderful character -- tough beyond all belief and completely focussed on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety, yet clearly a little out of her mind with paranoia and anger; amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to) in her otherwise 2-dimensional character. And Furlong, as John, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom tell him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well, particularly Earl Boen who plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).<br/><br/>With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. I mean, who doesn't cheer (at least inside) when Arnold steps out of the biker bar, fully clad in leather when ""Bad to the Bone"" music starts to blast? The guy absolutely bleeds coolness. And the T1000 absolutely bleeds evil. But, with so many great moments, you'd think the pacing would be a little uneven... not really! The film shifts from place to place with an ease that makes perfect sense, never giving you the time to start being a little nitpicking jerk, always driving forward, but always doing so thoughtfully and with attention to detail.<br/><br/>Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The CG effects for the shape-shifting T1000 were cutting-edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they're completely commonplace today. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, a helicopter flies under a highway overpass; at another, a motorcycle jumps from the 2nd floor of a building into a flying chopper). (Probably, only the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings movies compare in terms of the level of stunt insanity.) And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Cameron-Schwarzenegger style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and somewhat bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait until the nuclear detonation sequence.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie. Probably moral content, and the movie has a very clear pro-human, anti-war message. The message is a bit stale, and the delivery IS, at times, a little heavy-handed (and some moments with the T101 seem just a bit unrealistic, towards the end), but the movie has heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","345","419","4 August 2002"," This is the sequel that dreams are made of.
","Normally when people tell you about a sequel that was better than the original or just as good, Terminator 2 is always guaranteed to be in their list; why? Because this is THE action movie of all action movies, next to Die Hard, this is the movie that isn't just about the action as well, but has an incredible story and message behind it that will always stay with you. Terminator 2 like the first Terminator film has memorable lines, moments, and incredible effects. This is the film that made you believe in ""liquid metal"" machines. Robert Patrick's performance is flawless, to be honest I found him a million times more terrifying than Arnold in the first Terminator, because Robert looks like this normal average guy, but he's not like Arnold where he gets shot and you can clearly see he's a terminator, Robert goes back to human looking and won't stop. Not only that you don't know how to stop him. Linda Hamilton returns and gives a great performance as Sarah Conor who is no longer a meek little girl, she has turned into a strong woman who will do anything to protect her son and the future. Arnold is back and he's better then ever! No wonder in the future they made several terminators that look like him, he's great entertainment.<br/><br/>Eleven years after Sarah Connor destroyed the original Terminator that was programmed to kill her, two Terminators arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029. The first is a Terminator identical to the one that Sarah first encountered, while the second is a new model which assumes the identity of a police officer. John Connor is now a 10 year old living with foster parents. Sarah's experiences have made her tougher and more vigilant, but also desperate to warn humanity about the coming apocalypse. After attempting to bomb a computer factory, Sarah is arrested and remanded to the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the supervision of Dr. Silberman. Meanwhile, the Terminators locate John Connor in a mall. After John is rescued and a chase through the L.A. storm drain channels, the original Terminator escapes with John on his motorcycle. The Terminator explains that he is reprogrammed by the future John Connor to protect and obey John's younger self. The other Terminator is a T-1000, an advanced new prototype programmed to kill John. It is made of ""a mimetic polyalloy"", a liquid metal that allows it to take the shape and appearance of anything it touches. It can also form into knifes and stabbing weapons. Learning that the T-1000 will likely kill Sarah and then mimic her to lure John, John orders the Terminator to help free her. Initially, Sarah is terrified by the Terminator; but after seeing it fight off the T-1000, she accepts that they need its help. As they escape the city, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet, the sentient computer system that will nearly wipe out humanity in an apocalyptic nuclear attack on ""Judgment Day"".<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is one of the best films of all time, this is a film that I absolutely adore and if someone hasn't seen it, there's something seriously wrong. This story is a special one: humans, are we our own worst enemy? Arnold's line ""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"" is something that always sends chills down my spine because it's true. I loved the relationship between Arnold and Eddie Furlong, interesting to see a terminator take the place perfectly of a father and you see the pain in Eddie's eyes of never wanting to let go of the terminator. Like Sarah Conor said "" The terminator wouldn't stop, it would never leave him. It would never hurt him or shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him. And it would die to protect him."" meant a lot to me. Like I said, if for some odd reason you have seen this movie, do see it! I promise you that it's just an excellent film and one that will always stand out against cinematic history.<br/><br/>10/10"
"jamesqt","10","460","565","18 February 2006"," Best action film ever!!!
","This superb sequel surpasses the excellent original in every department and quite simply you won't see a better action film. Set 15 years after the original Arnie may return as the good Terminator trying to protect John Connor but he's a redundant piece of scrap metal compared to the T-1000.<br/><br/>The opening hour and the last half hour is absolutely breathtaking with action sequences that still remain unsurpassed. Their's also a wonderful piece of storytelling 3/4 of the way through where Dyson relises the terrifying consequences of the project he's neglecting his family for.<br/><br/>The performances are memorable particularly Linda Hamilton's Sara Connor and simply put, they'll never make a better action film."
"MovieAddict2016","10","417","514","5 November 2003"," He Said He'd Be Back...and He Certainly is!
","Who said sequels aren't any good? ""Terminator 2"" is the ultimate sequel, a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It's dark, it's mean, and it's one tough movie. It's not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.<br/><br/>If there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director, it is James Cameron. Here we've got Cameron's real thoughts on the series, those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here, filling every frame with hard-boiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film, but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984, at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled, and good golly, is it wonderful.<br/><br/>Yeah, he's ""back."" Arnold (like he needs any introduction?) returns as The Terminator, Series T-101, Model T-800, an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film. Well, it's 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future, John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah's 11-year-old son. (Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years, with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003, yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn't match with his age in the third. We'll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?)<br/><br/>Another model Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold's appearance. Arnold, an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T-1000, has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won't be easy. First, he has to find John Connor, who is a rebellious angst-driven pre-teen living with foster parents. Then, together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), who believes Sarah is delusional. (You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film, too.) Then, they have to stop a computer chip designer (Joe Morton) from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer, modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. (Which is, of course, the chip from the destroyed T-800 of the first film.)<br/><br/>Whew. On with the film analysis, right? Where to start? This isn't as fierce or brutal as the first film, but it's got plentiful action sequences, a large budget, great special effects (even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays), not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course, this Terminator has no memory of the first film, since he wasn't in it--SkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So, with that in mind, John Connor's resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse, programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm, and sent him through the time portal.<br/><br/>Sarah doesn't trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and ""Xtreme"" edition DVDs, Sarah says, ""You don't know what it's like to try and kill one of these things!"" It's an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it, Sarah is about to destroy the machine's central processing chip located inside his head, when John stops her. It's important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn't trust him, and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice, without giving him a chance. As much as I don't like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meaning(s), ""T2"" clearly has an underlying message: One, don't judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two, if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life, why can't everyone? And three, the most important fact of all: Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.<br/><br/>I suppose the question on most interested viewers' minds is this: Is ""T2: Judgment Day"" better than its predecessor? Well, in some respects, yes. In others, no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film, but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film (futuristic, indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill), but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity, coming to accept your future, and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.<br/><br/>In some ways, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I'd choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I'm glad I don't have to choose.<br/><br/>5/5 stars."
"MR_Heraclius","10","44","50","6 March 2020"," Great
","A classic and belongs in the top tier of action films. The action sequences are exciting and plain awesome. Involving an arsenal of weapons, a Harley-Davidson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, action movies don't get better than this."
"athlynne81","10","44","50","27 October 2005"," A piece of cinematic genius...
","I adore this movie. I could never stand action movies, but T2 is so intelligent and moving that it stands apart from everything else.<br/><br/>First, the story - brilliant, smoothly making the necessary transition from T1. The dialogue runs the gamut from hilarious to heartbreaking, but always strikes exactly the right chord.<br/><br/>The cinematography and effects are stunning, especially the scenes filmed during ""magic hour"", when the pale gold of sunset casts a meaningful and lovely effect on the scene. Being the first $100 million movie naturally the effects are remarkable for their time, but they hold up wonderfully against anything made today.<br/><br/>It's the actors, however, who steal the show. Linda Hamilton can play insanity and despair like nobody's business, and she gave her all here. Robert Patrick was wonderful in the demanding role of the T-1000, creepy and threatening even during the funny finger-wagging moment. Arnold Schwarzenegger balances non-stop action with a machine's emerging humanity; frankly this movie cancels out every dumb action flick he ever made. New-comer Edward Furlong carried the film with seeming ease, giving an astonishing performance for his age and lack of experience; the ""We're not gonna make it, are we?"" scene is hauntingly perfect.<br/><br/>James Cameron and his team have given us a classic that has something for everyone. You'd never know that this is the guy who made Titanic."
"TOMASBBloodhound","10","28","31","30 August 2009"," Note to Hollywood: This is how you make an action film.
","And yes, I'd consider this more of an action film than Sci/fi since it takes place in contemporary times and locations. Nowadays, it can be hard to distinguish an action film from a video game. In fact there is one coming out soon that appears to be both. I guess studios these days feel that kids need something to see while resting their fingers after long days of playing their Nintendos/Playstations/whatever. So they come up with all of these PG-13 action films that are often mere meditations of comic books, toys, or old TV shows. Looking back at T2, one may find the action films of today sorely lacking in comparison.<br/><br/>The story of course deals with Arnold returning from the future to protect a boy who will some day lead the human resistance against a world run by machines. This time Arnold is the good guy (as per Schwarzenegger's request) and he's up against a lethal and much more advanced prototype sent to off the kid. The CGI used to create this new T-1000 terminator was jaw-dropping at the time this was released. Though technology to create such things is now infinitely more available, this has led to problems in my book. Now, there is too much done with computers, and stunts don't seem so wonderful if you know it was all done on a computer. Most of the stunts in T2 were live action and extraordinarily filmed using all types of vehicles and explosives. Director James Cameron really sold these stunts in terms of how he filmed them.<br/><br/>Not all directors are a good as Cameron. That is a given. But directors looking at making action films should take note of other strengths found in the construction of T2. First of all, you don't need shaky camera movements to sell to your audience that there is an exciting or crucial scene happening. Here the photography is crisp and detailed. You see everything clearly that you need to see. Right down to the little things. The action sequences are perfectly blocked and the spacing between hostile parties is easy for the audience to figure out. We know who is shooting at who, and how far apart they are from each other. Cameron also made sure his entire cast was proficient with the weapons they were going to fire in the movie. And guns run out of ammunition and need to be re-loaded at appropriate times. Nothing seems artificial in a shootout.<br/><br/>I could go on forever pointing out good qualities of this film. Just watching a bit of it on Bravo the other night reminded me why I saw it so many times in the theater. And this film was rated R! And it still made a fortune! That just proves if you make a good product, you don't have to dumb it down or tame it for the kiddies. If it's good enough, they'll find a way to see it! 10 of 10 stars. Unfortunately, the inspiration seems to have left this series with Cameron.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"shortround8391","10","36","41","7 April 2009"," Schwarzenegger's Best Film, Hands Down
","Oh yeah, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""......The greatest overall action film next to ""Die Hard"" and the greatest science fiction one next to ""Aliens"". It is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time and I would give this 20 stars if I could and this is a film that everyone recognizes and knows about and this is a film that absolutely gets what it deserves.<br/><br/>In 1991, Arnold Schwarzenegger had finally cemented his reputation as the world's greatest action star after a couple great classics (The Terminator, Predator, Total Recall and the Conan films). This is the movie that defined Schwarzenegger forever as the one and only ""Terminator"", the cyborg sent from the future to protect the kid (Edward Furlong) who will save the entire world. Even though he's a machine, he learns what humans need to do and what they were put on this Earth for. And like what action films lack, T2 develops its characters flawlessly, and yes, EVEN the Terminator is given development as a character! When the T-100 arrives to the mid 1990's, he is basically awkward and socially clueless and knows nothing about human emotion or interaction. As the film progresses, he learns how humans behave and learns a few one-liners from John (Hasta la Vista, baby) and Spoilers: at the end before the Terminator melts himself in molten steel, his humanity is completely obvious, ""I know now why you cry, for it is something I can never do."" And just before he completely disappears in the molten steel, he gives the ""thumbs-up"" gesture, something that John had taught him before.<br/><br/>It is also probably the most heart-breaking ending and even the most insensitive guy will cry to that.<br/><br/>Also, Linda Hamilton makes one of the greatest ever screen performances by a female, and even challenges the performance of Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens"". And her character has really developed from the first movie. The main problem with most movie sequels that have been made is that they usually act like the film before it never happened. But Sarah Connor has transformed from a timid waitress into a smart and brutal militaristic woman. And it shows off James Cameron's film-making genius and he truly knows how to make a great action film and a great sequel to follow it, because of this and ""Aliens"" (which I will write up a review soon) 2 of the greatest sequels ever made. During the course of this film, Sarah Connor has already developed a phobia for Terminator's due to her experiences in the first movie. And during most of the film, she doesn't trust the Terminator at all and even tries to destroy its CPU chip (only in a deleted scene). But at the end, when the Terminator is just about to destroy itself, she shakes hands with him and makes peace with him.....very,very touching moment. Also, Hamilton did a great job at providing the narration, with some greatly written lines, and she utters them with perfect drama and suspense to reveal the story in the beginning and what's next for the future at the end.<br/><br/>Also, Edward Furlong really makes a name for himself in his film debut. He is absolutely perfect as the juvenile offender who is affected by the absence of his mother and biological father. Throughout the film, he becomes attached to the Terminator and teaches him the meaning of human life. And no one else could've done the role better or equally as great. FYI, it's not really that easy for a kid with limited acting experience to pull it off.The line, ""She's not my mother, ''Todd''"" shows what Furlong can do and says that line with the perfect facial expression and delivery. And Furlong and Hamilton are really the 2 who provide the intense emotion that has capitalized James Cameron's films ever since.<br/><br/>The villainous T-1000 (Robert Patrick) has gotta be the icon for movie villains, 'cause the whole ""liquid metal"" thing is so cool. And the film was even a landmark for special effects which make the action scenes stand out and make them among the best in the genre.<br/><br/>This is further proof of why every action fan needs to have James Cameron alive to give em a reason to live. I'm already looking forward to ""Avatar"" and ""Battle Angel"", and I'm sure those 2 will kick @$$ once they come out.<br/><br/>If it weren't for this film, every other action flick that you see these days wouldn't be the same. When you watch it, just keep in mind that this movie changed a lot of things. It's not just an excellent action epic, but a very emotionally charged story about human survival."
"SmileysWorld","9","219","277","26 February 2002"," One sequel that out does the original
","I am not a big fan of sequels,as most of them disappoint,but T2 certainly does not.In fact,it's a rare case,at least in my opinion, of a sequel actually surpassing the original film in terms of greatness.As in 99.9% of his films,Arnold Schwarzenegger is the good guy once again,but you don't mind once you witness the incredible villain performance of Robert Patrick.This film is nothing short of a beginning to end thrill ride.Let us not forget the talents of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong,who gave great supporting efforts.Thumbs up!"
"Quinoa1984","10","264","340","30 April 2000"," surpasses the original
","Terminator 2 perhaps shows that Cameron was at least was cognizant of life and its meaning. I mean, this IS the movie where the end of the world has the most impact outside of Dr. Strangelove, right? One of those outstanding dream scenes in movies, one of the ones that actually works because it's true in its savage simplicity, Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor sees herself in her 1984 waitress get up with baby John in a playground and then everything gets wiped out by the BIG BOMB (Dmitri) that also incinerates Hamilton into BBQ.<br/><br/>So it's with this kind of thought that Terminator 2 means to be the most kick-assingest blockbuster of its (or all?) time while trying to keep the loss of life very small - or, rather, the ""Bad"" Terminator who was designed by the wizards at ILM can kill to its mission's content - I mean, DAMN, it still looks great, and in its silver-liquid-chrome simplicity much more, for me, impressive than the clanging junk of Bay disasters. It's arguable, of course, that the Terminator (T-800) does kill some people, incidentally, or, you know, all that gas from the gun he shoots could make some people really screwed up but, hey, ""He'll live"" is enough.<br/><br/>But if Cameron is ""soft"" at all here, it doesn't show too much... well, okay, Lil' John (hehe) does squeak and squak those early 90's amorphisms ""No Problemo - chill out - listen to Kriss Kross - etc"", and Edward Furlong is one of the things that just does not hold up here. He's serviceable at best, annoying at worst. He can cry okay though.<br/><br/>But it's Arnold, in his swaggering low-key and then with an occasional grin awesome leading man turn, and especially Linda Hamilton who make this tight script so compulsively watchable. Hamilton makes Connor into what Cameron likely saw in his one-time wife/collaborator Bigelow - a take-no-prisoners soldier who can take charge and has muscles and can probably knock you upside the head (maybe that's why they divorced, he couldn't take all that woman... but I digress, at any rate he moved around a lot till his current wife) And there is also a vulnerability still to Sarah that makes her so endearing. <br/><br/>She can never be completely hard, though time and experience and the dread of what's to come had scarred her, so by the time she has the chance to kill the Man Who Destroys The World, she can't do it. A scene like that is probably more emotionally gripping than so many other scenes that try in these blockbusters (something like Days of Future Past, which is a cousin of this flick, gets there). The fact Hamilton wasn't able to parlay such high caliber performance work into a better career is kind of sad, but at least this stands as a benchmark of a woman action hero, one of the two Cameron Wonder Women really.<br/><br/>So, blast your Guns N Roses, say hi to the kid from Salute Your Shorts (that's him, right, Connor's friend in the first act?) and ride your motorcycle through LA - it's a bad mother-jammer of a blockbuster that holds up enough to look over its faults (i.e. some dialog isn't tight, like the voice-over, it's alright but whatever - perhaps it was ambitious enough to best The Perfect Action Movie, which the first Terminator just was)."

He's not here to kill Sara Connor... His mission now is to protect the future savior of mankind, her son John... Thirty years from now, Terminator was reprogrammed to be John Connor's protector here, in this time... Terminator would never leave him... Terminator would never hurt him...

He can jerk any knife out without slowing a stride... His hand blurs out like a striking cobra...<br/><br/>We watch him smashing the cover plate off the phone's cash box with the heel of his hand... And when the bullets rake his chest, he doesn't even draw back... We observe him in slow motion how he fights for control, how he jumps his bike, sweeps a street kid off his machine with one arm and swings him in front of him... <br/><br/>Robert Patrick is a super-villain, a perfect chameleon...

The Best!!!"
"Ziya90","10","14","16","22 March 2010"," It pushes the limits of greatness
","Probably this is the movie I enjoyed watching the most. Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my all time favorite actors, I am a huge fan of him. It does not matter whether his acting is great or not (but in this movie, he is great I think) The Terminator 2 has humor at times, but because of that again rather critics give one star low! However, humor in the movie is not to entertain audiences. Humor in this movie results from natural situations, it seems that Cameron does not put such moments for our entertainment like the third Terminator movie. And this humor does not ruin the seriousness and the dark tone of the movie. I can't think of a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger. I have seen Terminator Salvation and yes, there was Arnold Schwarzenegger too, but CGI! (an awful idea) Terminator Salvation was OK, but not as a Terminator movie, as a post apocalyptic science fiction action. I want to say a few things more about Schwarzenegger. He was an icon by this character. Motorcycle, leather jacket, sunglasses and pump rifle. At this point, this is the most humanist, may be the only action movie ever! One of my favorite one liners is the movie is ''he will live.'' Connor tries to teach him not to kill people. Don't get me wrong, it does not mean that I don't like other action movies which do not give such a message, but this just makes the movie greater and deeper. By the way, Terminator 2 is also the deepest action movie ever. This is one of the movies that when you replace any of the actors, pieces don't fall into place. Schwarzenegger is like he was made for Terminator (and yes Conan too), Robert Patrick was made for T-100 (he was at his best in this movie, may be not for acting, but for performance) and Edward Furlong was made for John Connor. Honestly, personally it was impossible to believe that Nick Stahl is John Connor, I watched him like another character. Furlong portrays a very realistic rover portrait. As for Linda Hamilton, she was not made for Sarah Connor, but it is a big pleasure to watch her and for her acting, real very good. Musics always make me live nostalgia, great musics. Now, let's talk about the scenes. The atari center sequence is the first beyond great sequence. This movie is great entertainment, every time, it is a great pleasure to watch it. From the middle of 1990s till now, I watched the movie almost 50 times. I love the metal holes and then renew. How creative it is. As for visual effects, it is a touchstone, yes still. It is the greatest visual effects of all time to me, till 2012. Now, to me it became the second greatest. And I am sorry, I find the visual effects of T2 much more believable than Avatar. Yes I know, 3D, some other new technologies as well. but this is what I think. At a few moments, it is flawed like the scene they shoot at the face of Schwarzenegger, but no problem at all. Can you believe that this movie was made in 1991? I can't believe at all. That's why it is still a milestone. The chase sequence in the highway is beyond great too. Cameron raised the bar and I used to compare all the chase scenes with this one. Do you know another movie that in user comments, the titles which say the greatest action movie ever are innumerable? Almost everyone says the greatest action movie ever, the best action movie of all time, the greatest, the best... I will say the same thing. This is the greatest action movie of all time. The pump rifle using style of Terminator was getting my attention when I was a child. Still I like that. I just like gunfight scenes, not guns by the way. The hospital sequence is the third beyond great sequence, there are a lot of scenes that deserves cinema anthology in this movie. The coffee scene was incredible, every time makes me remember The Silver Surfer, we get lots of very interesting and brilliant moments like the shoot at head (not just in this sequence, throughout the whole movie) The Terminator is 10 out of 10, but T2 surpasses even that (you know I can't give 11 out of 10) Ohh By the way, I don't recommend you to watch the extended edition, if you are a first time viewer. There are three new scenes in this edition. The scene which Sarah hallucinates, to me a mediocre scene, the scene which T-100 tells Sarah and John where his chip is, an unnecessary scene and the scene which a kind of foreplay and talking between Tarissa and Miles while he works at desk, a cliché and a bit ridiculous scene. Returning to the movie, this is the best cat and mouse game movie with No Country for Old Men, it wouldn't be better. T-1000 is the most powerful, the most resistant (the most indestructible) villain ever! You think that he is terminated, but he is not, will he be terminated this time? The movie delivers such a feeling that I would define great success. Helicopter truck fight is great, another action sequence, I would call the kind of action in the movie metallic, not CGI action. By the way, mercury scene was one of the most shocking moments in the cinema history! Unbelievable, incredible. There is an unaccountable moment which it seems that Hulk was inspired from. Another moment recalls The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King etc. If you watched both movies, you understand what I mean. And T-1000 continues to execute his tricks, I was bowling over every time. This is a non stop action movie, but not shallow at all, not like pure action with no substance, in contrast the deepest action movie ever made."
"knucklebreather","9","18","22","2 November 2009"," King of the Action Flicks?
","Most action movies follow a pretty predictable sequence. There's nothing written in stone, but the movie tends to have an introduction, an epic conclusion, and then fills the intervening hour or two carefully switching between scenes of suspense, heroics, setbacks, triumphs, evil ploys and noble sacrifices. The more you watch, the more you notice the formula.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is one of the few good action movies that dares to throw the formula out the window, and that is what makes it so great. Instead of structuring the plot to build suspense by the book, Terminator 2 makes the bold move of telling a linear story where every scene actually has to be multi-dimensional and build the plot in a creative and new way. This is very hard to do, each scene practically has to be written from scratch like a chapter of a good book, and the difficulty of making that style of film-making succeed is why so many films rely on the trusty old formula.<br/><br/>The structuring of Terminator 2 is a subtle thing to notice, but I do think it contributed to its success, and certainly to the relatively serious respect its given as a film. No one is going to confuse it with an art house film, of course, but at the same time, it does something that formula thrillers like ""Air Force One"" don't even try to do, it tells a story in an original, genuinely creative way without relying on traditional suspense-building clichés. In its own way, this film is a work of art.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has much more obvious assets. The film's calling card will always be the epic action and special effects sequences - Arnold riding his bike off a ledge, twirling his shotgun around to reload it, tearing aside his fake skin to reveal the metal parts below - ""Terminator 2"" was a stunningly exciting film when it came out, and its visuals don't feel dated at all even 18 years later.<br/><br/>Still, though, a lot of other films have had competent special effects. Why do people consider T2 a classic instead of films like ""Independence Day"", which also invested heavily in effects? It's not enough to just generate 15 minutes of jaw-dropping visuals in a 2 hour movie. You need to be creative about what you're actually depicting. A $10 million scene that's carefully crafted into the film's narrative is always going to do more for the audience than a similarly expensive scene that doesn't bother to give the audience any real reason to care about what's happening. Terminator 2 is a movie where the director spends time on the non-action scenes, treating them as more than just filler, and this really pays off because instead of seeing a nifty visual sequence with some character you don't particularly care about, the excitement of the action scenes in Terminator 2 is actually enhanced greatly because you like the good guys on a deeper level than in a formulaic action film.<br/><br/>T2 is one of the high watermarks of action films. Everyone should see it, it's that simple."
"lincoln-maurice","8","18","22","26 April 2006"," Still going strong
","15 years on and still Terminator 2 remains a turning point in cinematic history introducing the world to photo-realistic computer generated 3D rendering. To this day, this is still an astounding achievement, however (ironically) these are the things that re-watching the film now, you notice as not being to the standard we now expect films to be.<br/><br/>As a result of this, you're then forced to look beyond the graphics in search of other quality. When I last watched it (about 3 weeks ago), something stood out to me that never did before because of no longer being mesmerised by the graphics.<br/><br/>This was the interactions between characters who are gritting, no nonsense, hard edged people, but those who care deeply for one another. In particular, I'm referring to Sarah and John Connor, but also to the inhuman T-101 in all it's programming trying to humanise itself (at the demand if John).<br/><br/>Though these might sound like day to day interactions (pardoning the whole terminator and robotic elements here), but to put them onto film and not have them feel forced or contrived is quite a feat, and all of these were achieved far above the expectation of one watching an ""action"" movie. You truly believe that John is devastated to have to lose T-101. You can tell he's fearful about Sarah going off to kill the man who would kill the world, unwittingly.<br/><br/>I urge you all to sit down and watch this film again. You will remember things you've long since forgotten, and maybe appreciate something you never even noticed was there before."
"RockDaddy","10","6","6","6 March 2005"," It's all about the sub-plots
","I will never forget the day when my dad took me and my three older brothers to see T2's premiere in 1991. I was only 6 years old. During parts, and at the end of the movie, people stood up, on their seats, and applauded louder than I have ever heard people applaud since. This is in my mind, at least one of the best 100 movies of all time. It's hard to beat out those older films that AFI for some reason greatly respects, but for their time, they were good too. What I like most about T2 is the sub-plots. The one sub-plot I enjoy the most is the greater awareness and human instinct of the Terminator as he evolves through the film. I'm a film student at Columbia College in Chicago, and I will tell you that this movie is very under appreciated. However, I will always be it's biggest fan, along with my best bro Panty. Here are some of my favorite lines: ""Good morning Dr. Silverman...how's the knee?"" ""He'll live!"" ""Sayyy, that's a nice bike..."" ""I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle.""

"jessx2001","10","9","10","24 September 2000"," More Than Just Action
","When this movie came out at the theatres, I was 15. I thought it was cool. I'm 24 now and I see this movie in a completely different light. I don't doubt that the movie has amazing special effects that makes the movie quite watchable if you just want to vegatate for a couple of hours. I don't doubt that there  might be a few plot holes and discontinuity in the time travel aspect of the story. This is something I have yet to figure out.   But after watching this movie a few times and reading critical reviews of the movie, I've come to this current opinion. If you bother to think about this movie beyond the great special effects, you might find that it has more to offer than the cool F/X. James Cameron is a very critical and detail oriented director. If you are familiar with his work at all, you will see an emerging theme in all of his movies. I believe that theme is humanity vs. technology. (THE ABYSS, TITANIC, ALIENS) In any case, the characters are an INTEGRAL part of the story and not simply the platform in which the action takes place. Compare this movie to say, practically any Jerry Bruckheimer movie. (Gone in Sixty Seconds anyone?) James Cameron thinks about his characters first before he can imagine the situation in which they may reasonably be confronted with. James Cameron says himself that the intent of the movie was to make people feel for a robot, to cry for him, and not simply to be blown away by the action taking place within the context of the characters and the story.<br/><br/>With this in mind, I see this movie as first and foremost, a human story. The whole premise of this story is the fight for humankind. Humans vs. Machines. I mentioned Cameron's theme earlier: humanity vs. technology. In this movie, the more technologically advanced we become, the more inhuman we are. Witness this as Sarah Conner becomes more of a terminator herself in her willingness to kill Miles Dyson. She does not question morally or ethically about why she is killing him. She is just going to do it. Before she does it though, she has an epiphany and she realizes exactly what she has become. It is shattering to her. There is such a moral fabric throughout this story voiced by our future hero: ""You can't kill people!!!"" And later on, ""Don't you get it?! Don't you understand why you can't kill people? Because we hurt, we feel pain, we're afraid..."" It is not surprising that John has such a strong moral fabric. After all, he is going to become a great leader someday. Ironically, it is his teachings to the terminator and the resetting of the CPU that makes the terminator more human. In the end, he becomes half-human and he realizes his half-humanity. ""I know now why you cry... but it is something that I can never do."" It makes his sacrifice even more greater. A hero is defined as someone who sacrifices himself for a greater good, something greater than even his own existence. Although the terminator could have stayed, he chose to go. In this movie, he is a true hero. Cameron chose to have this strong moral issue in the film... he did not want Arnold as the good robot killing everything in his way- which he could have easily done. After all, he is a terminator. He chose to weave this moral fabric into the story which I think many people easily overlook. The terminator teaches us a lot about ourselves too. This is a very spiritual aspect of the film. John says to the terminator, ""we're not going to make it, are me? People, I mean..."" to which the terminator replies, ""It is in your nature to destroy yourselves....""   It makes the theme and message of the whole movie even more meaningful. The theme of the movie can best be summed up by Sarah Conner, ""If a machine,a terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."" It took something as inhuman as the terminator to teach us something very human about ourselves: loyalty, love, fear, sacrifice, and hope. So before you write T2 off as just another action movie, I challenge you to watch it critically. This movie is about destiny vs. free will, (how much control over our future do we have? as john says, ""there is no fate but what we make of it ourselves."") and as I've said before, really about being human in such a technologically run world. Watch as Sarah fights to protect her son, watch as john just desperately wants his mother to embrace him and love him. Observe the quiet moments of contemplation and rest in this movie. This movie is not perfect as no movie is but as an action movie, it certainly provides a lot more than a two hour adrenaline rush."

"MovieManiacX","10","5","5","18 January 2005"," The Best Action Movie Ever
","Where do I begin? Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a great movie. It has everything that anyone could possibly want. Spectacular action, state-of-the-art special effects, well-developed characters, a touching story, thought-provoking ideas, and a wonderful cast make this an awesome movie. Easily in my top five.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the action scenes in this movie are, in my opinion, the best ones I have ever seen. Huge explosions, intense chases, awe-inspiring weaponry, and one of the most menacing bad guys I've ever seen are a great reason to see this movie, if nothing else. The chases keep getting better and better, starting with a riveting chase through a canal involving motorcycles and tractor trailer cabs and ending with a 'leaves-you-breathless' chase on a freeway with a S.W.A.T. van, a helicopter, and a tanker carrying liquid nitrogen. The weapons used are wild, most notably the scene when The Terminator obliterates the entire police force with a minigun and an M-79 grenade launcher. I could go on, but you get the idea. The action will blow you out of your seat.<br/><br/>The special effects are, even now, some of the best I've seen on film. The CGI used here is better than half the stuff that's in movies now. The morphing and reforming effects are amazing, especially when The T-1000 gets its head blown in half and it reforms instantly. WOW! I also got a kick out of when its gun gets stuck after it morphs through the jail bars.<br/><br/>The characters are excellent. Schwarzenegger is great in his best-known role and spits out many quotable one-liners, most notably ""Hasta La Vista, Baby."" Arnold as a cyborg has more charisma than Keanu Reeves. He evokes compassion, sadness, laughter, and had me cheering him on the entire time. Linda Hamilton is terrific as the tough-as-nails Sarah Connor, a major change from her innocent and desperate Sarah in the first Terminator. I'd be scared to even look at her. Edward Furlong is decent as John, and is never fully annoying. My only complaint is that his voice cracks a little too much. Everyone else is fantastic.<br/><br/>The message conveyed in T2 is very strong. We have become so dependent on technology today that it is taking over our lives. It's also developing faster and faster. It just shows you what could happen if we didn't stop to think, 'Hey, maybe we shouldn't create something that thinks just like us, and can learn at a geometric rate?' <br/><br/>But enough preaching. <br/><br/>The Bottom Line:<br/><br/>If you're looking for mindless action (which I'm a big fan of too) or a compelling story, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a superior film that mixes both of them and yields one hell of a result."
"dormesher-21565","9","4","4","14 October 2019"," Highlight of the franchise....
","Terminator 2 Judgment Day. An absolute classic movie and one the best sequels ever made and definitely my favourite in the Terminator series.<br/><br/>What a great film the action amazing the story incredible and the characters are outstanding.
Sarah Conner is a bad ass in this scene and the T 800 is awesome once again.
Also Edward Furlong is still best John Conner on screen.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 also has one the greatest villains ever in film the T1000 the liquid metal Terminator such an amazing villain and the effects are amazing and still hold up to this day.<br/><br/>The story is great now T800 being the good guy and seeing John grow up with a machine is a great way to turn the original movie on its head and add more the franchise like great sequels should.<br/><br/>The opening to the movie showing the war is incredible and still looks amazing today a great action set piece with great special and prectical effects.<br/><br/>My favourite moment in the movie is definitely the ending. The machine sacrifices its self to stop the war and John not wanting it to go is such an emotional moment.<br/><br/>Verdict 9.9/10 a classic movie that still holds up today with great special effects and great story this is the highlight of this franchise."
"Treg1980","10","4","4","23 January 2005"," T2 Special edition
","Any Terminator fans who agree with me that it was a shame that some of the deleted scenes (which were shown in the special edition) were some of the best scenes as well? I mean, Sarah's dream, in which Kyle visits her... Linda Hamilton is simply gorgeous, but more important, the whole scene is just fabulous. The scene in which the T1000 is on the phone with Jonh (who thinks he's talking to his foster parents) and then finds out the dog's name is Max instead of Wolfie). Then there's the scene where she wants to destroy the terminator's chip. And the scene at the end where we see an adult John with his daughter and mother at the playground. Linda looks great as a grandmother, and IF James Cameron would have kept it at the end, probably no one would have made that horrible T3 movie... For those who don't have a clue 'bout what I'm talking about, buy the special edition DVD and find out. It's so much worth the money!!!"
"Jim-500","Null","4","4","7 December 2003"," A simply great movie
","Terminator 2 is, for my money, one of the greatest films Hollywood<br/><br/>has churned out.  Everything in it is top-drawer: the script, acting,<br/><br/>directing, special effects, etc.  And you can't mention superlatives<br/><br/>without discussing Brad Fiedel's music!   <br/><br/>In this flick you get chases, incredible special effects, cool kid stuff,<br/><br/>twists, paradoxes, and even biting commentary on the sexes.   On<br/><br/>top of everything else, the movie also has a lot heart, with some<br/><br/>touching observations about humans and non-humans.  And, of<br/><br/>course, it also deals with where we're going as a race and the<br/><br/>possible catastrophes we're headed toward.  But far from being a<br/><br/>desultory comment on the end of everything, it also has a ton of<br/><br/>humor--some obvert, and some extremely subtle.  And the ending<br/><br/>may just bring tears to your eyes.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick, as the T-1000, is one of the great modern movie<br/><br/>villains.  He never lets up, even when knocked down time after<br/><br/>time, or having his head blasted in two.  He runs like a human, but<br/><br/>does not take setbacks like one--he gets up and keeps coming<br/><br/>after you.  <br/><br/>And that's one of the things that's endearing about the two<br/><br/>Terminators--they are super-strong, but not supernatural.  Bullets<br/><br/>don't stop them, but they do slow them down.  Thus we're able to<br/><br/>identify with them to a degree.<br/><br/>As far as chilling scenes go, who can forget when Arnold is<br/><br/>walking toward John with the box of roses, only to toss the box<br/><br/>away as he pulls out a shotgun?  And the T-1000's many<br/><br/>resurrections, especially the one of him slowly trolling along on the<br/><br/>police motorcycle, surveying the ruins of Dyson's living room?<br/><br/>Some people are undoubtedly put off by the series' titles, thinking<br/><br/>that these are crazed, violent movies with nothing to recommend<br/><br/>them.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  You'll definitely be<br/><br/>getting your popcorn's worth with T-2, and a lot more."
"Mer_Girl_Fits_Heaven","10","16","23","22 November 2008"," A Perfect 10
","This movie is perfect...seriously. That's a dangerous thing for a reviewer to say, but there it is. The effects are great (maybe not as ground breaking as they were back in the day, but they work, and they aren't overused). The story is gripping and original. The acting is spot on, and ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE. There are no ""why would he do that"" or ""why is she so ripped?"". This movie is so tightly constructed that the audience can suspend their belief and get thoroughly enraptured in it.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong deserves the ""Christian Bale Child Actor of the Year"" award. His portrayal of John Connor is vulnerable, intelligent and lovable. Linda Hamilton becomes her character utterly, body (0% body fat) and soul. And Arnold Schwarzenneger appears in the role he was born to play. He is remarkably engaging and (dare I say it?) comedic, for a man playing a machine. His performance is utterly believable. Robert Patrick (who doesn't have much charisma) is perfectly cast as the stone cold killing machine who looks like an everyman.<br/><br/>This movie is thoughtful, exciting and epically good. See it."
"dvc5159","10","13","18","12 April 2008"," My favorite movie.
","This movie is a rarity - if you manage to catch it on TV while channel skipping, you don't change the channel anymore; you just SIT DOWN AND WATCH. That's the commanding power of this film. It has something for everyone - young and old, for the typical summer movie lover to the hardened film critic, this movie has it all.<br/><br/>There are so many, many things that I like about this movie. Firstly, there are the action sequences. They are big, grand and spectacular in every sense. Since this is an Arnie/James Cameron movie, you know it's gonna be big. From the storm drain chase to the Cyberdyne police shootout, it is massive. Hordes of stunt-men are present here. You can tell they are dedicated when doing their job. #1 rule of action movies - always have a LOT of stunt crew around.<br/><br/>Next, the acting. Arnie is used to being Arnie, but instead of that, and also the creepy, relentless killing machine in the first film, here we see him as a worthy hero and protector, who will do anything to protect John. Some moments in the film shows the Terminator's humanization, an element which gives the movie more credit. To which I recall ""Arnie, do your stuff"". But, truth be told, Arnie gave a better performance as the villain in the first film than in this. Linda Hamilton is also highly commendable as Sarah Connor. In the first film, we see her as the damsel-in-distress, in this one, she's a gung ho commando mom who will do anything to protect her son. This also shows that she is a changed woman, both physically and mentally, as her adventures in the first film have shaped up into this Sarah, and we can't help but cheer for her. Edward Furlong also gives a charming performance as young John, who develops a strong father-son bond between his cyborg protector, an element which serves as the emotional theme for the movie. And, who would not review this movie without mentioning Robert Patrick's chilling and menacing portrayal of the seemingly indestructible and invincible T-1000? The cinematography is great. Adam Greenberg really picks the right scenery for the film to make it feel more ""epic"". The city of Los Angeles have never looked this wide. Also, the night scenes were incredibly shot, especially during the Cyberdyne shootout. The dark scenery is joined with a great dark yet heroic atmosphere which gives the film yet another one of its key elements, although frankly speaking, in terms of atmosphere and mood, my vote goes to the first Terminator movie, no contest.<br/><br/>The music - Brad Fiedel returns to give us not only his signature synthesizers, but also to give a new orchestral arrangement for the heroic tone of the movie. His score is fantastic, and the music fits the right places at the right moments. I wish I could hear more of Fiedel in the near future.<br/><br/>This movie wouldn't have been possible without the special effects and makeup. This film is one of the first movies to fully take advantage of CGI, but only, repeat, ONLY, during scenes with the T-1000. This is great, because limited CGI means more time for real pyrotechnics, gun-play, and vehicular play as well. VERY unlike the films made today, an example would be Transporter 2. So stylized and so unrealistic. Thankfully, and possibly hopefully, Hollywood have learned its lesson and will probably continue making old school action films, with action films like ""Live Free or Die Hard"", ""Casino Royale"" and recently ""Rambo"", which are all done old school style. That being said, the CGI in the film looks terrific and does not at all look aged. The makeup effects are also good, with realistic metal skull revealings. Both these elements easily surpass the first film.<br/><br/>Finally, I would have to comment on James Cameron, who wrote, produced, and directed this blockbuster. He practically delivers fast-paced, kinetic direction, and knows how to build up tension as well. As for the story, some may criticize it for being too redundant to the first (which I agree), but I think that Cameron has done a tremendous job for turning the dark and moody atmosphere of the first into a rip-roaring, no holds barred action adventure. And, giving us moral insights and predictions of machines turning against their creators. Really, if not for Cameron, then who? Overall, I think this is one of the finest films ever to grace the silver screen, and as of today still stands as a colossal and grand masterpiece few can beat. However, in that said few is the first Terminator, which is better than this film.<br/><br/>But that's just me being a harsh critic.<br/><br/>Now, being the little kid I've always been, this is my favorite movie. I first watched it on VHS when I was 6 years old in 1997 and since then I have watched it more than a dozen times and I never get tired of it. It's a film that will probably never grow old or outdated. This movie not only sparked my interests in movies, but also made Arnie into my favorite action hero. This film is the reason why I've decided to pursue my dreams into becoming a film director (after seeing the hard work and dedication the filmmakers put in while watching the documentary in the Ultimate Edition DVD), and also why I continue loving movies today. This movie is an inspiration to us all, and I strongly recommend anyone - anyone at all, to watch this film. This film, one or not on its own, is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Delton."
"jgordon1093","10","8","10","18 September 2009"," In one word: Brilliant
","Let me start by saying what everybody has already said, the acting is great, the story great, the effects awesome, the characters believable, the action brilliant. I don't know a soul who doesn't like this film. Me personally, I though this would just be another shame to the original, make lots of money, and throw in some effects just to make a good profit. But I was wrong in every sense of the word. James Cameron has come over and beyond, not just mine, but everyone's expectations and has put together a film that doesn't just focus on action or effects, but focuses on the characters as well. Which is why I like older movies better than newer movies. The thing about older movies is that since back in those days, there was no such thing as CGI, so instead of making the monsters or whatever look real and convincing, they made they characters convincing as well. Now, we could make a movie that is entirely CGI, and the problem with that is, that instead of focusing on the characters, they focus more on making the monster or whatever as real as possible, but they forget about making the characters real. I like this film because it's the on in a million that has good effects, and good characters."
"dandare4479","10","6","7","27 April 2012"," T2 - The first 100 Million Dollar Movie
","Terminator 2 is an amazing action packed movie from writer / director James Cameron. Arnold Schwarzenegger is at the top of his game returning to play the cyborg the T-800, his most famous movie role. James Cameron's love of Science Fiction and action coupled with the latest film making technology pushed the boundaries in 1991 to their limit. James Cameron uses classical action shots that allow the viewer to see what is going on at all times, something newer film makers/ editors should pay attention to. The reason this film works so well is down to the story itself and the concepts it deals with, James Cameron always writes interesting stories for us to think about but were he differs to 99% of other directors is he merges this with jaw dropping set pieces filmed with energy, often a moving camera shot he totally understands that this is an entertainment medium, he never forgets about his characters though and this why his films always have heart. Terminator 2 is one of the best action / science fiction films of all time, James Cameron is the best action director of all time and Terminator 2 is proof of that."
"stdaganov","10","15","22","2 June 2005"," The greatest movie of all times
","There are 40 000 movies, or, written in American style: 40,000 movies, made till that very moment by the American film industry, not to mention the international industries. Around 40 of these films, or 0,1%, are films so great, they need not only to be watched by every existing human being - but they need to dwell in the hearts of every human, at any moment, till their last breath. ""Terminator 2"" is the first of them all.<br/><br/>This is not only the greatest action movie, but it is the greatest movie ever made. It is a film that treats the highest possible theme in the art sphere - the theme about the self-sacrifice. In this movie everyone of the main characters sacrificed himself for somebody else. The child did it to save his mother, despite what she had told him about his importance. She did it for him and for the rest of the world. And at the end even the machine sacrificed itself, for the humankind - when it understood the value of human life and that its existence was a threat for it. The three of them did that without complaining, without expecting a reward or pretending for something. They did it because it was their duty, and they would fulfill themselves as humans by doing it. Plain, simple and genius.<br/><br/>To the people, who are dashing pretentiously at the time paradox, and to the other ones, who moan: ""I kinda didn't like it. I liked (place the name of ANY OTHER action movie here) more. There was more beating and explosions..."" - to these ones I say: you have completely and tragically missed the point of ""T2"", and as a result of this you have deprived yourselves of understanding and embracing the best film ever made into your hearts and souls. The last things ""Terminator 2"" is about, are pseudo-scientific riddles with time, or creating the best special effects of early 90s in order to make the eyes of the ""riping"" teenagers open widely in surprise and disbelief.<br/><br/>As I said, I will repeat again: it is a movie about the personal sacrifice, the duty and the destiny of the strong ones - not the ""written by some unseen force"" destiny, which you cannot change, only follow; but the destiny of the people who have a strong character. The destiny that they CHOOSE: to sacrifice themselves in order to fulfill their duty, and ultimately - their life; in order to prove themselves as humans. And they make this choice alone, on their own: the weak ones would ""duck and cover"", and run away in a similar situation.<br/><br/>There is another character in that movie, who showed human behavior and in the end of the film - as he turned weaker and weaker from a physical point of view, due to the inevitable damage by the superior technology - became more and more human. In the last moments of the film, in one recent Bulgarian voice translation, they translated it a little bit differently, in an artistic way, and I want to translate it ""back"" and write it here, to show you what I mean. It is a TRANSLATOR HIT: when the Terminator realized that it should sacrifice itself and go against its own nature, and in the moment when John started to cry, because he understood the necessity and the brutal fact that the T-800 WILL NOT OBEY HIM THIS TIME, because IT HAS TAKEN A DECISION ABOUT WHAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, T-800 said: ""Now I know why you cry. I WISH I ALSO COULD."" And then, after they hugged, HE - not IT - HE stepped on the chain. He had become human in that moment, in a certain way - as he was taking decisions on his own, and as HE HAD A WISH - a wish, that never turned into a dream, because he had to step on the chain. And if there is only one thing that I want to be remade in the original version, it's not all the goofs and inconsistencies, mentioned also in the IMDb trivia of the film - they prove that human beings, including the great directors, make mistakes - and they MUST - that's why they are human. What I dream to be changed in my favourite movie, is only this line. The line ""but it is something I can never do"" looks cold and alien to me now.<br/><br/>It is a movie that will not be surpassed soon - because a new film needs to find a higher theme than self-sacrifice in order to do it (apart from all the rest, which is needed - a good scenario, which makes everything to cohere in perfect harmony; directing from a genius and a visionary like James Cameron; acting from people BORN FOR THE ROLE - like Linda Hamilton and Schwarzenegger; innovative, but not overdone, or with overexposed and misplaced effects; having well arranged and nicely corresponding music; and so on) - while if it uses the same theme, it will be a REPEAT. ""Terminator 2"" was THE FIRST ONE, and THE GREATEST. And the way this film is made, the way EVERY FRAME IS SUFFERED THROUGH BY THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT, makes it both unbeatable and the epitome of all that is good and human in that world. And it is even something more: it shows what we are, IT IS WHAT WE ARE. It's so universal and refined, that if aliens come and want to understand us, the humans, in the space of two hours; to find what is our basic philosophy; what our fears and problems, and aspirations are - this is what they have to see. This film.<br/><br/>Such a movie appears once in fifty years."

","""T2: Terminator 2"" or ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is truly an example of how sequels can be better than the original.Here we are given more action, more special effects, more interesting characters, and a better terminator.It is truly a special and crowning achievement for director/producer/writer James Cameron.It's a film that knows how to make action sequences exciting and how to add some humor into them.That's something you don't get very often.I'll admit that the first movie was great, but it's mediocre compared to the greatness of ""T2"".The movie's key success is Arnold Schwarzenegger.Never will there be an actor who will do a better job as the terminator, for Arnold does it so perfectly that you think of him as a machine and not just an actor.I'll also admit that the villain is also a key role in the movie.Robert Patrick plays his role with lots of potential and you actually care that he's in the movie, even though he's a villain.There's also Linda Hamilton.She returns to her same old role as in the first movie, Sarah Connor.In the first movie, she just seemed like an ordinary person who's being chased by a killer machine.Here, she's a tough and smart character that never bores you and always keeps you interested when she's on the screen.Then there's the action and special effects.Outstanding, just outstanding.The film was made in the early 90's, and the effects are really this good?It just amazes me how Cameron knows how to put these great characters in these exciting action sequences.<br/><br/>To put it in a couple of words, this is a GREAT movie."

","This movie completely changed cinema. It was one of the first modern sequels to greatly improve on it's predecessor in every way. At the time of it's release it was the most expensive movie yet; and unlike today every dollar can be seen on screen.<br/><br/>The story, for not just an action film or a sci-fi film, is superb. Terminator 2 does not follow a typical sequel formula and the audience is greatly rewarded for it. James Cameron shows his uncanny craftsmanship in every frame. Each key character is given motivation and development that complement the direction of the movie. The performances in T2 are chilling, both Hamilton and Morton should have received academy award nominations for their efforts.<br/><br/>I have seen this film countless times, and have been rewarded by the special effects each viewing. When I first saw it in 1991, every effect was cutting edge. There was nothing like it and that was part of why it was so successful financially. Since that time effects have jaded viewers. I find that after Jurassic Park, CGI effects became too mainstream and you can see that many films turn into a rush job. T2 was a pioneer effort and so the effects are given the utmost attention.<br/><br/>I have to mention Arnold Scharzenger. With Arnold you get to see a cyborg performance that only he can do so well. You also are insured that that action scenes will be spectacular. Arnold has an on screen presence that most do not appreciate.<br/><br/>Other praises go to Stan Winston with his creature effects, and all other technical efforts in the movie. This movie also has the smoothest sound editing ever to complement the most outrageous chase scenes on the big screen. Today so many chases are noticeably computer crafted, and to me that takes the audience out of the action. Here we see real buildings,vehicles, and people with amazing results.<br/><br/>This is the first action movie to take a chance on an highbrow storyline, by giving characters rational thoughts. It raises questions on the effects that artificial intelligence could have on the world; while providing an exciting median for fans of action and sci-fi. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a great watch for any mature audience."

","Without a doubt, ""Terminator 2"" is one of the best movies ever made and perhaps the very best action film bar none.<br/><br/>The concept is absolutely superb and the execution could not have been better. It is indeed a sequel, but it can be watched without seeing the original because it really plays out as a stand alone movie. <br/><br/>The Terminator is a great character and the way that John interacts with it is really beautiful. The cast is all wonderful and could not have done a better job with their roles. Linda Hamlton is great as a tough, strong woman, Arnold is great as the machine that has a hard time understanding humans, Edward Furlong is great as the wide-eyed teen who is fighting for his life, and Robert Patrick is great as an emotionless killing machine. Everything is just so right.<br/><br/>Another thing that I must mention is the special effects. They were absolutely astonishing for the time. We had never seen anything quite like it in a movie before. Even today the effects are great. <br/><br/>Individual scenes are all so memorable with this movie. From the motorcycle chase, to the hospital escape, to the liquid metal scenes, to the introduction of the Terminator, to the final battle and destruction of the terminators, everything is so perfect and memorable.<br/><br/>The end is so great as well. I'm pretty sure I shed a tear when I first saw it and when the credits began to roll with the road in the background after Linda Hamlton's monologue, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It is that moving.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this, everything else should be put on hold and this should be priority number one."

","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the best action films ever made, that is a fact. It shows that a sequel can be even better then the original and expand on ideas set out in the first film.<br/><br/>T2 takes place 10 years after the events of The Terminator, set in year 1995. In the year 2029 the Machines set a second Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) to 1995 to find and kill John Connor (Edward Furlong) when he is a still a child. The Resistance also send someone to protect John, this time a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the same type of Terminator sent to kill Sarah Connor in 1984. John Connor has become a juvenile delinquent, living foster care, who runs away from home, steals bank cards, rides a mini-bike and goes to the arcade. Sarah Connor (Sarah Connor) had become a Luddite type terrorist, attacking computer factories, and ends up being locked up in a psychiatric hospital. When The Terminator saves John, John get the machine to help him break his mother out of hospital. It is after that event that Sarah, John and the Terminator should stop Judgment Day from happening, by attacking Cyberdyne Systems, as well as stop the T-1000.<br/><br/>Some elements of the plot may seen a re-tread of the plot in the first film, but James Cameron, being a skilled writer and director, expands on the ideas of the first film, showing more then just a chase movie. Sarah Connor has grown as a character, from the scared teenager to a strong, kiss-ass woman and it is Linda Hamilton's strongest role. Cameron has a love for strong female characters. Cameron focuses on two key elements on storyteller, plot and character, and that is why T2 is so good. As well as the action and sci-fi storyline, T2 is the eternal love-story between a boy and his robot. Seriously though, there is a strong relationship and chemistry between John and the Terminator, John teaching the Terminator to be more human, whilst the Terminator acts as a fatherly, guardian figure. Cameron also expands on the theme of fate and choice and that the idea of the future is not set in stone. The film also has some of the best one-liners ever in film.<br/><br/>The action is non-stop, relentless and some of the best you will ever see. James Cameron uses both old-fashion techniques for scenes like the chase scene with the truck, but also used to at the time top end special effects, which is effective even now. This film was the first to have a budget over $100 Million, and it is money well spend. The pacing is great, and can not get board during this film.<br/><br/>The Terminator is easily Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role because it requires very little acting. It also fun to see a role reversal in this sequel. Robert Patrick has a real menace as the T-1000, all he need was a look and didn't need to say much. He was a lot better then Kristanna Loken in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. It was also a smart move to make the T-1000 a regular sized man, not another muscle man. Linda Hamilton is tough and believable, whilst, Edward Furlong had a decent debut. I don't know what happened to him, from staring in T2 and American History X to staring in Uwe Boll films.<br/><br/>The Terminator was excellent, Terminator 2, even better, Terminator 3, don't bother.<br/><br/>An essential film."

"Svenstadt","9","3","3","1 December 2019"," Awesome effort and great fun.
","This movie is very raw and violent and is not for children. The action is solid, and it has some heart-churning moments, from John and Sarah in the car after the escape, to the ending. There are plenty of crying moments. In short, this is a complete action movie, with an ability to segue from one scene to another that hasn't been matched since then. The movie flows well, and the music matches the pace of the movie in lockstep. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because of the few mistakes, which kind of stand out: Arnold saying ""Hasta la Vista, baby,"" only to say next ""We don't have much time,"" was out of place; next mistake was when Arnold says, ""I need a vacation,"" after killing the T-1000, when he didn't learn to say that in the movie. Another mistake, the T-1000 didn't imitate the Arnold Terminator when he walked down to the garage - he could have fooled John and killed him then and there, because he had already touched Arnold during the fight in the galleria. Another bad part was when the orderly at the mental institution licks Sarah Connor's face, this made it into an even more disturbing film! In fact, all the mental hospital scenes were disturbing! Another part I felt was getting bad was after the mental hospital escape, and they start introducing character after character after character!! Luckily, I think they put a cap on the number of characters being introduced. This movie was about 1 step away from being a little too long and too epic and too violent and too menacing. I found the death scene of the T-1000 believable, if not a bit convenient. The deleted scene, where T-1000 malfunctions after being frozen, was a good scene. It seems that nothing other than molten steel could kill that thing."

The fact that even to this day I regard it as an all time great, the quality big CGI in the early 90's, this had to be the benchmark. The storyline is absolutely gripping and action packed! The acting by everyone shows true emotion and oozes passion! You could literally watch this film in any foreign language and still appreciate how brilliant every character is portrayed from start to finish. Un-predictable elements, thickening of the plot, and an un-deniable desire to push your feelings. This film is an inspiration. It has so much depth to it, from action, comedy, love, sci-fi and adventure. I've had enough of typing this review, hats off to the soundtrack aswell, it was totally spot on and played on the heart strings! I want to watch it again and again, right now! Absolutely love it.

","This movie is way beyond it's time, movies are made today that have poorer special effects. I remember when I first saw it, I was a young boy, I was so impressed it was all i talked about for a week, I even had dreams about it. It's just so cool how everything looks on the screen, the action scenes are amazing and Arnie never looked better. The terminator is the perfect role for him cause he doe-sen't have to act. The special effects are outrageously cool for that time, and the shaded colors give the movie that dark look it needs. What more can I say?

","This movie was the pioneer in special effects. Without this movie, we wouldn't have any of the ""Comic Book movies,"" the LOTR trilogy, and Jurassic Park. Some people say that Jurassic Park was the pioneer; I personally think it was this movie, but you can't leave out the Abyss that came out in 89. But I don't really count that because it was only a, what I call a worm coming out of the water. This movie has the T-100 walking through steel bars, changing into a police guard by just the makeup of his footprint, and when he gets shot, he refills the hole with his liquid metal. This movie has it all, tons of explosions, more of an in-depth look at Skynet, and has Arnold shooting at cops with a Mini Gun. This is just one of the best movies in my life time, and I hope you enjoy it as well if you haven't seen it. If you have, then you know where I'm coming from. Thank you for your time.

"Rob_Taylor","10","3","3","19 December 2002"," All in all a worthy sequel to the original and another classic Cameron action movie.
","Arnold Schwarzenegger, James Cameron. Two ingredients that go to make a hell of an action picture. Cameron always seems to get that little bit extra out of an action sequence, something that's a bit different from all the rest. And Arnie...what needs to be said about him. He gets to use a mini-gun again, just like in Predator, but with far more effect.<br/><br/>People have pointed out the ""inconsistencies"" in the plot, but that's just part-and-parcel of time-travel pictures. By it's very nature it's a paradox. So you have to give it a little leeway in the consistency department.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick is suitably emotionless as the killer android, but I couldn't help thinking the fight sequences between him and Arnie looked a bit weird - Arnie is seriously larger than Patrick. But only a little bit. They carried it off well enough, though.<br/><br/>Another minor niggle (now I've watched the film several times) is to do with continuity and editing. And that's the door to the SWAT van. As it's being chased along the street by the T-1000 (Patrick) in a helicopter, he fires at the van with an automatic weapon. We then see the door, with Linda Hamilton hiding behind it, firing back at the helicopter. The door has three big holes near the window. There's another exchange of gunfire, and cuts between the chopper and van, and the next time we see the door, it has loads of holes in it, but the three big holes have disappeared. Another exchange of fire/cuts and the van door is back to the three big holes only, again. It's a minor glitch, but it niggles every time I see it and ruins the scene for me now.<br/><br/>That aside, the picture has everything you'd want out of an Arnie action flick. Gunfights, explosions, Arnie one-liners, the works.<br/><br/>If you have a chance to see the extended edition it's worth it. Like with the Aliens special edition, it adds enough extra bits to make the movie more entertaining and worthwhile, but doesn't throw in anything that changes the plot much. There's a dream scene involving Michael Biehn (Reece from the original film) which is a nice addition, and some extra footage in the foundry at the end which better shows the problems the T-1000 had after being frozen.<br/><br/>All in all a worthy sequel to the original and another classic Cameron action movie."

","There is a saying that sequels never surpass the original. Well, this one does, and can I say, BIG TIME! Besides the special effects, and they are great, is the sheer terror and hopelessness the main characters are in. How do you stop a relentless, ruthless killing machine? Linda Hamilton was superb in T2.(I fell in love with that body!) She was almost as unstoppable as the machine in her pursuit of saving her son and mankind. I'm not a fan of your basic Sci-fi special effects. Snarling aliens drooling slime all over their victims, and gross mutant alien-babies popping out of humans don't thrill me. But it T2, Cameron does it best, it's more believable. With technology these things could happen. I was blown out of my seat with the EXTREME special effects, and chase scenes. This is the best action movie I have ever seen, BY FAR! If this movie doesn't blow you away, you better check your pulse rate. My recommendations? See it on a big screen and crank up the volume."

This movie has awesome special effects and visual effects, top notch acting and a very good storyline. In this film, the Terminator is sent back to protect John Connor and Sarah Connor from a more advanced more powerful terminator, the T-1000. I liked Robert Patrick's portrayal as the T-1000 in this movie. This is Robert Patrick's best film role to date so far. Sarah Connor is more psycho and more stronger in this film than she was in the first one. Like I said, I think this film is better than the first one. This movie is the breakthrough movie with the use of CG. Creating the first computer animated villain and a partially computer animated main character. This movie is definitely worth a watch and time well spent."

The visual effects still look impressive all these years later and the soundtrack is amazing. The T-1000 is probably one of the best baddies in a movie ever. It is totally relentless in it's attempts to kill John Connor and it's up to the older model Terminator (Arnie) to protect John at all costs. There's nothing about the movie I don't like and that's all thanks to James Cameron. I think it's amazing that Arnie was able to go from uber-villain in the original Terminator to uber-hero in the sequel whilst playing exactly the same character basically. I realise that he's a robot but I don't think anyone else could've played that part and Arnie excels here. As a now 32 year old man I know I'm supposed to be all tough and hardened but the ending ALWAYS makes me cry and I'm not ashamed about it. Totally amazing."

The characters go through changes, the dialogue is razor sharp, and the acting is wonderful. Arnold gives the best performance in his career. The jokes are often funny. Moments with The Terminator talking to John Conner are just as good at times as the big action sequences. The effects were groundbreaking at the time. The score is fantastic.

I personally find it impossible to look at Cameron's sequel as a 'film' to critique because it's simply so much greater than the confines of the silver screen. I'm currently sat with a tepid coffee, trying my best to conjure the brilliance of this epic and even with the worlds most extensive thesaurus I'd fail to do it justice.<br/><br/>Casting aside the sheer admiration I have for Cameron's ability to intertwine science fiction, action and romance so poetically, it's the overwhelming character the film has to offer that I feel sets it so far above the rest. Whether it's Cameron's off-hue blue-lit depiction of LA, Brad Fiedel's tragically heart-warming score, Robert Patrick's icy demeanour, Arnie's stoical charm or the final brutally touching words of Linda Hamilton, Terminator 2 simply oozes with a unique and unmatchable style, character and timelessness.<br/><br/>-10/10"

","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is perfect in every sense. When I watched Terminator 2 for the first time, I didn't understand anything, because I was new to English, but after re-watching it, I was completely amazed by what I missed out on. Terminator 2 is 50x better than it's predecessor even though that is good, but still it could not beat Terminator 2.<br/><br/>An evil terminator (Robert Patrick) is sent back from the future to terminate John Connor (Edward Furlong), who will later rise an uprising against the machines, and the terminator will do anything to stop John from living.

","This is my favourite film of all time. I am 25 years old. I clearly remember when I saw it when I was 10 years old and the thing that immediately struck me even though I was only 10 years old was how artistic and brilliantly directed it was. The main reason James Cameron made this masterpiece was not because he only wanted to make money. All the greatest movies of all time deal with an important issue about humanity and T2 is no exception. It deals with how humanity has a tendency to destroy itself. This is a very important universal issue and it affects each of us when we turn on the TV and hear news about various wars happening around the world. This masterpiece works on so many levels that it's truly amazing. It contains some of the best visual effects and action scenes ever put on film. It is a thrill ride from beginning to end and the great character interaction and drama never stops. During each action scene you always feel that the characters are fighting for the fate of humanity. By far James Cameron's best film and that is saying a lot. It's much more emotional and dramatic than Cameron's overrated and disappointing Titanic. T2 clearly shows that James Cameron is most creative and artistic when he is making an Action/Sci-fi film. Anybody no matter what age will consider this a great film. It only gets better with time and I love it now even more than when I was 10 years old. Should be in top 10 greatest films list. A timeless masterpiece."

","Usually sequels try to capitalise on the success of the first movie, replaying the same storyline, the same jokes, the same characters. T2 takes the story from the original Terminator, brings it forward, adds new characters, and takes the level of storytelling and special effects to a new high.<br/><br/>T2 takes the storyline and continues it, but not just cashing in, it gives more details, a background, and a future.<br/><br/>John Connor is a pre-teen (although the age discrepancy is actually quite funny) but even at this tender young age, he is a criminal: he steals money, knows more about firearms than the average army guy, and could handle himself in any situation. Sarah Connor is now a tough woman, locked up in a mental hospital for actually believing that Terminators exist. It's a plausible scenario.<br/><br/>The action is high class, plausible and adds to the story. James Cameron was testing his budget and the imaginations of those at Stan Winston's and it paid off.<br/><br/>This has got to be the best sequel ever- even better than the original."

Arnold Makes the best killer cyborg of anybody. He should have won an Oscar for his performance. James Cameron is the ultimate action/adventure director.

","This is, simply, the best action movie I've ever seen. I just cannot get enough of it! Everything about the movie is flawless, the direction, the visual effects(which are still stunning, mind you), the action, the pacing. Just utterly flawless.<br/><br/>James Cameron proved with this movie, not ""Titanic"", that he truly was the King of the World. He has created an action masterpiece. T2 set the bar for action movies for years to come, and that bar, in my humble opinion, has not been raised yet.<br/><br/>In T2, Ah-nuld returns as Cyberdyne Systems Model T-101, only this time his mission is to protect. He is not supposed to protect Sarah Connor, but her teenage son, John Connor, who was conceived during Sarah's night of passion with Kyle Reese in the original. Of course, you can't have a good Terminator movie without a decent bad guy, and this bad guy is more than decent. He's the Cyberdyne Systems Model T-1000. He's a polymimetic alloy, liquid metal to the lay person, more than a match for Ah-nuld.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick creates one of the absolute most menacing movie villains ever put to film. What makes him scarier than Arnold in the original is that he looks like an ordinary guy. He's clearly not a bodybuilder, yet his icy stare is utterly chilling. Arnold returns in fine form, though, proving that he can play a convincing good guy. He also throws in bits of comic relief, too, though it's mainly on the Director's Cut, aka the Extreme Edition DVD. Pick that one up; it's got a hilarious scene where John teaches the T-101 to smile.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton is perfect as Sarah Connor. She's buffed up since the last one, making for one heck of a butt-kicker. She also convincingly portrays an affectionate mom who, though she may sound insane, only wants to do what's best for her son.<br/><br/>The biggest standout, though, is Edward Furlong, who plays John Connor. He's the perfect guy to portray the spunk and resourcefulness's that John has. It's all the more spectacular in knowing that this is Furlong's film debut. Sadly, he wasn't able to return for T-3 because of his continuing drug problem.<br/><br/>I cannot do this movie justice! I've seen it many, many times, and I keep coming back for more. Everyone on the message boards agrees with me that it's one of the top 10 action movies of all time. Oh, I would want to caution parents before letting your kids see it. It's very violent, though not as graphic as it could have been. It's got some language, too, although compared to most of today's R-rated movies, it's fairly tame. See this movie now!

"ackstasis","10","8","11","23 November 2009"," ""The Terminator wouldn't stop, it would never leave him""
","Watching 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)' for the first time in three years made me remember how amazing movies could be. Director James Cameron had previously achieved unexpected success with 'The Terminator (1984),' a moody and relentlessly bleak tech-noir thriller. The inevitable sequel came armed with a blockbuster budget and state-of-the- arts visual effects, and it is a triumph on every level. The two films are very different, of course – just as Cameron's 'Aliens (1986)' was very different from Ridley Scott's 'Alien (1979).' The first Terminator film was a down-and-dirty dystopian sci-fi, where the modern-day setting is just as drab and ominous as the terrifying future. In 'Judgement Day,' Cameron juggles a tricky juxtaposition of hope and despair. The blindingly-vivid 1990s action sequences feel as though they were captured in the flash of a nuclear explosion, and their dazzling intensity make our glimpse of a bleak, war-ridden future all the more horrific.<br/><br/>Science-fiction has often tackled the notion that Mankind's technology is destined to rebel, as in '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).' However, unlike most entries to the genre, 'T2: Judgement Day' takes the time to explore the idea. As in Kubrick's film, the fates of humans and machines become inescapably entwined: Man is no longer merely the designer (a la Dr. Frankenstein) who creates an artificial son, but one who must learn from his progeny. Accordingly, John Connor (Edward Furlong) and the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) share a father-son relationship that twists back on itself like a Moebius strip, each half teaching the other. In one haunting sequence, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) grimly contemplates the Terminator's unwavering loyalty towards John, and his ironic suitability as a father figure. This grotesque interlacing of familial roles speaks a clear message: if Judgement Day is to be averted, Man and Machine must coexist as equals, though human vanity may never allow it.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Cameron weaves one astonishing action set-piece after another, utilising a seamless combination CGI and optical trickery. The T-1000 Terminator at first glance seems reasonably innocuous, but Robert Patrick brings something icily sinister to the role, a cold intelligence that isn't strictly mechanical but somehow filled with imagination. An equally fascinating character, I thought, was Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, a complete reversal from the innocent Sarah Connor of the previous film. Now emotionally hardened by the prospect of nuclear holocaust, Sarah sees only ghosts where she once saw people, her apathy stemmed only by her maternal instincts towards John. In a haunting dream sequence, Sarah Connor is powerless to warn a younger version of herself (representative of society at large) of the coming dangers, her screams consumed by a nuclear blast that levels cities and engulfs her in flames. Hamilton's performance is bold and ferocious, perhaps cinema's most intense female action role (not coincidentally, James Cameron also provided us with the runner-up, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in 'Aliens (1986)).'"

","I will always enjoy watching this film for all sorts of reasons. I really cannot find fault with the result, granted a lot of money was spent making it but for a pleasant change the money was well spent. It does help to see the first film first but in my opinion it stands on its own as a great film therefore it is not crucial. The quality starts at the beginning and continues throughout its 2 hours 20 minutes. I seem to recall Terminator 2 getting a cool welcome and mixed reviews at the time of its release in England. Fortunately the vast majority of people who have seen this film rate it very highly. This film has everything anyone might want from it, everything for me just feels right. I have read a lot of the reviews of this film and most of them are very eloquent about its contents and wax lyrical about this or that or all of the bits that make it up. I simply look at the whole and it is greater than the sum of its parts which I know isn't logical but it really is extremely enjoyable to watch. Like all great films the viewer needs to pay attention to the detail, it is well worth the effort, because it is clear that a great deal of time and effort went into the making of this film and all of the team that were responsible for the outcome should be satisfied on a job well done. I highly recommend anyone watch this film and you will probably find yourself watching it over and over again. The quality doesn't dissipate through repeated watching, for me a sign of a quality product."

The T-1000 is one of the best characters I have ever seen, because the special effects on the characters are so incredible, it makes it seem like it was done in real life, not in a computer.<br/><br/>Arnold is great, and better than he was in Terminator. I also enjoyed the actor who played John Conner, Edward Furlong. Little did we know that Christian Bale would be playing him nearly 17 years later. I also like Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner, and Robert Patrick as the T-1000.<br/><br/>Overall,Judgment Day is one of the best sci-fi thriller I have ever seen, and would go on to become one of the best movie sequels of all time."
"Jamie_Seaton","10","8","11","25 August 2009"," even better than the first
","now not many sequels surpass there originals but this one did in my eyes and in everyone else's eyes for that matter. this movie has gotta be the greatest science fiction film ever made, if not its very close. i'm so glad the first film is in the top 250 films of all time, i think its around 170. but whats even better is this second instalment of the terminator series is at around number 50 in the top 250..... well done, it deserves it.<br/><br/>i'm also really chuffed that this classic won 4 academy awards. goes to show that some action films can grab that many. <br/><br/>so Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the terminator which he plays beautifully. this time hes the good guy that has been sent back to the mid nineties by the future John Conner to protect himself as he is only a child in these times. the reason for John sending back the terminator the protect himself is because a very hi tech liquid metal machine posing as a human has been sent back to kill John so the resistance would be shattered in the future. the mother of John, Sarah conner is in this one too who teams up with the terminator and John Conner to kill the liquid metal assassin.<br/><br/>the first of these films is brilliant but this one exceeds to the next level and really shows how fantastic this story is and can get for the future films<br/><br/>among the cast are Arnold Schwarzenegger (terminator, predator) Linda Hamilton (terminator) Edward Furlong (american history x) and Robert Patrick (cop land, die hard 2) they all play brilliant parts in this fantastic sequel<br/><br/>be sure to watch the first one before watching this because you'll ruin the story. i would recommend anyone to watch this because its not just a science fiction film...... its a well planned out science fiction classic. just look at the top 250 and you'll see why you need to see this.......... 10/10........j.d Seaton"

","Terminator 2: Judgment Day Is One Of The Best Movie Sequels Ever Created.<br/><br/>Reason's Why: Characters. The character's are just incredible, They all act very well. it seems as if i'm watching something that's really happening. 5/5<br/><br/>Action: The action is some of the best i've ever seen! lots of explosions lots of action. if your a action fan this is the movie for you. 5/5<br/><br/>Special Effects: The special Effects are Where incredible for the time and still are. its a good way to use CGI instead of spreading it all over the screen. now i don't hate CG i just think it's used to often. And the special effects are not what the films all about. its the acting and the characters. 5/5<br/><br/>Dialog: The dialog was very well done it was never cheesy/corny. if you are picky about bad dialog you won't be picking around! 5/5<br/><br/>Plot: <br/><br/>In 1994, a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of humanity in a 21st century war against machines. A competing machine (Robert Patrick), the T-1000, is sent back to kill John. With the aid of John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton), the cyborg manages to destroy the T-1000 at a confrontation at a steel mill. However, the cyborg must then destroy itself in order to eliminate its chance of being used to help fuel the future war with the machines. Sarah helps the cyborg destroy itself, but not before the cyborg consoles John, quietly assuring him that everything will be okay. Sarah then notes that if a machine can learn the value of human life, perhaps people can, too.<br/><br/>The plot is fantastic, the best i have ever seen! 5/5<br/><br/>Overall Terminator 2 is the best film ever made in my opinion.<br/><br/>its a A++ Film its much better then the first but thats not saying the first its bad its one of my favorite films.<br/><br/>5/5 for terminator 2<br/><br/>Thank You For Reading This.<br/><br/>-Addison The Movie Reviewer"

","Good Stuff! This movie is perfect. What else can I say? Arnold is back as the Terminator and this time his mission is to protect John Connor from another terminator, the T-1000 played by Robert Patrick (awesome!).<br/><br/>At first I was afraid that John Connor would ruin the movie as the annoying kid we see in many movies. I was wrong. As the focus lies on the chase between the two cyborgs and by the way, Arnold has never been this cool!(taking movies as Predator, Conan, Commando and T1 under consideration) <br/><br/>Having him on his Harley with the shotgun is priceless! Every aspect of this movie is awesome and this is my number 1 movie of all time. There isn't a single lame scene which gives you a ride you will never forget.<br/><br/>10/10 is an understatement..."
"insomniac_rod","10","8","11","28 January 2007"," Probably the best Action movie ever made.
","This is probably the best Action film of all time. It has all the ingredients for being considered the best of the best.<br/><br/>First of all, back in 1991, this was the ""ultimate"" movie with spectacular f/x and action sequences. Nowadays, the movie does not look dated and still manages to shock me with it's surreal nightmarish post-apocalytic settings and monstruous robot action.<br/><br/>The f/x are great, great but that's not the best thing about the movie; ""Terminator 2"" spends a lot of effort on the fantastic plot and character development. There's no need of extreme use of f/x because the characters have interesting backgrounds and you really get into them. The plot is simply great. It's a futuristic tale involving the end of the world at the hands of technology and at the same time, a war between humans and machines.<br/><br/>The action is non-stop and lets you wanting for more. I couldn't have enough of Arnold and co., spectacular guns, amazing explosions, and memorable chasing sequences on the freeway, motorcycle, etc. This movie ranks high on the fun factor and entertaining factors.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a kickass performance. Every time he says ""Hasta la Vista Baby!"", ""No Problema"", and the other trademark lines my skin crawls. It's part of pop culture and fits perfect for the movie's feeling. Linda Hamilton who is sexy as hell delivers a brave and solid performance. Special mention for Edward Furlong who delivers a great performance. But Robert Patrick steals the show as the villain. He was impressive.<br/><br/>James Cameron created one of the best movies of all time and brings us the best possible action ever seen on movies. Also, there's room for glorious gore and non stop violence.<br/><br/>Not else much to say but, I truly recommend it for everyone. It's one of those movies that will change your point of view towards cinema."
"Hellrazr360","9","8","11","8 February 2006"," Blazing Sequel That Terminates Almost Every Other Sci-Fi Movie
","""The future has not been set, there is no fate but what we make for ourselves"". These are the words that set the way The Terminator moves forward. The same applies to Terminator 2: Judgement Day, which is one of the greatest sequels ever made in filming history.<br/><br/>Like The Terminator, T2 has a Terminator and a protector sent back in time to change the future. But a couple of rules have changed in T2 that make it a different movie. For one, Sarah Conner is no longer the target of the Terminator, it's her now born son John Conner. The other changes is that instead of a Terminator and human soldier sent back, two Terminators are sent to find John Conner. The model sent to protect John is the same as the Terminator from the first movie, so Arnold is back but he's turned a new leaf. The model searching to kill John Conner is the more advanced Terminator, the T-1000, or Alloyman as I like to call him.<br/><br/>T2 takes place about ten years after the first Terminator, and a bit has happened since then. One being that John Conner is born and living the life of a typical bad kid. The other and the more surprising being that Sarah Conner is now locked up in a mental institute, where unlike the first, she is now a tough and strict woman that does at times seem close to crazy. Since John of course can't live with his mother he's raised by adopted parents which he obviously loathes, being the computer hacking, bank-stealing kid he's become. The story of how Sarah and John got to where they are is told through the plot segments of the movie so the viewer doesn't feel completely lost.<br/><br/>Like it's predecessor, T2 focuses on tense and suspenseful action sequences with plot segments in-between as its means to entertain. And like the first, this technique pays off thanks to some more exciting and memorable scenes. Such scenes that T2 is famous for include the first and last chase scenes in the movie and one of the best endings ever. The plot segments that go before and after the action scenes are more or less story-telling scenes that fill the viewer in on what they have missed between the first Terminator and this Terminator movies.<br/><br/>Again, Arnie is back but he's changed. Instead of being a ferocious killing machine he's now a softer and less menacing character. The newer Terminator is played by Robert Patrick, who brings a charming yet obviously deadly personality to his Terminator role. Linda Hamilton returns to play Sarah Conner but she like Arnie has changed, but she's more like Arnold was in the last Terminator movie instead of the innocent hostage-like chick from the first. As for John, he's unprofessionally played by Edward Furlong, but at least he gets the job done as John, but just barely passing.<br/><br/>Fans of the first Terminator movie might feel a bit betrayed by the changes in the characters but Cameron actually took a logical direction with the characters and it pays off surprisingly well. Most of the movie seems dedicated to allowing the viewer to establish an accurate with the new and old characters to the movie. This combined with some unforgettable action scenes help to make T2 one of the better movies to find a certain love for, one way or another. This works especially well in the perfect ending that many fans will say was the real ending to the Terminator movies despite the release of T3.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 stands as a monumental accomplishment that shows the peak of James Cameron's directing talent. As Arnold said in the first Terminator ""I'll be back"" and he did come back and brought back a fresh supply of excellence. The great action is back, the excellent story-telling is back and the great acting, despite some obvious complaints in Furlong and perhaps Hamilton and Arnie's roles is also back nonetheless."

You see the beautiful thing about is that you can watch it whether you 7 or your 70 it doesn't matter movies like this come once in a lifetime and is a big reason why I'm in film school right now this thing that Cameron created is a bloody inspiration.

","There are many people who call T2 the best sequel to date, others claim it is the best SciFi flick they've ever watched, but I would like to say: I never felt as privileged to be shown a movie as with this one. There are of course the more obvious fields in which this film excels, like mind-blowing special effects (especially for the time when it came out) and acting at its best (thanks Linda!), but there is so much more to it! A unique, original and very becoming soundtrack, cinematography that makes every still a picture to be hung in a living room and James Camerons virtually unmatched direction. All these factors combined would make a fantastic movie alone, but this one's got more: Heart, love and an unforgettable story. To see that so much emotion, reason and art can be expressed through a movie of the SciFi/Action genre that is stunning and entertaining at the same time - this is the ultimate joy of being into the movies."
"vailsy","7","19","32","26 June 2011"," Preferred the 1st one then. Still prefer it now
","Don't get me wrong, this is a great film but it is much more child friendly compared to the first movie, and is more commercial <br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with it is that the whole Mexico thing goes on for far too long and the movie loses a huge amount of it's pace. I have never been able to fully engage with this movies second half for that reason. Granted the first film also slows down mid way-ish but for nowhere near as long, and we always feel that Sarah and Kyle are being relentlessly hunted and in considerable danger. Indeed, they are attacked immediately after and so the pace continues<br/><br/>In Judgement Day we know the characters are in a place of relative safety at this point in the movie and the feeling of pursuit is well and truly lost from thereon in<br/><br/>I much preferred Arnie as the bad Terminator, and find a lot of the comedic aspects of this sequel goofy, taken to a further extreme in the third outing. They also date the film further<br/><br/>I feel that the first movie has strangely aged better than this one. It is set firmly in the 80's but without all the stupid guns and roses and other obvious 'cultural' references. The liquid metal thing while amazing at the time would let's be honest, look a little crap to young eyes I'm sure. The opening sequence is still brilliant <br/><br/>The sound in Judgement Day is unbelievably good. All the weapons sound fantastic and full of character, especially the grenade launcher, mini-gun and the T1000's Beretta. Although I did prefer the delayed style heart beat effect in the first one which intensified the tension and was a very clever audio cue. They use a similar device in Judgement Day but it's not nearly as good<br/><br/>A great movie that absolutely shouldn't be missed, but I find The Terminator stands up much better to repeated viewing"
"gregory-anderson-2","9","10","15","13 April 2006"," We've Nuked 'Em!
","This film is a mini-gun of action scenes, tearing you apart before throwing you several meters across the cinema. But nowhere does a dystopian film start more aptly than in the opening shots of a sweltering LA traffic jam transposing into nuclear fire.<br/><br/>The dynamic difference between Terminator 2 and the original Terminator is that Arnie now plays an anti-hero. Despite that being common knowledge before the film was released, for me that is a spoiler. Because the first meeting of the T-1000 and the T-800 should lead us to suspect that the machine in police uniform is the saviour, and the robot in biker leathers is the monster. And when the T-800 protects John Connor instead of killing him, we are thrust into the There are so many fantastic action scenes to relish in this film - the bike chase scene with one-handed shotgun reloads, the police shootout scene with the T-800 brandishing a helicopter mini-gun, the T-800 surfing the upturned nitrogen truck. This is the standard of the action genre.<br/><br/>You should acknowledge, however, that Terminator 3 has action scenes, perhaps on an even greater scale than Terminator 2. But this film is more. The industrial soundtrack emphasises the unstoppable, pitiless drive of the machine. The development of mother and son develops, somehow, what should be unchanging machine. Taking the place of the missing father-figure for John Connor, the T-800 becomes the protector we desperately need in the face of the relentless T-1000.<br/><br/>Credit must extend to Cameron's unique direction, who mixes an intense and serious action with occasional dark humour - witness John's attempts to make the T-800 speak 'cool language'. In painful contrast, the tone becomes franchise slapstick under Jonathan Mostow's direction in Terminator 3 - hear the self-congratulatory bird singing in the aftermath of the mini-gun shootout.<br/><br/>Your final focus, however, should be on the implications that the T-800 has on our relationships with each other. To take the words of Fight Club's Tyler Durden, ""Our fathers left us. If our fathers were role-models for God, what does that say about God?"" Sarah Connor offers us one possible reply to this indictment, ""Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."""
"gigan-92","10","6","8","27 October 2010"," Among Cameron's Best
","A+ Following the first film came a rare sequel indeed. It is beyond rare to find a sequel that takes it predecessor and expands it, deepens it, and ultimately surpasses it tenfold. And ""Terminator"" was a good movie all its own. ""T2"" does that in almost every way imaginable.<br/><br/>With ""T1"" we were left with a lot of unanswered questions, but here we get those and more. We have a very good cast rolled out here for audiences to enjoy, among them obviously Arnold and Linda Hamilton as a tougher Sarah Conner. Edward furlong is the legendary John Connor, a role that I doubt few of that time could fill. I won't drag this on any longer than I have to seeing as everybody's' seen the film by now. The thing that sets this film apart from many films is the characters and a well driven story. Most action films are easily forgettable with characters I could care less about. You're just there for the big explosions. But Cameron develops his quite well. And as the movie nears its end, we are left with a very good interpretation of who they were and why they did what they did. The terminator undergoes a complete transformation from the first film as a silent and menacing killer to a being we know is definitely not human but we care for it just the same. Exuberantly well done. That role is replaced by the T-1000, played by Robert Patrick. Even more menacing as than the first one really.<br/><br/>The action is obviously well played, fresh and VERY intense. Unlike today's CGI over laden, over the top antics. An unrivaled achievement of film history and a legacy that lives to this day."
"LtDT89","10","6","8","7 December 2009"," The...ultimate...action flick
","I consider this movie to be a classic, and for good reason. The CGI is amazing, even for today's standards, and this was released back in '91! The action is explosive, the directing is superb, and the acting was very good, at least believable! Action movies don't require a lot of acting, heck even a coherent plot, but this movie delivers both big time thanks to film master, James Cameron. The plot sets back in '91, where we see the famous ""Ahhnold!"" teleported back in time, not to kill Sarah Conner or even her son, but to protect them, from the vicious, more advanced T-1000! The plot change is enough to make fan excited, because now you know your in a whole new better adventure, and not just more of the same. It's actually very touching to see ""The Terminator"" develop a relationship with young John Conner within the movie as it progresses. I'll admit, I wept a little bit in the end when ""the terminator"" sacrificed himself for the good of man kind, and as he's drowning in the pool of lava, he gives a thumbs up to John for a mission accomplished, seeming that ""the terminator"" actually has a conscience, if not a heart. For me though, I give this movie two thumbs way up! The effects are awesome, especially from the T-1000 aka liquid metal, it has the most memorable action/chase scene I can remember in a movie when T-1000 is chasing little John Conner with a big mack truck. Bottom line, this movie has it all. It's not just a terrific action film, it's a terrific film period!!"

"joecoolbrad","10","6","8","4 July 2009"," Possibly the greatest sci-fi film in existence
","Strong points: Surprisingly complex and deep characters. solid acting, sweet action, special effects that still hold up in this day of CGI and advanced particle effects.<br/><br/>Weaknesses: Minor plot holes that nobody cares about, oh who am I kidding, this film is flawless.<br/><br/>I say this a lot to people who ask me about movies like Trnsformers that are based solely around action and special effects: The fact that a movie is centered on action and special effects doesn't automatically make it a bad movie. Many people disagree with this, believing that action is useless without characters and plot.<br/><br/>This film is an excellent case for both people.<br/><br/>The acting is better than any I've ever seen from any sci-fi film. Linda Hamilton is by far the best actress in this film. I am very sorry to say that she never went anywhere after this excellent film. Arnold actually is very good in this film, and manages to play the stoic, but increasingly human father figure to John Connor.<br/><br/>That brings me to another area where this film excels, the characters. Every one of the main characters is given depth and emotional realism. The film even explores Sarah Connors psyche, and how it affects her actions.<br/><br/>This film also has the some of the best action we have ever seen in a film. Each action scene is expertly crafted by James Cameron. the special effects are so excellent, they still look good, 15 years later after many innovations in computer technology. The only other film I know of to do this is the original Star Wars.<br/><br/>The film has one factor which may make or break the experience for some. I for one, enjoyed this element. The fact is, before watching this, pay careful attention to the MPAA rating, because this film is very violent and disturbing. I loved the fact that they had no problem showing everything, but for some people, this may ruin the experience, I don't know, I've never had much problem with violence.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Watch this movie, if you can take the violence. You will enjoy yourself."
"mitchelledwards","10","6","8","1 July 2009"," An Excellent Action Epic
","It seems that James Cameron only knows how to make epics, with films like Terminator, Titanic, True Lies, Aliens, and The Abyss it is no surprise that T2 is considered one of the best action films ever made. The special effects are phenomenal and still hold up today, of course you can see more of the flaws but they don't take you out of the film. Arnold is just Arnold but he does give more vulnerability to the role than he did in the original and yet he remains bad ass. Then there is the phenomenal performance of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor watching it again recently I realized how good of a performance she gives in this not just emotionally but how much she really became the character physically. There are so many good action scenes in this that I can't just mention one that stands out, but one of my favorites is the causeway chase at the beginning. Last but not least I want to mention Edward Furlong's performance this was his first film and you can tell that sometimes he is unsure but the performance grows on me every time I watch the movie. If you haven't already seen this masterwork definitely check it out, and to James Cameron keep the action coming."

","If not the best Sci-Fi movie ever, then at least heads TOP 5. <br/><br/>It is hard to describe awesomeness of this movie. Made back in 1991 it possesses all the elements of a modern Hollywood masterpiece, and still retains its originality reminds of that era in 1970s-80s when there were no rip offs and directors like Coppola and Scorsese were defining the meaning of MOVIE MASTERPIECE. James Cameron achieved the same thing in a totally opposite genre. <br/><br/>In this movie he depicted such a vivid and deep vision of an apocalyptic turn of the events, a consequent doom of mankind as he saw it in a modern world where hastened evolution of technology implied a disaster so deterrent as a nuclear war. The screenplay keeps your attention to the very end, and visual effects were kind of revolutionary. <br/><br/>A high level entertainment unveiling a much greater message than the plot itself. I'm a dedicated fan of T1, but the sequel is without a match.<br/><br/>Without the vision, this movie would be nothing. The visual allegory of nuclear fire destroying playground and terminator skull emerging from flames as the utmost outcome... That's some good stuff. In moments like that can one discern the true quality of the movie. Sarah's dream sequence is one of the highlights of the movie, and again would be ridiculous without the(director's) vision <br/><br/>The iconic intro and credits were composed brilliantly and the music theme couldn't be more fitting to the whole idea. Never before, nor after, have I heard a theme that describes the message of a movie so appropriately.<br/><br/>The movie itself tried to maintain the touch with younger audience by implementing kitschy innovations but on the other hand directors like Spielberg maintain this as their freaking modus operandi.<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger's blunt acting fits in this role perfectly, and T2 spawned some memorable one-liners. It really somewhat captured the 80's/early 90's cultural zeitgeist.<br/><br/>There is a lot of appropriately implemented shooting and explosion scenes, and fight between the terminators. Still, I have to mention that this part perhaps did not intend to leave space for a sequel and I'm not a fan of T3, but I think it's nice to see other directors making their own versions of this cult franchise. <br/><br/>10/10."

Showing up the T-101 and John Connor find Sarah and quickly escape as the T-1000 pursues after them. <br/><br/>Hiding out somewhere Sarah Connor discovers who created the SkyNet Super Computer and sets off to kill him and change history. The T-101 and John Connor arrive at the house and find Sarah, Miles and his family. Telling him about what will happen if he creates the SkyNet Computer he decides to help them get the Arm and Chip from the previous T-101 unit and dispose of them thus preventing the War between Man and Machine.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a great sequel that should be seen and just like The Godfather Part II and Aliens it's a prime example of how to make a great sequel.<br/><br/>Check this film out. 10/10"
"epatters-3","10","6","8","21 May 2008"," Best Terminator movie ever.
","I am a 11 year old fan of the first 2 Terminator films(I hated T3). Even though these films are Rated R, I am allowed to watch these films(One of the few R rated film series I am allowed to watch). It is a fact that is this is the best of the series. And I agree with that fact. Terminator 2 is the second best time travel movie. The only time travel movie that is better then this is Back To The Future. This is also the second best sequel. The only sequel that is better then this is THe Empire Strikes Back. This is better then Terminator 1. Yep you heard me. This is better then the original and thats a fact. It has some humor. It is not as violent as the first one. It is more of a Sci-Fi picture then the first one mainly because of the T-1000. This is my 5th favorite film ever. John Connor is a cool 10 year old kid in this film. Arnold Schwarzenegger's best picture. MPAA Rating:R. My MPAA Rating:PG-13. I love this film because of it's plot, it's humor, and Arnold. Some people on the internet bash this film because of Eddie Furlong. He is not annoying. Great movie."

","It is no doubt that T2 is one of my favorite movies and I'm still so exciting when i see the toys the DVDs the pictures all about T2 even nowadays. When I first touched the Extreme Edition DVD collection, I forgot how to breath... What a great masterpiece!<br/><br/>We can tell lots of reasons to explain why so many people love T2: the visual effects, the acting, the direction and many many other ones. I'm very agree with all of them. We can say that that's just the every part of T2 is perfect makes the whole movie so extremely perfect. Because of this, there is no need for me to write all. But I still want to mention one point, every time I see T-800 drowning down and disappear in the end, every time I cannot help being deeply touched. And that's the most successful part of the movie I think. It gives machine a heart, a kind of sensation. The machine is not only to live for a mission. He becomes a human's friend, a woman's protector and a kid's father. Although he can never cry.<br/><br/>When John full of tears, the tear's flowing in my body too."
"dee.reid","10","6","8","14 January 2008"," ""T2"" review
","In director James Cameron's first ""Terminator"" film, the story held that in the post-apocalyptic future of Los Angeles 2029 after a rogue super-computer called Skynet became self-aware and initiated a worldwide nuclear strike and waged a subsequent genocidal war on mankind, humans are on the verge of being wiped out by the machines that have taken over the world. However, a revolutionary leader named John Connor will rise to power and lead the human resistance to eradicate the machines. Since Skynet is on the verge of losing, however, it sends a cyborg assassin, called a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), back in time to 1984 to eliminate the man's mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton).<br/><br/>It failed.<br/><br/>A few years later in Cameron's high-powered, special effects-laden ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" John Connor (newcomer Edward Furlong) is still a teenager, a wily and rebellious teenager, with the full weight of the future on his adolescent shoulders. Skynet, however, has one more card left up its sleeve: it sends another Terminator, an advanced prototype, the shape-changing T-1000 (Robert Patrick), to strike at Connor once again. The human Resistance reprograms another Terminator as a protector for John. It's only a question of which one will reach him first. So both Sarah and John are forced to team up with their cyborg protector if they are to avoid the T-1000 and the horrific future from which it came.<br/><br/>Just to get this out of the way, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is in many ways superior to ""The Terminator."" Made on a significantly higher budget (at least 10x that of ""The Terminator""), Cameron employed many different ideas and special effects tricks that he couldn't do because of the budget limitations he faced on the first film. While I still hold that Cameron's original 1984 ""The Terminator"" is the greatest sci-fi movie ever - an unrivaled triumph of one ambitious filmmaker's fever-induced dream - ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a triumph of its own. Although for me problems arise with the setup and the repeating of plot devices from the first film, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" shows just the length of Cameron's vision as a filmmaker. His writing here, with William Wisher, is not as strong or as sophisticated as it was in the first film, but the ideas remain powerful enough to get his vision across.<br/><br/>The film is still a technical marvel, though, with crystal-clear cinematography by Adam Greenberg and some pretty strong and convincing performances. Schwarzenegger, doing his best turn as a ""kinder, gentler Terminator"" (and surrogate father), does what could be considered his best performance as a machine, but for me, his best performance is that of the relentless Terminator from the first movie. Like the first film, you ""believe"" that he's a machine in human form. But here he's given a chance to learn as a Terminator, and not be such a machine all the time, which does allow for some touching and humorous interactions with the young John Connor. (I cannot believe I just wrote that about Arnold.) Hamilton continues the trend established in Cameron's earlier ""Aliens"" (1986) with strong female characters. Quite simply, this is her best and most memorable performance as well. She's one tough, beautiful, and formidable presence on the screen under Cameron's guidance. Like Sigourney Weaver, she helped to usher in a new generation of beautiful a**-kicking females. Most surprising here, though, is the newcomer child actor Edward Furlong. This is one of the most impressive debuts of any child actor ever, especially from one of absolutely zero acting experience beforehand. He finds the core of his character and truly brings the role of an adolescent John Connor to life brilliantly, and we're allowed to see shades of the brave future leader he is to eventually become.<br/><br/>More to the point of why I love ""The Terminator"" and its following, is Cameron's vocal decrying of nuclear holocaust and the ascension of man-made over made-men. The first ""Terminator"" is a hot-bed of vocal opposition to nuclear armament with a strong anti-Cold War sentiment and the rising of technology in our society as we become more and more mechanical at an alarming rate. That to me, is what makes ""The Terminator"" such socially relevant science fiction. Unfortunately, though, this vocalization is much stronger in the first film than it is in the second one, which is more action-oriented (even though the film has received positive accolades for its horrific depiction in nightmare sequences of nuclear holocaust).<br/><br/>""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a much more brilliant and more technical film than its predecessor, and for that I'm thankful Cameron was able to bring his vision to life with a capable cast of talent and special effects artists. The original ""The Terminator"" is still my favorite sci-fi movie ever and Cameron's true work of genius. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is still a brilliant exercise in high-charged sci-fi entertainment and nothing more.<br/><br/>10/10"

","What can I say that hasn't already been said (and hasn't someone already said this exact line?) about this film? The film that cemented James Cameron's place in the Hollywood industry, the film that broke box-office records, the film that jump-started Edward Furlong's career, the film that made Arnold Schwartzenegger a bonafide action star, the film that pioneered groundbreaking special effects...it's all here in spades. You name it, T2 has got it. Great acting (even from the big man himself); kick-ass action scenes; wicked effects; and the list goes on. If you just look past the whole time paradox problem (yeah, I know, it's a big problem) and a couple of the effects shots (the dummy of Arnold is very noticeable when he's walking towards the SWAT team and getting shot up in the Cyberdyne lobby), but those are negligible, you will really enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Get it. NOW. And try to find the ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD of the film, because it's got more extra features and a DTS track."
"ShadySovereign","10","6","8","13 August 2005"," The best sequel of all time!
","""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is an extremely good sequel to the sci-fi classic ""The Terminator"". Although I like the first movie much better, I think the second movie was pretty good for a sequel.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in this film as the Terminator himself, except this time he is one of the heroes (which made him a big Hollywood star). Linda Hamilton also returns as Sarah Connor, one of the heroes, and she is much stronger than in the first movie. And Earl Boen returns as Dr. Silberman, possibly the most hated character in the first movie (and in my opinion, even more hated in this second film).<br/><br/>The new characters introduced are the menacing T-1000 (played by Robert Patrick) who is a menacing evil Terminator model, John Connor (Edward Furlong) who is Sarah Connor's son, and Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) who is the person responsible for the future war between the humans & the machines.<br/><br/>This sequel brilliantly focuses on all the main characters very well (although not as much as in the first film). A special bond is created between John Connor and the Terminator towards the end, and Sarah develops a special bond to her son.<br/><br/>The special effects in ""Terminator 2"" have improved greatly over the first film (although I like the first movie's special effects better for some reason). There were some spectacular explosions, and the T-1000's ""liquid metal"" effects were awesome and will remind hardcore-movie-fans of the watery creature in ""The Abyss"".<br/><br/>To sum up, there are many great things about ""Terminator 2"". Nevertheless, it lacks originality in some areas despite some new ideas & modern special effects. The original movie ""The Terminator"" was a more original film and was such a classic for its time in the 1980's. But still, the 2nd movie was pretty good for a sequel and it was very good.<br/><br/>I give this film a 10/10."

","Probably the greatest science fiction / action film ever Terminator 2 is almost the greatest sequel ever. That goes to Camerons other opus Aliens. In fact Cameron is so good at sequels Titanic 2 would probably be something to look forward too rather then fear. Unlike another Amityville Horror film.<br/><br/>T2 takes place several years after the original. Sarah Connor has had her child - the young John Connor. Unfortunately she also came off as slightly nuts while raving about robots taking over the world and so she is locked up in a mental hospital. While this is happening another Terminator has been dispatched, this time to kill John himself. The T 1000 is a liquid metal Terminator capable of reforming into different shapes. Thankfully to combat our meltable foe Arnie returns, this time as the good guy to protect John and his mother.<br/><br/>Its hard to review Terminator 2. Its just far too good for words. The villain played by Robert Patrick is probably the most villainous of all villains, the action is probably the most action packed of all action sequences. Plus it will also make you cry at the end. An action film. Seriously. OK just me then. Still a kind of bizarre situation where you find yourself close to shedding tears for a toaster with legs. But Terminator 2 manages it. In fact you feel Terminator 2 could do anything and get away with it. A bit like a woman in that respect.<br/><br/>I don't know how Cameron created my two favourite films of all time. I'm sure God had something to do with it. Id like to thank him but I'm far too bust watching this film to pray."
"nicklavigne","10","6","8","28 June 2004"," The Best Sequel Ever Made! 9,5/10
","After the release of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", we all knew James Cameron was the best director for sequels. He had already proved that a sequel could surpass the original with ""Aliens"", but with this one, he took it to a whole new level. The story of the 1984 hit thriller ""The Terminator"" is about a cyborg machine sent back through time to kill the future-mother of a military leader who will supposedly, take mankind to victory against the machines in an upcoming war. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" takes us about 13 years later. Sarah Connor is now in a mental institution after trying to blow up Cyberdyne. Her now-born-son, John Connor lives with his foster parents. But when a terminator called T-1000 comes to kill John, his only hope lies with the same terminator that once tried to kill his mother. Together, they will help Sarah to escape from the mental institution, destroy Cyberdyne to avoid judgment day and fight a metal-liquid made terminator, that seems invincible. What is so great with this movie is two things: the special effects and the script. James Cameron truly wrote a script superior to the original ad added more depth to the story. The special effects by Stan Winston are truly remarkable. They introduced CGI Animation to the world, long before <br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" or ""The Matrix"", to create some of the most impressive stunts and effects ever made with a movie. If James Cameron hadn't done""Titanic"" a few years after that, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" would've been his masterpiece. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives his best performance in career as the good terminator to battle the invincible T-1000, played remarkably by Robert Patrick. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" came out on July 3rd, 1991, and took in more than $500 million worldwide, including $204 million in the U.S. alone. It wasn't only a movie, it was a phenomenon. I give ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" a very good 9.5/10"
"Rocky_D","10","6","8","15 July 2003"," a film thats alot more than its special effects
","Terminator 2 has a rare quality amongst sequels! Not only is it visualy more sophisticated and more realistic in its action sequences but it also has a unique quality, that being its storyline. Many sequels are just money spinners with large set pieces and big scenes designed to hide the lack of story. T2 is a very unique film, not only does it superceed the original but it delves deeper into the story with a darker moodier and more creatively sophisticated vision which is rare for its genre.<br/><br/>The story being focused on Sarah and john conner and their battle to stop judgment day and the human race being annihilated by machines. In the first film we see sarah being the target of the terminator but this film manages to be nothing more than a very elaborate comic book adventure, the second film becomes almost artwork, the story is much deeper and more emotionally wrenching as a disturbed sarah struggles with the knowledge of the precise date and time and the events leading to the end of civilisation as we know it. The story is much more focused on the nuclear war and the true elements of the whole terminator story where the first film only scratches the surface and just uses the story as an excuse for Arnie to chase Linda Hamilton around LA. the first film was excellent but the second really dug deep into the story to let it be told rather than just be a guideline for an action movie.<br/><br/>T2 was groundbreaking in many ways not only for being a much better movie than the original but with its C.G.I (computer Generated image) breakthrough but this is not used to pull the wool over the audiences eyes it is merely there to enhance the realism of the picture and for us to believe and to tap into the emotional torment and horror that the characters must face with the burden of knowing the end of the world lingers and their battle to prevent the war from happening whilst avoiding the very thing they are trying to save that being the human race. Many films since like jurasic park used the same breakthrough effects but with very different purpose, to hide the lack of story and plot developement but T2 uses it to enhance the already very deep and sophisticated story.<br/><br/>Terminator 2's script is emotional, unsettling and disturbing if people would just sit down and take the film in they will realise that this picture is much more than just fancy special fx its a triumph of story telling and movie making and its a credit to James Cameron for not letting the sequel drop into the same pit of nasty films trying to cash in on the success of the original but to make it a significant masterpiece in the world of storytelling."
"mbanwait","9","6","8","5 July 2003"," James Cameron's masterpiece!
","Terminator 2 is not only a mind blowing movie with spectacular special effects and unbeleivable action, but cultural phenomenon akin to capturing lightening in a bottle.<br/><br/>Never will such a perfect action/sci fi movie ever be made in the history of filmdom.<br/><br/>The casting of Arnold is perfect beyond belief.  He was born only to play the role of The Terminator.  His minimal dialogue enhances the roles mechanical robotic qualities.<br/><br/>James Cameron is certainly a dedicated filmaker who cares about his work and the expectations of the audience.  The only other film that comes close to T2 is Aliens, also directed by Cameron.  His use of computer effects to augment and supplment the storyline is rarely ever used in todays overblown blockbusters.  In fact the special effects in T2 are so good that today's effects PALE in comparison.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick is perfect as the predatory T-1000, and will be forever be remebered as the guy who gave Arnold a run for his money, as he definately attempts to steal the movie in some scenes.<br/><br/>I am appalled that a T3 has been made without James Cameron.  T3 may be a decent action flick, but it looks embarrasingly juvenille from the trailers and TV spots.  Whats with all the sunlight???  Arnold even stated a few years ago he would not do T3 without Cameron.  After Arnolds diasasters such as End of Days (not bad flick) he needed a hit and the only way was to bring the Terminator out of retirement, with or without Cameron.  Thats Loyalty for you.<br/><br/>T2 is the best action movie ever made, and if you have not seen it yet, you have probably seen paradies, ripoffs, and copies of the movie.<br/><br/>
But watching the original will give an appreciation as to how this movie shaped future action movies, as it is groundbreaking.<br/><br/>I wished James Cameron had made T3, but I doubt he could have topped the perfection of T2, and that may be one of the reasons he decided to opt out of T3."

","The opening scenes of James Cameron's acclaimed, overrated 1991 sequel TERMINATOR 2:JUDGMENT DAY (T2) are all one needs to see to know why this movie is not nearly the equal or superior to it's classic predecessor THE TERMINATOR (T1)!<br/><br/>In the first 30 minutes of T2, we get THREE cliché ""Hollywood"" scenes: <br/><br/>(1) Arnold Schwarzenegger's naked ""good guy"" T800 (polarizing the bad guy in T1) in a ho-hum bar brawl with a group of mocking bikers (the SAME scene occurred in T1 and grittier, esp. the reaction of the last punk, whose muted, jittery fear spoke volumes!), the last of which pulls a gun (typical sequelitis up-the-ante trick), then unconvincingly utters TAKE IT! His ""fear"" was the typical ""Hollywood reactionary type"" that I've seen in a bunch of movies.<br/><br/>(2) A scene with a now loony, buffed-up Sarah Connor (reprised by Linda Hamilton) in an insane asylum where the police psychiatrist from T1 now works (convenient) as he briefs a group of interns on her and then an utterly predictable and tepid exchange ONLY for explanation and exposition...BORING!<br/><br/>(3) ANOTHER expository scene introducing 10-year old John Connor (a fetus at the end of T1), establishing him as a juvenile delinquent and showing how his foster folks are jerks <br/><br/>We also get introduced to a new, improved evil Terminator, the liquid-metal T1000, played by Robert Patrick whose job it is to terminate John Connor; he can assume any human form and kills and takes the place of a cop (convenient plot device for the rest of the movie)<br/><br/>I don't see how a movie with such a tedious introductory 30 minutes can be proclaimed the ""greatest"" ANYTHING of all time! And the rest of the film is filled with nothing but cliché dialog that is still sadly heard today in many action films (I guess T2 is influential in that sense).<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger and Hamilton in T2 aren't given near as much to work with and not allowed to display the depth and range of emotions that permeated throughout T1, making it a provocative film and not JUST an action movie. The dialog in T1 had a realistic edge to it, ranging from Reese's hypnotic rants about the apocalypse and the T800's determination to kill Sarah to the gritty, wry (and convincing!) banter at the police station. Arnie in particular is stuck actually in a very thankless role, playing lapdog to John Connor (played by Edward Furlong, who gets to deliver an amazing amount of forgettable dialog). I saw nothing that would make me think this kid would be the future resistance leader and no mother-son chemistry between Furlong and Hamilton.<br/><br/>For me, the biggest reason why T2 is not in the league of T1 is the ""evil"" Terminator himself. In no way, shape, or form, does Robert Patrick's T1000 match or come close to Arnie's no-nonsense, unflappable T800! I've seen some people complain that Patrick is not on screen enough. But guess what? Arnie probably had about the same (maybe even less) screen time in T1 than Patrick did in this movie and Schwarzenegger managed to be 100% convincing and frightening every second he was on screen in T1. To be fair, Patrick was confined by the conventions of what is really a generic action movie.<br/><br/>Another big reason T2 is a fail for me is that (contrary to popular opinion!) it violates all that was built up in T1. Now, all of a sudden TWO (one in 84 and one in 94) evil Terminators were sent back. So there was a backup plan all along! Kind of takes the sting out of what Reese went through to save Sarah and ensure the future in T1, doesn't it?! <br/><br/>T2 is rather long, also, with quite a few, expository, unnecessary scenes that seem to be designed to give it depth and to stretch the film out to the appropriate length of a big, summer blockbuster movie. Example would be a scene past the midway point where Sarah narrates (while she looks at them) how the good T800 is like perfect father to John of all the fathers he's had; the narration doesn't work and the whole scene doesn't work. What's ironic is that in T1, the human Reese was just as willing to sacrifice others to save Sarah as the T800 was in order to kill her, while in T2, Reese's ""replacement"", who is not human, is sanitized to the point of not even seeming like a machine most of the time b/c young John won't allow him to kill; I guess it's a message about morality even in war, but not delivered as effectively (due to stilted dialog and unbelievable scenes) as the ""win at all costs"" attitude of T1.<br/><br/>In fairness, even though dated in terms of 80s, even people that love T1 (I do!) don't hold that against it and defend it for it's deep story, strong characterizations, brisk pace, nightmarish-noir look, and influence on the sci-fi genre. Even people that like T2 more than T1 (I do not!) compliment the original on these same things, so that's something.<br/><br/>I understand why T2 is held in regard in terms of special effects. For a near 20-year old movie, the effects are still impressive, especially the smooth transitions in Patrick's T1000 going from metal to human form and back. CGI movies today could learn a thing or two from this film. Also, all the action scenes in this movie are ""necessary"", if a bit showy. The action in T2 is well executed, if a bit too clean (minimal blood, no guts). But in between the few big, well done action scenes, there's standard dialog, boring character interactions, and predictable outcomes. None of this was true of T1!"

","It's a rarity that a sequel actually outshines its predecessor. Yes, James Cameron was allowed a budget for 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' due to his own success, as well as the cult following part one had. But, he didn't stop at simple special effects. He took his original, interesting and origin story and blasted it in fast forward, excellently. Hamilton apparently refused to return unless her character expanded, and it did, tenfold. Schwarzenegger was given more lines, most hilarious, and a lot more in depth was his cyborg. Also, was the addition of excellent acting of Morton, Patrick and soon-to-be notorious Furlong, a full-length story of his own origins. Not only was 'T2' a perfect summer movie, not only did it surpass the original, it is absolutely one of the best action movies of all time. And, like part 1, it's mostly about the story and acting. I cringe at most so-called ""action"" movies of today (SEE: 'Transformers' 1 & 2. Sure there's FX to spare, but where's the story? Where's the acting?) This movie, a continuation of part one with Sarah, now the mother of the future resistance leader John, protecting him (or is he protecting her?) while a new duo of terminators sent back in time to protect and/or destroy. They up'd the ante for action, dialogue, comedy, score, suspense, heart with special and original effects – this one set the ""liquid metal"" stage. I can go on and on, but seriously, this is what real big budgeted movies should model themselves after. First, get a great and original story. Then hire accomplished actors who can, yes, act. Next, employ real FX-experts. How hard of a code is that? I truly believe parts 1 and 2 are a complete story. It should've ended here.<br/><br/>Side Note and Spoiler: Though I loved the deleted and reinserted closing with Grandma Conner and Senator Conner playing in a no-war zone decades later, it was the most unrealistic aspect. For, how could those two ever expect not only to make it out of the events of 'T2,' despite the humanitarian efforts, without being completely hunted or on the FBI's most wanted list? We must of missed the President's pardoning and the American's forgiveness for John to become a Senator. Only in Hollywood."

","Terminator 2 Judgment Day is a big improvement over the original. Writer/Director James Cameron returns along with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton from the first one. The story picks up many years after the original that finds Sarah Connor (played with vulnerability and intensity by Linda Hamilton) in a mental institution and her now punk teen son John (played to a tee by Edward Furlong) who's living with foster parents. John's world comes crashing down however with the arrival of a terminator (played once again by Arnold Schwarzenegger who does a great job in the role) whose been sent from the future to protect the young soon to be leader of the resistance from a deadly time traveling cyborg known as the T-1000 (played to perfection by Robert Patrick) an advanced prototype which makes it that much more dangerous. Soon The Terminator is in a race against time to protect Sarah and John from a formidable foe it may not be able to defeat. The whole cast are exceptional in their roles especially Schwarzenegger who does a fantastic job as the Terminator, Linda Hamilton still proves to be a perfect Sarah Connor, and Robert Patrick makes for an effective villain. He may not have much dialogue but Patrick makes the best of his villain role in the movie. Well done. Director James Cameron continues the story from the original and gives us a worthy sequel that is much better than the first one. From the intense action which is pretty much non stop, to the acting, to the characters, the story, the suspense, thrills, and some small does of humor this sequel makes for an enjoyable movie to watch. The special effects are amazing especially considering they didn't have the technology we do today. Despite some flaws when dealing with the time-traveling plot and some over acting at times the good more than outweighs the bad. Overall Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made with plenty of action, chases, explosions, fist fights, amazing special effects, solid performances, a compelling story, and some humor that sure to please any fan of the series or genre. Go see it. Terminator 2 does not disappoint."
"VagueVoice","10","7","10","24 March 2008"," Best movie ever made
","Being a Terminator 2 fan for some years now I think it finally deserves a comment. From the first time I witnessed the fast paced action, high powered weaponry and the the T-1000 emerging from explosions and floors, I was immediately hooked. I don't think there's any aspect of this film that I don't like, it really has a great feel of humanity's struggle against the creation of Skynet which will be responsible for the loss of so much life.<br/><br/>It's hard to pick out the best performance here, with Linda Hamilton portraying such a cold character (almost like a Terminator herself), to Robert Patrick's excellent performance as the new Terminator, the T-1000. Even young Edward Furlong is fantastic in this picture being just 9 years of age as the young John Connor. And of course you have Schwartzenegger, who is playing the role he was born to play, unlike the cliché he turns into in Rise of the Machines.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend film to anyone. From a distance it might just look like your mindless science-fiction action movie with robots and explosions, but it really is just so much more than that. The production value is phenomenal with great chase scenes and fantastic special effects, even by todays standards. And as I mentioned the performances by the actors are fantastic. But more than all that I think is the whole feel of the movie, which contrasts good over evil brilliantly.<br/><br/>10/10, your not going to find a better action movie than this, buy it on special edition if you haven't already.."

","Terminator 2 is by far better than the first. But what really makes T2 a stand out is the important message behind it: ""If a machine can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."" T2 shows the horrors of a nuclear bomb, and what we can do to each other. Even though a lot of scenes are action packed, some are surprisingly touching, such as the last scene with Terminator, Sarah, and especially John. All of the performances were dead on, and the action is relentless. The special effects are damn good, even to this day. Some memorable quotes, like the one about human life, and of course, ""hasta la vista, baby"" help T2 stand the test of time; it's hard to believe it's already been 15 years since this was first released.<br/><br/>10/10.

","Terminator 2 is no doubt the Greatest Schwarznegger movie of his career. Arnie has given us great movies before like Commando, Predator and Total Recall. Arnie will always be Popular for his role as the Terminator. Terminator One was a great Movie and a Great Start the made Arnie a Star. Terminator 2 went 10 steps ahead to make one of the Best Sci Fi Movies of all time. Over 2 hours of non stop entertainment. I remember when i saw T2 when it first came out in 1992. At that time, the graphics in T2 were out of this world. Everybody wondered how did they do that with the T1000. If you see this movie just recently, you wont be so surprised. It was the movie everybody was talking about in school. T1000 was a great Villain, its a shame the creaters on T3 couldn't compete with it. T3 was the worst out of the trilogy. Arnie was like a side kick in T3. T2 is one of the finest films ever made. Must See"

","Even after fifteen years since the film came out, the special effects, and intensity still roar and excite to this day.<br/><br/>Arnold Swartzenagger leads the cast in a brilliant tale of futuristic cyborgs, and robots sent from the future to terminate in the past.<br/><br/>If you've seen the first film, then you'll be able to follow the sequel much better, but to be honest, you don't really need to see either the first or third to follow this one. And, quite frankly this is the best of the three. I'm not really much for science fiction, but this is one of the few that I really do enjoy. Robert Patrick gives a chilling performance as the 'bad' robot sent to destroy John Connor (Edward Furlong), and terminate T-1000 (Swarzenagger), who is ironically there to protect the son of the woman he was sent to kill in the last film.<br/><br/>The whole film is almost non-stop intense, and there are times when you're heart will jump out of your chest, because it gets so nerve racking.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong, in his debut role, gives an amazing performance as the son of Sarah Connor, and the leader of the future.<br/><br/>I would give it a 10, however, there are times when the movie tends to slow down, for long periods of time and can get a bit boring. However, the rest of the time it's nothing but thrills and nerves at your doorstep, for an entertaining ride in the future, past and present. A great sci-fi film, that will never let you down."

","This is one of the best action movies ever made. Director James Cameron hits the right combination of action and emotion. He proves that there is still room in an action movie for some feeling. It expertly switches to hard boiled action movie, to making you feel about the characters.<br/><br/>The Terminator is both killing machine and father figure, the father John never had. He is always lit in a cold steely blue, which gives him a hard sculptured look. The sunglasses cover his eyes, giving him no emotion. He throws people out his way like rag dolls, they are helpless to stop him. Yet, he is helpful to John, his protector.<br/><br/>We really believe that the T-1000 is an unstoppable killing machine. He blends in like a chameleon, unlike the Terminators hulk. It seems that there is no way to stop him. He can change to the form of any person he kills. His outward appearance is that of a normal human being.<br/><br/>Sarah has become a hardened, prepared for the nightmare of the future. She is trapped in a mental institution for trying to blow up a computer factory, for the horrible truth only she believes. She is tortured to the point of appearing insane.<br/><br/>The cinematography contrasts a hard blue with an orange red, fire and ice. It sets the mood very well. There is blue light for danger and fear and red for love and family.<br/><br/>The music is like the Terminator's mechanical heartbeat, a pulsing rhythmic beat. It uses sampled strings and percussion. It also pauses for an emotional moment.<br/><br/>The movie is fast pace and pulse rising, but also dramatic and careful. One of the best, an action classic!"

"Bogmeister","10","7","10","7 August 2005"," Still Unstoppable, Still Relentless
","The first Terminator pic was a modest success at the box office in 1984; by 1990, thanks to video, millions of people were anxious for a sequel. James Cameron granted their wish and again exceeded expectations. This sequel is 10 years later, based upon the age of the central character (played by newcomer Ed Furlong). Cameron had a budget of over a dozen times the original picture and used it all to great effect. Notably, this was an early use of computer FX which are prevalent today; back then, they were simply amazing to behold (this was before even Jurassic Park '93, and each instance of their use was startling - we weren't used to it). Most of them revolved around the T-1000 super-villain (Patrick), a revolutionary approach to depicting a fantastic menace. Arnold was back as another durable cyborg, but seemed quaint & outmoded as the picture progressed.<br/><br/>The film was another impressive progression of action and suspense, interlocked with the theme of nuclear holocaust. More than just building on the threat of nuclear annihilation from the 1st pic, the picture throws the concept at the audience with some striking images. It slows at about the halfway point when the heroes evade the pursuing super-killer for a time, but then you see that nuclear bomb going off, still about the best such depiction ever seen. Just when you think you can relax for a few minutes, a city blows up. By this time, the definitive version of this film is the 'extended' cut Cameron presented a couple of years later. The extra scenes accentuate the plot and don't slow the story down at all.<br/><br/>Like the best sequels, it presents characters which progress and advance. This is especially true of Linda Hamilton's character; she's really lived those past 10 years and is a much older & stronger mother figure here, coarsened by ceaseless struggle. She really does turn out to be the mother of the future, as mentioned in the original pic, obsessed with saving us all from a nuclear winter. Arnold, of course, has to play a more human-like cyborg, very different from the mono-syllabic droid he interpreted earlier. The film pulls another fast one in the beginning, still keeping the audience guessing as to which is the heroic protector, Arnold or the T-1000 (the T-1000 actually seems more human than Arnold in the first 20 minutes). When the hero turns out to be Arnold, the viewer claps in appreciation for a fine role reversal. We had to wait another dozen years for the next one, but it could never be as good as this."

Also, it probably had a much larger budget.  But somehow it just never captures my interest the way the original did.  No doubt that it's a good movie.  But just not AS good.

","In the iron foundry the Terminator gets his left arm ripped off in a cogwheel. He leaves it there. This means that it is NOT destroyed along with the laboratory arm and micro chip after the destruction of the T1000, and thus, when the Terminator is lowered into the molten iron, there is STILL a robot arm in existence. The arm is bound to be found by scientists like Dyson who will eventually replicate it. This just shows that you can't change the future by changing the past. World War III is bound to happen but hopefully only in the Terminator universe.

","While the action and effects of this movie were above the original (thanks to a much bigger budget, after the first was a hit), the story, acting and characters are not. The original had imagination, and characters that felt like real people you could root for. It was a tight, imaginative and stylish thriller. <br/><br/>""T2"", as it was marketed, has Sarah Connor turn into a completely unlikable mental case, with a whiny, emo, 90s ""grunge hipster"" son. Worst of all, for purely commercial purposes, it creates a nonsensical excuse for bringing back Arnold's Terminator -- as a good guy. <br/><br/>Yeah. The Terminator of the original becomes a good guy, and stays that way for the rest of the series. And it had to happen solely because Arnold became a big star. Lame all around.

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","4","5","30 November 2019"," One of the best action films of all time Cameron's masterpiece my personal number 1 favorite
","The best action movie of all time, surpasses the original directed and writen once again by James Cameron and Stars: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick and Edward Furlong. I watched this movie 100 times and I love it so much that I have to talk about it. The effects, the puppetries, the action are great, they are great delivered. It is my personal favorite action film of all time. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a classic and in my opinion a damn masterpiece along with Aliens (1986) of course. Everything about this film is masterfully executed, the incredible direction, performances, action, writing and effects and music are ALL great and I've never had a problem with any of the subtle humor moments or the fact that Arnold never kills anyone since he is the protector so it makes sense LOL.<br/><br/>T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) returns as a Terminator from the year 2029 sent back to the present day to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong) from another Terminator T-1000 (Robert Patrick) who is also sent back from the future in the present to find and terminate John Connor (Edward Furlong). When these two terminators meet each other they start fighting each other one try's to protect the kid, the other try's to kill the kid. T-800 and John Connnor arrive at the hospital Pescadero State Hospital and they help Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escape from the hospital. They flee in the desert in which the trio starts preparing for Judgment Day and they planing to stop it. In meanwhile T-1000 takes the form of the unharmed pseudo-cop and he is searching for John and hunting them.<br/><br/>What can I say about this movie that it was already said: the movie is one of the best 90's action movies of all time, it is better than the original Termiantor movie. Has great effects, practical stunts, action scenes are great. Shape shifting terminator is great desigend by Stan Winston. I love the night scenes of this movie or the mills steal scens. T-800 is driving on a 1991 Harley-Davidson FLSTF Fat Boy during the night i really love that it is my favorite scene. I love how Arnold Schwarzenegger is dressed. Honestly this movie surpass RoboCop even the sequel RoboCop 2 can't not come near Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day are my favorite Cameron movies he ever did, they are masterpieces. Aliens is my number one Cameron movie, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is my second Cameron favorite movie.<br/><br/>You have plenty of actions in this movie: in the Galleria T-800 Vs T-1000 fight eachother, T-800 fiers at T-1000 with a Winchester 1887 shootgun fiers all bullets at him and you see only holes in his stomach awesome. T-1000 (Robert Patrick) fires his Beretta 92FS back at T-800 and he does that on realistic way. Robert Patrick does an excellent job of not flinching in the film and thoroughly convinces the viewers that he is an emotionless killer and not some wimpy actor who's touching a gun for the first time. The Galleria shout scene to me is the best one in the movie. The same mall scene was used in Commando earlier Schwarzenegger movie my favorite. The T-1000 drives through the destroyed lab notices the helicopter flying near the building, it accelerates, jumps its motorcycle out of the building, and grabs hold of the helicopter as the bike crashes to the ground. That was crazy stunt, a stunt man jumps with a motorcycle trough the building 2 floores and grabs a helicopter. The Helicopter scene is great. T-1000 fiers from the helicopter with his semiautomatic Heckler & Koch SP89 on a SWAT Van: Sarah, John and T-800. The Terminator (Arnold Scwarzenegger) walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. It ignores the police's order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun at the police cars below tousand of rounds are fierd. (The same M134 Minigun was used in Predator (1987) earlier Schwarezenegger movie.). Terminator uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more police vehicles. You have a lot of action and sci-fi in this movie. A lot of wepaons are used in here, handguns, Beretta 92FS by T-1000, T-800, Detonics Custom 1911 by Sarah Connor. Sarah fires the Colt/Detonics 1911 at the T-1000 as he pursues their stolen police car. M79 grenade launcher is used by Arnold. Arnold Scwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick trained to use hand guns for real. So most of weapons are used they are for real. Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick and Arnold Schwarzenegger used the gun realistic and accurate.<br/><br/>One of the best action movies with Rambo: First Blood Part II, Rambo III, Aliens, Predator (1987), Die hard (1988), Cobra (1986), Hard Target, Demolition Man, Predator 2, Hard Boiled, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, Universal Soldier, Rambo, Live Free or Die Hard, John Wick, John Wick Chapter 2 and more action movies.<br/><br/>Jenette Goldstein from Aliens was in this movie ashe was great as Janelle Voight. I love those 2 girls played by Nikki Cox and Lisa Brinegar. That scene in which T-1000 is asking a qestions these two girls if they seen John Connor and they said he said, he went to Galleria. The music score was made by Brad Fiedel which he made an excellent music score for the movie, one of the best music scores I have ever heared. Guns N' Roses made a music song for this movie ""You Could Be Mine"" one of the best soundtracks of all time. I have this song on CD. Guns N' Roses were one of the best bands in the 90's. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie, his best performance ever. It is my childhood movie and I am glad that I grow up in the 80's and 90's when this great movies come out. 90's were great times for music and movies. They do not make movies like this anymore, nowdays movie suck!. They made 4 more Terminator movies and most of the sequels suck. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines suck, Terminator: Salvation is alright in my opinion, Terminator Genysys sucks ass, Terminator: Dark Fate have not seen it yet, but I hear from critics it is awful.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick are great they are the Best! All three are at their best acting performances and they are in best shape of their lives, I have ever seen on movie screen. They are great and perfect in their roles. Arnold was scared because he thought this movie will be a floop, because Terminator refuse to kill anyone, but Arnold was surprised that audience loved it. Budget for this movie was $102 million. I would say with Rambo: First Blood Part II, Rambo III, Cobra, Predator, Aliens and later in the 90's Predator 2 and Demolition Man, it is one of the best action films of all time. I grew up it is my childhood movie. I love, love, love this movie to death!<br/><br/>This is my review about Terminator 2: Judgment Day the sequel to 1984 ""The Terminator"" original movie. Love this film to death, I have no problems with this film, it is a Great Masterpiece! Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language. Bad-ass action film with balls to the walls. Watch this movie and Predator with Arnold Schwarzenegger."

","In my opinion, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the best film of the entire franchise. Due to its involving and breath-taking story along with impressive performances. The plot even having some similarities with the first movie isn't remotely predictable or boring. The tension, the soundtrack and how the action scenes were shot provided a feeling of always look up your shoulder because something is after you. But the film is not only actions scenes, in the interval between the action scenes, the characters have their chance to be explored and developed making each one have a good and solid identity during the entire picture. One aspect which is new is the humour, the relationship between John Connor (Edward Furlong) and the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is responsible for this to happen. Other point worth mentioning is the visual effects, specially the makeup used in the T-800 is so realistic, at times there is a certain discomfort because you know that action would hurt, but as he is a robot, that is nothing. <br/><br/>Regarding the cast, their performance was incredible. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) suffered a change both physically and mentally, she's no longer the naive and helpless woman from the first movie, now she is willing to do anything so John can survive. Arnold once again is great in the role, Edward Furlong plays a troubled and rebel John Connor. Throughout the film a bond is created between John and the T-800 and surely it's one of the highlights. It's so funny and amusing see the growth of the odd friendship, a man with a machine."
"mstrhlly","9","4","5","31 August 2014"," Linda Hamilton rocks as Sarah Connor
","In my opinion, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the best sequels of all times. Considering 90s cinematography technologies, James Cameron did an outstanding job. Every detail of this cult movie, from the plot to the music was awesome. <br/><br/>In the first movie, the terminator was the bad guy. With a tremendous body like Greek gods and his robot-like accent, Arnold Schwarzenegger was a perfect fit to the Terminator character. He was sent back from future to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of an unborn child who will become the leader of a resistance against the machines. We all know the story. But in T2, he came back to protect the son of Sarah Connor which I believe was a very good twist. Arnold did his part very well again as the cyborg of our dreams. What surprised me was the transformation of Linda Hamilton's character. I honestly didn't see that coming. Sarah Connor was a vulnerable young girl in the first movie. But she turned into a bad-ass woman who has lots and lots of guns. I was really impressed. <br/><br/>I have watched this movie so many times over the years and it never gets old or boring. Just watch it."

","This movie is one of the very best ones!.. It contains not a single irrelevant scene, and there are all scenes brief and to the point. And the choice of not adding any distractive music as the movie go along is very important and well done. About the star Arnold Schwarzenegger, I must say that he is the one that no one'd replace for this movie. He really makes us believe that he is a terminator and not a human, although he is trying to be one very well. And about Edward Furlong, I must say that he plays the role of the smart and innocent kid real good. Impressive!.. The tears in his eyes, while he struggles for the life of humans... Well done! About the script, I say it is very humane after all. You see, we build machines and kill each other from the beginning of history. And we never stop shedding blood. And in this movie, James Cameron did the best to prove that we hold the most value as human being and we should never ever hurt ourselves, with or without the hopeless inventions.

","When I saw the first movie,I was surprised what an amazing movie James Cameron was able to create with such a small budget.When I went to see ""Judgment Day"",I was curious to see how Cameron would use a much bigger budget.He uses it to it's full extent.The result is a truly unique movie.<br/><br/>This film focuses more on the characters-The T-101,Sarah and John Connor and they're all likable.I especially liked how the Terminator discovers the value of life,but eventually sacrifices himself in the end.That was one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a movie.We also have a more intimidating villain-the T-1000.Don't get me wrong,Arnold was still very Intimidating in the first movie,but you can never see the T- 1000 coming,it can change into everything and uses cunning instead of smashing as it's primary tool.<br/><br/>This is probably the most entertaining and fun-to-watch movie I have ever seen.In my review for the first film I mentioned,that you will not feel bored for a single minute while watching,well,you wont feel bored for a single second while watching ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"".Sure,the movie has some cheesy moments here and there,but I think that's what gives it it's distinct terminatorness,what makes it so enjoyable."

","In the rare pantheon of sequels that are just as good as -- if not, better than -- the original, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is in limited but good company. Nearly a decade after leaving his stamp with the first film, James Cameron returned to the property that put him on the map (perhaps with tail between legs following the disappointing release of ""The Abyss"" a few years prior). With original players Linda Hamilton and, of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger back in action, Cameron co-wrote a script that expanded upon the simple premise of the original film while adding more social commentary and even more action than before.<br/><br/>While our heroin from the first film, Sarah Connor (Hamilton) rots away in a maximum security mental institution, her young son and future savior of mankind, John (a fresh-faced Edward Furlong), is roaming the streets of Los Angeles, blasting some GNR whilst robbing ATMs. Meanwhile, the war against the machines rages on in the future, and as such, a newer and deadlier Terminator with shape-shifting abilities -- the T-1000, as played by a stone-cold serious Robert Patrick -- is sent back in time to crush that little squirt John Connor before he leads all of humankind to victory. It's hard not to imagine the resistance chanting ""Yes, we can!"" while the machines retort with ""We built it!"" Anyway, as before, a protector for Connor is sent, only this time it's a re-programmed version of the same would-be Terminator that originally tried to kill his mother. And thus, Arnold is back.<br/><br/>""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is notable for a lot of things, but what really makes it stand out is its stunning visuals effects. As one of the first films to utilize CGI in a big way, it simultaneously closed the door on the dominance of practical effects in the '80s while opening the door for the likes of ""Jurassic Park,"" ""The Matrix"" and, of course, ""Avatar."" Using the T-1000 as the film's guinea pig, Cameron makes us believe liquid metal can come to life and stalk us. Even as technology has advanced, the CGI in the film is remarkable and somehow manages to look better than the CGI-heavy fodder of today.<br/><br/>But special effects aside, the film is truly a roller-coaster ride of epic proportions. While admittedly not as tightly paced as its predecessor, the follow-up is chock full of dizzying action, dazzling set-pieces and big and bold ideas about the future. Amidst all of this lies a disarming sense of fun and humor, vis Ã  vis the interplay between Schwarzenegger and young Furlong. To counter this, Hamilton steps it up as Rambo with sweater-meat. Her turn as the hardened and focused soldier is a natural progression from where we last saw her, and thankfully, Hamilton is up for the task.<br/><br/>As far as big-budget blockbusters go, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" sits at the top of the heap. Very few films have come along in its time that are as truly epic and entertaining as this. With Schwarzenegger in his prime and Cameron at the top of his game, this is a no-brainer. One of the few ""must-see"" sequels in history. This one truly gives its predecessor a run for its money. While the franchise laid dormant for a good decade, Hollywood couldn't resist, and two sequels as well as a TV series followed. To be sure, though, ""Terminator 2"" is the end all, be all follow-up and a perfect companion piece to the original. Like chocolate and peanut butter, or plastique and burly beef, if you prefer."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","10","4","5","30 August 2012"," Just as good as the first
","After watching the first terminator film, it was no surprise that director James Cameron came back for another shot. But what did surprise me was how well this sequel was made. And it didn't take a few sequels in between to make it this good either. It was directly after the first.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator (T-800) but this time he's on the good side. The whole idea of having the terminator switch roles was an interesting take. Because the terminator is on the good side now, there is so much room for character development and writer James Cameron and William Wisher Jr. made sure this occurred throughout the movie. To actually see a machine learn to be more human is always life changing and Schwarzenegger does it perfectly.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton's character, Sarah Connor has changed a lot too. We saw a glimpse of what her character had become. Here we see her doing much more: cursing up a storm, stabbing people and firing shotguns. Nothing like the Sarah from The Terminator (1984). Edward Furlong plays John Connor, Sarah's son who are on the run from a new terminator, the T- 1000. Robert Patrick plays this terminator and he's got a knack for it too. Patrick's eyes and face make a very menacing looking callous killing machine.<br/><br/>The action sequences are also well staged, from scale models to live- action. All of it is believable and commendable. The special effects are the most amazing though, especially for 1991. This is beginning of CGI. The music by Brad Fiedel is also great too. It still sounds like the first and that's very much appreciated. Cameron has done it again.<br/><br/>T2 is more involving and retains every element from the first film. It's a sequel that is just as good as its predecessor."

"ozziemovielover","10","4","5","10 June 2011"," Pure brilliance
","This was the best movie of the decade. In fact, I have not seen any movies that have surpassed it. This was arnold's best movie although he has had other movies that good. The same goes for Cameron. Titanic and avatar might have been decent movies that made tons more money but I would still choose T2 over them. Some of the fx are a bit dated but the t1000 effects still match up to modern movies. This movie was vastly superior to T3 and T4. The last two terminator movies were all style and very little substance whereas T2 had the right blend of action and wit. T2 had a heart and brain in there somewhere. T2 does have a few minor flaws. I thought that edward furlong was a bit wooden in places (only slightly) but then again this was his first time to act. The story also slumped a slight bit in the middle. Definitely a movie to be recommended"
"homyg2003","10","4","5","18 February 2011"," Terminator 2 is as the ultimate movie!!!
","I remember watching Terminator 2: Judgement Day at an early age and it has been my favourite then and it is now I then saw The Terminator and then Rise of the machines and finally Salvation and this is definitely the best out of the quadrilodgy (The Terminator is excellent as well, an ""edgy 80s sci-fi thriller"" and its only downside is how amazing T2 is), this is Schwarzenegger's best performance and he was born to play the terminator, the movie is filled with action, sci-fi, and even some drama, and great performances all around by Edward furlong, Robert Patrick and Linda Hamilton. The movie never has a dull moment and will keep you're attention throughout with dazzling special effects, the cg is really something special (James Cameron used the technology when it was new) even for todays standards, and the storyline is awesome,the only downside the movie had to end, if you haven't seen T2, then stop reading this and get a copy and watch :D"
"AlexTheRamL","10","4","5","29 January 2011"," The Greatest Sci-Fi Film ever made
","Dear James Cameron,<br/><br/>You remember Terminator 2 right? Of course you do, it's arguably your best film, remember the script you wrote you know that super tight script, you remember the memorable and of course likable characters that gave fast, smart, and witty dialogue? You made and how great you made the character development yeah you do, a two hour and 15 min film and you just made it fly by. James Cameron you arguably made the greatest Sci-Fi Action film of all time. So when you're making Avatar 2 please work on the script, character development, of course characters and dialogue please, also make it less of a drag to watch than the first one.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Alex L<br/><br/>Terminator 2 like I said is arguably the best Sci-Fi Action film of all time and is in my top Ten Films of all time. The Plot: The T-1000 is sent back to kill John and The Terminator a.k.a T-800 (Schwarzenegger) is sent back to protect John reprogrammed by John himself. Then the whole movie is about John, Sarah, and The Terminator needing to destroy the T-1000 and to stop judgment day from happening. The Characters: Edward Furlong plays John Connor. For Furlong there are two films he is know for, this and American History X, I like him better in Terminator 2. Essentially he plays mean, messed up kids in both of them, but what seals the deal for me is his father son relationship with The Terminator. With saying that I should mention that the way the characters change was excellent, from the first film and also during this film. The Terminator changing from a killing machine into a father like figure, and Sarah from being scared to death from the future to learning that we as a human race can learn to make the future better. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays The Terminator a.k.a T-800. He actually does a better job than he did in the first Terminator, mostly due to the fact that he has more lines and the way he becomes a father figure to John. He makes himself an incredibly likable father figure machine; let's just say he becomes incredibly likable that at the end of the movie it was making me tear up a little. Linda Hamilton plays Sarah Conner the most badass female character of all time (some of you might say Ripley or ""The Bride"" but I stand my ground). I really don't know any other film Linda has been in besides the first two Terminators. In the first terminator she played this wimp of a girl and almost gets killed by the first terminator, in this one she this badass taking people out with a broomstick, stabbing people in the legs with pens or just explaining to someone how many bones there are in the human body, but is still worried about John's safety and preventing judgment day from happening, but by the end of the movie like I said she realizes that the human race is able to learn how to make the future better. (Remember it's just a movie) Robert Patrick plays the T-1000, he did an excellent job showing no emotion or sympathy for anyone else just kept a straight serious face, a killing machine, he fits the role perfectly.<br/><br/>Everything Else: Terminator 2 like I said and I will say it again is arguably the best Sci-Fi action film of all time, for me it is. I'm just gonna say that everything in the film is top notch. The sound, action, special effects, everything is perfect, a fantastic looking film. What I love about the action is that it looks real especially with the car/motorcycle chases, Cameron did an excellent job with them and he sure knows how to direct an action scene(s). He also somehow made this two hour and 15 minute film just fly by, it never felt like a drag to watch, it was fun to watch and it is still fun to watch over and over again, I believe this is the film I've watched the most. The special effects were fantastic for the time and today they still look pretty damn good, very revolutionary for the time. But it isn't the best looking film of all time to me that goes to 2001 A Space Odyssey. What I learned by watching the film: There are 206 bones in the human body The Conclusion: What really made me love this film (besides being the best action film I've seen) is the characters, they are likable they are fun they make the movie worth watching until the end (besides the action). I honor James Cameron as a master of sequel making with this and Aliens. Hopefully he will continue this tradition with Avatar 2 I believe he can, but I don't think I believe too much because of the first Avatar. Avatar 2 comes out in 2014 so hopefully he will hit gold with that one. I'm not saying I hate the first Avatar, I just think it's his worst work. Terminator 2 Judgment Day with the action and especially characters and fast pace, this is what am I saying arguably, James Cameron made THE GREATEST Sci-Fi Action Film of all time."
"g-bodyl","9","4","5","26 January 2011"," Awesome!
","Terminator 2 is a worthy sequel to the first one. I think I like this film more than the original. With these films, James Cameron proved himself to be an adept director. He made the top two grossing films all time in America and three films that defined science fiction/action for ages to come.<br/><br/>The Terminator returns this time not as a bad guy but as the good guy. His mission is to protect the son of Sarah Connor, John. Together they must rescue Sarah from the mental hospital and save the lives of three billion people.<br/><br/>It's nice to see Arnold return. He knows how to kick butt. Robert Patrick is quite the villain. I hated his guts.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best movies from the 1990's. It also broke new ground visually. I rate this film 9/10. Hasta la Vista, Baby!"
"starlit-sky","9","4","5","20 January 2011"," A Sequel that Measures Up to the First Movie
","Imagine a sequel that is almost as good as the first original movie, or even better. That's not very easy to do. Most sequels are terrible, made only to bank on the original movie's ideas without introducing anything new.<br/><br/>T2 Judgment Day is not an original movie because of its plot, or its idea but it is actually groundbreaking in terms of special effects. I do not like movies that rely on special effects alone for its appeal. There must be more to a movie than just special effects. And T2 delivers it.<br/><br/>T2 is a special movie: This is, I believe, the first time CGI was used. Prior to T2, you could easily make out the image that was pasted to the film. The graphic image would stick out like a sore thumb, its contour easily traceable by naked eye.<br/><br/>With T2, CGI (computer generated imagery) technique has evolved to such a level that creating any image and adding it to the film became possible. And this is done so well, there is really no way of telling it apart from the original film like you could do in movies prior to T2. Contour lines are no longer visible, they are much smoother and blend with the original film.<br/><br/>As for the story, it is almost the repeat to the original movie and there are many parallel scenes. Again two characters fighting each other for the fate of Sarah O'Connor, wait, this time for John O'Connor (Sarah's son); that is one main difference. So we have a new character added to the story. We have a more sophisticated terminator, T1000, the indestructible liquid man - thanks to CGI effects. We get to see the character who is responsible for building the micro-processor that gave birth to SKYNET, the evil mainframe that declared war on humanity.<br/><br/>One thing I would like to emphasize is the performance of Robert Patrick, the actor who portrays T1000. His acting is simply fascinating and, in my opinion, is the reason why this movie works so well. A lot of the people are impresses by the CGI, rightfully so, and forget to give credit where its due. Robert Patrick brought T1000 alive. Without his impeccable performance, the movie would fall flat, even CGI couldn't save the movie. His brute looks, his robotic but finely-tuned moves, his cunning ways were just what this movie needed.<br/><br/>After T2, there were two more franchise movies, T3-The Rise of the Machines and Terminator Salvation."
"jpultwiner","9","4","5","1 November 2010"," Sequel Exception
","This is one of the rare occasion where the sequel far surpassed the original. I would argue that a large part of that has to do with the drastic change in our media culture. For example, these days, if a commercial film is very successful, a studio will almost immediately green light and rush a sequel to the screen. In doing so, it is willing to sacrifice all quality just to take advantage of a hot item and to make money. <br/><br/>The difference here was that because of a legal rights issue, the sequel did not come out until seven years after the original (1984, 1991). Also, James Cameron was behind it and it was his creation to begin with. He wasn't just a gun for hire. James Cameron would never attach his name to something that wasn't of the highest caliber and sense this movie has such extensive visual effects work (Cameron's strong point), the film far surpassed anyone's expectations. It's no wonder that the franchise has fallen apart ever sense he has departed and moved on to other works."

Terminator 1 didn't have proper animation for robotic action. Terminator 4 has number of inconsistence as well as poor storyline. Hope to see these type of movie in the future.

And with a lot of Foster kids, John Connor (Edward Furlong) becomes a young criminal, but at the same time, he's developing survival skills and bravery for the future.<br/><br/>One day, 2 terminators are sent back, one is a T-1000 (Robert Patrick) a liquid metal cyborg whose job is to kill John Connor, and a T-800 (Arnold Shwarzenegger) whose job is to protect John Connor. The 2 of them will stop at nothing to complete their task, which makes a great action flick that even today impresses old and new fans of the series.<br/><br/>Where this film really impresses is not the story, but the Special effects, more so the beginnings of computer graphics. Millions of dollars were spent on them, and they proved just how far they could go for 1991. even today it's amazing to watch how realistic a T-1000 looks turning into liquid metal and moving through metal bars.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I Strongly suggest you check this movie out.

Their's also a wonderful piece of storytelling 3/4 of the way through where Dyson relishes the terrifying consequences of the project he's neglecting his family for.<br/><br/>The performances are memorable particularly Linda Hamilton's Sara Connor and simply put, they'll never make a better action film."

"honorhorror","10","4","5","19 June 2010"," Father-absent series: Terminator 2.
","The moment T-800 took John Connor with one arm and bosom-ed him against his leather jacket, I knew it's cozy, safe to be in there. Why? Because my dad used to put me in his bosom and ride me home on his bicycle. If all the CGI and camera work made Terminator 2 way ahead of its time, then it was the stubborn terminator who refused to die again and again made this movie nearly timeless.<br/><br/>This review along with other reviews in the ""Father-absent series"", intends to explore how the absence of fathers affects people's mind and spirits, in and out of movies.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is the kind of movie that reminds you why you love to see movies. As an enthusiastic fan of the series I bought DVD-9 deluxe set the moment it's released. After maybe 3-4 viewings it again bothered me as what did I own when I say I have this DVD. Do I own the 120 million dollars of budget making T-1000 alive on the screen? No. Do I own the finest hour of Arnold's career? Nope. Maybe even Arnold didn't really enjoy being Terminator after all. What I owned might be the chance to enjoy being chased by crazy cyborgs then being saved by a father-like T-800. It was timeless to me because it was cemented in my childhood memory. 30 years later, when some teenagers buy it in some ultra-definition format, they may not be entirely impressed by the SFX, but they'd be very impressed by their grandfathers' definition of a ""father figure"", or someone with impenetrable chest and belly muscles, a willingness of iron to protect his family, and an unconditional oath of alloy to stick with you.<br/><br/>In this sense, Terminator movies are not only mindless Science fictions, but also a crazy prophecy about our status quo. The prophecy states that we as mankind already failed decades before our destined nuclear holocaust, because in our hands something superior was born. The terminator as the movie portrays, have all the desirable male qualities: versatile, strong, disciplined, and favorably indestructible, blah blah blah. This also reflects how the modern society, how the ""here and now"" philosophy teaches us about man. We are put into jobs to provide accuracy, efficiency in our performances. We are put into families to be an effective money-making machine. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against Capitalism. Ever since my primary school, my arts teacher used to call me ""examination machine"" because he was angry to see my excellence in doing examinations but dull mind in painting. But for some reason, I believed man stands for something unique, something to do with the greater good, something only man can stands for. It seems John Connor's puberty was also a lost journey to find out about man.<br/><br/>The savior in the movie John Connor never met his birth-father, he was raised up by a overburdened, apocalyptic-fanatic mother who's given him everything except a father. Though the later stories about him were all about an ongoing struggle as a savior he may never come to be, Terminator 2's story might just be the most important part of John's life. What he lacked in flesh, the terminator made him up in machine, a perfect substitute of father. Even better, in Sarah Connor his mother's eyes, this ""father"" is better than any father he can have because ""he will stick with John in any circumstances"". Sadly, with his magic ""neurological CPU"" and ""progressive learning"", the terminator finally learned about human's feelings and love, and in his noble action to self-destruct, he completed his dedication to greater good, thus completed his way of martyr.<br/><br/>I don't know about you guys, but I don't have ""Neurological CPU"" and ""progressive learning function"". That being said, my logic would never catch up with the Terminator's logic, so I can't find the answer about the greater good by calculating. Guess as a dumb student who was a ""examination machine"", I can only believe such a thing as ""greater good"" existed. Unlike Mr. Connor who found out about the greater good on a terminator, I find it on Jesus Christ. Also unlike many people's presumption, Christianity had very similar notions with the terminator story. The one that stood out was man's failure to carry on the greater good. The Bible told us mankind has failed their relationship with the Lord God, therefore even this species is going on to exist on the surface of the earth, every one of them can't escape the final destination of death. In other words, they failed before their actual ""judgment day"" just like in the Terminator movies. The difference between the point of the Bible and Terminator movie is just the question why humans failed. If you are particularly curious, please find yourself a copy of Bible to read deeper about it.<br/><br/>John Connor in his 20s, need the harassment of terminators in all genders and all models to remind him of the urgency of apocalypse. Without crazy machines tailing us, what do we need to remind us such urgency? Are natural disasters enough? How about pollutions? Along with our own personal pains, health issues, emotional traumas, political insecurities, these pains of human can very well be our gift from the one who created us, ""a flag of truth in the fortress of sins"" as a great man once said. It's a time to reflex."

","The concept and visual work in and of itself makes this a masterpiece and a piece of history forever immortalized in record. All credit MUST be due to James Cameron because he is a groundbreaking and genius filmmaker. AND this was the highest budgeted movie to date...as we continue to look back at JC's record, he tends to demand these outlandish requirements and backing and yet always pulls it off. Since I have recently seen Avatar (also created by the master), I was fortunate enough to read an article that stated, in short, that Cameron spent the better part of 2 months in a hotel across from the Twentieth Century Fox lot in preparation for the Avatar opening and that Fox basically just handed him the keys as he was there day and night in genius mode. This brings to mind Leonardo DiCaprio's depiction of Howard Hughes when he was making Hell's Angels. <br/><br/>Arnold was perfectly cast as a machine as no one was interested in his acting ability (none really required here) but he was the perfect action star at the time. In addition, we have some of the most groundbreaking explosions, visual effects, effects make-up, and adrenaline pumping action sequences recorded on film to date. PLUS, for all those who don't appreciate any of the technical aspects and major sacrifices that go into the making of a film, it was just plain hardcore fun and entertainment."
"kdnor2011","10","4","5","31 March 2010"," Awesome sequel to awesome movie
","The original Terminator was a masterpiece, and a great example on how to make a great action movie with great special effects without a big budget. So when you make a sequel and get a much bigger budget, you can either make it bigger and better than the original, or bigger and not nearly as good as the original. Thankfully Terminator two is actually better, or at least just as good, but more entertaining than it's predecessor.<br/><br/>Of course near the end we get the big plot hole with if they do mangage to stop the machine uprising, than John would never be born, and then a huge paradox would happen. Also John is a bit of an a##hole in the beginning, but he redeems himself. There are other problems of course but it's mostly nitpicking.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fantastic, with some of the best practical and CGI effects ever. The pacing is perfect, that was one of the problems the first movie had, it was too slow at points, but this movie give you an action scene in just the right place so you don't become bored, nor does it seem like it's just a mindless action movie. The character's are likable, and at times actually pretty funny. And it does bring up good questions about weather you would kill one innocent man if that meant saving millions of other innocent lives.<br/><br/>There are of course other good things in the movie, but I won't spoil anything, if you haven't seen the movie, just go watch it."

James Cameron, as director of the first two cinematic installments of the Terminator franchise, admits how the focal ideas of this tale are gravitating towards the works of author Harlan Ellison, who delivered numerous stories for the sci-fi series Outer Limits, back in 1963. James Cameron was 13 then, and this television program surely must have given him quite a few retina stigmas and a lot of quality fiction to chew on. After all, quality science-fiction really should be able to offer you a fictional language and a collection of ideas you find intriguing and entertaining at the same time, and this exactly is what the Terminator movie was doing, - in fact, does still - back in-, and from- 1984.<br/><br/>Prior to that date, popculture robots were good fellers, cute sidekicks, friendly household appliances, or similar mechanical constructs of the sort that are seeking your bidding and amusement, ready to carry out your commands without hesitation. The Terminator movie rejected this view utterly, creating the then-fresh idea of sophisticated machinery that gets conscious of itself and recognizes its creator as something the world would be more easily manageable without. Machine sends a cyborg assassin back through time with the agenda of eliminating the current leader of the human Resistance. Though the ancient tale of the Golem may come into mind, the idea of intricate and ""evil"" machinery is unknown to the popular culture of the early 80's.<br/><br/>""Evil?"" Why would The Terminator be ""evil?"" It is not. It is carrying out a Command, which is to eliminate the future leader of The Resistance. Yet, from a human point of view, - did you have any other sort of view than that so far? - evil is the capacity to harm without remorse. Since The Terminator has no awareness of such a vague concept as remorse, because remorse has no function nor relevance in spite of carrying out its mission with efficiency, the titular character indeed becomes the worst nightmare human can face: a nightmare that knows no mercy, simply because it does not know mercy, indeed.<br/><br/>Fortunately, it was Arnold Schwarzenegger who could cement the extremely rare Popculture-Demigod status with his paradigmatic portrayal of the cyborg assassin, the T800 Terminator, as originally Cameron wanted a Terminator figure that blends in more easily. He wanted Lars Henriksen, among others - this concept became realized in the Aliens, two years after The Terminator.<br/><br/>If one wants to be honest AND a Terminator geek at the same time - and let us want that, for a moment - then it is safe to state that a Terminator movie simply is not a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger, since the heart and soul of the entire franchise is Schwarzenegger, as he is methodically-, thoroughly clears out an entire police station with a shotgun, wearing cheap sunglasses, T800 haircut and a black leather jacket.<br/><br/>The Terminator movie gains a pure-musculature continuation via its 1991 sequel Judgment Day, as director James Cameron has a masterful sense of what to offer-, what to show to deliver an installment that has no other agenda than to entertain with fresh and inventive elements he found, as result of going on with the story. This time, the T800 model becomes a good guy, while the main baddie is coming for you through the introduction of the state of the art T1000 model, the perfected cybernetic organism. As of now, the T800's assignment is to protect the leader of the Resistance from the death clutch of an even more efficient cyborg assassin, a construct Cameron uses to deliver inventive, state of the art special effects, revealing narrative brilliance and related playfulness at the core.<br/><br/>The T2 movie is a cybernetic rat race really, orchestrated-, and operated by the simple conflict of the urge of Termination and the confronting urge of Termination-Prevention: the idea is as grateful as it is elegantly simplistic, and Cameron has a whole lot to tell about how good of a time he has with all the significant elements he brings to the fray. The T2 movie does everything with the largely abused term: action packed-, and THEN does some more with it. The reason the movie remains an accomplishment of truly slick qualities, is the accumulated result of Cameron's sense of how to give an extremely sharp character to a scene ""simply by"" throwing in masterful elements that can't help but support a set via their mere presence and their slickly chosen functionalities.<br/><br/>In the exceptionally memorable chase sequence, for example, Arnold rides a good, old fashioned Harley Davidson bikebeast, removing the obstacles in his way via his favorite good, old fashioned shotgun, reloading it in a way that gives male viewers an immediate extra layer of hair to the chest via every buckshot implemented. Meanwhile, the state of the art T1000 model bids in radical proportions when the moment whispers lies about a second of peace, just to be shattered utterly-, and quite literally. Not to mention how Edward Furlong invents the ""Emo"" subculture without having any knowledge about that.<br/><br/>T2 delivers decently from a storytelling point of view as well, as the primal portrayal of the bond between the exceptionally strong mother figure and her son eventually invites the narrative to a satisfactory emotional culmination the whole franchise could settle idle upon, with<br/><br/><ul><li>spoiler warning - </li></ul><br/><br/>Arnold giving you the thumbs.<br/><br/><ul><li>spoiler ends - </li></ul><br/><br/>The Terminator tale goes on of course, to entertain its fans further on, but the franchise is yet to see an actor and related character who surpasses-, or even approximates the gravitational pull of the so far unrivaled canvas presence Arnold Schwarzenegger stigmatized the Terminator mythology with.<br/><br/>http://opiniononion.blogspot.com/"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","4","5","31 July 2009"," Groundbreaking for its time -- a consummate action film
","It's almost unfair to write this review in 2009, a shocking 20 years since this film was put into production, where the future that James Cameron imagined is much closer than before and the effects he did with computers are now standard action techniques. Kids growing up from here on out watching ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" won't even have a sense of ground this film broke, and consequently their overall enjoyment of the film will be a bit less. I give this film 8/10 when it's deserving of more in the right context -- these kids might go lower.<br/><br/>But even the lowest of budgets can be better than a digital spectacle with a better story. ""T2"" has that story, brilliantly taking its iconic villain, The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) from the first film, and bringing him back as a good guy. Genius. This time he is sent back in time to protect a 10-year-old John Connor (Edward Furlong), son of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and leader of the humans in the future when the machines they create turn on them -- not kill him. That job is left to T-1000 (Robert Patrick), who is made of shape-shifting liquid metal. Today, that's nothing, but 20 years ago, T-1000 joined the ranks of Darth Vader on the villains list and there he still stays in the minds of many.<br/><br/>Much like 1984's ""The Terminator,"" one guy from the future is good, the other bad, and both are engaged in the life of a human who is pivotal to the future. Wherever one goes, the other follows. The difference is that James Cameron has turned the weapons and explosives scale up to a 15 on a scale of 10. Hamilton, once an '80s party girl, is now an angry and muscular 35-year-old who goes crazy on people; Schwarzenegger's shotgun is now on the puny end of his arsenal.<br/><br/>James Cameron wows with the action. It sort of erases his attempt to tell a story about the differences between humans and robots through the relationship between John and the Terminator, but just about everything with a motor or a computer chip in it meets some sort of spark-flying combustible end. <br/><br/>Plus, it all looks better than the first. Cameron has much better models of Schwarzenegger to beat up and he weaves them in more cleverly. The make-up is also superior. Talk about a visual marvel for its time -- all the Oscars for various effects and make-up are certainly well- deserved. Cameron decides that an action movie about the future isn't worth making unless it breaks ground. It's hard to disagree with the man.<br/><br/>The acting could still be better, but believe it or not, I don't mean Schwarzenegger. He's actually much better now that he's got the English thing down -- or at least intelligible. Hamilton's Sarah is just too angry and a withered shell of her former self, which makes sense in the context of the story but makes her not too likable. Furlong, as young John, is kind of a whiny and obnoxious turd who desperately needs his voice to drop. Neither matter too much, however, because Terminator is super easy to root for ... and they're fighting to save the human race in the future, which is cool.<br/><br/>Nowadays it's sadly easy to shake-off explosions and action stunts in movies like it's been- there-done-that, but also in the age of the move to 3D and miraculous CGI, it shouldn't be hard for the movie-goer who appreciates today's groundbreaking technology to consider the same for a movie made 20 years ago."
"abezerrav","10","4","5","13 July 2009"," One of the best action epics
","I was absolutely amazed when I saw this extraordinary piece of work. All the actors are amazing, it's funny, yet riveting and thrilling. And has a great and very important message for humanity today. I had never really been interested in the terminator films, but this film just blew me away, the special effects were just mind boggling for the time. It has such amazing character development and a great story. I just recommend everyone to see this film. It captivates you from beginning, all the way to the end, which is very hopeful and beautiful. Thank you James Cameron for giving us such an amazing sci fi epic. And thank you to all the cast for terrific performances. John Connor is one the best and the most human heroes of all time."
"Patel_KH","10","4","5","9 July 2009"," My favourite and for some very good reasons...
","I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect)<br/><br/>________________________________________________________________ <br/><br/>Visual Pleasure:[100%] Visually, this film is a monumental landmark. A dream film for every action-movie supporter. The futuristic scenes were classic for a film shot before 1991. And the present day scenes are no less epic. Especially the Truck-Chase scene (this in my mind is the single-most awesome action sequence in the history of film-making). We are treated to some of best action sequences EVER in the entire movie. T-1000 & T-101 face-offs will be cherished by me for the rest of my life. <br/><br/>Director's Work:[100%] James Cameron needs no introduction. And this is probably his best work (he has done few of the best films so its no small statement). He weaves each and every scene so well that its truly magical and a viewer's delight.<br/><br/>Acting:[100%] Wow! That about describes it. The best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie by miles. Edward Furlong's best movie (he was exceptional...no-one else would've been more appropriate). Robert Patrick's best movie. And above all Linda Hamilton's iconic role as Sarah Connor (Curse Oscar jury for not giving a well deserved Oscar to the greatest action female character of all-time:Sarah Connor).<br/><br/>Entertainment Value:[100%] Perfect! Couldn't ASK for more. A high octane and thrilling ride throughout the movie. This is what I call COMPLETE SATISFACTION or in Hindi:""Paisa Vasool"".<br/><br/>Script:[100%] Flawless. Some of the best one-liners EVER. A superb message:""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"". The relationship between a Terminator(Arnold) and human(John) was awe-inspiring. There are endless things I can list down here but its better if you experience it.<br/><br/>__________________________________________________________________ <br/><br/>My Advice: A MUST-SEE for EVERY action-movie fan. This film will definitely pass the test of time. In General, if anyone is a normal movie-buff, you should see this...What am I saying?? I'm sure everyone must have seen this if not something's wrong with you. Its a classic. My all-time favourite movie (and i've seen many-many films including most of the olden classics). I adore this movie! <br/><br/>_____ <br/><br/>10/10"
"lagriff05","10","4","5","27 June 2009"," Awesome, awesome, awesome.
","The differences between this and the first one are just night and day. The first one was good; very good, even, but this is just a whole other level of badassery. I'm going to have to divide this review into factions to explain it:<br/><br/>The Action: The biggest feature here that everyone seems to talk about is the Liquid Terminator, or T1000, and goddamn if I'm not going to agree with them, because he is truly awesome. The action here is a lot of the time just proportionate to how create whatever the T1000 is doing is, with all of his metamorphic features. But there are still enough cool explosions here to satisfy me, too.<br/><br/>The Story: A quite archetypal (and brilliantly told) tale of warning of apocalypse and action heroics, T2 also possesses an interesting moral qualm partially through involving human life and the intricacy within. T2 packs a little of just about everything, from action to science fiction to romance to drama, and it ties it all together in an explosive package that nobody should miss. There are a lot of cool little themes here too, like how the kid teaches Arnold things - and how the ""no killing people"" thing is carried through with such style - or the evolution of Sarah Connor's character from the first movie to this one, and all of this interspersed with the high-octane action makes for a hugely gratifying experience.<br/><br/>The epic scope, vision and dynamics of this movie are just incredible. It does so much and yet never manages to lose the viewers at all like some other movies might. Terminator 2 is a superlative movie and definitely one of, if not THE, best sequels ever made. See it if you haven't already, and remember, you CAN change your destiny."
"saarvardi","10","4","5","21 May 2009"," A quintessential action movie - T2 is a sci-fi roller-coaster that defined an entire generation of moviegoers!
","In my book, Terminator 2: Judegement Day was one of those rare flashes of genius Hollywood bumps into every once in a while. From the breathtaking visuals (that still hold well after 18 years) to the maverick storytelling (kudos to legendary director James Cameron for that) and genuine performances by the cast members (not just Schwarzenegger's Terminator, but also Linda Hamilton as one of the best female heroines ever, as well as Robert Patrick as the ruthless killer T-1000) - T2: Judgement Day was (and still is) a roller-coaster of movie making at its finest. <br/><br/>Plot-wise, it advanced the series' cannon story of the apocalyptic future where robots rule the world and human resistance is strong yet outnumbered. This time around, the robots send the shape-shifting T-1000 to destroy Sarah Connor's future-leader-of-the-resistance, John Connor, at the tender age of 10. But their attempts to destroy the human defiance is met with a precocious John Cononor, his mother Sarah (who has since the fist installment) has turned into a lean, mean, killing-machine) and the aforementioned Terminator (the one and only Schwarzenegger), this time being on the right side of the resistance.<br/><br/>When this movie was first released back in 1991, I was a mere 10 year old child (just like John). I remember watching it twice at the movie theater and being blown away over and over again each time. If there was anything I was ever close to idolizing as a kid, it was T2 (especially Arnold Schwarzenegger). I remember later dressing up as The Terminator for Purim and hanging a very big poster of the film over my bed. Those were good times, and i'm sure current-day viewers will have a positive experience watching this as well.<br/><br/>P.S. - I also liked T3, but it was less loyal to the first two, which marked it a lesser film in my book (although it did include one of my favorite endings ever)."
"KUAlum26","10","4","5","31 January 2009"," More fun with multiple viewings
","I've seen a lot of movies in the theater(where movies SHOULD be seen),particularly since I turned eighteen which was not quite twenty years ago,so I have probably forgotten more movie experiences than some have had. I preface this comment with that because I saw this first when it was just two days freshly released, the 5th of July 1991,and I recall it(And even some of the anticipation for the film)like--if not yesterday--it was last week or last month. I got there late and had to sit and watch this WAAAAAaaaaayyyy in the back in the single seat reserved for the wheelchair patrons(I didn't quite understand that that was what those seats were for back then.Ay!). Having said all that,this filmgoing experience was STILL very memorable and quite fun.<br/><br/>Flip forward over the years and,having seen this a number of times--in full and in partial--on big and small screens alike,but having not really sat and watched this in probably sixteen years,I bought this at the local movies and music secondhand store for a song and finally got around to watching it. <br/><br/>Not only did I enjoy seeing this again,I think I may've actually gotten MORE out of it than before.<br/><br/>The original HK T-800 model killing machine,so iconically fleshed out by Mr.Schwarzenegger,returns from the future to find John Connor,11(then newbie actor Edward Furlong,mixing annoying,tweener brattiness with an uncanny adult sensibility)and protect him from a new killing menace--the T-1000(Robert Patrick,then unknown and coolly menacing,counterbalancing the thunderous brute strength of Arnold's original),a liquid metal upgraded terminator with a scary efficient ability to both repair and replicate its victims and/or prey. John,despite advisement to the contrary,goes and rescues his mother,the intrepid Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton,ripped and sexy,in a haggard,toughened way that would probably change her career image permanently). Of course,becoming more and more aware of the seemingly inescapable doom of mankind's existence in the shadow of SkyNet's advent,she moves to change the future pro-actively,with interesting and even heart-breaking outcomes.<br/><br/>Well before JAmes CAmeron became much more famous for winning awards for a faux romantic adventure about a large cruise ship sinking,he was much more remembered as making films like this:adrenaline-soaked blow-ups with unrelenting action and sharp(if perhaps a tad trite)dialog. This movie is probably king of them all. Sort of an expanded,more ambitious take on the original movie,it is more of a augmentation of the original's concept,taking it to levels it couldn't on the original's budget. Screenplay writer William Wisher is able to make the most out of clipped dialog,though the actors in place help it out immensely. A fantastic film-watching experience that only seems,like fine wine,get better with age and more viewings."
"adel-khiat","10","4","5","28 January 2009"," What more could you want from a movie
","This is my first time writing a review so i'll make it short I have watched this movie over 30 times and still could watch it again. The reason for this is that this movie has everything, action, drama, comedy, and some breath taking scenes. This is the movie when Arnold put his name on the top list. Even though he didn't do much acting (for being a ""robot"" and all) he managed to pull his character, would i say perfectly If you haven't seen this yet i highly recommend it to everyone (but not little children off course). After you've seen this your life will have a new light toward movies. I really thank Arnold for making this movie. It will be remembered for a very long time."
"emperor_bender","10","4","5","23 January 2009"," A sequel that's on the same level as the original
","The Terminator was a lower budget, fun action movie. The movie was only held back by the lack of budget and nothing else really. Terminator 2 didn't have that same problem.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is one of the best action movies of the 90's and is, to me; a 90's icon. You can not bring up the 90's without thinking about grunge rock, Seinfeld, pogs, ""No Fear"" clothes, Pokemon, X-Files, and Terminator 2.<br/><br/>Aside from the impact it has had on popular culture, Terminator 2 is just one of those movies you can find almost nothing wrong with. Its nearly impossible to not like one thing about it or another.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the movie itself. The plot: A terminator (Robert Patrick) called the T-1000 is sent back to the present/past only this time its after John Connor (Edward Furlong), not Sarah (Linda Hamilton). The Terminator is also FAR more advanced here. Oddly enough, an older Terminator (Arnold), a recommissioned T-800 called the T-101 has been reprogrammed and sent back to protect John.<br/><br/>The acting was all perfect, and the effects were top-notch. I loved the chase scenes and the future scenes. The movie had a little of everything to enjoy. Highly recommended for fans of the first.<br/><br/>10/10."
"sirtymo","10","4","5","5 January 2009"," A movie that has held up
","To say that Terminator 2 has held up well over these last 18 years is a vast understatement the movie still looks amazing and you are still throwing your fists in the air every time Arnoldo blows a hole in the T-1000 the scenes where the T-1000 turns into liquid metal looks so good even by today's standards I was watching the film yesterday and i by now submission ended up watching a good thirty to forty five minutes of the film. James Cameron has given us at least two of th greatest action movies this gem and Aliens. Also look at the fact that both of these are sequels to very well liked almost horror movies. Cameron knows where to put the camera and knows how to make the action work. Now without even touching the surface look at the acting Arnold who also did the first Terminator in 84 and has aged amazingly well hell even looks better and they have flipped the script to turn what Sara conner fears most into what she needs to stay alive. To make your greatest threat your greatest ally is a true mark of a great storyteller."

This time, the Conner's are the target of the T-1000 (Patrick), a more advanced Terminator model.<br/><br/>Fantastic sequel which returns all the wonderful cast and crew of the original, as well as making it better with Patrick and Furlong.

","I am a very enthusiastic and dedicated movie fan and reviewer. I want it known that this movie is without a doubt the best and most complete movie I have seen in my 26 year existence.<br/><br/>Between the brilliant music, casting, directing, cinematography, and plot I have adamantly defended this movie again and again to the negligent and the educated. It is simply perfect in every respect. I have gone into movies the last 16 years waiting for something to beat this title but nothing has. When something does surpass this title one day I will stand and applaud. This is quite simply the best movie ever made!"
"neil-476","10","4","5","4 October 2007"," An observation
","With nearly 650 reviews at this point, I haven't read them all so I may be repeating something which has been said elsewhere (although I haven't spotted it among the pages I've sampled).<br/><br/>I liked the way Cameron didn't so much repeat the first film as echo it - there were many places where something from the original showed up again, but in a different context, making a different point, driving the plot forward.<br/><br/>I liked the way that the gradual role reversal from the first film (Reese strong and supportive, Sarah weak and helpless at the start, exactly reversed by the end) was echoed in the relationship between Sarah and John.<br/><br/>Which is why I was particularly surprised at the garage scene with the learning chip being cut from the release print - not only does it illuminate several points which follow it and which don't make sense otherwise, it is also the pivotal moment when John assumes the dominant role in his relationship with his mother which, in turn, echoes the moment in the first film when Sarah starts protecting Kyle rather than vice versa.<br/><br/>And another vote in favour of the groundbreaking effects, particularly the way they served the story rather than becoming the reason for it."
"Jakethemuss","10","4","5","28 August 2007"," Never ceases to amaze me
","This is one of those fairly rare cases where the sequel surpasses the original. In fact, T2 surpasses a lot of films, old and new. It was made around 7 years after the first outing, and is clearly operating on a much larger budget than the original. It has a blockbuster feel to it, as to the late night, B-movie theme of the first one, which still became a cult film despite its low budget.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing, even by todays standards, but unlike other Hollywood blockbusters, it has story, emotion and depth to accompany the explosions, chases and CGI. It has been 16 odd years now since it was made, and despite afew choice haircuts and references to old school gaming systems, it feels as if it hasn't aged a day.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, but unlike her character in the first one, she is now a lean, mean ass kicking warrior woman. Arnie returns as the T101 Terminator, only this time he is playing a bodyguard sent by the rebel side, to protect a young John Connor (Eddie Furlong) the future leader of the resistance. Those who have seen the film (almosy everyone) will know just how much protection John Connor needs, as the machines send back the dreaded T1000 (Robert Patrick), a being formed of liquid metal, that can manipulate his body into almost anything at the drop of a hat, queue amazing special effects.<br/><br/>Sarah, John and the T101 unite soon enough and start a quest to try and prevent the rise of Cyberdine Systems, who are the company responsible for creating a special chip in the near future. This chip will give machines the ability to think for themselves, which in turn will have a devastating, and I mean DEVASTATING effect on the general population. They do this specifically by locating a computer developer named Miles Dyson, who is the lead scientist in the project. All the while, the T1000 is following their moves. He is more advanced than the T101, more ruthless and will not stop until his mission is complete.<br/><br/>This film is literally great scene after great scene. There is the brilliant storm drain chases scene, Sarah's escape from the mental institution, T101 with the chain-gun, the battles between T1000 and his target's bodyguard, with the last half hour or so being pure excitement. The character development is brilliant as well, seeing Sarah's bond with her endangered son John, John's father-son bond with the increasingly human 'machine', and Robert Patrick playing the emotionless T1000 with cold eyed precision.<br/><br/>This is a film which sweeps you up and pulls you into whats happening. It has laughs and humour to ease the tension, classic lines, great cinematography, top notch action sequences and scenes that will stay with you long after watching. If you haven't seen this, you truly should. It is unmissable."

","I'm not even going to bother with a real review of this film, because it has like 4000 other reviews and most people know what it is even if they haven't seen it. Sarah Conner's in an insane asylum, and a robot from the future has come to kill her son. But don't worry, because her son (in the future) sent his own robot back to kill the other robot and save the son (himself). Yeah, it might not make sense from a time travel point of view, but just deal with it.<br/><br/>What to say? Arnold is great, as usual (though this is no ""Commando""). Edward Furlong is young, but does a fine job. I don't have the crush on him some people do, but he's cool. Robert Patrick is also awesome, even if he has creepy weird ears. And this is more action than you'll get in most films, which is probably what you want if you're watching this.<br/><br/>There, that was my little review. Maybe next time i see the film, I'll expand it to something with substance. But for now, this is good enough... read the other reviews instead.

If you ask me, Arnold and Linda Hamilton deliver electrifying performances that are out of this world. If you ask me, the liquid metal and special effects were fantastic.

All of them go to Cyberdyne and try to destroy it before T-1000 gets ahold of them.<br/><br/>
Filmed with amazing special effects and an interesting storyline, ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" scores a pretty high rating in my book. This feature ends up being pretty than the original. <br/><br/>The acting was very good in this film. The acting from Arnold Schwarzenagger, Linda Hamilton, and Robert Patrick was all good, as for Edward Furlong, a fair performance. I didn't expect much from him, after all, this was his pre-""American History X"" performance.<br/><br/>
The special effects in the film are top-notch. They were very well done and even helped the movie win an Academy Award. <br/><br/>""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is one of my favorite Action movies ever made. The special edition DVD makes it even more fun to watch, with the picture and sound remastered. You won't be disappointed with the ending, the emotion between The Terminator and John cannot be missed. You cannot miss out on this movie, or ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"", releasing this year.<br/><br/>

"baumer","10","4","5","2 July 1999"," One of the best sequels ever made.
","James Cameron is a God.  He has to be.  There are so few directors that can make films the way he can.  In fact I would go out on a limb here and say that besides Spielberg ( who himself is a God ) no one can make films the way he can.  Terminator was a great film.  But T2 is really heads and shoulders above it.  Sequels don't usually surpass the original, but this one sure did.<br/><br/>T2 explores so many of the same issues as the first one but it goes deeper into them.  It gives us more visuals of what a desolate future would be like after a nuclear war.  And it gives more reason to be pessimistic towards our own species.  "" We're not going to make it, are we? "" John asks the Terminator.  "" It's in your nature to desroy yourselves. ""  How chilling is that?  And how true?  As a sci-fi/action movie, this is one of the best. But this could also be taken on the same level as a horror film.  Just an incredibly expensive and well made horror film.<br/><br/>What an idea to add to the first films paranoia by not just having Arnold come back to play a good Terminator, but to have the seemingly invincible T-1000 become the enemy added a whole new dimension to the film.<br/><br/>This film has a bigger budget and it had higher expectations but it did not cease from being dark and intelligent enough to make us think.  It also has some great humour.  And Arnold doesn't disappoint, he utter the famous line "" I'll be back! ""<br/><br/>T2 is a movie miracle.  It is so well made and enteraining while having a message that it is quite simply one of the best films ever made.  I love what James Cameron does when he is behind a camera and I loved this movie. It is a true work of art.  And one hell of an entertaining film."

","This One's a seriously moving picture. Don't get me wrong, it's action packed and is full of enough shrapnel to de-bark a forest, but the underlying message and subversive tones of whatever you can find wrong with the future of the world within the story is to impress about more."
"ferreth","10","4","5","16 January 2002"," Should be in the top ten
","This movie blew me away when I saw it in the theatre - as much for the thoughtful ending as for the FX, story, characterization. There are very few movies I would give a 'ten', this being one of them, despite the time travel story, which I normally don't like in SF. There are only a handful of SF movies that equal this one, (2001, Contact, Star Wars:Empire Strikes Back) none really exceed it; it's THAT good. Overall best action SF movie out there - a must own."
"GuyCC","8","4","5","25 December 2001"," Entertaining Retelling Of The Original Film.
","And really, this is what T2 is.  Giving Arnold the Kyle Resse role the time around to promote Schwarzenegger's then newer ""good guy"" image.  But downplaying that, this film definitely keeps the entertainment and wow factor.<br/><br/>It's T-800 versus the shape-shifting T-1000 in another battle for the future and the fate of John Connor.  A more buff version of Linda Hamilton.  A supporting role from Sam of ""Diff'rent Stokes"" as John's punk friend.  Lots of explosions, gun fights and chases.  And still remarkably good special effects even by today's standards.  Schwarzenegger has charisma.  His acting range is best in two areas, acting and comedy, and this film allows him to do both.  His cyborg persona's attempt to understand humanity ranges from funny to surprisingly touching.  The plot is a retelling of the original film, but it's a secondary point for the sheer entertainment value that's delivered from this film. <br/><br/>There's not much that truly can be said about this film ten years after its release.  It's a landmark film in the sci-fi genre, especially for its technical advances with CG effects.  The ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD released last year is a ""must get"" as it adds deleted scenes to the film (The Terminator learning to smile is well worth the price of admission), as well as the ""extras"" book and all the ""Behind the Scenes"" information.  And the audio quality is nothing to sneeze at, either.  An excellent demonstration of any sound system.<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgement Day remains a remarkable film.  Go in expecting lots of action and a classic Arnold performance, and there will be little to be disappointed with.  With a ""T3"" in the works, it seems that not only the future of humanity is uncertain, but of this franchise as well.  Hopefully they'll be able to one-up the standards of sci-fi again, and not be out just to make a quick buck."

"action-6","7","4","5","18 August 2000"," Excellent movie, but not as good as the first movie
","Terminator 2 was the most expensive movie in the world when it was released back in 1992.  This movie is a big-budget-blockbuster, whereas the original movie was a cultish action/sci-fi made on a small budget. The extra cash means cooler and more spectacular actionscenes, tons of special-effects(but they look a bit crap now) and better-looking scenery. The movie is almost as good as the original, but this is why I think the original Terminator is a bit better: it doesn`t have the annoying and completely useless brat whose name is John Connor, it was an overall darker movie and Schwarzenegger was more sadistic(which is what The Terminator is all about). Still, it is a must see for those who`ve seen T1, just turn your head away from the TV-screen when John Connor(Eddie Furlong) enters the screen. 9/10"
"ccthemovieman-1","8","15","27","15 January 2007"," Many Annoyances, But An Incredible Action Flick
","I usually don't rate highly movies in which I can't stand listening to two-thirds of the lead characters, but this film has so many spectacular, memorable moments it always fascinates me....and brings me back. I enjoyed all three of the ""Terminator"" films but this one has always stood out.....because of the villain and the incredible special-effects. <br/><br/>When this movie came out, the FX regarding Robert Patrick's cyborg-patrol cop were so jaw- dropping, so astounding that people couldn't believe what they were seeing. Some 15 years later, they are still cool. Watching Patrick morph into various characters is incredible, literally changing shapes or having his fingers or arms extend to an awl-like instruments. For a long time, he looks like the most indestructible ""person"" I've ever seen in a film. He certainly is still one of the most unique villains ever shown on film.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger, an intelligent but less-advanced cyborg, plays the only likable character. The mother-son combination of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are too hard-edged, too smart-mouthed for my tastes. Hamilton was a lot more feminine and humanistic in the first ""Terminator."" Now she's ultra-macho and profane. Much worse than her is her kid, a real punk if there ever was one. There's something very irritating about Furlong, and not just the character he plays here. I'm not surprised he never became a star. <br/><br/>Actually, a lot of the dialog in here is terrible and a testimony to the sleazy people who wrote the screenplay. The director, James Cameron, has done a number of similar films with foul- mouthed characters. <br/><br/>Still, despite all these annoyances, as a fan of special-effects and a good adventure yarn, I can't help but keep watching this DVD every three or four years."
"Quebec_Dragon","9","5","7","9 June 2009"," The best Terminator in every regard
","After watching every Terminator movie, I can honestly say this one is the best: a sequel that surpasses the original, the landmark that sequels are compared to. The plot is tight, logical and constantly surprises you (compare to the plot problems in Terminator Salvation). T2 can even be seen before all others as I did many years ago as it stands by itself. The cinematography and camera shots are beautiful. Notice the color schemes particularly in the asylum (blue-gray) and the foundry (orange-red). The ""visions"" scenes are very inspired and memorable. The action is intense, engrossing and escalating as it should be. The visual effects are very impressive and were revolutionary back then, especially anything involving the T-1000. The actors are top-notch particularly Linda Hamilton who shines in the strong yet fragile, tough yet conflicted Sarah Connor, the role of her life.<br/><br/>The terminators, supposed to be unemotional, are quite cool, menacing and relentless yet fascinating. The interactions between John Connor and the terminator are wonderful and add depth to both characters. After seeing T2 for the first time, I was so awed by Robert Patrick's performance that I kept looking for him in other movies. Everything is in the physicality and the deliberate movements with no small nod to the talents of the director. Compare the T-1000 to the terminatrix in T3 who for some reason was much less memorable. The music is much better and grandiose than the first (such a good percussive theme) and the sound effects are so good they won 2 academy awards. Let's finish by mentioning the powerful unforgettable ending that is not only moving but ties up neatly the loose ends. There's actually something big that does not make sense (darn time travel paradoxes) but even after seeing T2 more than once, it just doesn't bug you when you actually watch the film. It's definitely worth buying but be careful with the different DVD editions. <br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10"

","Well, I wasn't going to comment on this film, but I find that I have to. Comparing it to Lawrence of Arabia or Ben Hur is like saying that the Batman cartoonists can use chiaroscuro as well as Rembrandt did. I mean, I can see Arnie doing a cameo in a Kenneth Branagh film in the near future, can't you? He has so much heart, and does a great job of expressing the universal human spirit.<br/><br/>This is a film that I loved when I was in high school. I am no longer in high school. I no longer love the film. It is a congeries of major elements in the American action film formula: lots of ""cool"" one-liners, impressive special effects, and lots of explosions and chase scenes. At least when the film sticks to these it's entertaining in that ripping legs off of spiders sort of manner. But when it strays into the arena of philosophical rumination it's just downright sad.<br/><br/>One has to be embarrassed for Mr. Cameron that he thinks this should be taken seriously, particularly the facile conclusion at the movie's end. If I want deep thoughts I'll watch something by Bergman or Tarkovsky. Cameron's like a French neo-classicist with some technical skills who's straining himself trying to produce something profound and winds up making a picture that has a proficient surface but no soul."

"colm-hearne365","10","6","9","17 October 2015"," Truly one of the best sequels ever made
","It's hard to believe that Terminator 2 is over 20 years old and even today it's considered a masterpiece and Arnold Schwarzenegger's best. As a matter of fact, I'm the same age as the movie! I mean the first Terminator movie is a classic also and gave both Arnold and director James Cameron their big break. But Terminator 2 is what cemented it all and took the franchise to a whole new level. I mean pretty much everything about it is excellent: the acting, the writing, the action scenes, the music, the visual effects and the characters. It even had a couple of surprises and twists for us as well. <br/><br/>One of the things I love most about movie is the relationship between John Connor and the Terminator which how John bonds with the machine and teaches it how to be more human and understand the importance of human life and emotion. In fact, the Terminator becomes a father figure (similar to how Ripley becomes a mother figure to Newt in Aliens). <br/><br/>As for the acting, everyone knows Arnold Schwarzenegger can't act, but still you got to love him as the Terminator because that was the role he was born to play. Also Linda Hamilton was incredible reprising her role as a heroine specializing in guns and weapons. And this movie was a nice introduction to Edward Furlong since this was his first movie and he managed to pull off as a rebellious kid yet always tries to do the right thing. And Robert Patrick made an even better villain who is menacing, intimidating and powerful. In fact, he was almost unstoppable if it wasn't for that steel mill. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, Terminator 2 is one of my favourite movies of all time, as it is for many other people as well. I just wished they hadn't made the two other sequels. I mean Terminator 3 was disappointing but Terminator 4 was okay but I haven't seen Terminator 5 yet. I mean it got bad reviews but a lot of fans seemed to have enjoyed it. Even James Cameron said he liked it so maybe I'll give it a try when it comes out on DVD. But I seriously doubt it could as epic as Terminator 2."

","I have seen this movie in the cinema in 1991. I was blown away, even because I had not seen Terminator 1. Even T1 was great, but T2 was the best! I bought the extended DVD and I loved the extended version of T2. There were scenes cut out of the movie what made the story more understandable.<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger and Patrick gave a remarkable performance as a terminator. I did not like Schwarzenegger in T3, he did not have to make that movie. T3 was a great disappointing.<br/><br/>I like the fact they did not go for the alternate ending with the old Sarah Connor. The original ending with the highway road was much better. I liked Linda Hamilton even when she was the beauty in beauty and the beast. She is one of my favorite actresses, and unfortunately highly underrated.<br/><br/>I liked Furlong very much, his drug history is a waste of talent. I hope he'll come back. There was something I did not understand. In the interviews I heard that all terminators would have the look of Schwarzenegger. Did is wrong, because in T1 Reese gets a dream of a terminator coming into their bunker, but it wasn't Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>The idea of the terminator with skin around the metal skelet is that a normal man cannot see that it is a terminator. When you make all terminators with the (outside) look of Schwarzenegger, it would not be a disguise anymore.<br/><br/>T1 and T2 were great, T3 was very wrong. Schwarzenegger was not convincing anymore. I'm curious about T4,5 and 6 with Bale. Although I think no one can replace Schwarzenegger, I think it is time for some new flesh. Schwarzenegger has left the building. I don't know why Nick Stahl played John Connor in T3, that was such a miscast! I hoped for the actor who played a few seconds John Connor in T2 (Michael Edwards), to let him be the Connor in T3. But no, nobody asked for my opinion. ;-) Schwarzie, if Stallone can make films at his age, even you can. You are not the guy for politics. You have to make T3 up for your fans. T3 sucked big time! I hope you'll be back in T4. Don't let Batman get you."
"Sonatine97","7","6","9","4 July 2001"," One Of The Better Sequels
","T2 is a fab movie, especially with its 2nd generation cgi and the introduction of Morphing. Coupled with a good, but slightly convoluted script, and passable acting, T2 deserved to be a box office smash.<br/><br/>It was also good to see Arnie return but this time as the good cyborg as opposed to the baddie in T1. Robert Patrick was also very good as the T1000 but again, the sfx took most of his character away so he didn't do very much other than do a lot of killing, staring & running.<br/><br/>I also felt Linda Hamilton just didn't ""look"" right as her powerful role, Sarah Connor compared to her original performance in T1. In T2 she looks thin, pale, drawn and doesn't seem to have the same drive or mommentum that she did in T1, even though we have to accept a certain amount of deterioration owing to her incarceration in a mental institution.<br/><br/>Ed Furlong, is also quite flat in the acting dept as the young John Connor. He didn't convince for a second and made the film feel uneven: there are better child actors available but I'm afraid Ed just didn't cut the mustard here.<br/><br/>It's a shame the Mike Biehn didn't reprise his role because he would've added more interpersonal characterisation between Sarah & himself. But as it is the film lacks a certain ""warmth"" that leaves the audience isolated and not fully caring for any of the lead characters.<br/><br/>It cannot be denied that T2 is a great film but only in the context of sfx and extending the scope of the sci-fi genre. Otherwise the film looks a pale imitation to the original & superior Terminator.<br/><br/>**/*****"

"beermonsteruk","10","2","2","23 December 2019"," One of the all time great sequels.
","The long awaited sequel, T2: Judgement Day, was it worth the wait? Definitely! Is it better than the first? Not in my opinion. Is it still a classic? Hell yeah! This absolute monster box office hit took the world by storm in 1991 and to me is still the definitive 90s big budget (Sci-Fi) action movie, just as the original was very much an 80s movie this is very much a 90s film (in a good way, I don't view it as dated, it's of its time) and yet still holds up to this day.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton return in their roles along with some familiar faces from the first, and Robert Patrick and Edward Furlong appear in main roles.<br/><br/>
Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is no longer the target of Termination (her son is now 10) and she is institutionalised at a psychiatric facility under the orders of Doctor Silberman, in contrast to her bubbly upbeat persona of the first film, she is now a hardened and highly skilled warrior, frustrated at no one believing her as well as being denied release due to constant violent outbursts, determined to continue former lover Kyle Reese's mission and keep her beloved son alive, has to find an escape.<br/><br/>Meanwhile her son John Connor (Furlong), a young delinquent, believing his mother to be crazy, is suddenly made aware of the importance of his existence (and realising his mother was not lying after all) when confronted by a seemingly murderous policeman (Robert Patrick), Arnie reappears as The unstoppable Terminator only this time he's been programmed to protect John Connor from a seemingly even more powerful Terminator (the liquid T-1000).<br/><br/>
A thrilling cat and mouse game occurs between The T-800 and Furlongs John Connor, and Patrick's Metallic Liquid T-1000 who has morphing abilities and immune to mechanical damage, how will they defeat a seemingly unstoppable foe who will stop at nothing to eliminate Sarah's young son.<br/><br/>
This is a classic sci-fi action blockbuster the pinnacle of its genre and one of the biggest hits of the 90s, and while not as dark and tension filled as it's predecessor (theirs more comic relief here and Arnies Terminator has almost been given a human makeover by the young future leader of the resistance), it is certainly more action packed, while I personally preferred the first (though both films receive a 10 from me), I can understand why some people prefer the 2nd, and these films are still held up very highly by fans of the genre, action as well as catchphrases galore, which many who were around at that time would remember well.<br/><br/>
Do yourselves a favour if you can and watch the Special edition Directors cut as theirs some great extra footage including a cameo from Michael Biehns Kyle Reese, a great film to rewatch once in a while too, so whether you've seen this or not, sit back, put your feet up, and enjoy, I've nothing more to add, other than this, like the 1984 original, is an easy 10/10, essential viewing."
"coasterdude44","9","2","2","18 November 2019"," Still one of the greatest Action movies ever created, an incredible atmosphere and tone that few films have recaptured
","Terminator 2 is still a masterpiece after all these years and my personal favourite from James Cameron which is in my opinion his greatest work. The film is so incredibly directed with such style and thrilling action sequences, incredible acting and character development, plus the smart and revolutionary use of CGI that started a new revolution in filmmaking technology.<br/><br/>With such an incredible and smartly written story that feels epic and massive in scale, it's all the characters that truly make this movie shine. All the human characters bleed with emotion and have completely understandable motivation behind their viewpoints. The greatest thing about this movie however to me is the musical score by Brad Fidel. It creates such a lucid atmosphere to this movie as it adds so many emotional layers so so many scenes which adds even more to the stakes and struggles of the characters. It's such a unique sound which often at times makes the movie feel dreamy and surreal which does reflect the tone of the movie, probably most of all Sarah Connor who in the movie is often completely overrun by pure emotion and crazed hatred over rationality most of the time which is why she's borderline psychotic in the first half of the film anyway.<br/><br/>The film's core message is about humanity over technology which is a powerful message for sure and what technology could do one day, but most of all it's just an immensely satisfying action film with cutting edge effects and incredible atmosphere and incredible and unique identity which is why so many movie fans keep on coming back to this movie in particular, it's a classic and there are very few things about it that you can fault. So many future films built upon the structure and foundation this movie put in place and it's a masterful and resonant action film that ages better and better as time goes on"

Plus the linear progression of the story seems to be really bad for writing good sequels, so I believe they should have done the logical skynet thing to do and sent a terminator further back in time for an easier Connor bloodline kill, crushing heads with a spikeball on a chain! Not that T2 is in any way a bad experience, it's a masterpiece that killed the franchise. Maybe Ridley Scott could have pulled off a sequel to this with heart, given a masterpiece script.<br/><br/>I recommend the ""Terminator 2: Hands of Fate"" edit for it's more serious tone."

"coneill97","9","2","2","17 October 2019"," A Sci-Fi Action Masterpiece
","T2 is a movie that builds and improves upon the original in every way. Right from the opening pre-credit sequence, the special effects are enhanced, and the action is more intense.<br/><br/>The movie tricks the audience into believing that this movie will be a carbon copy of the 1984 classic. The setup is almost identical, with Arnie's famous T-800 and Robert Patrick's mysterious new character travelling back in time, this time with Sarah Connor's son, John, as the target. The movie then reveals its amazingly executed twist; the T-800 is the good guy, reprogrammed by an older John Connor to protect his younger self from Robert Patrick's T-1000.<br/><br/>The T-1000 is a worthy successor to Arnie's original villain. He is a more advanced cyborg, made from liquid metal, who can change shape and take the form of other humans. Given the fact that the movie is almost 30 years old, the effects hold up surprisingly well.<br/><br/>The movie does an outstanding job of developing the three main protagonists in exciting and unexpected ways. Linda Hamilton is given a lot more to do in this sequel and provides an excellent performance as Sarah Connor. She is a much different character this time around, and we see the effects of the trauma inflicted on her from the original. Over the course of the movie, we see her lose her humanity and almost become a ""terminator"" herself.<br/><br/>We are introduced to John Connor is this movie. From the original, we know that he grows up to be this great military leader. Given this, it is surprising to find him as a troubled teen, getting moved from one foster home to another. Actor Edward Furlong brings a lot of energy to the screen and gives a good performance.<br/><br/>The movie also finds a way to make Arnold Schwarzenegger's cyborg one of the most human characters in the film. While Sarah is losing her humanity, Arnold is finding his, learning from John, with whom he has great chemistry. Arnie also brings a lot of humour to this version of the T-800, which works brilliantly. His termination at the movie's climax is a genuinely emotional moment.<br/><br/>The action throughout the movie is phenomenal, with one action sequence after another delivering edge of your seat thrills. These include the motorcycle chase, the hospital breakout, the lab break-in, the highway chase and the climax in the factory. Each of these sequences is original and inventive, and it's tough to choose a single piece of action that could be removed from the film. The makeup and prosthetics used on Arnie's damaged face are also great.<br/><br/>At over two and a half hours, the movie is brilliantly paced and never drags. When it slows down after the hospital breakout, we get some crucial character moments between John and Sarah, followed by John and the T-800.<br/><br/>If I had to find a criticism with the movie, it would be Sarah Connor's voiceover. It feels like a last-minute inclusion and a little unnecessary. Fortunately, it is used very sporadically and doesn't detract from the quality of the film.<br/><br/>For me, Terminator 2 is where the franchise ends. It is an all-round satisfying, emotional and hopeful movie. It is funnier, more profound and better than its predecessor in every way. Overall, it is a sci-fi action masterpiece.<br/><br/>Note: This review is for the Directors Cut"

Because that last scene will be one of the most iconic scenes in the history of cinema. Not only that but T2 sets the time for many good sequels, especially with time wraps and good or bad villains, human or machines... Directing here is pure art.

","I gave the first part 9/10... Why? While it was amazing and thrilling experience, in my opinion, there was a lack of connection with the characters. Sure, they are cool, but still, there was too little time to develop them fully. With extended edition of this movie which runs two and a half hours and bigger budget for even better amazing action scenes, this movie has it all, improves the shortcoming of the original and I think it will forever be a nostalgic love trip for everyone who wants a good action movie packed with nineties feel and Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton. I could go on and praise the movie, but why? So many people already did it way better than me, for me only thing left to do is recommend it to you with whole size of my heart. Go on, and enjoy this action masterpiece along with it's everlasting message and thoughts on human nature. And yeah, I still get teary eyed at the ending of this movie. Ever since I was a kid. 10/10, hasta la vista, baby!"

","Although the original is a better film this sequel to the Terminator is a magnificent piece of filmmaking combining both- a great narrative and state of the art visual effects to tell a story which is based on speculation and yet manages to touch a chord. James Cameron's sequel sees some changes. The Terminator played by Arnold is a ""good guy"" here(T-800), sent back time from the future to save and assist the young John Connor from the clutches of an even more foe- the dangerous T-1000(played eerily by Robert Patrick). Terminator 2 has become such an important part of popular culture (thanks to its religious showing on every cable network everywhere on earth) that it seems strange to imagine someone who hasn't seen it, or knows the most famous scenes verbatim. Terminator 2 is what every sequel should be like. But then not everyone is James Cameron."

","Generally sequels never reach the cinematic heights of a good original film. But Terminator 2: Judgement Day is not only an excellent sequel but also establishes a landmark in blockbuster cinema-making. Despite belonging to different generation this movie was almost 10 times more entertaining to watch than today's Transformers like crap. The highlights of T2 are its ground-breaking visual effects and awesome sound effects, surprises me that this movie was released in 1991. I know that visual effects only is not a measure of the quality of a film, but one must respect the achievements of T2 for establishing such great use of CGI for the very first time. Keeping aside the effects, the movie is still an excellent sci-fi action with a heart-touching story and memorable characters. Also should not forget the first terminator film which inspired all these sequels, of which only T2 makes remarkable use.<br/><br/>It is almost impossible to talk about the plot without giving away one of the biggest shocking moments of cinema history.I really did not see that twist coming. Thus, leave the plot as it is almost a rehash of the previous one. Two guys sent back from the future to finish off John Conner so that he doesn't become leader of the Resistance. Well last time target was John's mother, this time target young John himself. Despite having similar story-line what makes it interesting is the relationship between the characters and great performances especially by Linda Hamilton and also Arnold. Edward Furlong also was lovable as 10 year old John. The action sequences are much grander here than in first film and terminator much more deadlier. Also lot humor thrown in all of which makes it more likable in general. Still the movie has enough sci-fiction elements which make us think and emotional themes to make it heartfelt.<br/><br/>Brad Fiedel's score with slightly improved effects was fantastic.All the Oscar's this film got for its effects were well deserved. Unlike the first film which was much more focused and incredibly original, T2 covers different grounds of humanity, love, emotions and relations that kind of dilutes out its dreadful elements of the Terminator which were the focus of first film. Also T2 is much longer than T1 but it has enough content packed. The climax felt a bit prolonged, yet the ending was emotionally satisfying. Cameron has done a outstanding job with another great sequel, it gets all the things a sequels must do spot on. A big thanks to him a creating such an excellent sci-fi world with these 2 films, which gets ruined by its unnecessary and disappointing third and fourth installment. Cameron said his vision ended with this film and he was damn right. Both the Terminator films and 'Aliens' are his best films till date.<br/><br/>RATING: [4.5/5]"
"illbebackreviews","10","2","2","27 January 2013"," 'Terminator 2' is the King of Action movies and the King of Sequels- At least that's how I view this epic masterpiece!
","Terminator 2 Judgment Day is a 1991 Epic Sci Fi Action movie that focuses the story around John Connor a middle aged boy who is in the future, destined to be the leader of men against an army of machines. John ends up leading man kind to victory and so two Terminators, killing machines, have been sent back in time to eliminate him as a boy and change the future so that the machines win the war and wipe out man kind.<br/><br/>From the synopsis to the movie, everyone just straight up assumes that this movie is an action movie with some cool moments. Are they right? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Terminator 2 is a movie that teaches you a great deal about humanity, such as why they shouldn't be eliminated for a greater good. It really is a heart warming film with so many redeeming moments which make T2 a far better movie than Terminator 1, which itself is a straight TEN out of TEN from me.<br/><br/>Why do I love this movie so much? Well the acting in the movie is actually very good. Arnold Schwarzenegger actually does a great job in the movie playing the Terminator. Patrick Stewart does a great job playing the T-1000 and Edward Furlong, despite all complaints, to me, delivers a great performance. This is a performance that make me relate to John and not the guy who played him in the third movie. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was fantastic in this movie and her character really grew so much from the last movie.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is the king of action movies to me, delivering some absolute breath taking action scenes and some classical comic relief. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack to it making the tone of the movie all the more deeper.<br/><br/>Terminator 2, along with the Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers, Return of the King, Aliens, Godfather Part II and the Dark Knight is deserving a title for the greatest sequel of all time. Seriously, everything that made the first film great is put into this film just with so much more depth making the film easily exceed people's expectations.<br/><br/>This film also has some of the most mind-blowing Special effects that actually feel like they were made in 2010. The special effects certainly hold up and it is pretty evident that Cameron had a far bigger budget for this movie than he did with the original.<br/><br/>However, the highlight of the film isn't the action, its not everything about humanity but its actually the relationship between John and the Terminator! Seriously, this is one of the greatest bonds in movie history. John, a jerk at the start is able to learn the qualities that make people human and he is able to teach this to a thing that is far less understanding, a killing machine. The way their relationship works is absolutely brilliant and is the scene stealer.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is a whole lot better than the original in every way; a bigger, budget, better acting, more fleshed out characters, better special effects and a whole greater story. This movie easily holds up as my second favorite movie of all time, behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>For any who have not seen Terminator 2, which is hard to believe, MUST do so right now as it is pretty much the king of all action movies and one of the greatest sequels of all time to a fantastic duology- that's right. The last two don't exist. This film is an absolute must see and in fact, its pretty much impossible to tell what you'll be missing out on if you don't see this film---Its Cameron's masterpiece! Check it out....Or 'He'll be back!'"
"martyshoemark","10","2","2","19 December 2012"," Landmark in science fiction and action/adventure
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a standard based on how great science fiction and action/adventure movies are. T2:JD was perfect and revolutionary using both special effects and casting. The T-1000 is a frightening villain who is nearly invincible to any known weapon and special effects show him using horrible weaponry form from his composition - stretchy sharp thick knives, disguise, and handlebars. <br/><br/>The Terminator (T-800) isn't working with the John Connor who is hard core and experienced with the battle, he's forced to protect the John Connor who is just a little timid kid who doesn't know anything about fighting. His mother Sarah Connor isn't much braver than him but is angrier. Working with a mother and son who are frightened by the T-1000, the strong rough and tough T-800 is their only defender. <br/><br/>The police are not shown as noble and powerful like they are stereotyped into narrow sense in reality, in the film the on-screen police are weaklings and idiots who think anyone associated with violence other than them deserve to get hunted down. The T-800 spreads how much he dislikes the annoying police to the audience, so the audience cheers for the T-800 to kill and injure whoever he intends to."

","In The Terminator, Arnold Schwarznegger play a menacing cyborg from the future. His mission was to terminate the woman who hold the key to the future. Now, In Terminator 2: Judgement Day, that change. In this sequel to the 1984 smash hit, Arnold Schwarznegger reprises his role as the Terminator. But, this time, his mission is to protect a teenager from another terminator. The new terminator is played by Robert Patrick. What's unique about Patrick's performance is that his character is made out of liquid metal. It can form into a puddle, or shape-shifted in any way. The action sequences are astonishing. Every chase after chase, the action gets better and better. This is a good sequel to a good movie. Arnold Schwarznegger is terrific as the The Terminator, once again, this time playing a hero and, somewhat of a father figure to Edward Furlong, the actor who plays John Connor. Linda Hamilton is also terrific as Sarah Connor, the mother of the future. The special effects are wonderful, spell-binding and explosive. Arnold Schwarznegger's performance as the Terminator is superb. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars."
"PeachHamBeach","9","2","2","22 April 2011"," A good sequel is a rarity...
","True, T2 is much more up to date special effects wise (one of the first films to use CGI instead of head puppets or anamatronics or stop-motion), but that's not the reason I like this sequel. There are lots of reasons. Among them: Robert Patrick's delicately featured T1000 comes across as almost scarier and more ruthless than the original Series 101 (Arnold's role reprised, sort of...he's GOOD in this sequel), more screen time for Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman, and of course, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>Sarah, in the years since learning about the future, and giving birth to her son John (Edward Furlong, whose performance I appreciate much more than I used to, in spite of the sometimes annoying ""chill out dickwad"" stuff), has been using all her energy training and preparing John, always on the road and on the run. When she tries to blow up a software factory, she is arrested, declared insane, and stuck in an institution run by Silberman.<br/><br/>I always appreciate a Cameron film restored to its original length, and really enjoyed a scene with Sarah getting a visit from the late Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn :) who implores her to find a way to escape the hospital and find and protect John, who has been in the foster care system. Her suspicions that Skynet has sent another assassin are true, but like before, a protector has also been sent.<br/><br/>Before long, Sarah, John and the 101 are on the lam, and learn a great deal about a man named Dyson (Joe Morton) who will play a very huge part in the advancement of Cyberdyne Systems and Skynet.<br/><br/>Like Roddenberry, Jim Cameron is a prophet of sorts. In 1991, most of us little people barely knew anything about the internet. The next chapter of the story, RISE OF THE MACHINES, will further explain what Kyle Reese was raving about in the 1984 film.<br/><br/>I still like the original TERMINATOR better than its successors, but T2 is a film I've come to appreciate a lot more...restored footage always helps and I wish filmmakers would just stop cutting scenes out. Who cares about theatres? If a DVD movie is 4 hours plus, a person can turn it off and come back to it later."
"bobsgrock","9","2","2","20 May 2010"," The standard of action films of all genres.
","No matter how many action movies have been made since 1991, Terminator 2 stands heads above all others; really every other movie is just trying to mimic the standards T2 created. Although the first was quite astonishing in that it was made for a mere $6.5 million yet looks more engaging and explosive than most big budget action flicks today, the sequel stands as one of the three or four films that actually surpass the original in every aspect. <br/><br/>The story continues the Terminator mythology established previously, but also expands on it, giving more background details as well as dropping hints of what the future holds for the Connors and humankind. What is also surprising about this film is how well the acting holds up. Usually characters and plot are secondary to the action sequences, but writer/director James Cameron weaves them together and the result is a very pleasing and satisfying experience that truly wraps you up completely in the story from beginning to end. <br/><br/>By now, it is a well-known fact that Cameron is a master of visual effects and has done more than anyone, sans George Lucas, to make them progressive enough to be the foundation of blockbuster movies they are today. In seeing this and the original Terminator films, we see a more primitive style from Cameron. He must rely more on editing than he does now in order to hide some of the small details not able to be changed with computers or special effects. This gives a more intimate and personal experience to the viewer but cannot take away from the sheer brilliance of the effects used on the character of the T-1000. <br/><br/>In seeing the special edition as I have, I must confess I have not seen the original cut so obviously I have seen more than was initially planned. Yet, I am sure that I have not seen too little of the incredible and painstaking ability and work put forth by Industrial Light and Magic in order to create a character made out of liquid metal, who can change shape into almost any physical specimen, walk through solid metal, and even coagulate after being frozen and blasted apart. Seeing this was almost groundbreaking for me, even though it was released some 20 years ago. The computer and digital effects look better than much of what is accomplished today, perhaps mostly because it adds to the story rather than diverting our attention away from it. <br/><br/>On top of all that, this is simply a very well-made film that puts most other action pictures to shame. In looking at Cameron's filmography, his two bench-mark films are probably Aliens and Terminator 2 as with each of these he raised the bar of what can be acceptable as solid action and essentially paved the way for his less action but just as impressive films of Titanic and Avatar, which now reign supreme as the two highest grossing films of all time. I cannot express enough how enjoyable all of Cameron's films that I have seen are. He will probably never be compared to the likes of Welles, Kurosawa or Kubrick, but perhaps he deserves his own category as special effects and digital wonder pioneer. In that regard, he truly is the king of the world."

I don't mind the Sarah Connor Chronicles because it was in an alternate time.<br/><br/>This movie is revolutionary. Not only did Cameron tinker with the time and space-traveling idea, he even added cybernetic organisms (robots) to make it even more interesting.

The Terminator is here to save John Connor, and, consequently, Linda Hamilton, from the new T-1000 which, through some very impressive special effects can change into a liquid, among other things. Edward Furlong, he who could act in American History X, does not do so well here, with his character of John Connor rather annoying. An irritating voice-over from Hamilton is also peculiarly brought in halfway through that seems out of place as well, while Arnie is his usual self. Despite all this however, the sheer scale of the special effects of the action sequences is more than enough to make the film passable, with many scenes that linger in the memory.

","Nearly 10 years have passed since Sarah Connor was targeted for termination by a cyborg from the future. Now her son, John, the future leader of the resistance, is the target for a newer, more deadly terminator. Once again, the resistance has managed to send a protector back to attempt to save John and his mother Sarah.<br/><br/>Okay, we understand. A Terminator sent back to kill the lead of a resistance. Blah, blah, blah. Although thought provoking, I never thought The Terminator was a masterpiece. I thought the third was better. The order I've seen the films is weird: Third, first, and second. This movie (the second) is the best (yet) and I'm glad to say I won't be using the word ""mediocre"" in this review.<br/><br/>The second movie uses the plot but delves in deeper, making it really interesting and clever. It's more than what the plot is about. I liked the score of the film. I also liked the CGI and action sequences. Well, too much action than I thought. The first hour and thirty minutes are slow, in my opinion. Once it picks up, the film gets much better from there.<br/><br/>Although not Oscar worthy, Arnold Schwarzenegger's role is perfect for him. Robert Patrick, playing the villain, gives us a scary role. I know people won't like me saying this but Linda Hamilton is quite annoying with her more mature role. I missed the sweet and innocent performance from the first film. Well, you can't stay nice and sweet when robots are trying to kill your son, can you? Edward Furlong's performance is also good.<br/><br/>I found this film smarter and more clever than the first film. It's the best of the series and one of the best science fiction films ever made.

You should get the extreme DVD, it is extended with extra scenes that are quite important (in my opinion). This movie is also the most lightened up of the three (mostly due to john Connor's sense of humor). Like all terminator movies, the bad guy has more advantages.

","Some spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>This, along with ""Titanic"" and ""Aliens"", are the movies James Cameron will be most remembered for. Of those three, this is the most powerful, compelling, interesting to watch, and most beautiful. T2 is a great sci-fi story about how people can change the future for the better. A line from the movie sums up the theme: ""no fate but what we make for ourselves."" Cameron is also quite brilliant by taking showing character development in an android, showing its transformation from cold killer to empathetic being. This sympathetic portrayal of a robot with a soul is more compelling than another movies that attempt a similar plot, ""Blade Runner."" <br/><br/>The acting is actually very good by all of the major players. Eddie Furlong does a superb job as a teenage John Connor. He is a three-dimensional character: bratty, yet with a strong moral sense and a realization of how human actions can alter the course of future events. Arnold Schwarzenneger needs only be cold and emotionless as the cybernetic killer, and he does very well here. His only need to have emotion at the end, when his character learns compassion. Linda Hamilton is excellent as an action star, and it's a shame she hasn't starred in more movies. Robert Patrick shines as the coldly evil T-1000, one of sci-fi's best villains. He is excellent as an emotionless Terminator, and he can send chills down the spine of viewers of all ages.<br/><br/>The violence is not as extreme as other sci-fi movies, like the aforementioned ""Aliens"" franchise or ""Robocop,"" but there is enough action and suspense to please any action fan. This movie was one of the most expensive to produce at the time it was made, but it was money well spent. This movie is such a classic that it ""almost"" redeems Cameron for the sappy ""Titanic.""

","Terminator 2, like Star Wars before it and The Matrix after it, revolutionized movie making. I'm not exactly sure, but I believe T2 was the first movie to use CGI. One thing is for sure, they were certainly the first film to use CGI successfully. They brought to screen only what minds could imagine when they introduced the shape-shifting T-1000 Terminator.<br/><br/>T2 already had a set base as a story in the success of Terminator. T2 only built upon that success and made sure to one-up its predecessor. Besides the CGI there were some excellent shots and excellent scenes. Just to name a few: when T800 (Schwarzenegger) rescues John Connor on the motorcycle, the amazing slow-mo scene when Sarah Connor attempts to escape the hospital only to come face to face with the T800, and the fight scene between the T800 and the T1000 (Robert Patrick).<br/><br/>T2 was a trend setter and a trailblazer, even other movies adopted abbreviating their title. The action was just right. Not too much, not too little, and not over the top to make you think, ""Absolutely impossible."" T2 was very well directed, as it had to be to overcome the poor acting of the three lead actors. It was an instant classic that will continue to be referenced forever."

This is James Cameron's third masterpiece.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the title character but much has changed since the first film. Schwarzenegger was a superb villain in the first movie but proves in this movie that he is even better as a protagonist. Even though he still has the mannerisms of the original terminator you will soon see that there have been made subtle changes in the character which all work beautifully. The movie also plays on the fact that Arnold is the unofficial king of one-liners and gives him plenty of these to play with. The most memorable one-liner is probably ""Hasta la vista, baby"" said with the usual Schwarzenegger stiffness. Linda Hamilton returns as well and the changes in her character are far from subtle. She is almost a completely different character. Tough and incredibly strong while retaining the vulnerability that made us identify with her character in the first place. At first glance she will appear almost detached emotionally but on further inspection this proves to be far from true. A genuine tour-de-force by Hamilton. The movie also introduces Edward Furlong as a young John Connor and his performance is very much above average. In a world of annoying child actors he does the impossible and produces a likable character. One of the strengths of this movie is in its villain which is even more memorable than Arnold was in the original movie. Robert Patrick is quite simply one of the best screen villains of all time.<br/><br/>Another strength is found in the effects which garnered the movie one of its Oscars. The effects are breath taking and like the effects from the original movie they hold their own even today. One could even go as far as to say that the effects in this movie are better than in most movies today which is saying something. Almost every scene involving the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) contains some memorable effect. Needless to say Terminator 2 is an effects masterpiece and the movie industry today owes a lot to the innovations which are found in this movie.<br/><br/>James Cameron did the impossible. He produced a movie that lived up to the hype and expectations set by the previous movie. The movie even improves upon the terminator lore and in retrospect the series really should have ended here. The story really didn't warrant further continuation.<br/><br/>In conclusion Terminator 2 is one of the best science fiction and action movies of the nineties and indeed one of the best movies ever and it is deserving of all the praise and a place in the history texts as one of the best movies ever.<br/><br/>9/10"

Wicth I prefer 2 his ever roll in the first movie. Linda Hamelton is a powerhouse. Th evil Terminator is also awesome. But, Ther was this kid named Edward in this movie who played extremely well. Edward Furlong made the best debut of an actor I have ever seen and now he is a star and one of my favorite actors. He is the man. The Best young almost child actor I have ever seen.

"freaky_dave","8","2","2","3 March 2006"," Another splendid film by Cameron
","James Cameron just keeps putting out hit after hit. After the success of 1984s The Terminator, and 1986s Aliens, Cameron brings us another hit film with the sequel to The Terminator.<br/><br/>Back in 1984 Skynet sent a cyborg back from the future to kill Sarah Connor before she conceived a son that would grow up to lead the resistance and defeat the machines. It failed. Now Skynet has sent back a more advanced and even deadlier Terminator, called the T-1000, to kill Sarah's son John (Edward Furlong), who is now a young teenager with an attitude and living with foster parents. However the rebels were once again able to send someone back to protect John Connor. What follows is one of the most action packed films to ever hit the screen.<br/><br/>The special effects in T2 are much improved over the old 1984 film, and the pacing, classic Cameron, is just as well as in the earlier film. However this time around the acting by Linda Hamilton seems a little too forced, and the storyline doesn't resonate as well as in the earlier film. What would, since the earlier film had such a unique story. The only thing T2 could do, as a sequel, is follow the story and keep us interested. It does all those things, but it can never quite match the ideas that were brought forth in the original film because after all it is just a second part to that movie.<br/><br/>Arnold Swarzennegger's role in this film can't quite reach the pinnacle of success of the first film either because here he is made into a good guy as protector of John. Since the new Terminator is so much more advanced, Arnold is kind of made to look a little weak here, and that takes some of the edge away from his character. After all, in the original he was made into this almost indestructible machine that kept coming at you and never stopped. It was fearsome and incredibly scary. He no longer has that now as the good guy. But Robert Patrick, as the advanced T-1000, was perfect for the role. He is just as cold and unforgiving as Arnold was in the first film, but he can morph into anything, including family and friends, and that makes him even more deadly because you never know who or what he could be.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Terminator 2. It was a fantastic film, and I saw it more than once, so that tells you how much I liked it. The visuals were stunning for 1991, but I can't quite give it classic status like The Terminator and Aliens for reasons mentioned above. Still this is a thrilling experience, and many people did indeed like it more than the first film. I guess it depends on what you're looking for in a sci-fi action adventure. And this one delivers the goods."

","This is a fantastic film, and one that still sets the benchmark for action type blockbusters.<br/><br/>The special effect are wonderful, even by todays standards. It was probably this film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger infamous.<br/><br/>This film has a very interesting and original plot. It contains everything from sadness and despair to romance and happiness. It is superior to the first terminator, and takes the good points from that film and supersedes it. I think this film exceeded most people's expectation.<br/><br/>The explosions are excellent and in one scene an entire office block is blown up. <br/><br/>Although the terminator has few lines, his character clearly evolves. The film is a little complicated to grasp, and is probably best understood and appreciated the second time one watches it.<br/><br/>The concept of the film has greater relevance in todays world, because computers play a greater part in our lives. It may show us where not to go in the future."

","Is this better than T1? Well in my opinion not quite. Arnold is the Terminator and it wouldn't have been the same if he hadn't returned, but I always feel he is better as the bad guy, and I liked the dark eerie style of the first film. This film does however feature some insanely massive set pieces and the action is upped from the originals 6 million budget to this films 100 million budget. Cameron's direction is tense and the imaginative story once again is made simple to allow for the characters to hold the movie rather than a complex plot. Arnold again dominates the screen with his presence while Robert Patrick is equally menacing as the advanced model the T-1000. This movie features some groundbreaking effects and still looks fantastic 11 years after its release. *****"

","An absolutely fascinating continuation of the story from the original Terminator.<br/><br/>John Connor is in now in his teens and the machines from the future have sent another, much more lethal, Terminator back: The T-1000. A liquid metal, shape shifting, killer with the mission of killing John Connor. The humans have sent back a T-800, the Terminator from the first movie.<br/><br/>The resulting film is unlike many out there. Packed with relentless and explosive action that will surely blow any viewer away. And, perhaps more importantly, an intriguing plot. The story is a vast expansion of the original film and deals with the important, ever present, moral agenda of us giving power to machines meant to serve and protect us.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is it looks at machines like human like things. They also want to exist and function and not be told what to do. Also it looks at human follies like greed, power, and even the dangers of being to curious or too clever for one's own good.<br/><br/>Hugely thought provoking, action-packed, filled with Oscar winning special effects this a movie to see.

The action is FANTASTIC, it has classic lines, SPECTACULAR stunts and SFX, and talk about perfect villians.  Robert Patrick is UNBELEIVEABLE.  Just think, yeah Aliens may be the scaries movie ever and Star Wars is a landmark film, but T2 was the first film to combine CGI and live action.  That's amazing.  And, it was directed by James Cameron and legend has it that he is a perfectionist.  All the Terminators were fantastic, but T2 is CLASSIC.  For any action or classic movie fans, T2 is a MUST OWN!!!!"
"carflo","10","2","2","25 September 2003"," Wow
","I am watching T2 on TV again tonight.  It is still Wow, even on a small screen TV.  The first time I saw it was at IMAX & that was a hundred times Wow.  I feel sorry for anyone who didn't see it on a big screen back then. The effects in T2 were revolutionary.  Kids who have grown up seeing the morphing in Tv commercials cannot imagine how impressive it was.  If I remember correctly, it was the most expensive movie made to date.  Those new effects cost millions & millions to develop.  Everyone in the audience was blown away by those effects.  For weeks after it opened, everyone at work stood around just talking about the effects, even people who really weren't movie people.  It is one thing to talk about revolutionary special effects, but it was really special to experience it. What was even better was that the rest of the movie lived up to the effects. Cameron put so much into the effects and the action without sacrificing any of the human elements that have to be there to make a truly great movie.  In another 20 years, the effects will by passe, but the ploting will still be tight and the directing superb.  But mostly for me, it is the characters: the Terminator and Sarah and John and Dyson & his family.  I like them, I care about them, I can cry for them.  Robert Patrick is even scarier than Arnold was is T1 (that Terminator only becomes truly chilling after the skin is gone). If you like Aliens, you've got to see T2.  And if you liked T2 please see Aliens.  I hope you enjoy both.  I certainly have many times."
"jaywolfenstien","Null","2","2","26 August 2003"," Apocalypse never felt so good
","T2 opens with a series of shots showing typical LA morning. The everyday joys of life and the things we imagine as a happy day, and then at its peak we see a slow fade to white and the desolate vision of a hopeless future. And over the opening credits, while the longing mechanical sound of the Terminator main theme plays, we see fires consume the dead remains of a shattered city. This is the poetic craft of James Cameron.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 never comes across as a sequel. It forever comes across as the film James Cameron wanted to make with the first--it's the film he wished he had the funding for to make. While the original Terminator is an incredibly well made film (especially considering the financial restraints), T2 takes everything the original couldn't do and does it. Now we have a director who isn't scraping along to survive, now we have a visionary with funding ready to show the world how to make an action film, and James Cameron delivered.<br/><br/>After viewing Judgment Day for the first time in nearly a decade (after seeing T3), I have to say I liked the special effects of this film over T3, Matrix 2, and the Star Wars prequels. And I have to say I'm developing a growing distaste for the excessive CG in films. There's something more menacing and intimidating about the army of endoskeletons in this film and the raw gritty feel we see in the future scenes with HKs and the resistance struggling to survive. Star Wars had action figures and toys battling in out, Matrix was a video game, T3 was something in between, but T2 was real.<br/><br/>The turn of events - making the killer robot from the first film, Cyberdyne model 101, the protector in T2 - that rocked. Since it's T2, why not send 2 terminators back through time? That idea rocked. Then Cameron introduction us to the T-1000. That so rocked.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick's performance along with his array of inherent special effects made him one of the more memorable film villains. The key with the T-1000, though, he never does an effect for the hell of it. Limited to only 'knives and stabbing weapons,' he makes such incredible and effective use of the morphing ability you're never intimidated by the likes of Freddy or Jason again.<br/><br/>Every effect has a purpose and is integral to either the plot or the characters. T2 makes no detours for the sake of special effects or action. Cameron gives reason for them to be there and goes from there, weaving it into the storyline and characters and cuts right to the point and gets away before it gets boring.<br/><br/>The premise is simple and effective - a mother and her son fighting for survival, and then the fight for survival becomes a pre-emptive war against the machines. T2 wisely avoids explaining or even mentioning the inevitable paradoxes time travel concepts create. And never unmasks the ominous future entity that eventually takes over: Skynet.<br/><br/>Despite not being the greatest characters ever conceived, I really liked John and Sarah Connor and the personality-less machine who gains his own personality in this film. Cameron doesn't go for overly dramatic with his cast, but instead infuses them with just enough traits and quirks to make them believable and likable without going into overdrive. The most extreme we get is Sarah Connor's mad ravings and venomous remarks towards Skynet's creator, but if you found out the exact date the world ended, why, and how and had to escape a machine from the future to preserve the survival of the human race . . . how would you act on a daily basis?<br/><br/>Cameron has a way with the lights and the cameras that make his work transcend above standard action, and sets it in its own little category that's describable as 'James Cameran.' Seldom is there a visually boring moment in Terminator 2. Terminator has its own distinct look and feel. Brad Fiedel answers this with an appropriately unique score to match, now armed with superior synths.<br/><br/>T2 succeeds because the music, the characters, and the images never loses its personal nature while the scope expands. Despite being a 'bigger' film, we're zoomed in on a few characters and these characters can and do grow on us. From there we can imagine the coming Armageddon being fought against billions of people just like these characters and not a faceless horde of people we neither know nor care about. It disturbs me that the popular trend is to increase the scale of these films to epic levels and yet throughout the whole experience you never find one character worthy of the film idea their inside.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 brings Judgment Day its sad truth. Yes in the storyline 3 billion people die sometime in the future . . . but unlike T3, Cameron has the balls to show the faces of these people, and thus T2 is all the more powerful experience."

Standing ovations for James Cameron that didn't realize his T3 and I cannot wait to watch it. Great performances for the young John Connor, Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger and of course Robert Patrick as Terminator T-1000.

And is better then the previous movie. I think this is Arnold's best preformence, the Austrian oak is perfect as the Terminator ;-). Also Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong is great in this movie.<br/><br/>But the true master of this movie is the director - James Cameron. If weren't for him, i don't think this movie would have ever been so good as it did. I saw ""Behind the Scenes - Terminator 2"", on the DVD box that came out a while ago.<br/><br/>I must say i have never seen such a dedicated director.

"sammy105","10","2","2","4 October 2002"," Best action movie I've ever seen
","Terminator 2 is possibly the best action movie ever made. Not only does it have very skillfully played-out action scenes, but it's also filled with some of the most incredible melodies I've ever heard, a factor that, simply, counts for at least 35% of the total excitement and feelings that the movie brings. In addition to being very well made, with no dull scenes whatsoever, this movie actually brings up some interesting questions. In one scene, John Connor looks at two little boys fighting, and asks a robot: ""We're not gonna make it, are we? People, I mean?"" and it replies: ""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves."" I don't think one realizes right away how deep this small comment really goes, way beyond even the main idea of the movie, with all the time-traveling. In addition, unlike many other movies, every scene seems to last long enough to really give the viewer the exact feeling of freight, sympathy, or just exhiliration that the director or writer really meant by it.<br/><br/>I, too, remember that actual August 29th, 1997; I was actually a bit scared of some truly devoted fans to start some ruckus. But nothing happened.<br/><br/>That is, also, another thing about this movie: it is the only movie I know that predicted an incident in the very near future, which made it even more sci-fi-like. Finally, this seems to be the best movie for each actor who stars in it, and whenever I see them anywhere else, I trace them back to this movie before any other. This is a five-star, 10/10 achievement! If you're a fan of hard-core action, sci-fi, and a little bit of comedy, this will be your favorite movie, as well."

I honeslty don't know any other film (with a possible exception of Titanic) which was remembered so well for years after it was made. The special effects were and STILL ARE great. The good thing I liked about this film was that director James Cameron didn't swamp the entire movies with digital effects unlike the rubbish over-used effects we see in today's US 'blockbusters' like Minority Report, which was so bad it's not even worth mentioning in this report about a good film. The acting in this film is brilliant and there are funny one-liners and phrases like ""ASTILA VISTA BABY"" which everyone remembers. This is one of those films which you can play when you invite all your friends over and they still wont complain as it is truly excellent. One of the best movies ever made. Obviously much better than the first movie, and a rare excellent sequel. A true classic. Well done Mr Cameron."

","This is my favorite move of all time. Arnold puts up a stellar performance as the T-800, especially with that accent of his, it makes him sound almost ""robotic"", which adds a lot of credibility to the role, IMO. If you take in mind that the movie was made in 1991, and if you look at the way special effects have been developed since, you have to admit that this movie was certainly ground-breaking in those terms. I still watch it every now and then, and I find it just as enjoyable as the first time I saw it. Movies like these are never going to win any major Academy Awards, apart from the special effects ones of course, but still, it is certainly worth whatever they are charging for it on a DVD! I am looking forward to its sequel, hopefully out next year!"
"VenomX","10","2","2","21 July 2002"," Succeeds in so many areas...
","T2 is one of those rare masterpieces that attempts to do a genre like no one has done before. T2 does not only action, but drama, suspense and sci-fi as well. Going for a lighter, less mature atmosphere, James Cameron turned this movie into a giant action success that rivals all else. One of the things that T2 does that few have accomplished: using visual effects to your advantage. The T-1000 is easily the most marvellous thing you'll even see on the screen, not once do the amazing visual effects distract from the experience. The action scenes in here are just as impressive, from the fight in the mall hallway to the freeway chase scene, there is not an ounce of action missing from any of those scenes. And when cars aren't chasing each other or guns blazing, there is some serious plot development that makes you think, about nuclear war and of the future, which is in our hands. The acting excels, nobody, and I mean nobody could play a Terminator robot like Arnold does; nobody could portray the serious, on-the-edge Sarah Connor like Linda Hamilton does. Robert Patrick probably wouldn't be your first choice for a villain, but in here, he shows his intimidating side by providing us with a dark look at the future of assassin robots. The music is absolutely amazing, the main theme just sends a chill down my spine whenever I hear it, an amazing achievement.<br/><br/>It is rare when you get a sequel that is just as good as, if not better than the original. T2 fits the latter category.<br/><br/>10/10"

","My Age: 13<br/><br/>The T-1000 is an advanced terminator that is sent back in time.  Its mission is to terminate John Connor when he is a boy.  Also sent back is another, less advanced Terminator, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose mission is to protect him.  John is very important in the future and must survive, as his mother Sarah, Linda Hamilton, tells him after she escapes from a mental institution with the help of John and the Terminator.  Together all of them must survive the onslaught of the T-1000 and also destroy all the chips that made the terminators possible.<br/><br/>The ""Terminator"" movies are one of the greatest action series of films around, along with the ""Die Hard"" series and I hope they make a third one. This film is fantastic in every way, credible after what happened in the first, but with incredible action!  This film is even better than the original.  It has fantastic action including adrenaline-pumping car chases and shootouts.  With a fantastic ending climax and a good plot, I highly recommend Terminator 2: Judgment Day.<br/><br/>Australian Classification: M 15+: High Level Violence, Medium Level Coarse Language<br/><br/>Rating: 87 out of 100"

Almost everything about the movie has already been said, or so you would think, so I will instead make a recommendation for all action and sci-fi fans to check out the Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition DVD.

","Not as good as the first one, but a great movie nonetheless. The only drawback is James Furlong (very annoying).

"the_dark_shepherd","10","2","2","27 April 2000"," An incredible sci-fi action movie that is one of Hollywood's best.
","(Minor/medium spoiler alert)<br/><br/>Few action movies have ever impressed me in as many regards as Terminator 2: Judgment has (herein to be referred to as T2).<br/><br/>Well, everyone knows that T2 is the sequel to the excellent Terminator, but not everyone may know of how well T2 surpasses it.<br/><br/>Within the first few minutes of the movie, upon viewing the far future battle scene between man and machine, the viewer already gets a feel for what the rest of the movie will be like.  The opening battle scene shows off the incredible, and in the eyes of many, still unsurpassed special effects.<br/><br/>The entire movie is superbly edited, and visual effects, sound effects, and sound editing are all handled very well.  However, you may have already heard of T2's technical achievements.  I will now speak of other elements of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot occurs some years after the original, with heavy emphasis on time travel and post-apocalyptic war.  At its core, the story revolves around a teenage boy who is pivotal to the survival of the human species later in the future.  There are two terminators sent back in time: one of them, the T-1000, is sent to kill young John Connor.  The other, the T-800 (Arnold Schwarznegger), is sent back to protect him.  When these two terminators collide, it makes for some of the best action you may likely see, period.<br/><br/>There are other characters in the movie who play major parts, including John's mother (Linda Hamilton) and the creator of a certain software/hardware company that plays an important role in the continuity of the Terminator universe.  I should say that Arnold Schwarznegger found his niche in this movie: he played the terminator perfectly.  Likewise with T-1000...his line ""Have you seen this boy?"" is very memorable...<br/><br/>James Cameron may have directed big movies before T2, and certainly, he has directed the biggest movie of all time after it, but no movie is as complete and satisfying as T2.  Watching Arnie kill whoever got in his way with impunity was extremely entertaining, and the whole moody feel of the movie impressed me.<br/><br/>This is one of my top 10 movies of all time.  People may scoff when they even hear me mention T2 in the same breath as Apocalypse Now, but hey, an opinion is an opinion..."
"The Terminator","10","2","2","27 April 2000"," The Best Movie Of All Time, Part 2
","How right Claudonio, a previous guy who commented, was. I first saw T2 when I was 8 years old and despite it leaving a lump in my throat, I was amazed even at my young age. Surpassing the original by a long distance, T2 displays some of the most memorable action scenes ever, for example the fantastic flood drain sequence and the finale. With the most awesome special effects (excluding the part where you can see Schwarzeneggers real arm when he pulls his fake one out from the grinder), Terminator 2 gave viewers a new concept of film. Excellent acting and a sound director makes T2 the best film ever!"
"eshy76","10","2","2","27 March 2000"," Brilliant.
","This is one hell of a fantastic sequel...Jim Cameron does it again after the triumph that was Aliens, he produces another moment of magic...the way this movie consolidates and improves upon the first movie is near perfection. The special effects were absolutely amazing and even today it is difficult to see exactly how they could have been used to better effect. The way he managed to create a bad guy infinitely more scary than Arnie in the first film and make him (the T-1000) so believable is first rate...<br/><br/>The cast was absolutely first rate, especially Linda Hamilton...her transformation over the two films was shocking and brilliantly played. The boy Connor was not just there for show either, his performance was great too as the child born to be world leader one day...the action was tense and relentless with some of the best sequences you are ever likely to see...the motorbike/lorry and the helicopter/van/lorry chases being cases in point...<br/><br/>The only thing that prevents me from giving the movie ten out of ten is the slight softening of the mood in this film compared to its precursor. The first film was darker, moodier, and conveyed a feeling of dread throughout. This movie had the dread alright with the indestructible bad guy, but there were a few comic one-liners, especially from the supposed robot Arnold which seemed out of place (""I need a vacation"" for eg). Still this is a very minor gripe and will not prevent me from saying that this one of the best sci-fi or action movies ever made."

","This as I remember back in 91' as I watched the first few minutes of the movie take flight, was a vastly different feeling from the original.<br/><br/>In 1984 when I sat through the first Terminator, it seems now in retrospect, a lower budget movie, however a 'gigantic' story feel. It was brand new and it was different than other sci-fi stuff that was out then. I was gripped by the feeling of an almost unstoppable machine. Schwarzennegger had captured the very element of a futuristic killer that was bigger than life. And scarier than HELL. It was an emotional thriller, with bigger than dollars outcome on how you felt when you left the theater after the ending was over. Now it seems to be traded for an over M-TV commercialized slicker packaged new Terminator. This one now is not un-conversational. He can look sideways at you and learn a joke or two. As I watched the new one I enjoyed it but realized later that, this was more like a 'drug' that would fade, than the preamble that left you squirming in your seat and thought provoked by the end.<br/><br/>This was a new-digitally mastered machine that was not going to kill, just act as a body guard for John. Understandably. I can see the point in it and the logic behind that concept for this story. It just was not as bold and fresh as the first. It was quite a thrill-rush...but just seemed to dissolve for me after a while. I liked T-2, truly. This just is though for me not as strong and pure as the first bum-rush the conscious feeling as you watch it, best casted futuristic story, made even better by Stan 'The Wizard' Winston. I had fun with a new friend of mine that I saw this with, but in the end I didn't end up wanting to have or know more. It just thinned out for me too much.(**)"
"raidatlanta","7","5","8","25 November 2018"," A good action movie, but a few plot holes left made it weaker
","This movie is good. you've got everything for a good action movie ; all the explosion, heart pumping, etc.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I was disappointed. The first one is an action / sci-fi masterpiece. sure, some visual effects seem a bit old now, but who cares?<br/><br/>In this one, the visuals are great. some of the computer effects are better than in new movies (26 years later!). what really made it less good for me were two things.<br/><br/>The first thing doesn't include spoilers really ; it's that they tell you EVERYTHING. While in the first one, the superb script writing leaves you cluelessly curious for most of the film, this one essentially tells you everything from the very start. Ok sure, the first one already existed, so it had less of a novelty effect, but nonetheless, here they really leave no room for curiosity to grow, which I found of course, less thrilling.<br/><br/>The second thing is... all the plot holes! Really, some things I could not get my head around. the first is, of course, why would the machines send the t-1000, more advanced model terminator, later in the past, than in the first part? Of course, for this film they had to think up some new, novel way to entertain people - a new, more advanced terminator seemed a good way, but this one is just over the top! why wouldn't the machines send that one? it doesn't make too much sense.<br/><br/>A few other plot holes popped up along the way - more bothersome than this one in my opinion, but no examples come to mind now. nonetheless, how ever small they were, they stoped me from fully enjoying the picture.<br/><br/>Basically, it's a good movie, but in no way does it compare to the first one, and it does have many plot holes."
"screenman","10","5","8","18 March 2006"," The typing-error-with-muscles never did it better.
","This was one of those sequels - like 'Aliens' - that was superior to its excellent original. Far superior.<br/><br/>For many years it set the benchmark in every aspect of science-fiction special effects and edge-of-the-seat action. Sound engineering aficionados tested their home-movie gadgetry on the basis of its tremendous sound score. Check out the moment when a terminator stamps on a human skull. You hear a heavy, ringing clunk of metal, a reedy crunch of bone, and a thumping impact as the foot hits the earth beneath. The sounds, in almost instantaneous succession, exactly interpret the imagery and the anticipation of the viewer. That's how it's done. It looks simple, but it's an art in itself.<br/><br/>How to begin a movie about machines taking over the world? Simple; You demonstrate that it's already happened, with opening shots of multi-lane highways choked by ever-demanding vehicles. It's just what we'd do with robots - a theme taken up by the later and inferior 'I Robot'.<br/><br/>Those few minutes of opening sequence are alone worth the price of admission. As credits roll we see a fire-storm in slight slow-motion to choreograph with the wonderful theme music. It doesn't sound like music for a horror film; it's a romantic composition that wouldn't be out of place in a Jane Austen period piece. It's a human theme. But slowly and surely, as the hideous muzzle of a cyborg condenses from the flames, the metallic tattoo of the original rises to dominate and usurp, foretelling human overthrow by their creations. <br/><br/>A new terminator is on the case. This one's a shape-shifting mimic called a T1000. The 'Arnie' model is now old-hat. Once again this movie set the standard in CGI morphing techniques. Both cyborgs get to battle it out for the life or death of a child who will grow to destroy them in their future. Script is taut, brief and solid. Directing is flawless. Everybody acts their part with conviction - even the wayward kid. Violence is brutal and hideous. Destruction is magnificent. Trucks are wrecked as a matter of routine. A caterpillar-tracked robot of the future, briefly glimpsed in cameo before going-up in flames was reputed to cost $30,000 alone. It's a blank-cheque movie that deserved every penny.<br/><br/>There's a poignant scene somewhere in the desert, where the heroine - played by Linda Hamilton - is seated in the balm of the evening. A westering sun mantles the world in a golden glow, kids can be heard laughing and playing, a Spanish guitar whispers peacefully. It's a moment of beautiful ambiance. But she slips into a doze and dreams a dream of nuclear holocaust depicted with such terrifying vividness as to be an object-lesson in nuclear disarmament. Everyone at Bombs-Are-Us should see their family depicted in this way.<br/><br/>If you look close you may spot some faults; I didn't. And it's easy to argue about the logical impossibility of it all. But if this movie doesn't make you think and feel and wonder - then you must be a machine yourself."

A world where thermonuclear warfare has left the world black and macheines have risen from the ashes of that fire and have now begun a war against humanity. This is hands down one of Cameron's Best Films, Forget Titanic, this movie was his masterpiece.

","Excellent. That's one way of describing what I call James Cameron's masterpiece.

Watch this and you'll see the birth of CGI, the birth of a new era of SFX for films. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, the TX from the third Terminator film will never come close to the perfect performance from Robert Patrick - Kristanna Loken may have had the help of even more improved CGI technology to back her up - it's the way you bring it that eventually makes or breaks you. And the T1000 never stops to make you feel comfortable, it's threatening from its arrival till its final morph. No, I won't give any spoilers here but the ending is totally different from that of the first film.

"AhmedSpielberg99","8","3","4","6 April 2019"," Great follow-up that is not nearly as intense as the original!
","The original Terminator is one of the most intense sci-fi/action movies I've ever seen. T2 is not nearly as thrilling and suspenseful as the original. And that's why I found this sequel, which considered to be even superior to the original, slightly underwhelming. The action set-pieces are almost as good as those in the first movie, and due to the the fact that this one has a massively higher budget, the action sequences feel even more well-shot. The visual effects look fantastic, and surprisingly still hold up pretty well. But the problem isn't about the action nor the CGI; it's about the situations and the conditions here that couldn't make me worry about the characters as I should. Even at its climax, the intensity pale in comparison to that's I felt whenever a car chase or a small fighting scene come in the original.<br/><br/>Another issue I have with this movie is that it drags a little bit at its second act. I don't mean it gets boring at all, but it feels a bit devoid and empty halfway through. Maybe better storytelling could have fixed that. I also have a couple of nitpicks, but I can't say they hindered my experience of watching the movie.<br/><br/>That said, James Cameron doubled down almost every single aspect in the story and the characters to make a new extremely taut story that expanded the characters' arc like I've never seen before in any film. The dialogue between the three main characters and even the story itself revealed that the characters, humans or cyborgs, have extra more layers into them. Even the villain is effortlessly well-rounded, and he oozes the impressive development Cameron has made in this world, that of course in addition to the fact that Robert Patrick is quite intimidating and so iconic as T-1000.<br/><br/>There is nothing can top what have been already said about Linda Hamelton's character, Sarah Connor, which definitely deserves its place among the absolute best female characters ever appeared on the silver screen. With that being said, I prefer to praise the astonishing chemistry between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong as the titular cyborg and John Connor, respectively. From the spot-on jokes and funny one-liners to the surprisingly moving and heartwarming scenes the two characters shared, the dynamic between these two endearing characters is simply unmatchable! Furlong is sadly a wasted talent that proved in this movie and American History X that he has a grand range and monumental acting abilities. Here he walked a very thin line between being an imprudent, reckless teen and an innocent child to bring out a likable, relatable, and quite convincing character.<br/><br/>Judgment Day is undoubtedly one of the best sequels ever made, but in my opinion it didn't surpass the original, nor even reach its level. That's in large part due to its relative lack of suspense that's arguably the best merit the original has.<br/><br/>(8/10)"
"Horror-yo","8","3","4","22 May 2016"," Sci-fi Action excellence
","While the first one was more raw science fiction and overall had a much more serious feel, almost like horror at times - this one, 7 years later, has a much lighter tone to it, all the while remaining a heavy weight blockbuster action thriller. The film-makers turned the table interestingly and it worked: Arnie was this time the good guy, setting up the stage for the older model but likable good guy robot-killer, now back to protect, vs the newer technology evil robot, and where Arnie was all heavy metal with boots and dark shades with heavy punches and kicks and robust weaponry, bad guy T-1000 was smooth, stealthy, lightning quick, surgically precise and sharp, while superior in intelligence and strategy. Put this way, it makes for quite an exciting prospect of a plot on its own, doesn't it ? And the movie delivers. The superiority of the T-1000 is well illustrated, and Arnie and the heroes keep up/escape in a believable way. The film even manages to generate emotion from the viewing public towards a robot, and nobody from this past radius of contemporary generations will ever, ever forget that ending, with Arnie's thumb raised. Globally, an excellently executed sci-fi action from the early 90's. James Cameron did another superb job there, and the film may not be the deepest in cinema history, but it sure provides the goods it promises, and for a sequel, and a sequel that's widely regarded as even superior to its original, an absolute classic in its own right; this is pretty damn strong."

That being said, while this sequel is certainly more ambitious in it's set pieces, I enjoyed the first one a lot more.<br/><br/>The plot follows the same structure, except Arnold is casted differently. The first half of the movie fleshes out the characters and their motivations. It definitely sucked me in. The second half consisted of mostly just metal, bullets, trucks and explosions. The ending was kind of predictable. All in all, it was very entertaining and polished, but I don't think the film had anything significant to add on the first."

The film is not based on mindless action it is intelligent storytelling at it's finest and the Perfect follow up to and a perfect continuation of the first terminator movie. I was always on the Edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. The dialog is also interesting at all times and all the actors are almost perfect in their roles. They are so perfect that I cannot even imagine anyone else playing their roles.<br/><br/>Arnold is fantastic in his role as T-101 this time playing as the savior or the good guy unlike the first movie where he played the antagonist.

You will be blown away here, he is even better as a protagonist and is acting and his voice and accent are almost perfect to play a cyborg, it just works so well. <br/><br/>Edward Furlong who was only a teenager at the time is just fantastic in his role, his acting, facial expressions, emotions and dialog delivery are all top notch and his interactions with both Linda (Sarah Connor) and Arnold (Terminator) are fantastic and memorable scenes. <br/><br/>Linda Hamilton plays a different role than she did in the first movie, in the first film she was an innocent person who was victimized this movie show how her character has developed and how she has grown tougher and stronger after the first film determined to protect John and prevent the end of the world from coming. This is perfect character development in a movie and Linda does a marvelous Job. Lastly Robert Patrick who does not talk much is a great antagonist, he is silent and mysterious and cold and calculated as that serious angry expression on his face most of the time which works so well, the action scenes between him and Arnold are just a thing of beauty and perfectly shot. the rest of the supporting cast including Doctor Silverman pare also great in their roles. Almost nothing bad I can say about the acting in this film.<br/><br/>Overall Terminator 2: Judgement Day is not only one of the greatest Action Sci-Fi films ever made, it is one of the best films ever, it is a perfect balance of good storyline and good action which is a rarity for Hollywood nowadays. Add to that the perfect direction and brilliant casting and performances from almost the entire cast. You have got a brilliant film a one you can watch again again. This is the perfect follow up to the first Terminator Movie, the sequels to T2:JD which were Terminator 3: Rise of Machines and Terminator Salvation were alright but they did not live up to the first 2 films and were honestly not needed. The first two films completed the story they wanted to tell.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10"
"shaggy_remiza","10","3","4","24 June 2014"," 90's classic, best off
","Every 90's kid will always remember this movie. Classic fight between good and evil. Having failed, in Cameron's impressive original, to prevent the birth of future resistance leader John Connor, the machines running the world in 2029 again send a cyborg to our era to kill him off as an unruly LA teenager (Furlong). Again, too, the resistance responds by sending the boy a protector: a T800 cyborg (Schwarzenegger) physically identical to the one which formerly laid siege to John's mom Sarah (Hamilton). That Arnie is now a good guy is one twist; the other is that he's the underdog, since the T1000 (Patrick) despatched by the machines is far more sophisticated, constructed from liquid steel so that it can adopt the appearance of anyone or anything it chooses. The film is much the same as its predecessor, except that the effects are more spectacular, there's a lumbering anti-nuke subtext, and the script's good-natured wit is undercut by the sentimentality of Arnie's becoming a caring cyborg. Structured as a simple chase, the story sags midway, but the first hour and last 30 minutes display an enjoyably relentless bravura."

","This movie is my all-time FAVORITE film. I was being born as it was released. Maybe my parents went to the theater while the night of? I don't know. What I do know, is that this movie had a killer plot and a poetic styled script. Most of the people I know who have watched this movie think of it only as an action movie. They don't seem to grasp the underlining theme of love and what you would do to protect those you care about most. Like Connor said, ""The machine seemed like more of a father than any of the ten's of men I brought home trying to protect him"". This movie is moving, and YES, the action is groundbreaking. This is a ""Hold on to your butt's"" (Samuel L. Jackson in Jurassic Park) kind of movie. Arnold portrayed a role he had previously done 7 years earlier but with more style and a sense of really embracing this emotionless machine who couldn't understand simple emotional functions. ""I know now why you cry."" was possibly the most memorable line for me in the entire movie (Considering ""I'll be back"" or ""Hasta La Vista, Baby"" or the smirking ""Trust me""). This machine had been through so much with this future-rebel savior that he had just understood an emotion. It was like breathing for the first time. Every aspect of this film was portrayed fantastically, from the camera work, to the long hours of early-computer graphics work done in movies. It was sad to see the following installments not to be as compelling as Judgement Day. I can't believe I'm saying this, but James Cameron has always been at the top of his game, always including only the newest, most advanced CGI or graphics that were available. He's always able to pull it off in such a way that he has no competition."

","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a science fiction action film, the second installment of the Terminator franchise and the sequel to The Terminator. Directed by James Cameron and written by Cameron and William Wisher, Jr., it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, and Edward Furlong. <br/><br/>Terminator 2 follows Sarah Connor and her son John as they are pursued by a new, more advanced Terminator, the liquid metal, shape-shifting T- 1000, sent back in time to kill John to stop him from becoming leader of the human Resistance. An older, less advanced Terminator is also sent back in time to protect John.<br/><br/>Having been informed by a time-traveling soldier in the first film that John will one day grow up to become humanity's savior from a computer- controlled Armageddon, Sarah has responded by becoming a muscle-bound she-warrior bent on educating John in survival tactics and battle strategies. Her ranting about humankind's future has landed Sarah in an insane asylum and John in the foster care system. The rebellious John has responded to his situation by getting into scrapes with the law. When a new and improved Terminator android called the T-1000 arrives from the future to eliminate John, an older model T-800 is sent to protect the boy. The T-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. The T-800 saves John's life and helps break Sarah out of the institution. Staying only one step ahead of the dogged T-1000, Sarah leads her son and the T-800 to the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems, the company that will invent a robotic intelligence that will eventually take over the world. There, they attempt to convince inventor Miles Dyson to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. Dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two Terminators at a steel foundry.<br/><br/>A sequel to the sci-fi action thriller that made him and star Arnold Schwarzenegger A-list Hollywood names, writer/director James Cameron upped the ante with this follow-up by employing a more sweeping storyline and cutting-edge special effects.The film excelled in many technical categories for its groundbreaking effects for which it won four Oscars.It is the ultimate is a state-of-the-art action movie, all right: It gets you thinking that the most reasonable thing might just have been to blow everyone away."

","Seven years after he first said he'd be back, Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator whose mission is not to destroy mankind, but to ensure its survival by protecting 10-year old John Connor (Edward Furlong), future saviour of the human race, from a T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a highly advanced, seemingly unstoppable liquid-metal killing machine.<br/><br/>It's 1991: Arnie is a major box office draw, director James Cameron has spent years developing movie technology, Guns 'n' Roses are rocking the charts, and I'm only too happy to stump up some hard earned cash to see all three join forces for the follow-up to 1984 sci-fi hit The Terminator. The original was a masterful piece of low-budget film-making; with a much bigger budget and the latest special effects technology at his disposal, Cameron's sequel was a must-see.<br/><br/>It didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Twenty years later: even though film-making technology has advanced in leaps and bounds over the last two decades, and budgets have got bigger and bigger, very few movies have provided me with as many perfectly executed cinematic thrills as T2. An incredible action juggernaut packed with unbelievable scenes of OTT mayhem, iconic performances, and groundbreaking effects, all accompanied by an unbeatable Brad Fiedel score and Axl Rose's unmistakable wailing, this still ranks as one of the biggest and best sci-fi/action flicks ever made. Not only does the film deliver everything you could want in terms of explosive entertainment, but it also has some wonderful humour and a lot of heartâ€”and anyone who says otherwise can eat me!"

","In the first ""The Terminator"" movie The Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) did the chasing and hunting for it's target.

This most is most definitely a sci-fi masterpiece that is engaging and highly entertaining from beginning to end. The plot is very well written and it's very memorable, especially some of the quotes. There is almost no flaw to this movie and will stick with audiences for a very long time. Definitely worth seeing to anyone that enjoy watching movies should most definitely check this movie out. The villain this time around T-1000(Robert Patrick) is very intimidating and scary at times, in another words he is a great villain even if the T-1000 is silent most of the time. I remember seeing this film a long time ago during my childhood and it stuck with me.

"jangomac72","10","3","4","20 June 2009"," One of the few sequels that's better than the original
","James Cameron's blockbuster sequel to his breakout film sees two Terminators sent back in time, one to kill ten year old John Connor and one to protect him.<br/><br/>Cameron starts the film with a bang, a elongated prologue showing us more of a nuclear ravaged Los Angeles in 2029 and giving us our first glimpse of the leader of the human resistance, John Connor. From there its a slow build of tension as we're introduced to our characters as the rival Terminators stalk their prey, the pre teen John Connor. Every time I see this film, I always wonder how it would've been had Cameron stuck with his original intention to not reveal that Arnold is playing a good Terminator. The early scenes are deliberately set up in a way similar to the first film and it's heavily implied that it's Arnolds T-800 who is the one after killing Connor. However for some reason they decided to announce the good Terminator quite early in production. It doesn't harm the film but it would've been nice if, in those pre internet days, the twist hadn't been revealed.<br/><br/>From the brilliant opening motorbike chase to the rescue of a damaged Sarah Connor from the local Mental Institute, the film hardly stops for breath with its spectacular stunts and FX showcasing the latest breakthroughs in CGI, the T-1000 sequences still stand up to this day. The middle reel then takes a well intended breather to discuss the implications of changing the future and whether this impacts on fate and destiny before the final reel hits fifth gear with Sarah Connor's failed assassination attempt on Miles Dyson, the attack on Cyberdyne and the showdown with the T-1000 in an Industrial Foundry.<br/><br/>One of the most impressive aspects of Cameron's films is that he gets outstanding work out of his actors. Linda Hamilton returns as a psychologically damaged Sarah Connor with a brilliant progression of the innocent waitress we saw in the first film, Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been better as the self learning T-800 and Robert Patrick is chilling as the liquid metal T-1000. Special mention should also go to Edward Furlong, who impresses as the young John Connor in his feature film debut. It's a real shame that his career didn't take off after this, with his only other notable acting work being American History X, but apparently his real life problems have hampered his progress in Hollywood in recent years but more on that with my review of T3.<br/><br/>T2 was considered quite a gamble at the time of release. Cameron was coming off commercial failure The Abyss, it was leaked quite early that Arnie that would be playing a good Terminator (something that raised quite a few fan eyebrows) and the film was, at the time, the most expensive ever produced but Cameron delivers the goods, producing one of those rare sequels that is even better than the original, and even rarer (especially in these days of dumbed down summer films), an intelligent action blockbuster.<br/><br/>Probably the action film of the 1990's and certainly, in my opinion, up there with fellow best action films of all time Raiders of the Lost Ark and Die Hard. 10/10"
"whatsinhisboxers24","10","3","4","11 January 2009"," The Saga should have ended here
","Terminator 2 represents what is, for me, the true end of the Terminator franchise and a truly fantastic film that succeeds on several levels. There is amazing action, spectacular special effects and some surprisingly emotional scenes for a film of this nature.<br/><br/>Right from the opening scene, portraying the nuclear wasteland and the fight against the machines, you get the feeling this is going to be an epic. From the Terminators you get a sense of cold mechanical duty (from both Arnold and Patrick), from John you have the innocence and disbelief; in a way, his character re-introduces us to the Terminator story, in the same way Sarah did in the first film. From Sarah you have desperation and frustration- how would it feel to KNOW, beyond all doubt, that the world faces destruction, yet no one believes you and you can't prove it? Unlike a lot of today's blockbusters, the action sequences fit neatly into the story and even serve to move the story forward in a lot of ways, as opposed to explosions for the sake of it. The narrative is strong and everyone performs their parts to the best of their abilities, inhabiting their characters perfectly. There is unrepentant menace from the T-1000, whilst from Sarah, utter determination to protect her son and save mankind.<br/><br/>This film concludes the story from the first film in a very organic and fitting way. In many ways it's a shame they made a third."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","3","4","2 December 2008"," There's a reason this is so appreciated
","Let it be said right away: There is at least one obvious issue with this. That doesn't have to include the fact that this is one of those sequels that are so much like the original that one could argue that it's partially a remake. What I'm referring to is that going by the first, it technically shouldn't exist. I am not aware of anyone who considers the predecessor of this to be the only film in this series(I've experienced many who, with good cause, deny there to be a third movie... heck, I am one of them), but I could see why there could be. However, if you look past that(and you ought to at least consider doing so, as this doesn't come off as one of those follow-ups released to cash in on an earlier success), you're in for an undeniably enjoyable and well-done cinematic experience. The plot is interesting and well-told. The pacing is solid. The acting is great from all, Patrick is an incredible addition, and neither Arnie nor Linda have forgotten how to portray their role. The action gets bigger, and still consists of fights, shootouts and car chases, all of which are marvelous and exciting, and never degenerates into stupidity. The guns are still impeccably well-chosen and handled. Really cool. The new concept or two herein are very smart and well-thought out. The science fiction remains well-done. This holds an appropriate amount and volume of self-irony over the title character(though I did not mind the seriousness of the previous silver screen effort). While some of the dark tone is maintained, it is less violent and disturbing than the 1984 piece. There is also no nudity(well, just about) or sexuality in this. I have more points against this, meanwhile, they all give stuff away, and this will remain a spoiler-free review. And even with them, it's hard to argue with the quality of this, even if you prefer The Terminator to it(and I do). I recommend this to any fan of sci-fi, intense scenes, James Cameron, the others who made this, and/or food for thought wrapped neatly in celluloid. 10/10"

Linda Hamilton- Looking mildly like she had taken steroids, still impresses as a changed Sarah Conner. Robert Patrick is, I think, the scariest terminator out there.

Yes the Matrix is good and visually amazing, but it doesn't have what T2 has. The original Star Wars films are my favorite sci-fi films, but Terminator 2: Judgement Day, is my second favorite film in this genre. This is a definite film for any DVD collection, it looks fantastic, and if you can, buy the special edition. It has a newly re cut version of the film adding sixteen minutes onto the original film, which do not diminish the quality of the film, but rather enhance it. So if you haven't seen this movie, rent it and then, buy it. You will love it, I know I do."

This is my first review on this site where I give the film in question 10 stars, which is only awarded to a film that has virtually no flaws whatsoever. And Terminator 2 is one of those films that deserves it.<br/><br/>The Positives: -The acting is great all around. Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to play the terminator, and Robert Patrick is effectively threatening as the T-1000. Linda Hamilton gives a fantastic performance this time around as Sarah Connor, as she convincingly conveys Sarah's pain, fear, intensity, and so on. And Eddie Furlong does a commendable job as John Connor, as he makes us genuinely care about the character. -The digital effects were revolutionary at the time, and still hold up today. Every effects shot still looks as convincing as ever. -The action sequences are outstanding. I don't need to give you any examples, because you know how good they are already. -The humor, the score, the famous quotes... need I go on?<br/><br/>The Negatives: -What?

","Seven years have passed since the first Terminator's release. It was initially a success, despite a low budget. Critics and fans loved it, and after seven years, the 90's have begun and the Terminator is back- and might I say, better than ever.<br/><br/>The movie picks up several years later with Sarah Connor trapped in a mental hospital for claiming that a 'terminator' even existed in the first place. Her son, which is the whole reason any conflict arose in the Terminator series, has now been born and alive for 11 years (although he looks more like a 14 year old). He's a foster kid (punk), and he's living the way he wants to. But he is soon caught in the middle of a battle, and this is what the movie is all about.<br/><br/>The movie is well-done, with an excellent format, a dark and brooding atmosphere that sheds some light (and tears) at the end. Robert Patrick does even better than Arnold Schwarzeneggar did as a baddie. This time, Arnie is the good guy, a Terminator programmed to protect John Connor, and Robert Patrick is the liquid metal Terminator set on killing John Connor. His character is done to perfection with its CGI.<br/><br/>All the action in the movie is spectacular. The first half hour of the movie is quiet, followed by an edge-of-your-seat car chase that will leave you breathless. More events begin to happen, and twenty minutes later, another action sequence picks up in the mental hospital. Whenever you want the action, its there and in your face.<br/><br/>The next half hour of silence (meaning no action sequences), is spent developing the characters further and adds the third dimension, whereas the first half just gave us a 2-dimensional development. By the end of this first half hour you know the characters by heart, and now you want the action again.<br/><br/>The next hour is basically all action, involving lots of car chases and battles. It's almost non-stop with probably five minute breathers in between some of them. The hour feels like only twenty minutes because you're having such a good time, so the movie doesn't really feel too long. They couldn't have set it up better.<br/><br/>The acting was great; Edward Furlong's character was obnoxious in the beginning but his character got better and at the end he really proved he can act. Linda Hamilton was at her best; a bit darker and definitely more pessimistic, but you can actually believe she is a real person thanks to her and the script writers.<br/><br/>There's not much more to say about this amazing film, except the action is great, the music is well done, and James Cameron gave it his all in this film. Not once did I find myself disliking any portion of the film. It's practically flawless, and because of this, I give it a 9.7/10. Nice work, James!"

","The Terminator failed to destroy Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). This time, The T-800(Arnold Schwarzenegger) is here on a different mission; to protect Sarah and her son John(Edward Furlong) from a highly advanced terminator, known as the T-1000(Robert Patrick). This terminator is so elusive and so lethal, ingenuity is the main factor in order to stop it. Like the T-800, the T-1000 can't be stopped by bullets. The T-1000 kills John's foster parents. How did he kill the foster mother? I don't wanna know. Sarah's distrust in the terminator was easy to spot, when this tries to help, she was left with no choice but to trust him. And she did. When he stitched her up, her trust in it grew. And the battle scenes between the cops and the terminator was no contest. Not one police officer was killed. The way the could stop the T-1000 was obvious, liquid nitrogen and explosives. Even though, he couldn't self terminate, he had to be destroyed with the same liquid metal that did the T-1000. Simply because, regular ammunition would be a total waste. And furthermore, other super-geniuses could reconstruct it. So he went down, honorably!

","Terminator II, is without doubt the best action movie out there...

Unlike, ordinary action flicks where the villain is just literally blown away.<br/><br/>Arnie is really stretched to the fullest and beyond to get rid of this guy. This is what really keeps you stuck at the edge of your seat throughout the movie, and as far as I remember, there is no other movie that kept me at the edge of my seat from starting to end like this one.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you have not seen this movie, you have got to be joking!

"danai_lee","10","3","4","12 September 2006"," The perfection in Hollywood exists
","As I commented in Terminator I (1984), this film is a legend. But this part contains everything that a spectator could expect. John Connor was Edward Furlong- it was a real pity that he was so crazy and didn't go on in his career because he is and will a great actor. The feeling about life is strongest that the first part, because in this occasion the own terminator learns that it can't kill whoever it wants because that produces pain and regret and it understands that a machine can replace a human for a lot of things but no to feel sensations. And a world without sensation isn't it a world, despite of, nowadays we are a little bit more insensitive. I was only 7 years when i saw this movie ( and i saw this part before the first). I understood that the life is so valuable. The role of Miles B. Dyson (Joe Morton) is special for this reason: in a low minutes he notices that is responsible for a lot of deaths for his own develops. He was so happy and so carried away about his job that he never thought about what could produce if the machines someday take control of everything. His wife, Talessa (Epatha Merkenson) (in a cut scene) did: she told him that a machine cant love like she did and their children.<br/><br/>When the Terminator told John that is natural that mankind kill each other , John changed his point of view and in that moment he reaches the feelings that his mother wanted to transmit.<br/><br/>But Sarah also learns something: she could became to a terminator (when she is ready to kill Miles at any expense) The role of T1000 (Robert Patrick) it was fantastic! Unexpressive, cold, wicked...A great Villain! No more words. Just see it again and again!"

","I've watched this film a dozen or so times, but recently saw it again for the first time in a long while.<br/><br/>Having seen many action films in the intervening years, it struck me how much better this film is than almost all of them. It is intelligent, with good performances and excellent pacing, and you feel a real emotional connection with the main characters, even (oddly enough) the Terminator.<br/><br/>The action is hugely exciting, even when you know the outcome, but the special effects are of particular note. The quality and restricted quantity stands as a prime example of they should be used, and they still look great 15 years after the films original release. Well, except for Arnie's arm-in-a-sock goof.<br/><br/>IF haven't seen this film: where have you been? Rent it today!"
"theshadow908","9","3","4","6 August 2006"," The best action film in existence.
","Terminator 2 picks up many years after the first film. Sarah Connor is in a mental hospital, and her son John is a rebellious pre-teen. Now, a far more sophisticated robot has been sent back to kill him. However, another T-800 model has been sent back as well, only this time to protect John. Together, they rescue Sarah and go on the run to stop the upcoming nuclear war in its tracks. Not only is this film far superior to the original, but it is far superior to any other action film as well.<br/><br/>James Cameron did a great job turning the first Terminator film into an action classic. He does an even better job this time around. It's obvious that this movie was made on a higher budget than the original, and thank God for that. The special effects in this movie are just awesome for what was available at the time. The liquid metal T-1000 looks amazing when he shape shifts. The action scenes are explosive and amazing to watch. The story and dialogue is all around better in this movie. What I liked most was how the human emotion element was used. John Connor grows attached to the Terminator sent to protect him, and he teaches him how to use phrases like a human, smile, and give high fives. The relationship between John and the Terminator, and how Sarah says ""out of all the would be fathers, this machine was the only one who measured up"", really makes the movie much cooler than the original.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is really good too. Edward Furlong is great as young John Connor. Arnold is awesome in the role he created. Linda Hamilton makes a strong improvement from the first film. She is more of an action hero this time around instead of a victim, and that makes her character better.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a spectacular action film that anybody who likes action will love. This is far superior to the first film, and one of my personal favourites.<br/><br/>9/10"

T2 is so expertly made. and keeps a heavy element of realism throughout that never disconnects you from the powerful plot. There's nothing in it at all that makes u go, ""hang on thats tack, or thats totally stupidly unrealistic, or thats total unexplained breaking the laws of physics there"" lol.

See, I alway's liked the whole sunset boulevared setting, and the moments in the desserts, because it gave the film great scenery. But T2's music by Brad Fiedel is what compliments the film superbly. I love the terminator idea, except for terminator 3, cos although nick stahl is a good actor, he ain't John Conner, and Arnie is too comical in this film.

","There's no reason why I should prefer the first film in this series to ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Perhaps the original is more of a classic and a personal favorite to me. This sequel goes for more in-depth with plot and character development than the previous film. However, there are several reasons why this film simply cannot measure up to its predecessor. First, this is far more violent than the original. It seems that every couple of minutes someone is either getting shot, beat down, or thrown through glass. Also, I dislike the character of Sarah Connor in this film. She is shown as a far more aggressive and tough woman than in the last movie, which can be unappealing to many. The movie also drags on a little too long in the last couple of scenes and really could have ended sooner, with less action and fighting sequences. Nevertheless, the chase scenes in this movie are some of the most fun and exciting ones I have ever seen. After watching it a few times, it starts to become a classic. Most of the film's elements are masterfully done, right down to the classic scene with the Terminator entering as George Thorogood and the Destroyers' ""Bad to the Bone"" plays, as well as the well-known ""Hasta la vista, baby!"" Could be improved upon, but an enjoyable film that lives up to its reputation and a newer sci-fi classic.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

The film is plainly aimed at the teen market, from the mall setting, teen lead and junk food and video game product placement it suffers as a result. It has many plot holes in it which other reviewers have covered. The acting from Lijnda Hamilton was competent though i didn't believe her descent in to psychosis.

"pyrocitor","9","4","6","15 October 2005"," Hasta la Vista, doubters!
","Terminator 2<br/><br/>The original Terminator, back in 1984, proved to be one of the best received movies of the decade, setting new standards for action films, and creating a defining role for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now, T2: Judgement Day proves to be one of the few sequels ever made which actually surpass the original in quality, bringing back all the successful elements which defined the first film, and re- creating them to a greater extent here. <br/><br/>Director James Cameron proves to be one of the wisest directors around, as he takes what could have been a terrible gratuitous action movie, and turns it into one of the defining movies of the genre. The plot is paper thin: a killer robot from the future (Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong) who will grow up to be the leader of the resistance against the robot armies in the future wars against the robots. However, a different, more advanced model of Terminator (Robert Patrick) is also sent back with the intention of killing John Connor. Meanwhile, John's mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escapes from the insane asylum she has been kept in, and gets tangled up in the mayhem.<br/><br/>It's probably one of the simplest plots in film history, in fact, I summed it up to a friend of mine as ""Arnie is the good robot. The other one is bad. The bad robot wants to kill the kid, Arnie wants to protect him."" But the execution of this simple story has such an infectious sense of fun that the viewer can't help but love every moment of it. It's one of the few action movies one doesn't have to regard as a guilty pleasure, because it's regarded as such a classic. And after viewing it, it's no wonder why T2 has been widely proclaimed: ""The greatest action movie of all time!""<br/><br/>Admirably, Cameron seems to know not to take himself too seriously, as shown with the opening sequence, as a nude Arnold takes out a whole bar full of bikers with the announcement ""I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle"". After claiming said clothes, he promptly snatches a pair of sunglasses and a shotgun from the astonished bartender, and is on his way, all of this accompanied by the song ""Bad to the Bone"". It really helps the film that it never takes itself too seriously, as it adds to the enjoyment factor, without any heavy life lessons being thrust at the audience. Cameron also incorporates numerous iconic shots, such as the Terminator stepping on a fallen rose, placing on its sunglasses for the first time, and the robot crushing the human skull at the beginning. <br/><br/>The Special Effects would be considered mind-blowing if used for a current day movie, but considering the movie was made back in 1991, they should be considered nothing less than astonishing. All the effects around the T-1000's morphing properties are incredibly well done and 'real' looking - a remarkable technical achievement, which deservedly bagged the 'Best Visual Effects' Oscar. T2 also won technical Oscars for Sound Editing, Makeup and Best Sound. It's not every action movie that manages to win four Oscars - another reason the movie deserves its iconic status. <br/><br/>But not all aspects of T2 are classic standard. As a whole, the acting leaves much to be desired - especially in the cases of Linda Hamilton and newcomer Edward Furlong. Neither give a particularly bad performance, but they each have so many annoying mannerisms, (Furlong's voice cracking adolescent screech and frustratingly blatant 80's haircut being the worst) that in many cases the viewer finds themselves wishing that the T-1000 would simply hurry up and kill them both. However, it's hard to go wrong with Arnold reprising his career defining role, and it becomes very clear that there was no better man alive to play a robot. (pause for comedic effect to set in. No? Alright then...) Schwarzenegger may probably have the least range out of any actor in Hollywood, but this was the role he was born to play, and every second he is offscreen, we desperately wish he was on screen again. Robert Patrick also plays a great villain as the shape-shifting T-1000. Though most of his part is dominated by special effects, Patrick still comes off as very menacing and dangerous - the perfect villain to counterbalance the equally stoic Arnie.<br/><br/>So it's really no wonder T2 is considered the definitive action movie: the action sequences are superb, the special effects are remarkable, even for today, and there's this infectious sense of fun that allows the audience to overlook some of the movies shortcomings, most notably in the acting department. But all in all, T2 is a highly enjoyable and very strongly made film. Take it for what it is, and you should be suitably entertained. Which is all the movie really set out to do, so it can be considered nothing less than a rousing success. To all doubters of the movie's quality. I have only one thing to say: ""Hasta la Vista!""<br/><br/>-9/10"

"mentalcritic","8","6","12","19 May 2005"," Overrated
","Terminator 2 is a very clear example of the hype becoming more important than the product. That's not to say the product isn't good, for it is certainly a better film than anything Dolph Lundgren or Jean-Claude Van Damme had been headlining at the time. The problem is that when one reads the commentaries after the fact, they expect to see a film that is as exciting to sit through as a ride in a Lamborghini down an autobahn. The reality is that for a substantial portion of its running time, Terminator 2 is anything but. Honor where honor is due - James Cameron managed to convince a film studio to give him a nine-figure budget to make a film, and it turned a not-insubstantial profit. That feat alone takes excellent film-making skills along with a good understanding of one's market. Combining this with the fact that Carolco Pictures was about to go bankrupt anyway, and the idea of publicising a film online was well over the horizon, makes the film's success even more extraordinary.<br/><br/>The film slightly revises the story told in the original, but since this was necessary to make the new story work, we'll let Cameron off the hook for that. Not to mention that unlike the dire Terminator 3, the story still makes sense on its own terms. In essence, Cameron decides to put the machine created in his groundbreaking original against something so radically advanced that not even a machine designed to be invincible is assured of success in stopping it. Realising this new enemy was accomplished through a series of robotic, makeup, prosthetic, and computer effects. This is supposedly where most of the extraordinary budget went, and it shows. Sure, the scene in which we scene a Terminator with much of his skin missing telling a truckie to get out of his own vehicle was amazing, but Cameron really tops it here. When the ""get out"" line is repeated, we totally believe that it scares the helicopter pilot enough to make him leap sixty feet to the ground.<br/><br/>The battle sequences in the film are exceptional, too. From the opening combat in the future to the small-scale duels that run through the rest of the film, the battles are exceptionally choreographed and executed. The absence of camera-shaking or, for the most part, far-too-close shots makes this one of the best films for battle sequences. The escape from the hospital and the siege at the computer manufacturer's offices are far-fetched at the best of times, but they set a cracking pace that leaves the viewer with next to no time to consider this. It is also good to see people spraying blood all over the place when they get shot, in spite of young Connor's ludicrous ""don't kill anyone"" directive. They could not have chosen a better actor for the new Terminator, either. Robert Patrick really gets the mannerisms shown in the original film down pat, and takes them to a new level. Although he is somewhat small compared to Ah-nuld, he has sufficient presence to not be totally overwhelmed by his massive co-star.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, and this is what I have been saying all along, Terminator 2 is let down by a very tedious middle section. One could almost divide the film in two. On one hand, we have an exciting series of battle sequences that, while bridged by some dialogues, rocket the viewer along with a kind of glee. On the other, we have a film where Cameron wears his philosophical waxing on his sleeve, where the characters seem to do nothing but talk and talk. Not only that, but they often state the obvious in a manner that could be considered patronising. I am told that the segue in the desert only takes up about half an hour of screen time, but it feels like ninety minutes. This, and a daft, unnecessary, amount of effort to negate a future that seems already carved in stone by talking a computer scientist into abandoning his research, well, it works in the story, but one cannot help feeling that this film could have been pared down to ninety minutes without any real loss.<br/><br/>In the end, The Terminator series should have stopped at one episode. This sequel is very good, but I just cannot help feeling the whole thing is redundant. One cannot blame Ah-nuld for wanting to return to the franchise that made him a household name, especially in light of the failures he had around this time, but one expects a bit more creativity from James Cameron. Still, Terminator 2 is worth watching once, which is more than I can say for a lot of other films I have seen in recent years."

I mean, most of the audience was roaring with laughter during the ""driving down the highway at night"" scenes. Those are when Sarah Conner is doing the truly woeful voice overs about ""no future but what we make"" and so on. I swear if James Cameron had been there he would have freaked out. He is so overrated as a director. It simply shows how ignorant people are when you see how financially successful a film can be, which has truly pitiful dialogue. I cringe during some of the lines people have. I also understand why so many people refuse to work with him because he is extremely careless (ask anyone who worked on ""The Abyss""); he is dangerous."
"Murph-24","Null","6","13","6 August 1999"," Better than the prequel, though not as good
","OK, it doesn't really need to be said, but the first film was better even though it was eclipsed in almost every way by this one.<br/><br/>
The stunts were bigger, the dramatics improved upon, the music used to more effect, but it still had the feel of a sequel which can't be good. An original will almost always be better than its sequel.<br/><br/>
The special effects and action scenes were greatly improved in content and in execution. The chase scene with the lorry is quite remarkable and is a good way of introducing the main players in the film. Some great scenes in the mental asylum and a good (though repeated) end location really manages to give a good feel to the film. However, special effects aside, we do get the feeling that it is just a makeover of the first film with a bigger budget, though that isn't a particularly bad thing. <br/><br/>Though the original terminator never betrayed his mechanical instincts and thorough programming and ruthlessly killed anyone claiming to be Sarah Conner, the return of the terminator sees models that have inconsistent (and less ruthless) characters. T101 compromises tries to learn humanistic character traits, loosely veiled under the guise of fitting in (and encouraged by his young master) which could be excused, but the failure of T1000 to successfully complete his mission could not. Though he killed John's foster parents and dog with extreme prejudice near the beginning of the film, he failed to pull off a similar stunt with Sarah near the end. He seemed to be exhibiting some very bad human traits in wanting to see her suffer. Flaws like this simply weren't present in the original film. The original model showed himself to be so inhuman at the end that he was stripped of all flesh, while the return sees a terminator that is willing to make a joke at the end. Add this to the fact that T1000 had no reason to look like Robert Patrick at the end when his cover had been blown, meaning that he could take on a different and more effective shape (like a long serrated blade with barbed ends), and several more plot flaws are revealed.<br/><br/>
Despite this, Patrick does play a far more effective and menacing terminator in practice, and without having to dress up like a thug or have big bulging muscles. As far as playing an artificial human is concerned, he fulfils the role far more convincingly than Arnie. His face changes from being expressionless to conveying some kind of empathy, and back, in a mere moment. He isn't built up, which is probably because the people that he emulates weren't big, but it seems more realistic than Arnie's Herculean body structure. Let's face it; in a post apocalyptic earth Mr. Universes are not going to blend in too well. Something else that was (naturally) missing was the feeling of innocence that was being violated. Here we see a beefed up Sarah and a well keyed up John teaming up with the Terminator as if he was an old friend. <br/><br/>Aside from this, the suspense, effects and amusing scenes make this well worth watching even if it isn't as dark and moody as the original. A very enjoyable film that improves upon many elements of the original but suffers from the sequel-plot syndrome."
"zkonedog","6","3","5","3 March 2017"," The ""Empire Strikes Back"" Of The Terminator Franchise
","After the original ""Terminator"" film that was so ahead of its time that the special effects couldn't keep up with James Cameron's vision, ""T2: Judgment Day"" is an action-packed, adventure-filled extravaganza. It basically does everything Cameron wanted to do in the first one...and then some. The only problem? It skimps on the time-travel storyline in favor of the romping action.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, T2 tells the story of a young John Connor (Edward Furlong), a boy who is vital to the future of human civilization once the machines take over in 1997. With mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) in a mental institution for her wild (yet accurate) claims of the future, John has turned into a rebellious youngster. When a new kind of cybernetic (Robert Patrick) comes from the future to hunt him down, this time John is protected by the Model 101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) that tried to kill his mother. The goal this time? Trying to prevent Skynet from ever being created.<br/><br/>T2 is an entertaining experience that never gets boring. The special effects are explosive, the pace is always moving forward, and the franchise certainly sheds its ""80s movie"" clichéd reputation with a slick, edgy new look. Patrick nearly steals the show as the advanced, liquid metal Terminator, one of the great on-screen villains of all-time. Simply put, there is simply a lot to like about the film that most people consider to be the best in the franchise.<br/><br/>For me, however, T2 comes in a notch below the original. Why? When I watch this franchise, I primarily watch it for the intriguing past/future time-travel storyline. That kind of gets lost in this one, what with all the stunts and visual effects. Even the plot arc involving Cyberdyne kind of gets short shrift. Personally, I liked the gritty, darker tone of the first film better. More focus on story/characters than on effects, humor, and action.<br/><br/>The best analogy I can make is that T2 reminds me of ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the original Star Wars trilogy. That film also forgoes plot a bit in favor of rollicking adventure. Many people (just like T2) think that is the best installment of that series, but I liked its predecessor a bit better (just like in this case too). I can appreciate ""Judgment Day"" for what it is, but I can't say its my favorite.<br/><br/>Overall, though, T2 is a fun movie that I can still enjoy. It adds some elements to the franchise that I like (primarily Patrick's character). I just wanted a bit more story."
"Screen_Blitz","10","3","5","25 June 2015"," One of the greatest and most visually stunning sci-fi actions films of all time
","How often do you see a sequel that surpasses it's predecessor? Sequels like these are exceptionally rare and come only once in a blue moon. In the summer of 1991, Director James Cameron left a long lasting impression on audience with this exciting and visually stunning sequel to the 1984 science-fiction classic 'Terminator', with Arnold Schwarzenegger in arguably his most iconic role. Exploding with groundbreaking computer-generated visuals and energy-fueled special effects, this sequel to the 1984 predecessor continuing the storyline with a plot more fleshed out than ever and more compelling character exploration than what James Cameron brought us in the first outing. And the results are nothing short of impressive or fun. From the opening scene showing the massive shoot out between the terminators followed by the burning landscape in the opening credits, to the ending; this movie James Cameron delivering his outstanding flair of filmmaking to the screen. Terminator 2: Judgement Day sees Schwartznegger return as T-800, a robot sent back in time to the year 1995 to protect John Conner (played by Edward Furlong) the preteen son of Sarah Conner (played by Linda Hamilton -- who he tried to kill in the first film) who is now imprisoned in a mental facility, from a liquid metal shape-shifting robot named T-1000 (played by Robert Patrick), who sets out to kill the young lad.<br/><br/>This science-fiction adventure offers just about everything you would expect from a sequel except one thing, only much better. It kicks off with an engaging premise about a war between humans and robots ruled by Skynet (the main antagonist), a lethal computer network system that launches a massive global attack that wipes out millions of lives on Earth. The war is the event known as Judgement Day. From there on out, the film blesses us with an powerful plot that carries on quite well from beginning to end, and characters with magnetic backgrounds. This includes John Connor who is revealed to be a future resistance leader during the aftermath of Judgement Day, that is if they fail to stop it. Arnold Schwartznegger does a magnificent job as T-800, probably the most memorable performance of his career. Yes, his performance does lack emotion but what do you expect? He's playing a robot. And let's not forget his larger-than-life line ""Hasta La Vista, baby!"". Edward Furlong does a pretty well job as John Conner, especially for this being his first acting role. Then there is Linda Hamilton playing Sarah Conner, John's mother, who is assist John and T-800 on their mission to bring down the tyrant T-1000, played by Robert Patrick who fits suitably well in the role. Hamilton is tremendous in her role, indulging a fair amount of charisma and emotion into her character with a mysterious past. While the film grants an astonishing amount of nuance in the narrative department, the most impressive aspect comes from the visual effects. Arguably the biggest eye-catcher in the visuals point out at the way T-1000 transforms back and forth from a human into the liquid metal robot he is. These effects, along with the explosive special effects make up for some high-octane action sequences. <br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgement Day is not only one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made or one of the greatest sequels, but perhaps one of the best films of all time, especially for its decade. This is one of those films many sci-fi fans will love and cherish for many years beyond, no matter how much it ages, an astounding achievement that shows that James Cameron really had something thoughtful in mind."

But I believe nothing can meet the standards on this classic flick.<br/><br/>Movie begins in the not so distant future where 2 machines called Terminators are send back in time. Then the story revolves around John Connor(who is destined to be leader of the rebellion in the future). One of the terminator played by Arnold is sent by future John to protect the present himself from the advanced T-1000 played by Robert Patrick. Isn't this plot kickass enough for u to get ur pop corn ready?? :) Back ground score is legendary.. Direction is amazing.. Go James go.. And the climax is mind blowing... All in all, a must watch for all who love action..."
"Arm-Lizard","10","3","5","23 September 2014"," A work of art that can't be matched
","Why am I writing this now? I don't really know for sure, but I just remembered how much I love this movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Terminator 2 is one of the very few perfect movies in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is one of five or six movies in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid, and massive.<br/><br/>So, I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurate:<br/><br/>1- The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvelous, every camera movement is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it and you spoil it, seriously.<br/><br/>2- The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed from the first movie, which was an incredible hit too, and it still has its own creations as well, and full of unpredictable twists. I don't know about you, but this take on the post-human era was unbelievably frightening. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city is dark enough. Its power and effectiveness are yet, 23 years later, not to be matched.<br/><br/>3- The atmosphere is genius. Gothic, cold, and sometimes idyllic. The use of camera angles with editing techniques and the score is beyond description, and the use of sound effects is as thrilling as it gets. The result is pure magic.<br/><br/>4- The visual effects are the best possible for 1991, and it holds today as good as it did 23 years ago. Here you'll witness the perfect marriage between CGI, makeup, and animatronics. Stan Winston with his team and the magicians of ILM took the industry of cinema to the 21 century with ultimate success.<br/><br/>5- The acting is splendid. Arnold in the only role that suits him, as the protective machine T-800. Linda Hamilton as the tough woman & caring mother is more than a revelation. Robert Patrick playing the shape-shifting T-1000 gives me the creeps.<br/><br/>6- The score. Brad Fiedel's work matches the images so perfectly as if it is bleeding from them. It is, and will always be, the best soundtrack for a cold, hostile, post-human futuristic atmosphere in sci-fi flick ever.<br/><br/>7- A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well-remembered scenes. Well, T2 has so many that I won't go into it.<br/><br/>8- So, what more? I urge all cinema fans and directors to watch this movie a zillion times as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip-off from it as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. CITIZEN KANE? You must be joking."

","Hands down the best movie of all time. Cast is great. Story is great. everything is perfect. I wish they could still make a movie like this. Schwarzenegger really pulled it off in this one There will never be another T2. Great for the whole family. I have seen this movie close to 200 times now. It's still as good as the first time I saw it as a child. 10 out of 10 stars. I would give it more if possible. Just don't even think about it. Go ahead and watch this movie. Look at the amount of people reviewing this and how high the ratings are.. It has stood the test of time... I can only hope they make a Terminator 5 in the next year or 2 staring Arnold Schwarzenegger."
"WalterFrith","Null","3","5","2 August 2003"," No as good as the first film!
","I love 'T2' but it isn't as good as the original film.  People are fooled by it because, yes, it does look better.  But as a FILM with all the elements in place and evaluated, this film has less edge and a running time that is too long.  Although it won four technical Oscars, James Cameron's vision in the first film is far more clear and original.  Arnold looks far more menacing as a bad guy.  He looked younger and much hungrier for action in the first film and Michael Biehn was a great character as Reese who, unfortunately, had to get killed off."
"hereispierre","5","4","8","17 September 2014"," Mostly Good
","I really prefer the first Terminator movie because it is darker and just has a more real feel and edgier tone. It's bleaker and just more pure sci fi to me.<br/><br/>Kind of the same way I feel about Alien (best sci fi movie ever in my opinion except maybe for 2001: A Space Odyssey) and Aliens/Alien 2, just like that movie Terminator got a lot bigger and went for way more action with a much bigger budget. Still a good movie don't get me wrong but it lost a lot of the magic.<br/><br/>For one thing, Arnold S. as the evil killing machine assassin from the future was wicked. That scene where he takes out the entire police station? Wicked! But because it's Hollywood the producers or he or his agents said that he has to be the GOOD guy so he comes back as a machine to be the kid's bodyguard. Would have been better in my mind to stick with him as the killer."

I can tell you I love it as much now as I did then. The story is brilliant, the acting spot on and the action second to none. What's more the soundtrack is epic.<br/><br/>Arnold plays the part perfectly and the supporting cast also. The SFX still really holds up.

"saymaraza","9","2","3","5 June 2016"," Terminator 2: Judgement Day review
","Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) is a late sequel to James Cameron's original 'The Terminator' (1984) directed by James Cameron once again. I have to say, i absolutely love the original Terminator movie. Everything about it is awesome. Some people seem to think that this film was better than the original. It is great without a doubt, but i still have always preferred the original. Probably because it was the original idea, and i found Arnold a lot cooler and more intimidating in the first one. Cameron tried to make Arnold look a lot cooler in this film, when the film opens up with him in the bar, and he has his new sticky- up hair cut which looks awesome. But, he didn't look half as big and intimidating as he was in the first one. One good thing about this film is that it was filmed on much bigger budget than the first film, and the new Terminators were a lot more up to date with technology than the first one, In the first one it was just a powerful machine inside a mans human tissue. The same includes with Arnold in this one, in this film, he is the protector, not Terminator. But still in a Terminator form. This film is definitely worth seeing if you love the first film, i'm one of few who prefer the first one, thats just my opinion, i have seen the first one so many times and is a childhood classic of mine. But a lot of people tend to think this film is better."
"danielaustin-735-484497","10","2","3","13 March 2016"," One of the best sequels ever
","I have given this film a 10 because of its entertainment, story and emotion. <br/><br/>Some might say that it is not as good as T1 and in some ways I agree. T1 is a lot darker, menacing and original but this sequel really does deliver. It has the perfect blend of action, story line, depth and thought. The acting is good, sets amazing and action/ special effects amazing. Arnie is at his brilliant best in this and really makes the film. I much prefer sci fi like this to Avatar which is 100% cheese and CGI heaven. <br/><br/>With reference to a sequel it's up there with Empire Strikes Back and Aliens. Not much more I can say without spoilers. <br/><br/>If you're but seem it then you Are in for a real treat. <br/><br/>Enjoy"
"AgentX2014","Null","2","3","1 February 2016"," Still holds up
","I loved this movie as a kid. The first one is great as well, but for a child it felt drawn out and hard to relate to. This sequel upped the ante with the liquid steel villain, which helped the sci-fi feel. The kid was relatable, Linda Hamilton was no longer a damsel in distress, which was great. This feels like the ultimate Terminator of the series. I recently re watched this and the first one with my teen. She liked them both but leaned toward this one more as well. I won't give any potential spoilers for anyone who may be the last sci-fi fan on earth who hasn't seen this, but it is definitely worth dusting off or streaming. Even 20+ years later the CGI didn't feel old and the movie still kept you entranced. Well done."
"Morbius_Fitzgerald","7","2","3","13 February 2014"," Its okay.
","Now Terminator has become a staple of icon upon icon for action movies. For the most part, I don't blame people for saying that. The Terminator films (with the exception of 3 and 4) are all entertaining.<br/><br/>So if you haven't seen the first one let me go down the plot; A machine is sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of the child that would lead the human resistance to defeat the machines, a soldier from her son's army is also sent back to protect her. It was a surprisingly effective sci-fi/thriller and even brought the question of man's nature with machines into play. Its actually my favourite Terminator film.<br/><br/>The plot to THIS Terminator film is almost like it was made by fan fiction. Two Terminators are sent back in time, one to kill John Connor as a child, one to protect him. The film actually has a well done execution and it does feature some well done action scenes and character development.<br/><br/>However if you line up both Terminator movies both films seem like different features. One is a science fiction thriller about the dangers of independently thinking machines, the other is a sci-fi action that started the career of Edward Furlong (really?).<br/><br/>So is this the 39th greatest movie of all time? Not even close. Is it one of the good Arnold Schwarzenegger movies? Yes. Check it out if you haven't already, you wont be disappointed."
"Sandcooler","9","2","3","9 November 2010"," Mayhem!
","This sequel if possible makes even less sense than the original, but chances are you won't care at all because it just looks absolutely amazing. This is really James Cameron at his finest, with all kinds of breath-taking effects and action scenes that are about as pure as action scenes can get. CGI can do miracles sometimes, but nothing can really top a good old-fashioned motorcycle-truck chase with constant shotgun blasts. I make the movie sound somewhat dumber than it really is though, because it actually takes some time out for real character development as well. The friendship between an average boy and a robot who somehow learns to have feelings (kinda) could be a movie all by itself, here's it's just a really beautiful side story. Granted, Edward Furlong can be pretty annoying in some scenes, but he's pretty darn tough to hate during the climax. I also really enjoy the villain in this movie, a terminator who just for the heck of it can transform his arms into knives. I don't know why I find that clever, I just do. This is probably one of the best action flicks ever made."
"Filmmaker 13","10","2","3","3 June 2010"," Better than the one before it and the two abortions after.
","Surprised I never wrote a review for the greatest action film of all time (not really, I rarely do :) This film is masterful for all the reasons that every one has already said or will say once they watch. James Cameron is known for his strong female characters and Sarah Connor has to be the toughest. One reason I think why this action film appeals to many females vs. every other action films where the girl is in distress, waiting to be saved. But that's not the main reason everyone digs this film, it's simply how perfectly the film is crafted. It's a very well written script, not in terms of brilliant dialogue, but in terms of story and flow. Everything about the direction is perfect, editing, characters, performances, literally every input in the film."
"johnnyboyz","10","2","3","23 March 2009"," Still one of the best action films ever made, with fantastic levels of entertainment but careful and chilling substance as well.
","On face value, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a gripping and rip-roaring chase film constructed, in an entertainment sense, around three scenes of great action and tension that rely on the element of chase as their respective drives. Those scenes take place in Los Angles' flood control system between a motorcycle, a truck and a second motorcycle; an escape from a mental institution which primarily takes place on foot within the dark and precise confines of bleak, colourless corridors before branching out into an individual chasing a car load of protagonists; before finally settling for what is arguably the best of the three: a thrilling chase on a public highway between a SWAT van and a pursuing helicopter. This scene itself pauses to transform one involving a tanker truck chasing a much slower, smaller van. But the film is also a chilling warning, a film that borders on the political as it outlines the positive and negative aspects of modernity.<br/><br/>While Terminator 2 has and will probably continue to wow audiences with its fast pacing, gripping chase scenes and general all round entertainment aesthetic; Cameron has crafted something that carries great substance, something that is lost on more contemporary action directors. When films are made nowadays about robots bashing the life out of each other, people like Michael Bay can only come up with things like Transformers but back in the day, a certain guile or craft; a certain thought process was the result of it.<br/><br/>The film revolves around the statement that 'the future is not set', clearly stating that what we make up our own future as we go along and in the ever changing world of consumerism and modernity in which we live, there are no bounds as to where we can reach. The film was produced and released in 1991, coinciding with the end of The Cold War during which nuclear war was averted. The film's closing voice-over from a certain character is a warning of sorts; a statement that just because we've averted nuclear war in the most desperate of situations (echoing the character's actions in the film with the overall global situation), doesn't mean that there can never be a conflict as intense or as dangerous ever again. The closing voice-over makes reference to a 'new future', a future in which they hope technology and modernity is controlled and observed and that arms races' no longer exist.<br/><br/>The film is of course about two robots sent back from 2029, one with a murderous agenda and the other with a more protective one. The target is John Connor (Furlong), whose mother Sarah (Hamilton) was the target in the first film. The pitch here is that a young boy is now the target rather than a mature woman, creating a sense of urgency or desperation before anything has even happened when we realise this new target really is a complete innocent and utterly helpless if he were to come across either of these machines. Meanwhile, Sarah is being treated as mentally ill in a local institute for the delusional.<br/><br/>One of these machines acts as technology used 'for good' as it becomes apparent it is designed to protect John. This acts as the core of Sarah's argument when one of the more humbling scenes of realisation takes place in the desert half way through the film as she watches the machine interact with John. She states it was better than any (human) father in this regard and would fight and die protecting her son. While initially hostile towards the machine, wanting to destroy it at first chance, Sarah realises that machines are able to have a place in the world and she acknowledges the fact modernity exists and can be used for 'good' rather than to hasten H-bomb construction procedure or, indeed, to prolong nuclear war.<br/><br/>But Cameron's crowning glory could well be the way that, despite the 'cinema as a spectacle' approach and despite all these studies of the advancement of technology and the warnings they carry, is the manner in which Cameron develops his characters. The first Terminator film was progressive enough; taking Sarah Connor from a passive, submissive waitress whom drives to work on a quaint little moped to killer robot killer but here, the development continues and progresses Sarah into this strong, hard bodied and very independent women â€“ a fighter, a soldier but still a mother. Effortlessly, on the other side of the coin, Cameron studies the fatherly relationship between John and the protective Terminator, fleshing him out to become more human. One key part of this, I feel, is the shedding of the sunglasses thus ridding a very artificial and anonymous characteristic of the Terminator's face and allowing the study to occur following this. Additionally, Sarah becomes more of a killing machine herself during these segments, much to her regret when she realises she's become the one thing she once feared and fled from not so long ago.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is Cameron's crowning glory. The first one was impressive enough given how much it took on with such limited resources, but here Cameron blitzes his previous effort, albeit the first one was still thoroughly impressive. This film was a reminder that, as we stood on the brink of the 21st century, this 'thing' called technology existed and could well be used for good, or for evil as wonderfully demonstrated in this film."

","OK, so I always like to read the negative comments because it makes you think more about the movie. But it seemed like people were taking positive things about the movie and saying that's what made it bad.<br/><br/>To me, it was amazing how the terminator and John Connor created a bond. It added a buddy action feel to it and you also felt for them when he was destroyed at the end. How could this make it bad? There was a plot hole here and there maybe, but time travel is pretty tricky. I always asked myself how John Connor is suddenly a teenager only six years after his mother became pregnant with him. And robots having Austrian accents? Funniest thing ever, but who else could ever play that part??? The special effects were superior to anything else at the time. People make comments about the first one but c'mon, did you see the same clay-animated robot as I did at the end?? Not to say I didn't like the first one but no movie is perfect. Robert Patrick also made a cool evil villain.<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm saying is that I'm a huge fan of T2, just like anybody else who grew up in the nineties. I mean, I was raised on it, and still like it today. Just wanted to address some of the things I read on here. Still one of my favs."

Especially, Arnie and Robert fit their roles perfectly. The Terminator is still a machine. But he is a machinery hero who knows the life's value. T - 1000 is cold with his mission. The stunts are so great that you cannot remove your eyes from the screen. I remember I watched it when the movie was published on VHS tape. Now you can watch it on DVD or Blue-ray disc.

The gun fights are amazing and brilliantly choreographed, between Arnie and Robert; the films strength however lies in the tension that is built and the scariness of T-1000; Arnie's accent is also utilised and makes him sound more robotic and cold.....<br/><br/>Definitely one of the greatest action movies of all time...."

","TERMINATOR 2 DVD true beauty of TERMINATOR 2 is its undying loyalty and respect for its predecessor, made some eight years before. Even though there was such a gap in time, Cameron remained faithful to his original production, which translates into a seamless and believable sequel. The T-800 machine, the nemesis in the original ""Terminator,"" returns, only this time the cyborg has been programmed to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), now a pre-adolescent. And once again, Schwarzenegger was made for the role of the T-800: a stoic, hulking, violent killing machine, yet this time, Arnold brings a discreet sense of humor and compassion to the part. Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, young mother of John, but now she's buffed and tough and ready to fight back. And Robert Patrick is exceptional as the advanced T-1000 Model, the machine programmed to kill John--a machine so advanced it makes the T-800 look like an old Commodore PC. The action, the effects, the story, is spellbinding, but again, the subtle and not-so-subtle parallels to the original ""Terminator"" are what impressed me the most. Highly recommended for fans of Arnold, the Terminator, and Science Fiction movies. Gunner II January, 2008"

Stan Winston (RIP) was a Master at the effects. Terrific Unforgettable Background Scores By Brad Fiedel(True Lies(1994)), an another Master.<br/><br/>As far as I have remembered and observed: The following were the revolutionary FIRST steps in the various types of Visual effects we enjoy today. Each of these movies had unique first-of-its-kind Visual effects contained in them: <br/><br/>Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) The Abyss (1989) Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) Jurassic Park (1993) Forrest Gump (1994) Titanic (1997) The Matrix (1999) Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999) The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) The Polar Express (2004)<br/><br/>For me, the most realistic, non-Exaggerated, practical, Scientific movie ever made is Steven Spielberg's 'Artificial Intelligence(2001)' which gets a 10/10 from me. Nobody beats that.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, as a Scientific movie, I rate both Terminator / Matrix series as 9/10,subtracting one star from each, simply because these movies contained some Time/Place Warping events (Paradoxes) which are a long way to happen even by today's Physics i.e. they are a LITTLE-BIT unbelievable for me considering I did a Major in Physics."
"laura-vanbaren","10","2","3","27 July 2008"," My hero
","This is a perfect example of a sequel which is better than the original movie. Not that The Terminator was a bad movie, in fact it was a great movie, but it's just not as good as Termintor 2: Judgment Day.<br/><br/>Ever since I've seen this movie, and I think I was about seven years old when I first saw this movie, Arnie's been my action hero. I really do not know by, but I think it has to do with one of the last scenes in this movie. It's when the T1000 finally got beat by Arnie and Arnie, who's all scratched and broken, decides to 'commit suicide' by letting himself go down into the... what? I always thought it had to be lava when I was seven years old, so I keep calling it lava. I cried my eyes out! It was one of the saddest scenes I'd ever seen (but then again: how many (adult) movies could I've seen at that age? :P) Anyway, one of the many reasons why I think this movie is so great, is that it manages to let a robot almost become human. And not only that: When I was seven I did understand that this Terminator was a robot, he wasn't human and he could never be entirely human, simply because he hasn't got a human body and he doesn't have what we call emotions. He's not programmed to have such things. So I knew that all he was, was a machine. But still: Cameron manages to make a human out of a robot, in a way that's not over the top, but in a natural way. The bond between Connor and Terminator is beautiful in it's own way and even though Cameron makes a human-like robot, you never forget it's a robot you're dealing with.<br/><br/>Maybe Arnie isn't the greatest actor who ever lived, but you can't deny that he's the only true Terminator. No one but him could say the line 'I'll be back' like he did (which is obvious, I know) in the same robot-like way like he did. And maybe that's because of his accent, but I truly know for sure that there isn't a greater Terminator than Arnie. With or without the accent."

","Anyone who thinks this movie deserves any less than an 8 probably thinks that Transporter, Rush Hour, and Pitch Black are where it's at. This movie set the standard for future action movies and is a marvel for its time, even for our time. No other action/adventure movie comes close to this one, and I have to search hard to find movies in other genres that can compete at this high a level. T2 is one of those films where you want it to keep on going because it is that good, and you start to feel bad when you know it's almost over. It's such an insult to T2 to have Terminator 3 and so on created afterward because they effectively nullify this film's purpose. By the way, if anyone ever claims The Terminator is better than its sequel, then be VERY suspicious of any movie recommendations he or she makes."

","No doubt one of the greatest sequels ever made, Terminator 2 is an edge-of-your-seat Sci-Fi action extravaganza that is, in my mind, James Cameron's greatest achievement. The dark, uneasy mise-en-scene of the original classic is replaced with a accomplished, action-packed, special effects laden ride with some slick direction and a complex, intelligent script.<br/><br/>After the first film, the premise had lost most of its originality, so Cameron develops the plot, throwing in psychological subtexts and more conflicting character developments, making the film a lot more complex. The characterisation works wonderfully and gives the film a lot of raw emotion juxtaposed to the amazing action sequences. But the latter remain the ultimate accomplishment to this film; they are spectacular, thrilling, brilliantly composed and at times jaw-dropping with the effects of the T-1000 in particular, still looking fresh today. But perhaps the most underrated factor of this film is the fantastic music by the excellent Brad Fiedel, which perfectly suits every scene and elevates it to brilliant status.<br/><br/>9/10"
"philip-473","10","2","3","23 February 2008"," T2- One of the best movies made.
","I've seen the entire Terminator series and I've got to give James Cameron his props for this movie. It blends in comedy and action with not one- but two killer robots nicely. Without further ado, Here is my review of Terminator 2: Judgment Day: <br/><br/>Plot: The plot is simple- but is effective for this movie. The Villain from the first movie, has turned good. The movie doesn't begin in the present days either. It takes place during a War in the future. Then it cuts to the present. Where we see that a new threat (The T-1000) has come to destroy all of humanity one person at a time and until he gets John Connor. He can't fulfill it. The plot like I said earlier, is simple and effective. My score-10/10 <br/><br/>Cast: The cast is also excellent in this movie. We have Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton returning to the movie from the first plus he also have Edward Furlong playing John Connor and Robert Patrick puts on a great show as T-1000. My score-9.5/10 <br/><br/>SFX: I'm really impressed at the effects in this film. The guys at Stan Winston Studios and ILM outdid themselves here. The morphing effects are Photo realistic and go along nicely and don't get me started on the Trailer's practical effects either. In short, the effects might not hold a candle to todays movies. But for their time, they were awesome. My score-10/10<br/><br/>Overall: The movie is excellent in many different ways I mean, who else wouldn't want to see a Terminator morph into other things. My overall score-10/10 <br/><br/>Another review from Phil MacRae: I'll be back!"

"tjbb3113","9","2","3","27 December 2006"," Terminator 2 better than the first?
","""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is an action packed science fiction masterpiece. The sequel to ""Terminator"" adds a new flavor that makes it arguably better than the first. Set 12 years into the future from the original, Arnold comes back through time for another titillating thrill ride, but this time Sarah Connor is a secondary target. Her son John Connor, the future savior of men, is a young man living with his foster parents after his mother was committed to a mental health facility. What makes ""Judgment Day"" different from the original is that there is a new more advanced model of the Terminator. The T-1000 is a liquid metal robot who can take the shape of anything he touches as long as it is relatively the same size. He can also form knives and stabbing weapons. This movie is another James Cameron classic, which keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie while displaying a very relevant theme: ""The future's not set. There is no fate, but what we make for ourselves."""
"broadest","9","2","3","21 August 2006"," The greatest sequel to date!
","The saying goes that if you make a follow up to a film its never as good as the first but this statement is smashed up when Terminator 2 was released. I can still watch this film now over and over again, its an ageless film with effects in it that look great even now. No one had seen anything like the T-1000 before, Robert Patrick was a great casting. I think the terminator films are Arnold Schwarzeneggers decent film achievements. So many good scenes in this film to talk about but ones that stand out are the T-1000 copying John Conners step mum and when speaking to John on the phone in her voice you hear a slice and then the camera moves over to show that she has a metal knife sliced into Johns step-Dads face, great idea. The T-1000 rising up through the black and white tiles to morph into the police officer. Edward Furlong was also a great casting he was perfect for the part, he had no acting experience and they just found him and went to the lengths to train him to do the part, which was worth it. The music helps this film have another side to it having music for the 2 machines and Sarah Conners flashbacks its eary. So many different things to look at when watching this film like the relationship between humans and a learning machine. This for me is a truly complete film and the 3rd film should never have been made its just as well James Cameron didn't choose the alternate ending for the 2nd otherwise the mony grabbers would have been stuffed to make a third. There are so many other key things to say about it but then if you watch it, it explains itself!"

","Excellent combination of: futuristic sci-fi (must say so) horror, the dose of humor, moral dilemmas, high action, the best effects ever... I could watch this movie 100 times, not being boring to me... 10 is too low.<br/><br/>from http://www.filmsite.org/term2.html: Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) is the well-executed, action-packed sequel to the earlier film of the same name. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator (cyborg) character of the first film, The Terminator (1984) told everyone: ""I'll be back"" - and proved it with this film. <br/><br/>The sequel reunited director James Cameron and the two major stars, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton. The screenplay was co-written by Cameron and William Wisher, and Cameron was responsible for both production and direction. The sequel was made possible by Cameron's hugely successful blockbuster Aliens (1986) and The Abyss (1989). Unlike The Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgment Day would gross half its budget in its opening weekend, despite a running time of over two and a half hours, and end up making back twice its budget in the United States alone.<br/><br/>The science-fiction blockbuster is known for its computer-generated special effects (created by George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic) and dazzling, non-stop action sequences. In the first film, the Terminator was animated as an armature model unlike the second Terminator that was a computer-generated image. The film won four Academy Awards for its Sound, Visual Effects, Makeup, and Sound Effects Editing. It was also the first film in history to cost $100 million to produce."

","I was fairly young when I saw this film. It was my favorite movie then, and it still is now. I just love a good action flick. Anybody who does as well, will also love this masterpiece. I am a huge fan of both Robert Patrick(T 1000)and Arnold Schwarzennegger. James Cameron put so much effort into making this movie, it all paid off too. I admire all of his work. If this movie had not been made, they would have never been able to make Jurrasic Park. They made so many breakthroughs while doing this movie. If you can catch it, in some clips Robert Patrick had to put a suit on that looked like liquid metal. This sequel was much better than the original one it also ran on a much higher budget as you can see.

"deathrattle","10","2","3","27 May 2006"," Something A Bit Special To Say The Least!
","The best director at the time, an actor at the peak of his career, a storyline to salivate over, special effects that leave your jaw on the floor it has to be Terminator 2. The sequel to the Sci Fi thriller that was The Terminator. What makes it so special? From the opening sequence to the heartbreaking finale it grabs you and does not let you go. Arnold Schwartzenegger simple owns every scene he is in, stealing it sometimes without having to mutter a single word. An actor sometimes criticised for bland emotion-less performance pulls off his best role, ironically playing a machine with no emotions, but still managing to let the audience know what he is thinking and in a way how he was feeling....Superb!!"
"DaRick89","10","2","3","15 January 2006"," One of my favourite movies...it's every bit as good as the original
","I have seen Terminator 2 six times in my life and I still don't get the slightest bit tired of watching it. Since I watched it the first time, it has become one of my favourite movies.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 starts off very well, commencing action immediately with an introduction into the horrors of the future (2030?) as perpetrated by a computer called Skynet. The human resistance then send one of their own robots back into the present (T-100) in response to Skynet sending a liquid one back (T-1000, more on him later). Before this scene, we see Los Angeles as it was in 1991, further exemplifying the devastation caused in the future. This scene caught my attention and I was waiting for more from then on. Imagine my disappointment when, in class one day, we saw the intro of Terminator 2, but nothing else.<br/><br/>Luckily, I got more. We see our hero, in a mildly amusing scene, steal a biker's clothes and his car, while Liquid Terminator kills a cop. From then on, they are adversaries, with each looking to foil the other's objectives: kill and protect John Connor, the saviour of the future, respectively. The action heats up again when Connor flees The Liquid Terminator on a bike, meets up with our hero and they flee the truck-riding Liquid Terminator in an awesome chase scene which sees high-octane explosions all round.<br/><br/>Then we enter the next scene: the mental institution where John's mum, Sarah, is being kept. Sarah hits her way out of the institution, injects poison into the head mental doctor (Dr. Silberman, who somehow manages to feature in all three movies) and meets John, only to flee our hero when he exits the lift. Another awesome chase scene occurs, where when Liquid Terminator is chasing them, he sticks his liquid knives onto the back of the car (a scene which has been spoofed in 'The Simpsons').<br/><br/>A lull occurs, but even this is not that boring, as we enter Sarah's paranoid mind in a dream. She then sets out to try and kill the creator of the robots, Miles. This leads up to the best scene in the movie, when Miles helps them infiltrate the cyber building and take/destroy the robot technology. Our hero then takes out his grenade launcher and Gatling gun and...no, I won't spoil this. After yet another awesome chase scene, the final showdown occurs, which after a protracted struggle...I'll leave it here; I've spoilt enough of the movie. Now on to the review.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is such a great movie on so many levels. Not only is the plot good, but the action almost never relents, save for that brief lull I was talking about. The special effects are awesome, some of the best I've seen in movies. The Liquid Terminator, for instance, does some great looking metamorphosis and can turn his arms and hands into liquid steel knives. This looks incredible, but it could have come off as looking cheap.<br/><br/>Let's not forget about the acting. In my opinion, there is not one single bad performance here. Arnold Schwarzenegger does a fine job as the T-100, playing his cyborg protector part to a tee, especially at the end. Linda Hamilton offers insight into Sarah Connor, how the run-in with The Terminator (in the first film) completely changed her personality and outlook on life. Even Edward Furlong isn't too bad as John Connor. But the best performance in the film would have to belong to Robert Patrick, in my opinion. He pulls of the Liquid Terminator role perfectly, as he emits a sheer callousness and a sheer disregard for life that comes from the best villains. He even acts 'metallic' in his demeanour, with his head movements. (They should have cast him as the lead villain in Die Hard 2, then it would have been a better movie. See that review for more.)<br/><br/>You can also see it over and over again without ever getting bored with it, which is the mark of a really good movie.<br/><br/>In the end, what can I say? This is one of my favourite movies, for so many reasons. The original Terminator is as good as this film is, but I am more familiar with this one, having seen it six times. And hey, if I can see it six times without getting bored, then it must be good!<br/><br/>5/5 stars"
"elduderino78","10","2","3","9 September 2004"," Terminator was great, T-2 is perfect
","The first terminator was a fantastic science fiction thriller, dark and brutal. Schwarzenneger was merciless, Linda Hamilton was fragile and innocent, and the story was interesting and packed with action and desperation. But in my view, it doesn't come close to this.<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest action/sci-fi movies of all time. Technically, the film is incredible. Everything from the sound to the editing to the special effects is almost flawless - the two terminators look awesome, especially the t-1000. And the action sequences are brilliantly done.<br/><br/>Bur besides being brilliantly done, the action parts also leave you breathless, and that you cannot achieve just through technical perfection. For that, you need the director's awesome vision, and the actor's intense performances.<br/><br/>James Cameron is a genius when it comes to action and sci-fi, as can be seen in Aliens, the Abyss, the Terminator, and a few more. And here he's at his finest. The action is brutal and thrilling to watch, fun and packed with details.<br/><br/>The actors are perfectly cast. Schwarzenneger is a Terminator that is beginning to develop a soul. He's still cold and tough as nails, but no longer merciless. He's as cool as the first terminator, but actually likable this time. <br/><br/>Linda Hamilton is a bit over the top sometimes, but then again her character is supposed to be completely neurotic and paranoid. Furlong is a great actor nowadays, and started off really well here. And Robert Patrick plays an excellent t-1000. Not much depth to the character, but then again this time it's him, not Arnold who's supposed to be the non-stop killing machine, so not much depth required.<br/><br/>And the story... Well, for an action movie, it's brilliant. Imaginative, thrilling, sometimes superficially philosophical, it takes the first movie's ideas and creates one hell of a adventure.<br/><br/>This movie gripped me from beginning to end the first time, and still does after all this time. There's only one word that perfectly describes it: Excellent.<br/><br/>And try and watch the DVD special edition. It's got a lot of character development on it, and some great little details..."
"mrbeefyporkpie","Null","2","3","26 May 2004"," the greatest sequel of all time??
","i was first introduced to Terminator 2-Judgement Day at the tender age of 9 and ever since i have been hooked. i saw the first in the series on the same day for the first time too, and found it OK, but there were so many obvious mistakes, mainly due to the limited budget. Terminator 2 is however, so different, so spectacular, and so advanced, even by the standards of today. as i have grown older, i have learned to appreciate the first in the series more and more. the ruthless terminator who in some cases is so close to being a human yet so far away, and a soldier sent back in time to save a mother and her unborn (and unconcieved) son provide two completely opposite ends of the spectrum. the fear and determination to survive on the human part is quite moving, yet the ruthlessness of the terminator is utterly disturbing. now, this finally leaves us at terminator 2- and whats happened? a new terminator has been sent back in time, just as ruthless as the first, but with a mission to save john connor, age 11.( i think-lets not get into that!!)he must, however, obey all of johns orders, and promises not to ill anyone, a key moment in the film, as it not only expersses the terminators loyalty, but it is the same point where the terminator begins to feel human emotion, asking questions like ""why do you cry?"" and stating ""i know now why you cry, but it is something i could never do."" he's also prepared to learn the lingo!! sent back this time to terminate john connor is the T-1000, made of liquid metal, a far more advanced terminator than arnie, te T-100. some of the scenes the T-1000 provides are devastating, from the lorry chase to walking through metal bars, to he reformation when frozen by liquid nitrogen- undoubtably the greatest baddie ever to grace the big screen.<br/><br/>its not often you can say this, but throughout the film, arnie is fantastic, his lack of emotion at the beginning, to a machine which is almost human by the end is breathtaking, and it is obviously the part which he was born to play- if the original plans went ahead and Van Damm played the terminator i guarantee there would have never have been a sequel. so, what do i think? the greatest sequel of all time? without a doubt. the greatest movie of all time - i think the shawshank redemption may have something to say about that."

","He said ""I'll be back"", and he was, 11 years since the first film, James Cameron (Aliens, Titanic) directs the bigger sequel about the human looking machine, cyborg, returning from 2029. Another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has come to the past, 1991, and this time his mission is to protect the leader of the human resistance, age 13 John Connor (introducing Edward Furlong). The villain of the film this time is another machine, but the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) is not a cyborg, it is a shape-shifting liquid metal machine. When the Terminator finds John, and it follows John's order to get his mother, Sarah (Linda Hamilton) who is in a mental hospital, they start their run. Sarah doesn't trust the Terminator for a while, looking the same as the last, but she will. But the film does not involve just them on the run from the T-1000, but after Sarah attempts to kill the man mostly responsible for Skynet being created, Miles Dyson (Joe Morton), they plan to destroy the Cyberdyne building, to avoid the war, Judgement Day. Also starring Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman. The special effects, particularly for the T-1000 are extraordinary, the chase and action, i.e. guns and fights sequences are gripping, Hamilton is much more aggressive, Schwarzenegger is hard and lovable, and his goodbye is quite teary, and Cameron's direction is still fantastic. Another not great sequel followed in 2003. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Sound and Best Special, and it was nominated for Best Production Design. Arnold Schwarzenegger was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Terminator (Hero) was number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 76 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Hasta la vista, baby.""), it was number 77 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 32 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die.

I mean brilliant. To make such a movie you need lot of hard work, lot of money but On top of everything You need to be very very lucky. Such movies are not only made by creativity but also by accident. Pardon me for my English, but I don't know what is the correct substitute of this word Accident. I mean I can give this in Writing to JAMES CAMERON, that even he can't make any movie so perfect, or equivalent to this movie. I just can't describe my feelings for this movie."

","Sometimes sequels aren't as good as the films that came before them, I can assure you in the case of Terminator 2, this is not the case. Terminator 2 brings back some of the faces from the original terminator, notably Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger - who shine with their performances.<br/><br/>After the events of the first Terminator film we once again experience time travel and the need to protect the past (our present) to save the present (our future). John Connor is now a teenager; he will one day grown up to be the leader of the human resistance in a world where machine have almost wiped out humanity. A Terminator is sent back in time to kill him, but also another Terminator has been sent back in time to protect him. Playing the good guy this time, Arnie is the machine sent to protect him from Robert Patrick, a more advanced killing machine. What follows is a rip roaring action adventure chase film which pits man against machine and also machine against machine.<br/><br/>While the first film in this franchise was low budget, this film is a big budget blockbuster - everything is ramped up - effects, action, plot, performances and also in this film, the musical soundtrack which accompanies the film. Some of the action and effects in this film were top of the range and revolutionary in the 90's, some even look good in today's CGI heavy markets. This film marked a turning point for effects; you only have to watch the way a T1000 Terminator interacts with its surroundings to see some of the leaps forward this film brought. While the first film was a defining moment in sci-fi films, this film took that premise and ran with it, extending an already exceptional concept and lifting it onto a pedestal. I can't tell you how much I loved this film as a child - it's a cinematographic tour-de-force and hasn't deteriorated too much with age. This film has continued in spawning other cross platform media into its universe, it's continued in its quest to make something visually stunning and outstanding while delivering a compelling and fun story. If the first Terminator set the bar for excellence, then this film created a new notch onto which a new bar could be placed. I am happy to award this film a whopping 10 out of 10."

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","1","1","22 November 2019"," It goes without saying that Terminator 2 is sublime action cinema.
","***Spoilers ahead***<br/><br/>James Cameron struck pure gold when he made the first Terminator, and Terminator 2: Judgement Day is just as impressive as the first movie (if not more so). This sequel delivers everything a great sequel deserves and needs to accomplish: expand the world of the original work in a very natural, bold and ambitious way that explores the uncharted areas of the story. Judgement Day is to The Terminator franchise what The Empire Strikes Back is to Star Wars; and all the sequels that came after it one can try all they like, but they can't live up to THIS colossal masterpiece of sci-fi action.<br/><br/>Judgement Day is bucket-loads of fun, and it still holds up ridiculously well against more 'modern' cinema. It's films like these that are like fine wines; they get better with age it would seem. And when you revisit the film there's something you didn't notice the first time you saw it: re-watching a film this good is a rewarding and fulfilling experience, just like the film's premise of the T-800 saving John Connor from being assassinated by the T-1000. There's hardly anything pointless in the film's story: it's a microcosm on human volatility, machinery learning from humanity's worst impulses and applying said experience to improve upon its own purposes (good or bad) and that a cause worth fighting for (saving a life) is never a pointless endeavor.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is one of those rare flawless films that, in spite of being a 'genre-piece' from the 1990s, transcends most cinema of its ilk in ways that many films just don't seem to get: it's not genres that determine a good story (or film) but the essence of the experience you get from it and the overall impression it leaves on the audience that helps the film become a transcendent journey.<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgement Day has probably been judged countless times already, but who's to say that new incite is redundant when it comes to classic films like this? I'm not pretending I'm saying anything that hasn't already been said about Judgement Day, but my point is that it's still fun and insightful reviewing these movies on one's own terms. It all boils down to expressing our own experiences watching these things in full, and everyone's two-cents on a movie is different to the next. And that's what makes movie-watching so damn great.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 gets 5/5 stars: I could keep going on and on about why this film's great, but there's no need to keep going. I'll just let it speak for itself."

","Right from the first second, Arnold seems way more comfortable as a robot. Robin Patrick T-1000 is amazing from the start too. The score (including the amazing Guns and Roses song) helped to make the movie more fun, which aligned with Arnold's role as the good guy this time. Furlong was perfect for the typical 90's movies teenager rebel. And Linda Hamilton somehow was even better in this movie, being an amazing ""crazy"" badass. A set piece in the hospital is perfect.<br/><br/>Again, everything in the story is kind of tied up well (about time travel and the future, etc.).<br/><br/>The exposition and dialogue improved a bit (including a theme about machines as better than the fallible humans), but enough is still the weak part of the sequel. The detail or aspect that doesn't allowed it to be a perfect movie. Still, I think is a masterpiece in the action genre."
"thewoodmeister","9","1","1","6 November 2019"," The film that showed us how sequels should be done!
","There's no question about the influence this film has had on the film industry, one of the first films to really infuse cgi into a film and make it an integral part. It's held by many as a sci fi classic, and it is, one of the few sequels that's held in as high regard as the original. That said (and I'm going out on a limb here).....is it really as good as the original, or have some compromises been made?<br/><br/>I'm probably being a little controversial, and if I'd reviewed this film back when it was released it would more than likely been a solid 10/10, but I'm not. I'm reviewing this in 2019 when we've seen many sequels and I'm really reviewing it in the context of the whole saga.<br/><br/>So what does T2 get right? Well most things really, it picks up a few years after the original. John Connor is now an adolescent and his mum has been locked up due to her unwavering belief in judgment day. The story certainly has a lot of new space to play in and feels slightly less claustrophobic than the original.<br/><br/>We get a new Terminator, the T-1000 which is liquid metal, something that in its day was a visual treat as well as a more deadly threat. Robert Patrick really delivered in his role, making this threat less of a slow menacing shadow, and more of an agile, unpredictable and articulate hunter.<br/><br/>So what's my problem? Why 9/10? Well it's down to a couple of things.. firstly the T-800, yes Arnie is back, but he's been reprogrammed to be John Connor's protector in this film. Back when the film came out I know I loved this, a pet Terminator? What kid wouldn't love that? However looking back this was the start of the T-800 becoming child and family friendly. We never got the T-800 from the original back and I think that's a shame.<br/><br/>Secondly Edward Furlong. His acting can't be ignored, it's not good, it's distracting at best. Yes I'm being picky and maybe a little harsh but I feel it's the truth, and these are my main gripes that I'm taking a ""point"" away for.<br/><br/>So back to the good bits, the story arc and pace are spot on, I personally liked some of the scenes that were cut and feature in the special edition, the Kyle Reese dream sequence and the T-800 cpu scene and moral dilemma, but NOT the smiling scene! The special effects obviously, they were groundbreaking at the time and still hold up OK today.<br/><br/>It's a great fun sci fi action film and certainly lighter in tone that the original. A masterpiece and a classic yes, but when I look back I see that the series was never able to then go back to the darker more menacing roots, and I think that's a shame."

"Floated2","9","1","1","28 October 2019"," Different take on the original
","Watching this sequel after the original Terminator film and can see the differences between both films. Seven years after the original was released, this follow up does feel more ""family friendly"" and more ""Hollywood"" due to its much larger budget. The original was darker and we see Arnold's Terminator as the villain while in this movie they slightly changed (or modified) his character to be a hero.<br/><br/>Judgement Day is noticeably longer with more details to the plot and it does make it work. Though this movie does feel more watered down, to gear towards a wider audience (mainly with the addition of a child in John Connor playing a major role). His character is quite annoying with his constant cursing and his acting wasn't quite great.<br/><br/>Within the violence is still strong with weapons slicing through people's head at point blank and much shootouts and car/building explosions.<br/><br/>Although the concept was slightly confusing at points, mainly with the timelines and such but overall the film was thoroughly entertaining and has one thinking afterwards."

","Though its predecessor works best if its events are predestined, it also makes sense if they're constantly in flux, sending ripples through time to change the outcome of a future that previously seemed so certain. This is the premise for 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)', a sequel that decides to elaborate on a line (""the future is not set"") and a deleted scene from Cameron's 1984 classic. The result is a film that feels about as natural as possible for a follow-up to one of the most complete science-fictions of all time. It only retcons a couple of small, almost inconsequential elements. The decision to bring Schwarzenegger back as the 'good guy' could have been hokey, but it ends up as a distinct and inspired choice that also allows for an exploration of some fairly compelling themes. I don't think it works quite as well as having him as the villain, though. In general, the piece isn't anywhere near as tight as the first - in fact, it's quite baggy - and it feels almost as though its story is being found as it goes. The initial act is actually quite slow and, frankly, almost dull. There's also an extended segment in the second act which really slows the pace, despite having many interesting character moments and introducing what is, essentially, a well-developed 'side-plot' - which should have been the main focus throughout. I think this part feels so slow because, despite being engaging in its own right, it stops the flick's driving force, that being the extended chase with the T-1000, dead in its tracks. Once the final movement kicks in, the chase invigoratingly picks back up and the focus is placed wholly back on it, making the previous forty minutes seem like a bit of a detour. However, even though there are some issues with the storytelling and pacing, the picture is perhaps the king of set-pieces. There are several extended action scenes - each brought to life with amazing physical stunt-work and still-astonishing special effects (both practical and CG) - which stand out as some of the best in the genre. It's difficult to express just how far these sequences go in making the experience as enjoyable as it is; they compensate, in a way, for the piece's other flaws. It's a shame, then, that the thing is as slow and inconsistent as it is, as it could have been a downright masterpiece. Still, it's a phenomenal feat of filmmaking and a fantastically fun time as a whole. I wouldn't say it's as good as the first, but it's still one of the best examples of its genre. It's entertaining, exciting and every bit as action-packed as it's made out to be. 8/10"

","The sequel of The Terminator (1984) was way better than I expected. Because of the ratings in many websites like Rotten Tomatoes, the first one (100%) was rated higher than this one, the sequel (93%), also in Metacritic was the same, Terminator in 1984 got 84% and Judgment Day just got 75%. Metacritic rated so terribly. But in IMDb was fair. The Terminator Saga is one of the franchises that had its sequel better the the original like the Spider-Man Trilogy directed by Sam Raimi or the X-Men franchise.<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger was still T-800 but with a different mission. The last time we saw him as a villain, well in here he was sent to protect Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton)'s son, John Connor (Edward Furlong) who would lead an army to destroy the machines in the future. He was still a kid that time but his performance wasn't bad. He was great with different emotions and good acting. In here, I liked Hamilton's performance more than the previous film, she was a mother, a badass fighter and she was addicted to cigarettes. I also loved the way she looked but I didn't like the way she got drunk. Schwarzenegger just got much better. In here, there's a new villain called the T-1000 played by Robert Patrick, a better and more modern prototype. He could morph into liquid metal and used his hand as various weapons.<br/><br/>The way the CGI was edited was really awesome. The cinematography was great as well. It was filled with a lot of great and classic moments. The action sequence here was a lot better, especially the liquid metal (I've already mentioned that) and the battle between the good guys and the SWAT. The CGI was well-edited there with lots of shooting and explosions caused by Schwarzenegger's T-800.<br/><br/>The strong violence and sci-fi actions didn't really make this move deserve an R-Rated. It was totally safe for 13 and 14 year-olds. I didn't see anything too bloody, just T-800 cutting his arm, that's it. I really didn't like the idea the the whole Terminator Saga would be rated R. It's just sci-fi, actions and little violence. Nobody would be afraid, they're gonna like it. That's something I don't like about the movie and the rest of the Saga.<br/><br/>The final battle was extremely epic when T-1000 knocked down T-800 and then Sarah came to knock some of T-1000's ass. Then T-800 came up lying on a giant clockwork and holding a rifle that caused destruction shot at T-1000 and he fell into the lava (maybe?) and melted. The way the villain died was just so satisfying.<br/><br/>This is one of James Cameron's masterpieces of sci-fi. He got really good with the CGI and I'm looking forward to see the 3-D version of Judgment Day released in 2017 with better cinematography and maybe I could feel that I'm in there. This one was definitely my favorite of the Terminator Saga.<br/><br/>Ratings: 9.4/10"

"shakercoola","7","1","1","4 August 2018"," Spectactular special effects-laden sci-fi action film
","An American sci-fi thriller; The second film in the Terminator franchise used CGI technology to great effect and along with marvellous stunts and other visual effects helped make it a 'best in class' spectacle and a great genre film. It has an intriguing hero, a fierce heroine, and a young boy who is played with energy. One of the few false notes is that the story doesn't produce one single character to root for, and the ending doesn't make 'Sarah Connor' the hero prepared to terminate the machine herself despite everything.
The film has an interesting story, but to audiences it was a repeat premise of the Terminator (1984) - a boy has to be destroyed so that he doesn't grow up to be a revolutionary leader who would thwart the objective of an artificial intelligence computer network to bring about a nuclear war. Science paradoxes are rife - a higher intelligence in the future is the very end product of its time travelling mission so as to deduce in a femtosecond that it is futile logic.
That aside, we have a convincing central performance from its star once again, and stirring support from Linda Hamilton. Robert Patrick gives a menacing portrayal of the advanced machine out to stop the prevention of 'Judgment Day'. The pacing is good with some thought provoking narrative tight to the storyline which produces comical material in the Terminator-boy exchanges.
There are the usual car chases, explosions and fight scenes, all well done - and well directed in the big set pieces, but it is a film most memorable for the way the movie envisions a liquid metal human figure. Since technology has emerged in recent years able to mimic this effect in some small way makes Direcor James Cameron's vision quite remarkable.
Tension doesn't run quite as high as in the former film, where Arnold Schwarzenegger excelled in convincing us of a terrifying force and image, a diabolical killing machine seemingly incapable of being destroyed by humans, but it is in the special effects that this film soars to realise the vision of a high technology future and epic story of man vs thinking machine."

"caseynicholson","7","1","1","29 August 2015"," A Childhood Favorite--Not As Good Now, Though
","This movie was far and away my favorite film for several years after it was released. I was thirteen when the film hit theaters in 1991, and I had seen the original ""Terminator"" over and over again on VHS when I was a kid. Back then, ""T2: Judgment Day"" seemed like a huge improvement over its predecessor. The effects were much better, for one, and the storyline seemed more developed--and that's probably a true statement.<br/><br/>However, having watched both films this week, I can safely say that as an adult, I now find the first ""Terminator"" to be far superior to this sequel. The original movie has so much going for it in terms of just being a quality stand alone film. This sequel has its good qualities as well--it's still a good film, which is why I've given it 7/10 stars. <br/><br/>Still, seeing this film now, I'm able to see its flaws a bit more clearly. As good as it is, throughout the film I found myself surprised to imagine that it didn't seem too much better, quality wise, than a made-for-TV movie would today. Schwarzenegger's character still looks fake when the cyborg skeleton starts showing through his face in the final fight scene (although the part where the inner skeleton arm is revealed is pretty cool). That, and while there are plenty of big league action scenes in this movie, the light-hearted vibe of this movie--the witty banter mixed with things like George Thorogood's ""Bad to the Bone"" being part of the score--just makes this film a bit hard to take seriously. It's a film that was made to be a blockbuster that would appeal to all, whereas the original was a sci-fi/horror flick that happened to become a blockbuster because of its innate quality.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is still good and watchable. But I see it very differently at 37 than I did at 13. 7/10 stars."

","OK nobody ever imagine this movie i mean back in 1984 ""The Terminator"" really was categorized as a ""Class B"" movie i mean no one ever imagine that a ""Class B"" movie was going to be a bomb... literally So, following this mega hit, a sequel was inevitable and at the hands of James Cameron ""success"" is guaranteed OK this movie is one of the few best movies i've ever seen literally I've seen a lot of movies but a movie that ""merged"" my emotions with it? No man never... except this movie OK lets start: This a masterpiece i felt every emotion in here the adrenaline when Arnie rescues John in the truck chase all that adrenaline when he steps in front of the T-1000's truck just a few inches before the truck hits the wall and Arnie stretches his arm, grabs John and passes to its motorcycle is the best adrenaline scene i've ever seen Another scene the merged my emotions definitely when Arnie steps like a bad A(pip!) with the mini gun that scene is awesome!!! Also i felt like i was watching a football game screaming cheering ""Go Arnie GO! Come'on!"" when he says ""ill be back"" and walks being hit by the SWAT team shooting at him (i honestly was saying ""no come'on Arnie keep moving you can do it go go go come'on please don't give up) Then i honestly get angry when the T-1000 gives a smack to Arnie in the steel mill and impales him with the crowbar i said ""NOOO!!!!! Arnie no!!! (honestly i thought he was dead!!) then when the eye starts clicking i said ""Yeah come'on Arnie get up! You can do it!"" Finally yes, i was 10 when i saw it (now I'm 27) and yes i cried when Arnie self-destructs itself with the molten metal i cry i honestly cry in that part So a movie that merge with your emotions what can you say about that? A movie that gets to your heart it gets into you and leaves a mark... a masterpiece well done Cameron!!! Arnie rules (I don't care people say its a bad actors, gobernator or what ever) Arnie I'm with you... you said ""ill be back""... I'm waiting... always..."

And you will get tense during the action scenes as they really make you believe our protagonists are in mortal danger throughout.<br/><br/>Also we get to see well done character development you get to bond with these characters and that's something you don't see anymore. Along with this film giving us the famous catch praise of the 90s ""Hasta La Vista, Baby"" even now it is popular along with ""I'll be Back"". <br/><br/>James Cameron as the director for this film really did a excellent job with the direction of the film and he gave the film real credit and make it feel real throughout. Also the cast did a excellent job. <br/><br/>Linda as Sarah shows how much her character has change and we get to see her struggle with her past and inner pain and Linda's performance is far none. Arnold was born to play the Terminator he is the only person on Earth who could give justice to the role it is amazing how he could bring a Cyborg to the screen it just shows that Arnold was just the man for the job as The Terminator. Robert's performance as the T-1000 is both frighting and fantastic he just fit the role perfectly though he don't speak much his present alone is enough to make you fear him and I remember how scared I was of this character.<br/><br/>It just goes to show with the right cast you got yourself a masterpiece<br/><br/>Now I can't talk about the film without talking about the music which is one of my favorite scores of any movie every piece of music written for Terminator 2 just matches it story and feel. It just a terrific score plus the opening Theme for Terminator 2 sets the tone of what you will be seeing when the movie stars and even today I praise the opening song to Terminator 2. <br/><br/>It just so many good things came out of Terminator 2 that it's hard not to call it one of your favorite films and one of the best sequels ever made because this film deliver. The Terminator said he would be back and he came back in a big way. <br/><br/>Terminator 2 is a must have for any action film fan, Sci/fiction fan or any fan of movies in general because this my friends is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I give Terminator 2: Judgement Day a superb 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Hasta La Vista, Baby I'll be Back ."
"Vontoria","10","1","1","24 July 2015"," A sci-fi masterpiece
","Terminator 2 was one of my favourite movies growing up as a kid, and I didn't even understand it. Re-watching it now, makes me understand that without this movie, science fiction would not be the same as it is today. I don't even know where to start, the action is amazing, the frightening terminator in the first film was an achievement in itself for action, however, having two terminators, with vastly different abilities, was just fantastic. Even Sarah Connor kicked ass in this movie, as the badass mentor for John Connor. Schwarzenegger was the best part of this movie, his bond with John was a beautiful thing to see, and the humour was excellently portrayed in every character, it was always used when appropriate, and didn't shy away the seriousness of the plot. Speaking of the plot, T2 delves considerably deeper into the origin of Skynet, and explores a lot more moral issues than the first movie did. The villain of the movie, the T-1000, was portrayed excellently by Robert Patrick, this is one of those villains that doesn't have a disturbing physical appearance, but is frightening simply because of what he is capable of. This dynamic really helped to increase the stakes this time around, truly showing that John is crucial to the plot, and having him be a helpless kid made the T- 1000 an even more imposing antagonist. James Cameron did a particularly good job directing this movie. Every shot was clear, which allowed the action to be made more prominent on screen, and generally improved the viewing experience. The acting was also great, I was actually surprised at how good Edward Furlong's performance was, as he was quite young at the time. The CGI in T2 was fantastic for it's time, and still holds up today. In fact, I'd go as far to say it's actually BETTER looking than a lot of movies today, now that's an achievement. It also wasn't overused, which is a great sight to see, as the use of stunts and practical effects makes the movie so much more believable. <br/><br/>I don't want to say any more about T2 just in case I spoil it, if you haven't watched this movie, watch it right now before anything else, it is a perfect movie, everything about it just works. It is truly an experience to be had."

It is a wonder this movie did not receive more Oscars or nominations for that matter.<br/><br/>The story, including the paradoxical time traveling, is perfectly presented to the viewer. The movie flows naturally from one scene to another and throws the first and third Terminator through the walls with ease.<br/><br/>The ambiance, with amazingly chosen music, is empowering the feeling and presence. Acting, combined seamlessly with the visual effects, is making the world vivid.<br/><br/>Locations, lights, and props, along with costumes etc. are all better than well suited.

"zardoz-13","10","1","1","11 July 2015"," The Best Terminator Movie!!!
","Sequels rarely surpass originals, but ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" provides the exception to the rule. Writer & director James Cameron has outdone himself with this follow-up film to his seminal sci-fi, time travel, yarn about men and machines. In the original, a Cybernetic organism classified a Terminator appeared from the future to execute Sarah Connor, while the mankind resistance army of the future dispatched a warrior back to 1984 to save Sarah from certain death. Kyle Reese showed up and helped Sarah kill the Terminator. Nevertheless, although our heroine managed to survive the nightmarish ordeal and have a baby before she hightailed it to Mexico, Cyberdyne Systems acquired the forearm of the Terminator that she killed in the machine press and Sarah eventually wound up locked away in custody at the Pescadero Mental Hospital. Miraculously, Sarah's ten-year son John Connor (Edward Furlong in his first role) has been farmed out to foster parents, Janelle (Jenette Goldstein) and Tod Voight (Xander Berkeley), but is living the life of a low-grade hoodlum ripping off automated teller devices at banks when another Terminator designated a T-1000 (Robert Patrick) shows up to kill him. Unlike the enemy Terminator in ""The Terminator,"" the T-1000 is a highly advanced model that consists of liquid metal and can alter its shape. Essentially, the T-1000 is far more formidable than the earlier Terminators, and it gives our heroes a run for their money. As it turns out, the Resistance has rewired a T-800 (Model 101) Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger of ""Red Sonja"") and sent him back to 1995 to protect John. The outcome is a thoroughly exciting action thriller that raises the stakes where the villainous Terminators are concerned. Cameron and co-writer William Wisher have supplemented the plot with some humor as young John Connor helps the Terminator fit into society by saying familiar phrases. The T-1000 is a truly menacing adversary for our heroes and they have to keep on blasting away at it because it can repair itself in no time. As Sarah Connor, Linda Hamilton has undergone a transformation from being a vulnerable waitress to being a lean, mean doll who fights the Terminator. Initially, when John and the T-101 show up at the mental asylum, they have to battle the T-1000 and escape by the hair of their chin. You won't find a better sci-fi actioneer than ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" and some of the dialogue is funny."
"thescribe7","8","1","1","19 April 2015"," One of the Greats
","What I love about this is... everything really. The catchphrases, the kid that isn't annoying as s**t, and of course the Terminator himself. The first film rocked and intrigued me. There isn't much to say that hasn't been said.What I like is how many times you can just sit back and watch it. It's always entertaining. <br/><br/>I'll try to explain why this works in the way I do best: comparisons. What did this get right that Terminator 3 didn't? The story. Terminator 2 feels pretty conclusive but a story can be pulled out of anything. What makes Terminator 2 stand out is that it offers a triumphant, yet a little down ending. Terminator 3 just feels down. Terminator 3 doesn't have a niche going for it.<br/><br/>Terminator 4 just feels blah. It looks even more boring than Transformers. Terminator 4 is just something you forget about. Terminator 2 sticks out because of its epic tone and heart. Terminator 4 offers nothing. Not a niche. Not a soul. Not even fun action. Terminator 2 you can just chill and watch stuff blow up while also cracking a smile at the remarks.<br/><br/>What makes this stand out from all the Transformers flicks is the fact that the action is intense.The action is everywhere to the point where you don't know what's going on. Terminator 2 let's you see what's happening and it let's you know how it feels!<br/><br/>Why Terminator Genisys or whatever it's called is going to suck because you can see it's trying to look and feel like the second one. They've got all the lines and they've got all the gimmicks in the trailer. But what are gimmicks are merely gimmicks. The people who made Terminator 2 knew it would work because it was different and exciting. You know Terminator Genisys won't work because the creators are just relying on something that they know has worked before but don't really know why. And to be honest, Terminator 2 is conclusive."

Post that i have watched this movie almost 18-20 times over and over again on TV, on VCD's, on my Laptop and have not been bored a single time. This is for sure director James Cameron's and Arnold's best movie as per me. Arnold's portrayal of a cyborg from the future is top notch and all credit to Cameron for the superb casting. Edward Furlong too has played his part with elan. And what to say about Robert Patrick as T-1000, he was the best.<br/><br/>The dialogues are so memorable and stylish and the dialogue delivery is so amazing.

As simple as the story may seem, the amount of characters and subplots going on still forces you to contemplate on what's really happening.

It opened up my eyes, and even at the tender age of 9, made me realize what I wanted to do with my life: I wanted to make movies, and I wanted to make movies like ""T2"". <br/><br/>As I'm watching the film, I glance over at another patron and this woman, her eyes wide, was gripping the arms of her chair so tightly I thought they were going to break.

"GanzEhrlich","9","1","1","24 July 2014"," Spectacular Sequel that symbolises sci-fi movies of the early 1990s
","One day when I was 13 I purchased a copy of T3 and watched that same evening. Inspired, I promptly bought T2 the very next day, knowing it was a massive box-office hit when it was released in cinemas back in 1991. It didn't leave much of a long-term impact on me, but at least I can say I watched one of the greatest, if not the greatest, sequels in science-fiction history.<br/><br/>After failing its mission in T1, another model of the T-800 class sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of resistance leader John Connor in the first film before John is even born, is this time sent to protect John, now having become a rebellious adolescent with less-than-pleasant foster parents living in 1990s LA, while Sarah is stuck in what is effectively an asylum, often found working out, preparing for the next encounter with the machines.<br/><br/>Another Terminator is also sent back to kill John Connor, and if you thought the T-800 from the first movie was hardcore, the T-1000 is even more of a mean machine. Not only does it possess the murderous super-strength of the T-800, but it is also made of colour-changing liquid metal, so that like X-Men's Mystique, it can transform into any adult-sized human being and assume its identity, while the T-800 is stuck (unashamedly) in Arnie mode.<br/><br/>The battle between the two robots from the future will ultimately, indirectly, decide the fate of humanity. While the T-1000 kills anything which stands in his way, the T-800 not only protects John (and will also protect other people, since it will only obey John's orders) but also acts like a father figure towards the boy, since John's biological father, Kyle Reese, sacrificed himself at the climax of T1, before John Connor was even born. This is one of a few ways in which this movie is revolutionary.<br/><br/>The CGI visual effects, for 1991, were unbelievable for audiences back then. They made the T-1000's abilities look so real, so scary, but damn cool and made the movie appear to be so far ahead of its time. Terminator 2 won 4 Academy Awards, including best Sound Effects and Visual Effects (Zero surprise there...). <br/><br/>As for the cast, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the perfect role for the robotic cyborg that is the T-800. The not as well known Robert Patrick is equally chilling as the T-1000, while Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor and dÃ©butante Edward Furlong as Sarah's son John provide very intense performances as the human protagonists. As it turned out, for the four actors mentioned, the film would arguably mark the prime of each of their careers.<br/><br/>Although the film will be a harmless experience for most adults, it can become a bit too bleak. Being a squeamish fellow, some features of the movie were disturbing for me when I saw T2 aged 13 (Judgement Day has an R rating in America and a 15 rating in the UK), such as the way the T-1000 brutally murders people with his morphing liquid metal body, or the petrifying 'nuclear nightmare' scene. I spent days, if not more than that, a little haunted by what I had watched. But I watched without regret. When the T-800 stated 'I'll be back' in the first movie, he did indeed come back. With a bang, just like this film.<br/><br/>5 star+"
"GeorgeRoots","8","1","1","11 July 2014"," Big Blockbuster Sequel Done Right.
","The special effects are incredible. It's funny how I said that as a kid over a decade ago, and that still ultimately sums up the movie for me. James Cameron pioneered an incredible franchise on a shoestring budget, and to see what he's capable of with a large sum doesn't end up sacrificing too much of the series quality.<br/><br/>Considering how tense the direction of the first movie was by being a slasher ""Tech-Noir"" movie, that was slapped with an 18 rating. ""T2"" ended up a 15, mostly to what I imagined as getting as many people in the seats as possible. Which is fair enough as they finally put big money into the picture. I bring this up because ultimately I saw this one first as a kind of ""initiation"", to be able to convince my parents to let me see the first one.<br/><br/>Well age has hardened me, and I have to admit this movie still remains a classic. But I began to prefer the likes of the first movie more over time. Edward Furlong infuriates me now as an adult, and Linda Hamilton puts in a very well albeit over acted performance. It's obvious from the start both Arnold Schwarzenegger & Robert Patrick will have to hold the movie together, and they really do. Both characters become titans, and the make up effects be it real or digital is just insane.<br/><br/>What can I say about the plot? Bad terminator comes from future to kill John Connor, so bad terminator from first movie gets reprogrammed into good terminator to save him. In their way stands motorways, mental hospitals, corporations and steel mills. Stick in some ""Guns & Roses"", and it all absurdly works. Other than that, it's wonderful and silly but it feels overall smart. This is a great bar to what blockbusters should be, and James Cameron constantly manages to reinvent his filmography without having to rely on too many old tricks. They even adapted it into a highly rated theme park ride for gods sake.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It was a movie that made me want to make robots as a kid, and one of those sequels which really define the genre. 8/10."

Maybe start from number one and watch them through, it is worth it but like i said i personally think number two is the better of them all.<br/><br/>Well worth a 9 / 10."

","Let me start of by saying, this movie is far from good, it's far from great and exceptional, it's a masterpiece the whole world should know about. I've seen this movie about 10-13 times in the last year and a half and I can never find anything wrong with it. The acting has gotten better since the first, the storyline is incredible and it all just pleases me in every way. If you haven't seen this film yet then hurry up and watch it because if you don't then boy are you missing out. I am officially awarding this movie a 10/10, and that for the opening credits. The full movie gets a bloody 11/10 and if that score or this review does not persuade you enough to see Cameron's best film, then well, you've got problems."
"awesomesteinberg","10","1","1","31 December 2013"," A Sci-Fi Masterpiece, Cameron at his Best
","Wow. Just, wow. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And I am taking into account that I have seen many good ones, as well as the fact that this movie is over 20 years old and STILL holds up.<br/><br/>Okay, so this movie is a continuation of 1984's The Terminator, where a cyborg from the future is sent back through time to kill Sarah Connor, whose unborn son John will in the future lead the human resistance against the machines that wiped out most of mankind. (Also a very good movie, especially at making its budget seem ten times bigger than it really is) In T2, however, once John is ten years old, a new terminator, the T-1000, is sent back to kill John, but the model from the first film is reprogrammed for good and is sent back to protect John.<br/><br/>Every single actor in this movie is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger may not show any emotional range, but that is why he is so perfect for the T-800. He's a robot, he's not supposed to have feelings! Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, she was great in the first one and is just as good here too, where you really believe she's a different person than she was in the last movie but still the same character, as well as all the stress she is going through. Robert Patrick as the T-1000, both scary and hard-to-see-as-evil, blah blah blah, you hear it all the time about this movie. (Although I think the special effects play just as big of a role in his character) And Edward Furlong as John Connor, although he is a bit of a jerk at first, after awhile you really latch onto his character a lot more. He is probably the best child actor I've seen in a movie.<br/><br/>And the script and directing for this movie are fantastic. The film is very nicely paced. James Cameron really knows how to grab your interest and never let go. T2 is very exciting, intelligent, and even emotional. It is absolutely engaging for the entire run time. And honestly, can you find a single plot hole or something that doesn't make sense? Nope, didn't think so. (Did I mention Cameron directed, produced and co-wrote this movie? All that work and it still comes out flawless!) But of course, the most memorable aspects of this movie are the action and special effects. The action sequences are astounding. They are extremely well done and very realistic, and still feel like they progress the plot. And the special effects are amazing, a perfect blend of stunts, practical effects and CGI. The visuals used for the T-1000 are absolutely incredible. This movie was extremely ahead of its time, especially considering the technology to create computer-generated characters was only created two years before, and its advancement in such a short time. And without this movie, we wouldn't have Jurassic Park, The Lord of the Rings, The Matrix (Possibly), the Star Wars prequels (Okay, not so good), etc.<br/><br/>So overall, amazing amazing amazing. This movie is awesome in every respect. It is easily in my top 10 favorite films, I give it a 10/10."

","I watched this movie 8 years ago for the first time. And its excitements haven't changed at all. And it's getting more interesting than Terminator 1. In 2029, the robots are dominating the world and destroy the human. They try to kill the human resistant's leader, John Conner as well as the previous work. The two terminators came from the Sky Net and the human resistance and the battle over the Conner's life begin. The highlight of this film is the last scene. In the last scene Arnold Schwarzenegger has killed at once, but he restarts and goes to protect Conner. He fights without one arm. Whole the scenes of the film are quietly interesting and exciting. If you haven't watched it, you must watch it. If you can, you should watch the first work before watching 2. You will understand deeply and make the film more interesting. Even if you can't, it's interesting enough."
"yk-88","8","1","1","1 October 2013"," Scary
","In this film, two terminators are appeared. One is the same person as the first one. The new terminator is trying to catch ""John"" who is the son of the woman who appeared on the previous one. This strong terminator also looks like human, but actually he is made by metal, so he is not killed easily. The previous terminator must save John. Can he succeed to save him? How do they try to kill the new one? Through this film, I felt a little bit fear, because so many people are killed by guns. I should not do, but since I watched the first terminator, I cannot help comparing these two. They have lots of similarities even the story is different. If you will see this, please try to look for some similarities. I wrote the same thing on the review of the first terminator, but there are some grotesque scenes. It is very interesting to watch, but please be careful. The reason why I think it is grotesque is that the way to express how scary is very good. I think people can enjoy watching it because the quality is high.Of course I enjoyed it too."

","In 1995, eleven years after the events of The Terminator, John is ten years old and living in Los Angels with foster parents. His mother Sarah had been preparing him throughout his child food for his future role as the leader of the human Resistance against Skynet, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a computer factory and remembered to a hospital. <br/><br/>First I think this movie is so cool!! It is good idea that the Terminator is support the John. And the idea that computer can disguised the person is nice idea, too. Second I liked the new terminator's running form is funny, and scared. this movie is full of thrilling."
"marais-alexander","10","1","1","26 September 2013"," James Cameron's genuinely emotional film
","In some ways, I see James Cameron and Steven Spielberg as very similar creatures. Both project expansive, extraordinary visions (Spielberg seems more caught up in character while Cameron, equally as invested, is a little more interested in expansive special effects) that while thrilling on an overall scale are often a bit too sentimental which takes away from the overall film. This is not the case with the timelessly bombastic Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Out of all of Cameron's films, the emotional aspect here is really excellent because it's subtle. A great example of this emotional subtlety is the crying scene where Arnie asks a young Edward Furlong what's wrong with his eyes. Classic. The more obvious and over-the-top scenes of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escaping a creepy treatment center are well-acted too, devoid of sentimental music. Just gritty, and unfortunate, reality here. On top of this emotional subtlety comes the action, so when the scenes intended to make the tears start rolling start rolling, the tears genuinely can start rolling. 10/10."
"albnadia","Null","1","1","14 September 2013"," Awesome sequel!
","I definitely prefer this to the original! I don't like calling the sequel to Terminator a better movie, but it is, to me. For Schwarzenegger fans, you will enjoy him in this. For fans of little boys (no) that invoke similar feelings of immense frustration (still no) that Carl Grimes does, you will like John Connor here. Being a child actor in 1991 shouldn't be an excuse, but there it is. Honestly, Linda Hamilton is the main reason to watch this movie, for the majority of viewers. She is insanely hot, despite being a woman with violent tendencies committed to a psychiatric facility (actually that may be part of the reason). The new terminator model is a great twist to the story, also."
"raphaklopper","10","1","1","7 September 2013"," When he say ""I'll b back"" he wasn't kidding.
","OK, that's the thing with James Cameron, when he announces something it takes almost a decade to come out (still waiting for Avatar 2 and 3). Same thing with ""The Terminator: Judgment Day"", after the great success of ""The Terminator"" Cameron received letters and desperate requests to he make a sequel and then he promised he would. 6 years have passed, Cameron had time to do the Excellent ""Aliens"" and the underrated ""The Abyss"", and finally in 1991 came this film, and every minute of the wait was worth it! ""The Terminator: Judgement Day"" is still considered one of the best sequels ever made, not by critics who said that was not even at the level of his predecessor, but by fans who won over the years. Cameron made both classic films totally different, and unforgettable !<br/><br/>The story begins 10 years after the events of the 1st movie and we found Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrested in a rehabilitation clinic accused of attacks of madness and visions with killer robots and the end of the world to come thanks to a nuclear war. On the other side of the story we have John Connor (Edward Furlong), the prodigal son of Sarah Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines, a rebellious and troublemaker boy living with adoptive parents (the characteristics of a true leader, nothing like a suffered childhood to build a strong warrior). But as in the first, a killing machine was sent to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of John, in this one a machine is sent to assassinate John, this work is now up to an advanced model of Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). But just like in the 1st film, the resistance sends someone to protect him in this one, not a beautiful blonde soldier this time but a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger).<br/><br/>In the 1st movie, Cameron picked sci - fi and action elements evolving them, here he takes on its own material and evolves it to a new level. The critics considered that a more expensive copy, but fans considered a MAGNIFICENT recycling taking everything bigger and bolder. While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute .<br/><br/>From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films).<br/><br/>Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (like I said, recycling at its best). But it was not just the action that had a huge evolution, but also the stunning visual effects that the film contains (and very advanced for its time).<br/><br/>In levels of performances, Schwarzenegger after the 1st film he entered on the map, on this one he definitely gets to be the iconic face of the action genre; Linda Hamilton in the first was a fragile waitress seeing her life suffering from a huge changeover, in this one she became the human exterminator, showing that after the death of her love one she had to learn how to survive alone (and very well by the way).<br/><br/>Many fall trying to decide which Cameron's Terminator is the best, for me is hard to say which is above the other. Both have completely different tones and many different aspects and both truly unforgettable, and both received the same title of being the best action movie ever made but Cameron showed that it could be much more than that. With superb performances, stunning visuals and breathtaking action, both ""Terminators"" are both classics to be remembered forever!<br/><br/>10/10"
"elgronko","10","1","1","29 August 2013"," ""We're not going to make it, are we? - People, I mean.""
","There are a lot of very entertaining movies out there, and everyone likes that feeling you get when the credits roll at the end of a good flick. But no matter how many times I see it, ""Terminator 2"" is one of the very few films that leaves me feeling something quite unusual - a sense of absolute awe.<br/><br/>I mean, the scale of this movie! You have trucks chasing bikes, helicopters chasing trucks, shootouts, huge explosions; a liquid metal man, a nuclear holocaust, a laser battle in the future; ruminations on the nature and future of humanity; sacrifice, redemption, hope. It's just huge. <br/><br/>The pacing is terrific: after an absolutely breakneck first hour, the audience is given time to breathe while the characters reflect on their situation in deeply ruminative scenes in the Mojave desert, before a surprising, action-packed and ultimately moving finale. The lighting and colour grading add to the impact - the many night scenes in Los Angeles are given a slick blue sheen, offering a contrast between the threatening urban environment and the warm colours of the desert. The editing is fast enough to be appropriately exciting while never becoming frenetic or confusing.<br/><br/>The music and sound design are impeccable. The T-1000's leitmotif really heightens the creepiness of the character. The gentle acoustic guitar in the desert sequence is both beautiful and ominous, and the Main Title theme is simply one of the greatest pieces of music I've ever heard. Sound design is such an overlooked discipline: I'm certain the average moviegoer has no idea that every footstep, every engine rumble and almost every word of dialogue is replaced during post-production. Here it's perfect, and filled with nice artistic touches such as the extra reverb on Sarah's scream when she first sees Arnie.<br/><br/>Even people who don't like this film have to agree that the effects are spectacular, and I've still never seen such convincing use of CGI. I recently found out why: in many cases, CGI was used to provide a smooth transition between real-life animatronic models of the T-1000 in various states of decimation, provided by the workshop of effects genius Stan Winston. The ethos was that if it could be done ""in camera"", it should - a creed I wish more film-makers followed. It just looks so much better and so much more convincing.<br/><br/>It's surprising to find an action film so affecting. The nuclear holocaust, which inspired a reaction along the lines of ""awesome"" when I first saw it at thirteen, is a scene that as an adult and father I now find truly bloodcurdling and terrifying. Sarah's assassination attempt on Dyson, and John's efforts to stop her, always make a deep impression (""Haven't you figured out why you can't just go around killing people?"" Quite so) and I'm not ashamed to say that I've shed a few tears watching Dyson stare into the barrel of Sarah's gun.<br/><br/>Everything leads up to the final payoff. I get chills just thinking of the final monologue, delivered over footage of a highway at night, before the credits roll over that epic Main Title theme. It's just an astonishing piece of work, a true masterpiece, hands-down my favourite action film and in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. Two thumbs up for T2!"

The fighting I thought was great, seeing on in the first movie it is a machine vs. human while in this one it is a liquid metal terminator vs a T-101. I love how Arnold was not to buffed up for this movie. It made him more human and relatable to the audience. Please check this movie out then you will agree.

Great liquid metal special effect. Gripping score. Riveting story that just won't let you go. Imaginative background and settings, just like the first one. Tight suspense.

By that time, Arnold Schwarzenegger had acquired enough polish to really give some dimension to his machine role, especially one who can learn. Linda Hamilton shed off some of her beauty to better portray an action role, and she did great being finally mature as an actress. Edward Furlong was perfect and very natural as the young John Connor even if it wasn't probably very far from who he was at the time. Robert Patrick played his role so well, that it took years for him to shake it up and play any other with credibility.<br/><br/>The bad. A few minor logical flaws and awkward projection screen, but that's it!<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. A sci-fi masterpiece. A must for everyone.<br/><br/>Personal note.

","When this movie came out, people still went to movie theatres to watch movies and computers were just starting to be an integral part of movie making. This was an instrumental time in the progression of digital effects and James Cameron used it to full effect.<br/><br/>Cameron began with a very strong screenplay continuing the story of our hero Sarah Connor and introducing her son John Connor, the saviour of the human race against the machines, as a young man. <br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger was reluctant to resume his role in a sequel because of his experience in Conan the Destroyer which he felt was an inferior movie to Conan the Barbarian but was convinced by Cameron to accept the role. The screenplay introduced the Arnold Terminator as a good guy and a new version of the Terminator as the foe and improved killing machine.<br/><br/>Great dialogue, action and emotional content contributed to the success of the film and has kept it relevant and watchable 30 years later."
"Mr-Fusion","7","1","1","18 April 2013"," A worthy sequel and pretty cool action movie
","I was a kid when ""Terminator 2"" came out, and I remember that Summer vividly. It was everywhere; the Subway marketing campaign, the Guns 'n Roses song, even the action figures. It didn't occur to me that this movie would hold nostalgia value, but . . . well, there you go. <br/><br/>There are a few reasons why ""Terminator 2"" doesn't deliver as much enjoyment for me as the first film; I was never that hot on the score, especially the chase scenes; the T-1000 is a much better effect than a opposing force, it (and Patrick) lacks the unstoppable stalker quality and scare that Schwarzenegger had in '84; Linda Hamilton's narration is a bit much (we can see why she's brooding without hearing her tell us why); and the dialog in between action spectacles is so low-key and done in whispers (usually the ones involving Hamilton) that it tends to slow things down. <br/><br/>But the movie (for the most part) makes up for these with its novel sci-fi invention and terrific action scenes:<br/><br/>1. The shotgun in the rose box (just a great image) <br/><br/>2. The showdown in the mall hallway <br/><br/>3. The truck chase through the canals <br/><br/>4. The entire Cyberdyne sequence (and a great location pick for that office building)<br/><br/>Cameron makes an interesting contrast between the sun-drenched Los Angeles daytime with the cold blue steel palette of the night scenes. And regardless of the film's lesser points, this is a movie with its own look, style and enough excitement to keep anyone interested in its nightmare war-ravaged future. <br/><br/>It's still not Cameron's best, but it's also no ""Avatar"".<br/><br/>7/10"

","4/4<br/><br/>Some people believe that the second Terminator movie is overrated.

I can't specifically tell you but you will be amazed how the character development is in this film. Arnold Shwarzenneger's performance can really in a way be more important to this character development. This makes all the characters important, and how previous events with the previous characters are impacted and make the movie work. <br/><br/>The villain is also great making you not know where he's going to pop up. <br/><br/>All this can fit together to make the perfect science fiction action film."
"zootaman","10","1","1","8 February 2013"," The greatest sequel of all time!
","What can I say about this film, it's got to be my favourite film of all time! Based on the fact that I've seen in countless times and could quite happily watch it again right now and again next week! Most certainly the greatest sequel of all time. In 78 years, this is the only sequel to win an Academy Award when the previous movie wasn't even nominated. It is the only Terminator film to win (or be nominated for) an Oscar. It won 4 (and was nominated for 2 others).<br/><br/>I saw it when it first came out, in 1991 when I was only 13. It blew me away, so far ahead of it's time, there was nothing even close in terms of action and visual effects, it was the first film to have a production budget of more than $100,000,000 dollars. You've got to remember that as I write this, the film is 22 years old already.<br/><br/>I really, really struggle to find a bad thing to say about this film...... John Connor's bike has too many gears??!! It was a terrible waste of milk when John Connor's foster parents were murdered?!! <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it already (where have you been??!), it's unlikely to have the same impact as watching it in 1991, however still watch it!"
"Al_The_Strange","10","1","1","4 February 2013"," ""There's no fate but for what we make for ourselves.""
","The first Terminator film presented the unique concept of a robot killer sent back through time to assassinate a specific target to affect the outcome of a futuristic war. Even though the characters overcame the terminator, Judgment Day still beckoned. Nuclear war is coming. Robots will march over the dead and annihilate the living. They are still looking to alter the past to win over the future.<br/><br/>T2 hits the ground running with a similar plot structure as the first film: a terminator appears to terminate somebody, and another figure appears to protect the target. This time, the protector is a terminator reprogrammed to be the good guy. While there is plenty of fighting and chasing, what follows is not just another retread, and it's not all about running away from the threat. This time, the characters turn the tables with massive firepower to try and change the future. This makes for a number of impressive action setpieces: the attack on Cyberdyne Systems is a loud, explosive splurge of mass carnage. The final showdown in the steel mill is a thrilling and iconic sequence, especially when it shows the epic smackdown between the two terminators. Various sequences here and there are just as exciting. It's all made even more memorable and innovating for featuring the T-1000: a terminator made entirely of liquid metal, which is not only a great feat in special effects, but also one of the most menacing villains in cinema.<br/><br/>There is a ton of big action in the film, making it a satisfyingly badass experience. It's made even better with a solid plot structure, and a cast of deep, well-developed characters. Sarah Connor is fully fleshed-out at this point, as a heroine who is both hardened and traumatized by the events of the first film. Despite being a little annoying, John Connor shows enough heart to be relate-able. Even the terminator himself is humanized to a point. All the characters show remarkable pathos, and combined with the story, they serve to underscore key themes concerning humanity's destructiveness. By the film's end, the message is clear: the future is not written, and it's up to us to determine our own destiny.<br/><br/>The film looks very slick and stylish, with photography that's steady, but also moves in thrilling ways. Editing is superb. Acting is great: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton return to offer great performances, while Edward Furlong does the best he can (despite being a little annoying with his constantly-cracking voice) and Robert Patrick does his best to be menacing. Writing is good, in my opinion. This production spares no expense on the sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is pretty cool at times.<br/><br/>Highly recommended! 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"

","Not only is Judgement Day a non-stop thrill ride, it carries a message for all of humanity at a memorable time in history. The Cold War was at it's end. John Connor actually makes mention of this ""Aren't they our friends now?"" (referring to the Russians) in conversation with the Terminator.<br/><br/>The final words of the movie left me with chills. I think it went something like this. 'If a machine can begin to learn the value of human life... maybe we can too'.<br/><br/>In an uncertain world full of terrorist threats and nuclear weaponry it is conceivable that a nuclear holocaust similar to that of Judgement Day could occur. This message and James Cameron's brilliant direction of the movie blew me away. I am happy he did not direct any more movies in the ongoing Terminator Saga. He did what countless other directors fail in doing, I am talking about the sequel rivaling the original.<br/><br/>Another scene I will mention is the one where the two children are pointing toy guns at each other arguing who shot the other first. The remarks made after that went something like 'we may very likely be the cause of our own demise' (loosely speaking).<br/><br/>Great movie. Non-stop and creative action, and a message that is FAR deeper than the unforgettable catchphrase 'Hasta la vista baby!'."

","Terminator 2 was a ground breaking movie as far as taking a gigantic jump forward in what you were capable of doing with CGI technology at the time. The entire T-1000 version of the Terminator would not have been able to take place without this new technology. The movie holds up so well even after being almost 20 years since it's release, the special effects don't like dated at all.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to the Terminator franchise here only this time his character of the T-800 has been programmed to protect John Connor. Linda Hamilton is also back but she's no longer the scared and weak Sarah Connor but the hardened tough as nails version you see here in this movie. John Connor is added to the franchise here but with him being 12 years old he's still learning what it takes to be a leader, he's played by Edward Furlong in his debut film. Robert Patrick is the hunter in this movie as he plays the much more advanced Terminator the 1-100 who can shape shift and take on the appearance of other characters."
"Marc_Action","9","1","1","29 January 2012"," Classic Action/Sci-Fi
","I saw this the other day on cable for like the millionth time. That's when you know a movie is great - if you can watch it again and again over the years and it's still just as exciting each time as it was the first time. It's hard to believe this movie is now 20 years old, but its special effects and use of CGI actually hold up better than most of the over-budget garbage that passes for action/sci-fi these days.<br/><br/>In the original Terminator (1984) Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) kills off the cyborg-assassin (Arnold Schwarzenegger) sent from the year 2029 to take her out. Of course, she had the help of the young, handsome Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to help her. He was sent back from the same year by Sarah's future son, John Connor. In the future, John is apparently the leader of a human resistance movement gaining momentum against the machines, who have taken over Earth and unleashed apocalyptic hell on mankind. The machines' system (dubbed Skynet) thought it could send the terminator back in time to kill off Sarah, which would erase John from existence, and thus would wipe out the resistance. It fails to do that, and with that, makes room for a sequel.<br/><br/>Now, if you can get past the whole butterfly effect and the grandfather paradox that makes a lot of what happens in this franchise highly unlikely, then you'll be able to appreciate just how great the first two movies were. T2 for its part, is even better than the original. It picks up 11 years after the events of the first movie, to 1995 (interesting that T2 is set a few years in the future from its release year 1991, while the original was set in then-present day 1984).<br/><br/>This time around the sweet, innocent Sarah Connor is replaced by a much more militant, yet psychologically-disturbed female warrior. John Connor is a rebellious teen that still doesn't realize the gravity of his future, and Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator. Only this time, he's been programmed by the Resistance to protect John. Why? Because Skynet is sending a more advanced Terminator to kill Connor as a teen. Robert Patrick does an excellent job as the new T-1000, ice cold one moment, then able to speak like a charismatic human when it suits its purpose, something the old Terminator cannot do. The T-1000 also can shape-shift into various stabbing weapons and other people.<br/><br/>It's great to see Arnie back but fighting on the good side. He's not the best actor in the world, or even a close second, but this genre suits him. And when he has great material to work with, he will shine. Hamilton also gives an excellent performance here. There are very few females that can pull off the action heroine role and be 110% convincing. Like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, I wouldn't want to run into Sarah in a dark alley.<br/><br/>As great as the film is, it is not without its faults. As I've said earlier, based on our current knowledge of the laws of physics, time travel to the past to kill someone presents a number of problems, and none of those issues were properly addressed by the franchise. But then it is sci-fi, so pretty much anything can be forgiven in this genre. Also, I think the factory scene at the end of T2 was too convenient and way too reminiscent of the original movie. A little bit more originality for the ending please! Otherwise a great movie and a collector's item."
"os_rox","10","1","1","13 December 2011"," My Favorite Movie Of All Time (beware Spoilers ahead)
","Not very often does a sequel manage to surpass the original this is one of those times.Quite simply put never, will Cinema witness a better example of Sci Fi and Action brilliance a true masterpiece.I watched this movie for the first time when I was around 7 years old almost 12 years and over 150 viewings on each viewing still manages to send shivers down my spine. While many people credit Jurassic Park as the movie that revolutionized CGI and modern SFX I beg to differ T2 came out in 1991 2 full years before JP and the effects were just as good if not better I mean the scenes featuring the liquid metal T 1000 seem realistic even today.The action scenes are are Incredible the chase scene between the T 800 (Arnold) the T 1000 and John is one of the best and most exciting chase scenes period, my personal favorite is the Cyberdyne systems heist . The score is great and the Cinematography breath taking.What truly makes this movie this amazing is not its action or its visual brilliance, its the direction and writing and performances.Granted it had a huge budget but credit must be given where it is due one cant help but admire and revere James Cameron after viewing this,he is one of the true legends of Hollywood and this is his greatest cinematic achievement not Avatar or Titanic, from the beginning to end there isn't a single dull moment and the story that unfolds is astonishing . Linda Hamilton was amazing as usual its a shame that she was offered very few good roles after this as after witnessing her amazing transformation from Sarah Connor in T1 to Sarah Connor in T2 I must say that she had the potential to be one of the greats of Hollywood, Robert Patrick gave a power packed performance and Edward Furlong at such a young age gave a splendid performance but the best performance was given by Arnold Schwarzenegger some will argue that the role was tailor made for him but still he executes it with terrific brilliance even in the emotional scenes like the final scene where a tearful John orders him not to go an he defies his order and tells him that now he knows why humans cry (another example of great writing), spectacular . Its a movie for all ages and Races if u haven't watched it yet do watch it ASAP if you have then watch it again to refresh all of your great memories of this cinematic Masterpiece. 2 Thumbs up(if only I had more thumbs)."

","I remember going to see T2 in the movie theater in the summer of 1991. I first saw it just a few days after its release and liked it so much that I went to see it again and again - and again! In other words, I saw it four times in a movie theater! As good as the original Terminator was (and still is), Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of those movie sequels that outdoes the original. It has great special effects, and Arnold Schawarzenegger is excellent as the Terminator. Robert Patrick did a fine job as the T-1000, a terminator programmed to seek and do away with John Connor (brilliantly played by Edward Furlong). Of course, Linda Hamilton reprised the role of John's mother, Sarah Connor. The film won some Oscar awards, including one for the visual effects, and deservedly so.<br/><br/>T2 is my most favorite movie of 1991."
"TombRaider09","Null","1","1","8 February 2011"," ""Terminator 2"" has enough icons to build a church
","When Cameron the sequel for ""Alien"", he titled it ""Aliens"". Terminator could have followed suit and be titled Terminators: Judgement Day, for the sequel is fueled by the impending showdown between The Terminator (Schwarznegger) and the improved T-1000 (Patrick). In the end, the final battle is something of a disappointment, mostly because there's less fighting and more gimmickry involved, but none the less, Terminator 2 is one of the most substantive action films ever made.<br/><br/>Much attributes to the sequel being a success. First of all, Cameron takes his time with the characters - although we already know Sarah Connor (Hamilton) from the first film, her troubles at the insane asylum push her over the edge into a killing machine of her own. When Sarah finally takes matters of fate into her own hands, she leaves enough carnage behind to be the human terminator.<br/><br/>Smart plot and character twists are used from the beginning. When Schwarznegger's Terminator first appears, he assumes the identity of a leather-clothed motorcyclist. When T-1000 first appears, he becomes a cop. One of them is sent to protect John Connor. But it's the cop who turns out to be evil.<br/><br/>And speaking of an evil cop, Robert Patrick in his early thirties might be a ruthless killing machine, but no amount of bullets stops him from being handsome. It's almost cruel that the man of everybody's dreams is made out of metal, seeking to kill humanity's last hope. But really, aren't they all?<br/><br/>And luckily for the audience, the metal is among one of those things which gave room for some great special effects, still looking amazing after twenty years. Such moments as the T-1000 camouflaging itself as floor-tiles (!) and raising up still look as inventive anything done with today's visual effects. And no doubt, not a single human being can forget the detonation of a nuclear bomb, turning Linda Hamilton into a burning carcass. <br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a complex action film, which fully embraces its characters and their story arcs, while continuously showing off its visual capabilities of its director."

","John Connor (Furlong) is sought out for termination by a T-1000 (Patrick) and his only chance of survival is through a terminator (Schwarzenegger) from the future.<br/><br/>The anticipated sequel to one of the best original ideas ever written for screen in 1984 was a worldwide smash and still remains a fans favourite almost 20 years old.<br/><br/>James Cameron, the master of action, had created one of the sharpest and recognized sci-fi thriller's of the 80's along with Aliens and building on that success cemented his established idea through a more action orientated and more consequential sequel that sees Arnie reprise his role as the Terminator, Linda Hamilton showcasing another bravado surprise anti-hero and a debut for Edward Furlong as the saviour of humanity.<br/><br/>This film opens with a voice over from Hamilton's character Sarah Connor, describing the happenings of the last film and what the future could potentially have in store for us should we live through our machines.<br/><br/>Cameron's appreciation of the future is exceptionally visionary if ultimately catastrophic but this gives the film a purpose and an energy that matches its predecessor for script genius and once more, the action is bigger and better.<br/><br/>The futuristic shots of the machines fighting the resistance are wonderfully handled with bright lights and cold hearted cyborgs dominating proceedings whilst there are shots of humans attempting to fight and survive that gives the film a heartfelt sadness. Flashing back to the present day we see a copy of the first film with two naked men appearing in America, both with the intention of seeking John Connor. As with the first there is a wonderful vibe of anticipation and inevitability as both futuristic robots seek the supposed saviour of the human race and as the clock moves forward the action gets hotter as through chases through the shopping mall and then the unforgettable motorbike versus truck chase that examines fabrications of physical ability as we see wonderfully shot low angles following the back wheel of the bike and high aerial shots of the chase in progress, an unforgettable montage of adrenaline that was poorly attempted again in Terminator 3, but this is one of those action sequences for the ages.<br/><br/>The T-1000 is a brilliant creation, a man with the ability to change his arms into any weapon he chooses and the power to transform into any living organism it touches, fantastic. Certainly when it slides through the prison doors and reforms after countless hits is mesmerizing. Patrick has created a true villain.<br/><br/>This film has been recalled for its usage of turning the charisma of Arnie's villain into a good guy and certainly there is more of a comedy vibe and more dialogue from the actor thus round which is more beneficial if not as captivating as when he was a bad guy.<br/><br/>Whilst there isn't the same flowing intensity as the first film this provides plenty of action adrenaline and maintains a futuristic probability that cannot be ignored, a great watch."

","I reviewed the first movie and I truly considered both of them a masterpiece in their own right. This movie is a masterpiece for the cinematic blockbuster that it is compared to the gritty, horror/thriller that was the first one. Terminator 2 is, in all the essence of the word, the perfect movie blockbuster for the reason that it has all of the action elements hands down minus the weaknesses of a typical popcorn summer flick which is the lack of characterization and real drama. James Cameron achieved a character study with real human drama and a truly epic summer blockbuster with special effects that were truly ahead in 1991 and still match up today and are better than some 2009 blockbusters such as Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. Terminator 2 was the Avatar of 1991 in terms of special effects."

","A follow up to Cameron's successful ""The Terminator"", this time the Terminator's mission is to protect not terminate. Maybe it should be called ""The Protector""? The bond between the Terminator and the person he's programmed to protect — John Connor (Furlong, in his debut role), the son of the preceding film's target — is actually touching. Only Cameron can pull that off. Linda Hamilton reprises her role as a much darker and tougher Sarah Connor and Earl Boen reprises his role as a more important (and less likable) Dr. Silberman. Is it purposely ironic that the good characters from the first one grow dark in this film, and the dark character from the first one turns good in this film? Regardless of its intention, it works. The T-1000 (Patrick) is the cherry on top (the T-1000 makes ""The Abyss"" look like a student project). 139 minute action/sci-fi/thriller isn't long it's epic! Special edition runs over 2½ hours, including a scene with Michael Biehn reprising his role as Kyle Reese.<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

","T2: Judgement Day is a spectacular sequel to 1984's The Terminator. It's more exciting, cooler, better special effects, and better in every way. T2 is an amazing film experience. The Plot: Arnold Swatzenegger returns for the sequel to The Terminator. This time, he is sent back in time to protect 13 year old John Conner. John is the future resistance leader. Another Terminator is sent back in time to eliminate John and his mother Sarah Conner. Sarah is in a mental institution for trying to blow up Skynet, who is behind the future Terminator attack. Once she is out, she will not give up with her plans. Terminator 2 has a better villain. I first saw The original Terminator film and wasn't quite convinced that Arnold was a villain. Though he was. I was too used to seeing Arnold the good guy. But this liquid Terminator( Robert Patrick) is really cool. T2: Judgement day is a rare sequel that is better than the original.

"brando647","8","1","1","20 June 2009"," Best in the Terminator Series
","James Cameron's TERMINATOR 2 is a prime example of a film sequel that completely blows away the original. I was a fan of the first film but Cameron's follow-up is better in every way possible. The action is more epic, the special effects were ahead of their time, and it introduces one of the coolest movie villains ever...the T-1000. After Skynet's failure to terminate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in 1984, their second attempt to eliminate future war savior John Connor (Edward Furlong) has them sending an advanced liquid metal prototype model after young John.<br/><br/>T2 amps up the action this time, with Stan Winston's SFX team returning with assistance from ILM to bring the Terminators to life. Keeping in mind the move was released in 1991, the effects are amazing. Cameron has always been on the cutting edge of special effects technology and he continued the trend here. Even now, the T-1000 looks incredible as he morphs or heals from damage (better than the effects in some modern films). In addition, the film set up for some great action sequences (my favorite of which being the escape from the mental hospital).<br/><br/>Returning from the first film are Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Michael Beihn (in the special edition). Schwarzenegger returns to one of his greatest roles as a T-800 Terminator sent back from the future by John Connor to protect against the T-1000. Newcomer Edward Furlong is the young John Connor and seems to have no trouble running with the big dogs. Absolute best though would be Robert Patrick as the stone cold T-1000; his lack of emotion and soul-less stare gives the assassin that extra evil edge. The movie runs long at 2.5 hours (for the special edition) but you wouldn't notice as it rockets along. T2 is a sci-fi action great and (at this point) remains the best in the series; to be honest, I wouldn't have been upset if Cameron had used his original ending and given the series closure. At least we'd have known for certain it would've ended on a high note."
"tom_koopa","9","1","1","8 June 2009"," Terminator vs Terminator
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is an incredible movie. <br/><br/>From start to finish, it is a story that truly grabs you and pulls you in. <br/><br/>Young John Connor is chased by a Terminator from the future. A second Terminator (ironically the same type that tried to kill his mother in the first movie) is also send back through time, to protect John. Reprogrammed by the older John (don't you just love time travel paradoxes?) the 'old' Terminator is a lot different then the one from the prequel. Sarah Connors is locked up in a mental institute because the authorities claim her to be... nuts. We all know she isn't, and so it is very painful and rather sad to see her being mistreated in the institute. Eventually, John and the Terminator bail her out and together, they run from their enemy, the newer and improved Terminator.<br/><br/>Let me take the elements of the movie one by one:<br/><br/>Story: Very moving and well-written. There's a very strong connection with the prequel and you can see the writers put a lot of effort in this movie.<br/><br/>Music: It's the same tune that gave me chills in the prequel. It couldn't be better.<br/><br/>Acting: Very, very good. I can't point out a bad, important character. As a matter of fact, even the less important side-characters did a good job!<br/><br/>Effects: A-MA-ZING! And I'm not talking about the obvious mechanical movements and such. I especially loved how the liquid body of the newer Terminator was creatively used in this movie. A true work of art.<br/><br/>A very enjoyable movie and a worthy sequel.

","Having just purchased the Skynet Edition of this film on Blu-ray, I sat down to watch it for the first time in several years. It has held up very well, in fact the clothing you see people wearing in the background dates this film more than any of its technical aspects. Acid washed denim with neon shirts, whoa there I'm instantly in 8th grade again! But I digress.<br/><br/>As many others have mentioned, this film is one of the rare examples of a sequel besting its forerunner. And the original Terminator was an excellent film in its own right, so this is saying a lot. The only other film like this, that I can readily think of, is Aliens, oddly enough another James Cameron film.<br/><br/>Included in the Skynet Edition is the director's cut, containing something like 16 minutes of cut footage. Some of it was superfluous enough to demonstrate why it was ""terminated"", but the scene where Sarah and John remove the T-800's (Arnold) CPU should have been left in. It brought to bear the paradox of the need to destroy the machines, yet also the need to accept the help of one of those very same machines to do it. It also explained how the T-800 was put into learning-mode which makes some of the subsequent, uncut, dialogue a bit more clear to the viewer.<br/><br/>The ultimate message in the series, as stated by the T-800, is that our species has a tendency to destroy itself. The machines of the future are really just the evolution of our own intelligence, sans the emotion, and serve to starkly demonstrate the destructiveness we've possessed all along. Somehow when it is an emotionless machine intelligence trying to exterminate humanity, we recognize it as the terror that it is, yet we think little of it when we are doing it to ourselves.<br/><br/>An excellent film all the way around. Its special effects were groundbreaking in 1991, and they still look good today. It's rather like Star Wars in that regard. The acting was good, and hey you can't fault Schwarzenegger for turning in a robotic performance either! But all these effects would be for naught without a good story, and we have one here."

Arnold becomes friends with John and tries to teach him things, but inevitably their relationship ends.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor. There is basically no known supporting cast. But it isn't needed as the four main characters are enough.<br/><br/>The special effects were increasing at an incredibly fast rate when the 1990's started so that's the reason why the special effects for the 1991 Terminator film are better than the 1984 Terminator film.<br/><br/>The story was much more interesting and the action was a lot more exciting. The special effects were ten times better and the cast was great. Not to mention, Arnold had an actual role aside from walking and shooting.

","""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" was James Cameron's highly successful, special effects laden sequel to his earlier hit ""The Terminator"" (1984) which had catapulted star Arnold Schwarzeneggar to super stardom. In that film Arnold was a pure villain. Here he is again the hero.<br/><br/>T2 takes place about ten years after the first film. We find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is now a smart ass teenager living with and defying his foster parents the Voights (Jennette Goldstein, Xander Berkley). Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now in a mental institution where no one believes her predictions of total Armageddon.<br/><br/>From the year 2029, John Connor, the leader of the anti-machine rebels, dispatches a terminator (Arnold) back in time to protect himself from harm. The machine race also sends a terminator, the new and improved T-1000 model (Robert Patrick) who has the ability morph into any life form he chooses and is virtually indestructible. He is made from ""liquid metal"" which allows him to re-form any time after he is blown away by Arnold or any one else.<br/><br/>Sarah is unsuccessful at convincing Dr. Silverman (Earl Boen) that she is sane, so she plans an escape. Meanwhile Arnold has materialized and throws a couple of bikers through pool room windows while acquiring his wardrobe, weapons and a motorcycle. The T-1000 also appears and takes on the guise of a cop. Both try to track down the whereabouts of John Connor.<br/><br/>Arnold finds him first and whisks him away from danger on his bike. Their escape from the T-1000 in a semi cab is one of the highlights of the film. Arnold and John go to the asylum and help free Sarah while the T-1000 murders the Voights while trying to trap John. John learns that the terminator is programmed to obey him and instructs the robot not to kill anyone. Bummer.<br/><br/>Sarah is no longer the fearful innocent of the first film, but a hard-nosed freedom fighter complete with an unexplained cache of weapons with which to arm Arnold. Anyway, they soon learn that Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) will be the one responsible for developing the technology that will ultimately cause the final war in which the machines inherit the earth.<br/><br/>Sarah sneaks off to Dyson's home intent upon killing him. She shoots up his equipment, terrifying Dyson, his wife (S. Epatha Merkerson) and their young son. But Sarah in the final analysis, is unable to kill him. Arnold and John arrive on the scene and learn that the basis for Dyson's discoveries is a damaged memory chip from the first terminator. Now convinced that Sarah is right, Dyson agrees to go to his laboratory and destroy all evidence of his work.<br/><br/>The T-1000 is relentless in his pursuit and nothing is able to stop him, bullets, fires or explosions. Finally he corners Arnold and the Connors in a smelting plant and...................................<br/><br/>Producer/Director Cameron gives us an exciting action packed story. It doesn't however, have the originality and believability of the first film. Arnold starts out as the same emotionless robot of the first film but Cameron allows him to develop a ""personality"" and become more sympathetic. He was much more effective, as the unfeeling villain in the first picture.<br/><br/>Although many of the special effects are indeed spectacular, they are just not believable. The scores of wrecked vehicles and persons thrown about and/or blown up/shot stretches credibility to the maximum. But hey, this is an Arnold film and one expects such things. And Cameron's use of the melting metal effect is over done. There appears to be no working parts in the T-1000 other than this metal. Arnold on the other hand, is a walking computer with explainable parts.<br/><br/>Followed by a second sequel, Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines (2003) which, to date, is Schwarzeneggar's final film."
"Chrivhec","9","1","1","1 June 2007"," The ultimate action masterpiece.
","This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. I think I've seen it 9 times and I never get tired of it. With The Terminator, James Cameron brought a new sci-fi element in the movie world. It was a masterpiece that had great success worldwide. A lot of people didn't think he was able to make a better movie than the masterpiece he had already made. But in 1991, he did just that. T2 is without a doubt one of the greatest action movies ever, and certainly the best of the 90s.<br/><br/>After The Terminator everyone knew that there was going to be a sequel. But I don't think they expected Schwarzenegger to be in it again. I'm very glad he represented his role, because that's what makes the plot even more interesting. Once again a T-800 is sent back through time, but this time with a different mission than last time: this time he has to protect John Connor, the future leader of the Human Resistance. I'm pretty sure that no one could have directed this film better than Cameron. He knew exactly what he wanted this movie to be and how to get the job done. In an interview, Schwarzenegger said that Cameron is such a good director because he has such a great vision of what he wants to see. Every scene, every character, every song,  you name it: it's all as good as it can be. Cameron added the perfect kind of music to the right scene. And every scene was filmed very carefully. It can't get better than this.<br/><br/>I think everyone agrees that Schwarzenegger was perfect for the role of the T-800. In T1, he didn't have to talk a lot, and that situation is different in T2. We get a lot of information about what kind of machine he really is, and about the war against the machines. Schwarzenegger has to play a machine and can't show any emotions, so a lot of people think that it's no big deal to play that role. But it's a bigger task than everyone thinks. Cameron has said this himself when he gave an explanation in 'the making of'. In fact, his exact words were: ""Arnold's one of the most professional people I have ever worked with. He's got incredible concentration. He takes everything like a pro"". So no matter what some people might tell you; Arnold definitely knows what he's doing.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor and proves to be a very talented actress. She has to play a different Sarah than the Sarah you saw in the first movie: much more aggressive, more driven, and actually more dangerous. But all with good intentions, as she wants to protect her son and everyone else, actually.<br/><br/>The choice of Robert Patrick for the role of the T-1000 was a good decision, because he's got a neutral look: he could be a protector or a terminator, no one can tell just by looking at him. <br/><br/>And I think Edward Furlong deserves a big bravo for his fantastic performance in his first movie ever. I can imagine it must have been hard to play the role of John Connor, especially with stars like James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the team. That might have given him some pressure, but he handled it well. He did great.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, please don't hesitate and just see it. It will blow you away.<br/><br/>Bravo James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick and William Wisher, for making the best action movie ever: Terminator 2: Judgment Day."

","This film is AMAZING, i really liked the fights from the terminator and the t-1000. the new villain is one of deadliest and creepiest villains yet. the story continues in style with this time the terminator is in fact good and now has to protect John Connor and destroy any chances of the future war called judgement day from happening and that meant to sadly kill himself (the terminator). The theme is very cool the acting was superb. <br/><br/>This is the sort of film you would have to watch if you are into action, story thriller and special effects. You will not regret watching this."
"charlessmith702210","10","1","1","3 February 2007"," Best of the Terminator movies
","Actually, this is the best of the movies in the Terminator saga. Almost like Star Wars. <br/><br/>Well, the problem is that at the end of Terminator 1, we don't see why Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton) ends up at the Pescadero State Hospital, which partially begins Terminator 2. At the end of the first Terminator movie, she runs off with her car in Mexico into an approaching thunderstorm.....she rides until the car goes out of sight. Looks like Sarah thinks of the thunderstorm as a nuclear bomb going off...or the end of the world. So the allusion is that she is obsessed with the Terminator machines as a result of the inclement weather.<br/><br/>Like Star Wars, Terminator 2 has some awfully great special effects, especially the part during Sarah Connor's dream when Los Angeles gets bombed by a nuclear explosion and Sarah Connor ends up vaporized down to the bone by the superheated nuclear blast. By then, there is the awful allusion to the endoskeletons made by Skynet...and the endoskeletons are just part of the so-called ""Terminator"" machines.<br/><br/>The nuclear blast reminds me of ""The Day After"", but only briefly.<br/><br/>The steel mill scene is also popular because of its environment of very high heat and fire. Additionally, I liked the contrast in the mill when the T-1000 is doused with liquid nitrogen from an out-of-control truck, and frozen solid. The Terminator shoots him into pieces of ice, but with help with the heat of the embers in the steel mill, the T-1000 goes back to life...that was one part I liked most of all. You think the whole thing is over...but it is not yet over. <br/><br/>Not until the Terminator fires his grenade gun round at him does he finish off the T-1000 for good.<br/><br/>Addendum: There is great acting by John Connor (played by Edward Furlong) throughout the whole movie. It is a big wonder that a kid like Edward can be in such an action-packed blockbuster flick."
"abhra_29","8","1","1","1 February 2007"," Some of the best movies ever
","A decade after Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) destroyed the original Terminator, a second unstoppable killing machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives from the post-apocalyptic year 2029. But this time his mission is to stop an even deadlier Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), made entirely of shape-shifting liquid metal and determined to kill young John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance. Sarah, John, and the Terminator counter by going after the scientist responsible for developing Skynet, the computer system fated to destroy humanity, leading to an explosive and spectacular clash with the fate of humanity in the balance. Whereas James Cameron's original THE TERMINATOR was a low-budget marvel of efficiency and speed, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is an action-packed blockbuster with some of the most amazing stunts ever filmed and ground-breaking, Academy Award-winning special effects. Star Schwarzenegger was paid in the form of a $15 million dollar jet to revisit his most famous role as the Terminator, this time made kinder and gentler against the silent, relentless T-1000. One of the most popular films of the 1990s, James Cameron's action masterpiece is both a thoughtful look at violence in human nature and an exciting, nonstop thrill ride."
"DavidSim240183","10","1","1","9 January 2007"," At last. A sequel that equalises its predecessor
","This marks my 100th review for the IMDb. And I've chosen Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Although my favourite of the trilogy is the superb 1984 classic, T2 is that rarity. A sequel that in every regard is the equal of its predecessor.<br/><br/>James Cameron proved in 1986 there is such a thing as a good sequel with Aliens. Although not as scary as Alien, it was a thrilling, spectacular action extravaganza that was every bit a classic as Alien.<br/><br/>And that's what T2 is. In fact, I think its the film James Cameron originally envisioned with The Terminator, only with the luxury of a whopping budget the other didn't have.<br/><br/>The plot is not all that dissimilar from the first film. Skynet, having failed in its first attempt to wipe out John Connor, the leader of the human resistance in 2029, has sent another Terminator through time to try again. But a more advanced one, the T-1000 (the very underrated Robert Patrick). A liquid metal shapeshifter, he can assume many forms, create stabbing weapons, and revert to liquid so bullets have no effect on him.<br/><br/>The resistance send another protector, this time in the form of another Terminator (would you believe it, Arnie!), reprogrammed to fight on the side of humanity.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, John's Mum. Having wound up in a loony bin for her rantings about the future being doomed, she's forced to break out to protect John. And become a tightly wound, kickass mad momma!<br/><br/>Edward Furlong plays the 10 year old John, dumped in foster care, and now the target himself. Played with considerable rebellious precocity by Furlong. Making him annoying as hell!<br/><br/>And Joe Morton gets drafted as Miles Dyson, the creator of Skynet, who unwittingly condemns the human race to a bleak future. He tries to help change the future by getting rid of the components of the first Terminator, left over from 1984.<br/><br/>These are all the threads woven into the plot. And it makes for a very multilayered experience. The action moves at a breakneck pace, allowing for some very thrilling setpieces. The action does slow down at the halfway point (something unheard of for a James Cameron film!), which is T2's only fault. It doesn't quite have the relentless feel of the chase like the original. But it does allow for some fascinating explorations into the relationship between The Terminator and the young John Connor.<br/><br/>In a complete about face from the evil machine Arnie played originally, he's now the good guy. Humanizing the machine, nowhere in any of Arnie's other action films has he played the underdog to such a degree. He is even persuaded to refrain from killing people. Shooting and maiming them instead is a perfectly acceptable substitute.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick was a surprise revelation as the T-1000. With his steely gaze, impassive face and unassuming frame, he is surprisingly quite frightening. Especially because he doesn't look threatening. But he can throw someone like Arnie through a wall, and he can form himself into many dangerous guises.<br/><br/>T2 was singled out for high praise for the special effects sequences. And with good reason. Back in 1991, CGI and morphing effects were only just starting out. But James Cameron utilises them to astonishing effect. Any scene with the T-1000 appearing as liquid chrome makes you sit up and take notice. There are so many dazzling scenes, afforded true realism the way people are reflected off the chrome. And who could forget Robert Patrick frozen by liquid nitrogen, shattering to pieces, melting, reforming his blobs into a puddle, to assume human form. Wow!<br/><br/>Cameron also finds time to make some potent points about a possible nuclear holocaust. Sarah's dream sequence is a staggeringly realistic portrayal of an unassuming city destroyed in an instant by nuclear weaponry.<br/><br/>T2 is certainly one of James Cameron's most ambitious films. He blends the action, suspense and ethical viewpoints into quite a successful package. There are occasions where I noticed obvious back projection and stunt doubles, but I found it strangely refreshing in an action film that sometimes feels like it might collapse under its own effects and setpieces. I know that's a strange thing to say, but it seems to add a humanist essence to proceedings.<br/><br/>The ending is quite a bravura of heady action including a SWAT van, helicopter, pickup truck and automated lorry that ends in a steel mill. The deaths of both Terminators are on the one hand a triumph of effects work and real poignance on the other. Try to guess which one is which.<br/><br/>T2 is one of James Cameron's most action-packed films, and Arnie's most intriguing. It didn't seem necessary to continue after this, but alas they did. Shame, because T2 would have been a rip-roaring finale to an impressive first act. The Terminator may have more gritty resonance, but T2 is still a sucker punch of an adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>Cracking!"
"fmarkland32","10","1","1","4 September 2006"," The verdict is out...
","Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800, a cyborg protector this time sent to defend John Connor (Edward Furlong) against the T-1000(Robert Patrick) who can shift, morph and seems practically invincible. Also on board to aid in the survival of mankind is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who decides not only to stop the T-1000 but also stop judgment day from ever happening. It is interesting that a couple of reviewers have said that this is one of the rare cases where a sequel is better than the original, like The Godfather Part II. I myself am not one to debate since I think that like The Godfather parts 1 and 2 are on a par with each other, as both of them are better in different ways. Ergo the same goes with Terminator 2. Terminator 2 is bigger budgeted and works far better as an action movie but isn't quite as successful as the suspense fueled classic of the original. Also The Terminator is quite possibly the greatest B.movie ever made where as Terminator 2 is a classic blockbuster. Whatever the case I have to cave in and acknowledge the fact that I can't tell you which one is better as this movie has everything you could possibly want in a genre film. Terminator 2 is excellent in it's pace, action sequences, special effects and acting. It moves fast and it has been intensely put together. So in the end it is kind of like the same questions posed by Alien and Aliens, both are better in ways than each other because there are elements that each hold in their classic regard. I will say this though, Terminator 2 contains special effects that are still more spectacular (Even more so) than most movies today.<br/><br/>* * * * out of 4-(Excellent. A Must See!)"

","Arnold Schwartzengger delivers his best performance yet as the ruthless Terminator. Linda Hamilton makes a path for women in action films. The plot, the casting, and special effects are excellent. Terminator 2 is the best terminator films in existence. James Cameron deserves an academy award of some sort and so do other actors that are part of the project. Just like the Blues Brothers, I could watch It more than once if I could. The film is so great for how they were able to comprise what they did at that time and make the terminator films as popular as Star Wars and Back to the Future.

","I've seen Terminator 2 Judgment Day many times over the years and it's still one of the best action films ever conceived director James Cameron has done it again by creating another piece of sci-fi action art. While seeing the movie what amazed me was the use of computer and hi tech special effects plus the explosive action sequences and battle scenes. Arnold Schwarzenneger whose role in the previous terminator made him a star delivered another powerhouse performance in this action , adventure hit.<br/><br/>In the distant future of 2029 computers from Skynet have waged a losing war against humanity by sending machines known as terminators to destroy what's left of the human race. Now they've sent a more powerful terminator the T-1000 (Patrick) back to the year 1998 to kill John Connor, (Furlong) who will lead the human resistance to victory. 13 years earlier a terminator (Schwarzenneger) was sent to kill John's mother Sarah (Hamilton) before his birth that mission failed and because of her beliefs she resides at Pescadero State Hospital for the insane. Meanwhile a reprogrammed T-800 has also arrived to protect John from the lethal machine.<br/><br/>The terminator informs Sarah about Miles Dyson (Morton) a man whose role in the beginning of the nuclear war and creator of Cyberdyne Systems, she sets out to kill him but instead enlists his help in destroying all connections and evidence linking to Skynet including pieces from the very first terminator. However the T-1000 is hot on their trail and the two terminators battle it out to the end in a steel factory. My favorite scene<br/><br/>is when the terminator says goodbye to John ""I know now why you cry but it's something I could never do"". Terminator 2 Judgment Day is both explosive and exciting"

","If there was a 'Top 100 sequels' list on IMDb this will be No.1 for sure (idea IMDb guys & gals?). I think its an absolutely incredible movie and it is in my top 3 movies of all time. Everything works so well; the complex story line, the characters, the changes to Sarah Conner's character in relation to 'The Terminator'. Every character is cast to perfection and each one plays their part almost seamlessly. The first Terminator was great and had a really 'dark' feeling. Which made the 'warm' feeling of 'T2' work so well considering the subject matter. It really shouldn't leave you with a sense of warmth and inspiration, but you can't help but feel good inside after watching it. The attention to detail is second to none. And what a theme tune!!!"

(I guess Cameron figured Arnie was a much more thorough good guy).<br/><br/>Against Arnie is the evil T-1000 who just won't give up! The so called 'liquid metal man' chases our victims through all kinds of terrain and scenarios coming to a final climax at the end.<br/><br/>The action in this film is unquestionably sensational!

In a battle between good Terminator and bad Terminator, who will win? And can judgment day be prevented? <br/><br/>James Cameron is back as director and co-writer. He overloads this film with enough action, car chases, explosions and eye-popping (but expensive and Oscar-winning) special effects to satisfy any sci-fi or action fan. There's no reason to call this film boring.<br/><br/>Once again, Schwarzenegger is at his best as the friendly robot. Instead of killing, he maims or scares anyone who gets in his way.

"flingebunt","8","1","1","14 March 2005"," The last American movie
","Watching this movie once again I began go beyond merely being entertained to seeing this as the ultimate American movie.<br/><br/>James Cameron wanted to make the definitive robot movie and in Terminator he did. The very essence of what a robot is for most people comes from the Terminator movies. Arnie Burger career was made the original movie and even when he is 92 and using a walker he will still be the Terminator (maybe the zimmnator).<br/><br/>T1 (as it will be referred from now on in this treatise) defined a robot as an unstoppable machine that will do whatever it can to carry out its mission. It has no soul, no compassion and will not stop, until you are dead.<br/><br/>T2 brings 2 terminators back through time. One is a copy of the terminator from the original movie and the other is ultra high tech liquid metal robot. The special effects don't date because they are simply used cleverly. <br/><br/>Note: Terminator 3 is not a movie about Robots, it is a movie about time travel. It has nothing to say about machines, only fate. This time the machines are trying to kill John Conner himself when he was a young child. Too bad Sarah can't protect him, he is in a mental institution. So the big guy (Arnie Burger) back through time to become the governor of California and then the president of the united states. Their plan is to ban junk food in schools to weekend the resolve of their enemies. (oh wait, that is the plot of Terminator 4). <br/><br/>No, wait. John (the future John) sends Arnie to save John and battle the other Termintor. The Terminator must also learn and live within the rules of society (the machines are our servants, the destroy us because we programmed in our fears, not our hopes and dreams. It is on our own orders that they seek to kill us).<br/><br/>Why do I think this movie is so perfect. One, it is intelligent without pretense. It assumes the audience needs help and explains things, but doesn't just use dialog as a way to fill in between action sequences. The hydrogen bomb sequences are fabled for their accuracy. <br/><br/>Plot points that don't need to be there are not there. By leaving the question blank of how the invention of a tool for peace (a neural net chip) get turned into the destruction of humanity, you can fill in the blanks. Time travel or how the new Terminator make it back through time are not explained. This is a movie about robots, time travel is a plot device (I hate most time travel stories and myself, along with other people who feel the same, still love Terminator). <br/><br/>You also have the nuclear family represented. The terminator drives while blasting away with the shotgun. Sarah pops off a few rounds with a hand gun, and John reloads. <br/><br/>The action sequences are American action, none of these endless Hong Kong action clones (I love Hong Kong action, but there are other ways). There are lots of very big guns, explosions and witty lines. <br/><br/>There is no post modern self-referential $%#$%#. It was funny in Scream and Spaceballs (we can find out where they went by watching the movie we are in on video), but I am over it now OK. <br/><br/>It also sums up the most important American fears and hopes. Hope for a future, fear of our desire to destroy, fear of authority, belief that we know the problems and the answers to the worlds problems but no one will listen to us, the family, technology is both good and bad and of course big guns are really cool.<br/><br/>James Cameron ability in film making is superb, and part of the great tradition of American film making where the art of film making is hidden so that we can enjoy the story more. <br/><br/>Terminator is perhaps the last American movie ever made (now most movies have an international feel using techniques found all around the world, which I love too)."

","""Terminator 2: The Judgment Day"" is without a doubt the best scifi action ever made. With great script, jaw-dropping visual effects and stunning action, it entertains and in the same time chills the viewers. The story is set several years after the events of the original. Sarah Connor is considered mad and is in hospital, while her son, John is a cocky pre-teen, who hates his step-parents and lives mainly in the streets. Unfortunately for him, from the future comes a new and deadly Terminator of liquid metal - an unstoppable killing machine, which can not be hurt. Of course, a new protector is sent - this time he is the villain from the first movie, or at least a Terminator from the same model. He must save John from the liquid assassin. Which is impossible. The movie grabs you from the start and is great to the finish. The actors are excellent - not only veterans Arnold Swartzenegger and Linda Hamilton, but also Robert Patrick and Eddie Furlong. The story is epic in scale and action-packed, and the visual effects are still among the best in the genre, even today. In conclusion - the greatest action scifi ever made."
"FrankBooth_DeLarge","10","1","1","29 January 2005"," Awesome, some of the best action scenes ever put into a movie
","Terminator 2 is considered better than 1984's The Terminator. The reason is because Terminator 2 has much better CGI effects, as well as cinematic quality, and it has bigger and better action scenes. For me it is a hard choice, but I'd probably have to say The Terminator is better than T2. This is a review for T2, so I will focus mainly on this movie.<br/><br/>T2 picks up about 13 years after the first movie.<br/><br/>In T2, there are special effects that were groundbreaking, even for today's standards, and the action scenes are bigger and more explosive than The Terminator. This movie has a sci-fi story that is on the same lines as the story in the original, but it takes another turn and goes a little bit further into the whole nuclear war story. Arnold Schwartzeneger is back, just like he said he'd be, and he's better than ever in every action scene.<br/><br/>The characters who survived in the original Terminator are also in this movie as well. T2 is a classic, and while it isn't quite as good as the original, it still serves its purpose well.

But Arnold was still excellent as the terminator, and robert patrick as the liquid metal t-1000 was also a great performance. And Linda Hamilton took her character further and made it much greater and delivers a great performance. Earl Boen delivered another great performance as Dr peter silberman and Edward Furlong was pretty good as john but could have been better. The Action today still is great and sometimes a lot better than today's action. 10/10"
"Antagonisten","Null","1","1","19 November 2004"," Arguably best action movie ever made
","Every time i see this movie i am amazed at how well it still stands the test of time. When i first saw it i felt it was the best action movie ever made, and i still think that when i see it today. The pace, the effects, the music, the pulse raising action...<br/><br/>The story is probably known to most people. Two machines come back from the future looking for John Connor. One of them to protect him, one to kill him. Both because of what he will become later in life, the leader of the resistance against the machines.<br/><br/>To begin with, the casting is perfect. Arnold Schwarzenegger is his usual mechanical self, Robert Patrick is brilliant as the evil liquid-metal T1000. Edward Furlong has just the right amount of cockiness to pull off the part of the troubled John Connor. And Linda Hamilton is simply amazing as the hardest woman on screen since Ripley in Aliens.<br/><br/>But what makes this film so great? It's the special touch that James Cameron seems to have. His ability to turn a great budget into a great film (instead of just an overblown b-movie like for instance the horrible ""Chronicles of Riddick""). He uses the millions of dollars in an intelligent way and makes a truly magnificent action movie. He can make your heart pound like few others as the movie races to it's magnificent finale. I don't know exactly how Cameron does it, or what it is he has, but i can say this: it's a shame he doesn't make action films any more.<br/><br/>So if you're tired of all the modern action films failing to deliver. All those movies with high budgets and big explosions that still refuses to make your heart pound, then revisit Terminator 2. It's the best there is (in competition with perhaps ""Aliens"") and i have a hard time seeing how any movie could surpass this one in the near future. It's a 9/10 and as recommended as can be."
"joseav10","9","1","1","2 October 2004"," A story about our destruction
","This is not a movie only about special effects, the dates are obsolete too and the main character is probably not a very good actor. Then, why is this movie so special? Why the telly continues broadcasting it as a superb film and people continues watching it again and again. Well, I think because the whole film is a kind of fable about time travel, future, nuclear power, weapons, intelligent machines and human beings... the script is good, the philosophical reflections appropriated and the cast is unique, you cannot imagine other actors in this roles.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie is full of details, philosophical and simple at the same time, timeless. On one hand, you can watch it as a pure entertainment full of action. On the other hand, you can watch it with a little bit more depth, and discover a rich plot, interesting details and complex relationships.<br/><br/>All in all, we are commenting on a classic, a cult movie; one of that movies that you have to see... 9 out of 10."

","Obstensiably T2 is a remake of the original film.  It has exactly the same story line and character types, but the entire film is shifted along the scale of grandeur, and some interseting angles are explored.<br/><br/>The worst kept movie secret ever (the T-800 is the protector) allows Cameron to examine how the machine responds to humanity once it is able to coexist with us.  The benefit of having a clean learning plate and superior intelligence means, that by the closure of the film, the Terminator is the most 'human' of all of the characters.<br/><br/>To his credit Arnold does alot more than just go through the motions in this film, and manages to pull off a highly competent performance with some really poignant touches.  Cameron allowed some of his natural charm to appear on screen this time round - and well done to him for that!<br/><br/>The T-1000 is truely the most horrible, atavistically fearful and primally evil villaine EVER in cinema.  He bloody petrified me, especially when I first saw the film years ago.<br/><br/>The dialogue is tight and interesting and the actions sequences cement Cameron's position as the king of the genre.<br/><br/>Probably the best action epic of all time, and a contender for the best sequel ever.

"eamon-hennedy","10","1","1","27 October 2003"," One of the finest sequels ever made.
","From beginning to end this is a fantastic film, a sequel that truly betters what was really considered to be a film that couldn't be bettered. James Cameron has really increased everything here. Budget, special effects as well as the stakes in his fictional universe. Whereas Sarah, the mother, was the target,  now it's John himself and the story that takes place is superb showing that Cameron truly is the master of the Hollywood blockbuster, a writer/director who can mix big budget thrills and spills with brilliant character drama, which he does so exceedingly well here and this is not seen better than when we see the character development of the Terminator itself which stands as the best part of the film, apart from the action sequences that is. <br/><br/>It may not be saying much, but this is undeniably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best performance and I mean that really. Okay, so he plays a killing machine that cannot experience emotion and who basically talks with the same tone of voice throughout the entire film, but the development of the machine as he learns more about human pattern and behavior is fantastic. Watching the father/son bond develop between John and his protector is superb drama and big Arnie responds well to it. From learning to smile, to learning catchphrases such as 'hasta la vista baby' right down to his realization why human beings cry, Arnie has never been better than he is here, and in those final moments when he tells John he knows now why humans cry before having Sarah terminate him,  Arnie has never been better. Cameron can really get a great performance out of the Oak and it's never been seen better until you see it here. In saying that the rest of the cast is pretty darn good too. Linda Hamilton puts in a career best performance too while Robert Patrick has star quality and quality actor written all over him (the utterance of the phrase ""get out"" has never been more creepy, trust me""), while Edward Furlong is a revelation as John, and along with Arnie he nails those final moments with great aplomb.<br/><br/>Coupled with all of this, the action sequences twelve years on are still superb, as are the special effects which have not dated too much over the years. The truck chase and the helicopter pursuit are still fantastic staples of the action genre and truly set Cameron out as the best action film director working today. All of the elements of this film make this a truly magical film and goes to show that great special effects and a great story that always make a great film. <br/><br/>Take notice George Lucas."

","TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY / Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick / Directed by James Cameron / Written by James Cameron / Rated R / *** 1/2<br/><br/>Many kids today are gushing over a little franchise called The Matrix but older children, teenagers and adults grew up on James Cameron's classic Terminator series, the film franchise that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name and a Hollywood action star. Cameron's back for more in Terminator 2: Judgement Day, offering us a more detailed look at his creative world. The film is style along with substance. I don't think anyone should complain about the movie's action. There's loads of it.<br/><br/>Even with the film being stuffed with action, the story is easily comprehended. Terminator 2: Judgement Day sees John Connor, not unborn but now a fourteen-year-old boy played by Edward Furlong. Now in this time, another unstoppable killing Terminator (Schwarzenegger) arrives from the future to protect John, who will one day lead the resistance against the machines. But the T-800 would not come unless for a reason: The reason is the invincible T-1000 (Robert Patrick), made up of liquid metal, sent to destroy John. With the help of John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton from the original), they must stop the development of Skynet and destroy the T-1000.<br/><br/>
While The Terminator was a relatively low-budget science fiction action film, Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a $100 million action flick with the best special effects of 1991. Many were gasping when James Cameron introduced to us liquid metal that still holds up in the 21st Century. Heck, even Arnold is more of a ""emotional"" cyborg in this film. The relationship between Furlong and Schwarzenegger is sometimes sweet but not sickingly sweet. This film is a somewhat kinder Terminator, but there's still enough action for people gush over. Yeah, I guess I recommend it."

Excellent special effects and great actionscenes make T2 well worth a look for fans of the first, however where as people argue over which Terminator movie is better, I have to say part 1 only because The Terminator accomplished better results with a far lower budget.

"Mr Parker","Null","1","1","7 July 2003"," ...and for my next trick, I'm going to stick my needle-like finger into the corner of your eye!
","I was a huge Terminator fan when I was about ten years old, in case you didn't read my earlier review of it. I used to imagine that I was Reese, coming back from the future, saving Sarah Connor and all that. Me and my friend Adrian watched the movie on VHS in it's entirety at least twice a day for the duration of one summer, then rewound to the police station scene to watch Arnold give all of those poor, doomed police officers hell. Needless to say, we liked the movie somewhat.<br/><br/>Then in 1991, we went to see the sequel, the day before it was being released nationally.<br/><br/>I remember sitting through the opening future sequence with my jaw on my lap thinking to myself, ""If only the first one had these effects."" From then on, it was another two hours plus of pure Terminator bliss. Me and Adrian walked out of the theater laughing hysterically, happy that we had new fodder to abuse on the VCR (well, we'd have to wait a bit but ultimately, we got it pretty quick).<br/><br/>This is one of those rare cases of a sequel done right. The film does have a couple of problems but nothing that ruins it overall. Everything was taken from its original minimalist approach and pumped up to the maximum. The action scenes were without a doubt, unbelievable. The acting was uniformly great, every character given life with none of them being under developed. The story was surprisingly emotional. Just the fact that I wanted to cry for a cyborg that was getting trashed really bad at one point, I'll give Cameron his credit. Especially when mentioning the performance of Linda Hamilton, who was a shivering coward in the first one. You see her here, it's like looking into the eyes of a caged animal. If memory serves me, she wasn't nominated for this performance and it's just a crying shame. The special effects... wow. At the time, morphing had just been unleashed and this movie, believe it or not, basically set the standards for the special effects that you're seeing today. You have to understand that watching this when it was first released was nothing short of breathtaking. It was almost as if somewhere in the recesses of your brain, you somehow knew that you were being a witness to history. I'll never forget watching this in the theaters that first night, how the audience reacted to the emergence of the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) from the blazing wreck of the tow truck in the canal. I swear you could've heard people hold their breath for a moment, then breaking out into thundering applause and hoots and hollers when he morphed into his human self. The film was filled with moments like this and I feel that's why it's such an enduring flick. If you haven't seen this, you really need to stop looking up reader reviews on IMDB and get yourself a video rental card or something. Get with it, man!<br/><br/>Which leads me to the inevitable question. How does it hold up to the big, bad original? Well, I've gotta say that I love both movies. After reading my above thoughts on the movie, you may be surprised to hear that I actually prefer the original. As great as the sequel is, the grittiness of the first one is what does it for me. Yeah, T2 had everything plus the kitchen sink thrown in but the first one had this feeling to it, this feeling of death, darkness and destruction. For some reason while writing this, I thought of this analogy to sum up what I think about the differing moods of the movie: T2 was a crystal clear, beautiful, streak-free window. The first Terminator was the same window with a dirty, dingy rock thrown through it. I think it makes sense. You could probably attribute the griminess of the first one to its low budget roots but that's what makes it work so much better. The sequel is a bit too crisp, too neat, too clean. Don't get me wrong, the film looks great but then again, I'm the kind of person that loves the murkiness of Se7en.<br/><br/>Another thing, and this is where my main beef lies. Some people like the new and improved minigun wielding Terminator. The shoot 'em in the knees in order to spare them their lives Terminator. The joke-cracking Terminator. I am not one of those people. I like the quiet Terminator. The one that speaks only when he absolutely needs to. The Terminator that drives a car through the front lobby of a police station and comes out holding an assault rifle and an automatic shotgun. The one that absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead. The sequel's Terminator is a little more PC and given the general message of the sequel, requires him to be so. But taking away from this character what made him so popular the first time around kind of tips the scales in the original's favor, in my opinion anyway.<br/><br/>
There are a few other things that make me like the original better than the sequel as well. For instance, the runtime for T2 is pretty hefty with a middle section that drags a bit, where the first one is nice and lean, with no slow parts whatsoever. I remember while watching the movie initially, I got annoyed a couple of times near the end. The violence, while still strong, isn't on the level of the first. There's a preachiness to the sequel that gets annoying at times. What it speaks of is of great importance, true, but there's moments in T2 that almost made me roll my eyes. Edward Furlong, here playing the young John Connor, gives a good performance but comes off as whiny more often than he should. His voice squeaks in a way that sounds like nails on a chalkboard on occasion. I'll cut him some slack though, being that he was probably just going through puberty at the time of filming.<br/><br/>I've probably spent more time than I should have on comparing the two films. I'll finish with this: T2 is an amazing motion picture. If you are an action fan, this is a movie for you to see. It holds up well to repeat viewings and has some amazing special effects, with a villain that goes down as one of the more memorable I can think of. It's rare nowadays to get a movie that has this amount of special effects that weren't thrown in just for the sake of it. The special effects serve the story and push it forward, like it's supposed to do. The story is emotionally heavy and will definitely make you think of technology advancement in our age in a different way.<br/><br/>
Lastly, it's one of those few sequels that actually doesn't ruin the memory of the first film. That in itself, says something, I think.<br/><br/>
RATING: ***** out of *****."

","This movie has it all. A great story, great acting, great directing, great dialogue, great action, great suspense... everything I could ever want in a movie. I have watched this movie countless times, and each time it seems to just get better and better for me.<br/><br/>James Cameron's higher-budgeted action/adventure, is a work of art. This series is his baby and he treated it like one, with great care and vision to make sure it matured well in later parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger shows why he is the man to destroy box office records with memorable characters such as The Terminator (Series 800 Model 101).<br/><br/>With a strong supporting cast as well by Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong by his side, the chemistry between all these characters was like a well oiled machine (no pun intended).<br/><br/>To top it off, one of the scariest villains of all time is in this movie, Robert Patrick's T-1000. The near emotionless face of his actions is always a site to behold as his mission is always focused on one thing and one thing only. To kill John Conner.<br/><br/>The final aspect of this film which makes it so great is one of the most memorable scores in movie history composed by Brad Fiedel. The strength of the sound of the Terminator, the deep and scary theme of the T-1000 and of course, the opening theme itself. The score, is this movies soul and it definitely shows in this movie.<br/><br/>Although Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines was good, it lacked the soul and feel of Terminator 2: Judgment Day.<br/><br/>The greatest movie of all time.<br/><br/>Final Rating: 10/10"

However, many Hollywood directors and actors are EXTREMELY hypocritical by trying to advertise their ultra violent films is trying to give us some profound, insightful moral message.  Arnold also does this concerning T2 in an interview.<br/><br/>This is like telling people hunting for sport is wrong just before going on a fun duck shooting weekend with some mate.<br/><br/>The film, watched by certain bent people who would like to copy-cat the violence they see, ENCOURAGES them to be violent.  The verbal 'anti violent' messages the film makers are among the most hypocritical messages I have ever witnessed. I find it laughable to see that Arnie is now involved in politics."
"mikeslant","10","1","1","30 May 2003"," One of the greatest action movies of all time
","I remember when I was little and this came out, I wanted to see it so bad but I was never allowed to. Finally, when it was on PPV, my Dad let me see the last twenty-five minutes or so and I loved it. It wouldnt be until I went to my freinds birthday party that year that I would fully experience 'Judgement Day'. While T2 is a sequel with a new story arch, James Cameron in some ways was doing a remake. Now with the budget he originally needed he could tell the story he truly wanted to tell but couldnt. (Such as the T-1000 character, who he came up with during the first film)You'll notice similar set pieces and lines, similar action scenes to the ninth degree. John Carpenter did something similar to this with Escape from L.A., a sequel to Escape from New York that was in some ways a remake because the budget he was able to get. All similarities aside, T2 is a force to be reckoned with. Though T1 maybe scarier, with its edgy world and dark themes, as well as a much scarier Arnold, T2 has some scary moments too, as well as some of the most complex and extremely entertaining action scenes ever scene. Even by todays standars, the special effects in T2 rock. Maybe becasue they only used CGI when puppetry and animatronic and make-up effects wouldnt work, and they only used those effects when regular people or sets couldnt work. Something the new Star Wars movies could take a hint from, only use CGI if you HAVE to. T2 isnt just an action movie though. From the opening chse scenes that begins in a mall and ends in a flood chanel, to the closing shootouts and chases that start at a Cyberdyne office and end in a steel mill, T2 mixes in a touching and emotional story of surival and characters. In a way, T2 is storyline based, character driven, with huge shootouts, chases and special effects along the way to make it a blast. The T-1000 is very scary and creepy, Arnold is more over the top than he was in T1, but he still kicks butt. The opening scene that shows the future war still stands tall as one of the coolest battle scenes in all of cinema, and when John and the Machine talk about how humans arent going to make it, that it is in our nature to kill each other, creeps me out how very true it is. T2 shouldnt be missed by anyone, though it lacks some in the originality factor, it makes up for it in slam bang visuals, widely entertaining shootouts and chases, one liners, good acting, and a great story. When you think about it, The Matrix copied alot of the things the Terminator franchise created, accept added on action elements that could never be completed in real life, but made up a reason why it could. Either way, Matrix is cool, but T2 (and T1) are flat out amazing. **** out of ***** 9/10"

The ironic part about this is that the graphics are waaaaaaaay ahead of 1991's time, and I cannot tell you how many times I watched the part where T-1000 is chasing John Connor on the motorcycle.

This, the second film, is wonderful. Arnold, Linda and Edward make this a very good actionmovie. The heart beats faster and faster when the other terminator gets closer and closer... Along with great acting the music plays a very important role in this move. The classical Terminator-soundtrack makes you feel a bit melancholy and calm- you can feel the struggle between the future and the past. You just have to see this movie!!"
"GabyMR","9","1","1","17 May 2003"," Wow!!!
","This is one of the most extraordinary action movies I have watched. The story is extraordinary, the scenes are great and the performance of all the actors is magnificent. It was interesting to see like the characters had changed since Terminator I. Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger character is good, Sarah (Linda Hamilton) is not more an sweet girl. Not, she´s obsessed with the future war. In T2, we know John (Edward Furlong), the Sarah´s and Kyle (T1) child. He´s an rebel teenage, who is fond of The Terminator (and vice versa). We can don´t forget T-1000 (Robert Patrick), the ""bad guy"" (well, the bad robot :- )). Well, if you like the action movies and you haven´t watched Terminator 2: It´s time to see it."

","Ten years ago, an innocent young woman named Sarah Connor was targeted for assassination by a killing machine from the future.  She barely managed to escape with her life from that ordeal, but it ended up having a tremendous impact on her.  You see, a man had also been sent back from the future to protect her, and in the process he gave Sarah a warning about the terrible danger that threatened humanity--a nuclear war caused by a future computer that left humanity all but extinct.  Sarah's future son, John, was humanity's only hope in that future, but Sarah could stop the whole thing now if she tried.<br/><br/>And try she did.  She became a killing machine herself, destroying the research that would lead to artificial intelligence.  But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't seem to find the root cause of the danger, so she began teaching her young son how to be a ""great military leader.""  Then finally, she was captured and institutionalized, leaving a rebellious John in foster care.<br/><br/>This is where Terminator 2 begins.  And once again, the future artificial intelligence known as Skynet has sent a killing machine back in time to prevent John Connor from rising to lead the humans.  This time, though, ten-year-old John is the target.  And once again, the humans manage to send a protector back in time, as well.  It's only a matter of which one will get there first.<br/><br/>Of course, the protector does, but just barely.  And off we go on a journey that will change the course of humanity and, more importantly, will redeem Sarah Connor.  For that is truly what the movie is about.  Sarah, tormented by the knowledge of a horrendous future, has completely lost touch with her humanity.  She is no longer capable of loving her son; her only concern is that he remain safe so he can lead the survivors in the future.  Then, when Sarah gets specific information regarding the development of Skynet, she heads off on a mission to ensure that future never happens.  Only John can stop her, but can this boy and his pet killing-machine convince her that murder will only hurt their cause?<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a story of life and hope and possibility. ""There's no fate but what we make for ourselves.""  And no matter how far down the road we've traveled, it's never too late to change direction.<br/><br/>T2 is, in my opinion, James Cameron's masterpiece.  It works on every level, from superficial action to allegory.  The visuals are brilliantly devised, from the evil terminator driving a police car with the slogan ""to protect and to serve"" to the fire extinguisher behind Sarah's supervising doctor in the interview scene.  It is one of my favorite movies, and, I would say with only the slightest hesitation, possibly one of the greatest movies of all time."

","I saw this movie on the first week of its release after an enormous amount of hype.  At the time I would have ranked Terminator as amongst my top 5 all time favourite movies.  Normally after such expectations a movie flops. But no, this one was better than the first.  I highly recommend seeing Terminator and Terminator II, as I believe them to be the best action sci-fi movies of all time.  They also have an excellent man-machine ethics theme and of course the old time-travel brain*^%$, much loved by sci-fi audiences. It explores the ethics of science, the weight of pre-destiny, and challenges the unquestioned wisdom of building robotic servants as they approach cognitive self-awareness. Its also entertaining, which is always a plus.  I love this movie, I think you will too, especially if you love Alien/Aliens or other Arnie movies."

","This was the first terminator film i saw. I was about 7 at the time but i was very very impressed. Then when i had got a bit older i had relized that this film was almost perfect on the effects side for a 1990 film. Robert Patrick really suited the role of the T-1000, which in my opinion is better than the rubbish T-100 which Arnold plays. I do think this is the better one out of the two with better fight scenes and better gun fights. Also i think that the T-1000 is a lot better than the T-100 because well lets face it in the first he wasnt really the smartest of all robots was he? And he not exactlly the most strong all you would have to do is blow him up with a grenade and he's history!!! I would give this film a 7/10 for all round. 9/10for the effects at that time."

"memoryvixen","9","1","1","10 January 2003"," An action ride with a message? Wow...
","I saw ""T2"" when I was eleven.  I think my parents were nuts to let me see it when I was that young, but I could still kiss their feet for allowing me the chance.  ""T2,"" while still full of the violence and gadgetry that defined the first film, is a far more thoughtful introspection on what it is to be human.  Sarah Connor (Hamilton) - the helpless ingenue of the first film - has morphed into a hard-edged psychopath, while the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) becomes a father-figure to the impressionable John Connor (Furlong). While Sarah has become less and less human due to her knowledge of the future's horrors, the Terminator slowly becomes more and more human because of his exposure to John.  To paraphrase Sarah from the end of the film, if a machine can learn the value of human life, perhaps we can, too.<br/><br/>
For an eleven year old, that was one hell of a heavy message.<br/><br/>
But if you're not in the mood for deep thought, never fear.  ""T2"" is full of plenty of gunfire, explosions, and hand-to-hand combat to satiate even the most bloodthirsty of moviegoers.  The police shootout at the Cyberdine building is one of the best staged fight scenes I've ever seen.  And the climactic battle in the steel factory at the end of the film is amazing.<br/><br/>In my opinion, one of the best performances in the film (only outdone by Ms. Hamilton) is that of Robert Patrick as the T-1000.  Whereas Arnold was terrifying in the first film because of his sheer brute strength, the T-1000 is equally - if not more - frightening because of his cunning, fluidity (literally) and determination.  In the original film, the Terminator seemed to be a bit like a plodding elephant, following Sarah and Kyle with slow, inexorable steps.  In T2, the T-1000 is an agile opponent who can be anyone or anything at anytime.   There are moments during the film where you could almost swear he's human, such as when he exits the police car in front of the home of John's foster parents.  The way he looks up and down the street is so realistic, you forget he's supposed to be a machine.  He can even be downright charming!  Heck, there were times I found myself wishing the T-1000 was the guardian, rather than Arnold!<br/><br/>Whereas the original Terminator was a bulky killing machine, the T-1000 is an assassin.   The difference is made markedly clear by the physiques of the two actors: Arnold is, naturally, built like a brick house.  Robert Patrick is whip thin and muscular, without being overbearing.  His eyes are especially chilling - if RP himself weren't such a nice guy, you'd swear they were serial killer eyes.  The contrast was a brilliant move by James Cameron.<br/><br/>The fluid metal effects of the T-1000's morphing STILL hold up today, and are just as awe-inspiring as they were twelve years ago.<br/><br/>
T2 is probably one of the greatest sci-fi/action films out there.  I think it surpasses the original in terms of message and acting.  I always find myself missing the heroic human character, who was Kyle (Michael Biehn) in the first film; the Terminator, while an enjoyable and unlikely hero, is just a bit too robotic to really connect with.  But I think in this case, having that hero character would have taken something with a powerful message and made it kitzchy.  The dialogue is kept to a minimum, but you don't even notice.  If you're looking for something more than just your everyday action film, you can't beat ""T2."""

","In 1991, t2 set the bar so high in the realm of action/adventure movies that it still remains to this day one of the great action movies of all time. As time as passed, special effects have become more integrated into the action genre, as, frankly, they have always been.  And they have become quite outstanding.  But few of them today suspend disbelief as well as T2 continues to do.  Movies like Matrix and the James Bond movies have great sequences, but I cannot compare them even marginally to the chase sequence in this film between the helicopter and police cargo van (look at the T1000 on one of the close-ups during this sequence, because he actually has 3 hands!!!).  And the hydrogen bomb sequence blows my mind every time I see it.<br/><br/>I have seen this film no less than two dozen times, most recently on our new surround sound system.  I notice something new than astonishes me.<br/><br/>This movie is near the top of a short list that makes up the greatest all time movies I have ever seen."

The special effects were very good for its time (1984), but they look terrible now, or in 1991 when T-2 was made.<br/><br/>The special effects in T-2 even in 2002 do not look bad.  The T1000 effects were simply outstanding.  The plot was outstanding, then of course there was Arnold.  Let's hope that the new Terminator will be even half as good as this masterpiece of sci-fi."

","Originally written by ""Sam (sammyboy@rocketmail.com)"" Superior, WI<br/><br/>Date: 4 October 2002 Summary: Best action movie I've ever seen<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is possibly the best action movie ever made. Not only does it have very skillfully played-out action scenes, but it's also filled with some of the most incredible melodies I've ever heard, a factor that, simply, counts for at least 35% of the total excitement and feelings that the movie brings. In addition to being very well made, with no dull scenes whatsoever, this movie actually brings up some interesting questions. In one scene, John Connor looks at two little boys fighting, and asks a robot: ""We're not gonna make it, are we? People, I mean?"" and it replies: ""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves."" I don't think one realizes right away how deep this small comment really goes, way beyond even the main idea of the movie, with all the time-traveling. In addition, unlike many other movies, every scene seems to last long enough to really give the viewer the exact feeling of freight, sympathy, or just exhiliration that the director or writer really meant by it.<br/><br/>I, too, remember that actual August 29th, 1997; I was actually a bit scared of some truly devoted fans to start some ruckus. But nothing happened.<br/><br/>That is, also, another thing about this movie: it is the only movie I know that predicted an incident in the very near future, which made it even more sci-fi-like. Finally, this seems to be the best movie for each actor who stars in it, and whenever I see them anywhere else, I trace them back to this movie before any other. This is a five-star, 10/10 achievement! If you're a fan of hard-core action, sci-fi, and a little bit of comedy, this will be your favorite movie, as well."
"tranceguy1","Null","1","1","9 October 2002"," Superb movie

"ericjg623","9","1","1","17 September 2002"," Great movie, except for the annoying brat kid
","I seem to be in the minority here (based on the IMDb top 250 movie ratings) in that, spectacular as T2 is, I still prefer the original. Now, I must say that, having just watched it on DVD after having not seen it since it was playing in theaters, it's a better movie than I initially thought. Back then, I remembered it being a case of stunning special effects and amazing stunts trumping the basic story and characters (much like Independence Day), this in contrast to T-1 where they merely complemented them. I still think that is somewhat true, however, after watching this movie again, I really do have to give credit to most of the actors, as well as the writer(s), for a job well done. <br/><br/>First off, Arnold simply delivers. Just as no one else could have played the terminator in the first movie, he's the only one who could play it in this one. He's still a machine, but much like Star Trek's Mr. Spock, there's a hint of humanity and humor right below the surface, and to portray this skillfully requires a degree of subtlety that Schwarzenegger hadn't previously been noted for. Robert Patrick is perfect as the emotionless, yet relentless machine sent to kill john Connor. Linda Hamilton returns, only now she has to escape from a mental institute to save her son, Earl Boen also returns as the perfect combination of jerk and dork as Sarah's shrink, and on and on. Perhaps the best scenes, at least in terms of emotional intensity, are the ones in the psych ward, where Sarah goes from determined escapee to terrified woman fleeing at her first encounter with the (good) terminator at the elevator to protective mom when the three of them steal a cop car and make their escape. The only thing I would have added would have been to show what happened to Dr. Silberman after he witnessed the encounter between Sarah, her son, and the two terminators. After all, he was the one who'd been scoffing at Sarah from the beginning, so it would have been amusing to see how he dealt with finding out that, far from being a loony, Sarah had simply been telling the truth. Would they have had to lock him up, or would he have simply gone into denial to protect his sanity and his reputation? <br/><br/>Anyway, the bottom line is this film grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go till the credits roll. The amount of action is simply stunning, just think of what it took to film the final 30 minutes or so, from the gunplay at the Cyberdyne headquarters to the helicopter chase, and ending up in the steel factory. The story is well paced and, for the most part, the acting first rate. The only exception I'll make is for the kid. There are many instances where his dialog is simply awful, and his basic character seems unsuitable for someone who's supposed to be a great leader in the future. As just one example, there's a scene early on, shortly after John and the terminator have escaped from the mall, where he yells to a couple of guys to `help get this psycho off me!' then, when they actually come over to do just that, he insults them and has the terminator nearly beat them to death. This was just the worst scene he's featured in, but there are plenty of others, such as, right after the aforementioned scene, he tries to explain to the terminator why he can't kill people, but he seems unable to come up with a better rationale than `because you just can't. Trust me on this'. I'll be blunt Â– this kid (at least for me) is fully as annoying as Jar Jar Binks was in `Phantom Menace', and of course, since he's one of the main characters, it definitely detracts from an otherwise great movie. So, for that I rate it 9 out of ten."

Examples:  The knife through whining husband, ""chill out, dick wad"" 0.0 casualties!!

","*** 1/2<br/><br/>Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick, Linda Hamilton, and Joe Morton.<br/><br/>There are hardly any movies that can beat the movie before it.   Terminator 2 suceeds.  What was fresh about the first film is that their idea for a film was so original that it suceeds majorly.  How can any movie beat an idea like that?  You come up with a slightly different idea and add new characters.  The movie is practically non-stop action full of smart settings and great ideas for ""how the characters are going to escape.""  The movie is about the Terminator (who is suddenly now a good guy) who must *protect* John Connor from an unstoppable liquid-metal killing machine.  Arnold's back and he is much better than ever.  Furlong was good as John Connor at age 10 (weird, he sounds 10, he was really 14).  Robert Patrick is so cool as the villain I can't decide if he or Arnold from the last one is better. Hamilton reprises her role as Connor's mother and she's good here.  I am very surprised of how underused Morton's character is.  he could at better than anyone on the cast and he was their for about 15 minutes.

","Honestly, I've seen many sequelled original movies, but of all that I've seen, one after the other, I go back and I say, that T2 is the Best Sequel ever created.<br/><br/>I didnt like the first Terminator probably because I'm so spoiled by the special effects created in todays movies.They tried so hard to make it so realistic along with the plot of the story-which is excellent- although I didnt like that Future cop actor.<br/><br/>None-the-less T2 made a MAJOR break through since the first. Now Focusing more on Character development and a stronger story that actually made sense abuot what the human race can accomplish can not only take us higher, but can also make us fall. That our success can actually create failure for the future.  A way better plot then all those retard alien or space movies they had at that time.<br/><br/>The   LOTRs trilogy sequels, the Star wars trilogy prequels and sequels, will never surpass the breakthrough that T2 has made- Mainly because of one thing-  ORIGINALITY. LOTR is just a conversion from book to movie(still great but the Director was no the one that created the orignial story. Star wars- awesome- but still stands the winner of battle of Space movies- proves nothing but the idea of Politics getting out of hand- thats the only originality in SW.<br/><br/>Anyways you getmy point. thanks to this movie- I strongly look forward to T3."

The film also features a memorable villain in the T-1000 terminator.<br/><br/>The only weaknesses are overlength and the fact that we are supposed to believe that the Edward Furlong character, young John Connor, a motor cycle riding, code deciphering delinquent, is just 10 years old (Furlong was 14 years old at the time)."

","Cameron's Terminator 2 is a true masterpiece as action movies go.  It has everything an action film must have, a hard as nails bad guy, a tough cookie goodie, someone to defend and someone to crack jokes.  Some of the gunfights in the film are second to none and the simple yet classy remarks made by Arnie are cheesy yet extremely cool.  The immortal line ""ASTA LA VISTA BABY"" will never die.  Cameron certainly chose well when he casted Arnie for the part, he looks and sounds just like I would imagine a cyborg to, with a flat monotone voice but absolute truth in what he is saying. Some of the guns in the film make you want to go jumping around the room yelling boom boom boom, whilst holding your arms out as if you are holding anything from a pump action shotgun to a bazooka.

"BB-15","9","1","1","22 December 1999"," A Sci-fi Action Classic
","Terminator 2 has become the standard for sci-fi action films and it has not yet been surpassed. The backbone of T2 is its great script. It blends thrills and compassion better than any film I've seen. Obviously the terminators deal with most of the rough stuff but Linda Hamilton is a revelation. She is fiery, powerful and loving. The balance of action with human themes of faith, endurance, and sacrifice is almost perfect.<br/><br/>While the special effects look a bit dated, the action scenes are still incredible. How they got trucks and helicopters to do these things still amazes me. <br/><br/>It's inevitable with the success of The Matrix to compare these two films. The background stories of the two movies are very similar, machines take over the earth. Where T2 shines is that all of it's character's motivations make sense. The Matrix throws loads of comic book/cartoon images at you and then has characters do silly things. Lots of Matrix fans tout its Messiah themes but they are done in a very shallow way. Terminator 2 also deals with the theme of the prophet but it is more subtle and true. Linda Hamilton is just great playing this role until the end when Schwarzenegger steps in to make a final sacrifice.     <br/><br/>While Arnold's acting limitations are well covered up, they are still there. And the cute lines like ""Hasta la vista baby"" are over done. I also wish it were less violent. But I admit it seems almost mainstream compared to recent action films.  <br/><br/>Why quibble about a few minor problems? Terminator 2 has a terrific performance by Linda Hamilton. It is amazingly an anti- war film, blending many positive values with the action. It is masterfully made and still looks incredible."
"MikeT-9","10","1","1","2 December 1999"," Best Action Movie Of All Time
","This one has it all - Knockout special effects, a non-stop parade of the best action sequences in recent memory, excellent direction, great storytelling and Arnold at his best. It's well over two hours long, but it flies by.<br/><br/>This was the first film to cost $100 million, and it's far and away the best of any big-budget action film. You can see the price tag in every frame. ""End of Days"" cost the same amount and is nowhere near as good.<br/><br/>
I think James Cameron's direction makes all the difference. He knows how to punch up an action scene with the right camera angle and editing, and how to make every scene exciting. He is by far my favorite director, with the possible exception of Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>Arnold's best and the best action film of all time. A 10."

"Ares-18","10","1","1","17 October 1999"," A SciFi masterpiece . . .
","T2 is far and a away Schwarzenegger's best movie, not only because of it's financial success, but also because of it's content. T2 continues the Terminator saga, building on the foundation of the original film. This time, however, the Terminator model 101 is the hero, not the killer, and a new, even more lethal model, T1000, is sent to terminate John Conor.<br/><br/>T2 is less voilent and graphic compared to the original film and focuses a little more on the story behind the movies, which really draws you into it's atmosphere. Judgement day causes you to think about morals and ethics, and takes that extra step beyond a traditional action flick. This creates a more interesting experience for the viewer, causing you to want to see it time and time again.<br/><br/>The FX in this film, ground breaking at the time, combined with the excellent plot, which as I said before, adds to the background of the series, makes for one hell of a movie. As action and scifi films go, they really don't get much better than this. I expect that T3 will be nothing less than a block buster of equal proportions, and a film once again a head of it's time . . ."
"Mulder-51","10","1","1","13 August 1999"," A very good film with two huge mistakes!
","Terminator 2 is one of the sequels that are better from the first film. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton were perfect in their role. The directing was very good but the script had two HUGE mistakes. These are: 1. Only things that are covered by living tissue can go through the time transporter, thus explaining why the Terminators can't bring guns and bombs and knives and such. Therefore, Arnold Schwarzenegger can go through because he is covered with living tissue. However, the T-1000 is NOT covered in living tissue - he is made out of a liquid metal that only looks like living tissue Therefore, the T-1000 technically should not have been able to go through the time transporter. 2. The computer that the T-1000 reads in the police car (at the beginning of the film) reads that John is 10 years old and was born in  1985. This means that the movie would have to take place in 1995 ( 2 years before Judgement Day). Yet, Arnold claims in the car, (while driving towards Mexico) that Judgement Day would happen in 3 years, just after the Skynet funding bill is passed by congress. Finally the visual effects of the film were AMAZING!!!"

The terminator was like John's father that he never had. Directed by James Cameron from Titanic. Way better than Titanic. Titanic was alright, but nothing great. So check out this movie sometime."
"FlyBoyDC","Null","1","1","29 July 1999"," A remarkably powerful and moving motion picture.
","I remembered seeing this movie in the theater back in the day.  It was probably one of the best, most thrilling experiences ever!  Back in 1991, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY ruled the box office!  Yes, this movie was the summer hit of that particular year.  <br/><br/>Of all these science-fiction epic blockbusters that I have seen in my life, no film can match the impact of TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. This is absolutely the best science-fiction/action film that I have seen!  The mind-blowing special effects and stunts, plus unbelievable action place TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY on the top of my all time favorite movies.<br/><br/>
In the future, 2029 A.D., the fate of Planet Earth must be determined once again.  The T-101 model (Arnold Schwarzenegger, in a rather sentimental performance) has been sent through time to protect young John Connor (Edward Furlong) and his mother, Sarah Connor (role reprised by Linda Hamilton) as well.  The ""good"" terminator, the T-101 must stop another assassin, the T-1000 (character actor Robert Patrick), a ""bad"" terminator from eliminating John Connor.  If the T-101 fails, thus, the consequences are unspeakable, plunging the human race into eternal extinction.  Dr. Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) is also implicated into this whole predicament. In fact, he holds part of the key from the past that may lead to the future fate of the human race... <br/><br/>TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is undoubtedly a winner. The special effects are the most visually stunning sequences put onto the screen, and this film has introduced to the world, the ever-popular ""morphing"" effects.  The action in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is riveting, fast paced, and pulse-pounding with some of the most breathtaking choreography ever. This movie is simply an electrifying, crowd-pleasing fun.  The performances by several of the main characters deserve plenty of praise for their accomplishments. Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Morton are all great but the T-1000 steals the show.  Newcomer Robert Patrick earns points for portraying a reticent but sly adversary.  Also, the musical score by Brad Fiedel is marvelously exquisite.  Once again, director James Cameron has created another winner. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is Cameron's ultimate masterpiece.<br/><br/>
TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY transcends beyond the usual special effects extravaganza and action with a very cathartic and touching story-line. Here, this film shows the relationship between the young John Connor, and his ""surrogate"" father, the good terminator. Rarely in action movies do we see a bonding relationship between two people of different dimensions.  This is not talking about perfunctory friendships.  Rather, this is deeply discussing the concept of people from two different ""worlds"" sharing their culture, understandings, and even similar interests, if any. Another moving scene in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is Sarah Connor's frightening dream, or rather, a premonition she had of a burning holocaust of global proportions. This scene had definitely scared me when I first saw this movie in theaters. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY offers many insights on the main characters, just like in its predecessor. Character development is just as much of a spectacle in this film as for the obviously awesome visuals.<br/><br/>
I have no regrets owning my own copy of TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and I think that this movie will appeal to everybody. It is one of the very few films that makes you want to see the movie over and over again, even if it is just for the amazing metamorphosing effects. This is one film where you can truly say that you do not have enough seeing it just once.  Very few movies can attain the high caliber of TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY.  Of course, this film deserves every bit of respect from me...   <br/><br/>
Yes, it's true.  This film rules by all accounts!  A GREAT plot, tremendous action, breakthrough special effects and excellent production values make this film one hell of a science-fiction landmark!  <br/><br/>RATING: **** out of ****."
"boff-2","10","1","1","3 June 1999"," utter elation
","Forget the ground breaking special effects and innovative action sequences which so easily please cinema going audiences these days and what you have left is a compelling, moving and fast paced movie. Many people will be quick to criticize the originality and authenticity of the storyline but I ask you this, how many films has T2 borrowed ideas from? Only one, The Terminator. It is not a remake of an already great film, it is one of those films which achieves the rarest of cinematic feats. It is a sequel superior to the original. Unlike it's predecessor it provides a good subplot(the quest to prevent the war) lacking from the original. This is indeed a human story. Cameron is potrayed as a genius as he directs the ground breaking action sequences with the precision of a professional machinist and Robert Patrick's performance is brilliant and chilling. Along with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""Terminator 2"" was one of the few movies to truly entrance and frighten me as it is more of a thriller than sci-fi movie. The ending is also anti-Hollywood and can bring a tear to the most savage of critics. Sadly, this movie which ""set the standard for the 90's"" has only fuelled directors notion that special effects sell movies better than solid storytelling and acting. It is these which they should focus on. Terminator 2 has  it all."
"CorumJI","9","1","1","1 June 1999"," An underestimated classic... One of the best SF-Action movies ever.
","This movie is going to eventually be respected as a true classic -- The notion of the T-2000 robot is almost as significant an advancement of the concept ""robot"" as Asimov's ""3 laws"" were 50 years ago. The effects are well integrated into the plot, and the behavior of the robot, as it develops un understanding of its own capabilities is well thought out. (The scene where the robot stares at its frozen, shattered body part is perfect. Its second fight with Arnold, where it no longer is limited to ""human"" reactions to attacks is equally impressive).<br/><br/>It should be interesting to see what Cameron's T-3 will be like (esp. after the comment ""T-3 but without me"")."

Fortunately James came to his senses and did an improved version!<br/><br/>I've seen the same thing with his movies ALIENS and THE ABYSS, and now I hear that also TITANIC has some great scenes cut out.

I think Sarah was so incredibly morbid the entire film, it kinda put a damper on things.

","Oh woe is the poor souls who have yet to see the director's cut of Terminator 2. I pity thee. Great regular Terminator 2 is, but greater still is the director's cut. There's lots of reasons to love this movie. Arnold gives us the same big gun toting, king of the bullet dimension, rough and tough performance that we all expect from him. James Cameron equals his first Terminator movie in every way and even one ups it in a couple of categories. Like special effects. Along with Jurassic Park this has the greatest special effects of any movie ever. The T-1000 morphs are unbelievable and can be enjoyed despite countless viewings. This time around Arnold's accent isn't as thick so he actually gets a few more speaking lines then just his infamous ""I'll be back!"" A great supporting cast rounds out the picture and good writing and a little humor add on some points. But the director's cut Oh boy. You get a great deal of extra scenes, probably about 25 minutes in all. Plus that includes alot of key special effects scene, a return of Micheal Biehn's character Reese from the first Terminator, a better look at Joe Morton's character's home life and entire plot element. If you're going to purchase this movie I can't stress enough how much you should get the director's cut. It features a second tape with more outtakes, the theatrical trailers, and the alternative ending. Buy the director's cut. You won't be sorry."

","It has plenty of action, suspense and comedy, yet drives home the points that we can not let machines start running too much of the show or we could face consequences we may not like and how uncertain the future really is. On top of that, the Miles Dyson sub-plot shows us that one man's actions can affect more people than he may ever imagine.  As if that weren't enough, we see Sarah's evolution from human to machine due to her obsession with teaching John about weapons.<br/><br/>Plus, it's just fun to watch a movie where characters are saying the world will end on August 29th, 1997.<br/><br/>Overall, great movie.

Also, there isn't really anyone to root for in this one (unlike pulling for Hamilton in the original).  As a fan of the original, it was nice to see a a sequel with a purpose.  It is obvious that T2 was made for a specific reason and not to just bleed money from the fans of the 1st movie (like most sequels).  T2 is obviously a great movie, but it should not be grouped with the classics (other than the sci-fi classics). Great movie."

","I've been in love with this movie since i first saw it when i was six years old.  It has intense effects and all the ingredients that make a great scifi/action movie.  Hamilton's acting and character greatly improved from the first one and Arnie is so much better as a good-guy.  It's worth buying on DVD to see the special edition with all the deleted scenes and all the extras on how the movie was made.  The guns and driving scenes made the movie awesome also.  A must see for everybody."

","Being 15 years old, I never saw the Terminator series when it was all the rage. I only recently saw T2 and am amazed by the movie. The plot is one of the best I have ever seen, the acting is amazing and the visual effects are incredible.When my dad was always saying how good the terminator movies were, I never really listened to him. Because they were old movies, I thought they would suck. However, the movie was way better than any movie I had seen recently. The best visual effect in the movie is the way T-1000 blends in with the checkerboard floor in the mental institution.<br/><br/>BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! It will probably always be. Although, I do look forward to T3!"

","I think that most people wouldn't expect to see ""T2"" compared with films like ""Ben Hur"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"" but it belongs in the same category as these legendary films.  Really, why couldn't ""T2"" be put along side other classic films of this century, other than the fact that it isn't old enough to be considered a classic yet.  I would like to breakdown ""T2"" so that it can be seen that it does deserve its own pedestal.<br/><br/>First of all, in order to understand the subtext of its incredible story, you must stripe away all the eye candy, the special effects, the stunts, the violence and look at the core of the story.  In essence, ""T2"" is a film about the human spirit; its uniqueness, its power, its separation from that of the machine.  We see how the human race has digressed in time, how the ability of the human mind was taken for granted in order turn the fate of the human race over to a machine.  In fact, the entire existence of our race is defined and ultimately control and destroyed by a machine (Skynet).  The film is about the conflict between man and machine, their resistances to one another and their dependence on each.  This is a very serious subject that affects all of us.  ""T2""'s story explores and gives a result to this and does it in a manner which is extremely entertaining.  Its story is genius, incredibly importance to all of us and told in such a way that we learn and have fun simultaneously.<br/><br/>Now, we can talk about why it is a modern classic.  ""T2"" incorporates all the elements which make up a great action flick.  A big star (in fact, the biggest), stellar special effects, high octane action, a strong conflict between good and evil, great stunt work and lots of fun and excitement.  Put the appropriate amount of these contemporary visuals together with a great story filled with strong human emotion and you have a ""Ben Hur"" for the 90s. James Cameron is all to familar with knowing what viewers want to see and need to know.  Look within ""T2"" and you may find that the movie is, in fact, a film.  (Look for a Director's Cut with 18 additional minutes which heighten the emotion elements of the film)"

"villani","Null","1","1","2 April 2002"," Message to humankind...
","The Terminator and the T1000 represent desires within humans, and their struggle in the film represents the classic fight between good and evil. The Terminator fights for a future embracing life and humanity, while his enemy fights for death and destruction. Through their actions, both characters transcend their machine form by tapping into an aspect of the humanity around them. Terminator 2 presents a grim future in which the war against the machines establishes the enemy as technology; however, the threat that the T1000 poses to mankind is a smokescreen shielding the true identity of the enemy. At the gas station where two children are shooting each other, John realizes that the reason humans won't survive, and the real enemy threatening their existence, is the human tendency to destroy themselves.<br/><br/>The T1000 embodies the evil within humans; human technology created him, he takes the human form of all the people that he kills, he shows a consistent lack of respect for human life throughout the movie, and his mission is to destroy the leader of the human resistance. As the T1000 meets his doom in the hot pit, he manifests all the human forms that he has embodied, men and women of different races. He is more than a machine. He is a cross section of the evil in humanity. <br/><br/>The Terminator is a larger than life character, able to walk through gunfire without flinching and throw people out windows with force; however, his most important heroic aspect is the wisdom and hope that he brings to mankind. Sarah states the theme in the last narration of the film, saying that she `faces the future with a sense of hope because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe [humans] can too.' The wisdom that the Terminator brings is his own evolved respect for the human life. His initial instinct as a Terminator is to kill, but John begins his evolution by telling him that he is, `not a Terminator anymore,' and he can't just go around killing people. When the Terminator says goodbye to John and Sarah before he is lowered into the pit, there is a close-up of his human profile, not showing the exposed mechanical side, and he tells John that he `knows now why [John] cries.' This CPU computer has learned what it is to be human by acquiring human emotions. Then the camera focuses on the handshake between Sarah and the Terminator, which is another example of his increased humanity. Finally, as a last sign of the Terminator's embodiment of the human desire to strive for life, he claims that he must be lowered in to the pit because he `cannot self-terminate.'<br/><br/>The film's message is best summarized by the quote Sarah carves on the table; `The future is not set. There's no fate but that which we make for ourselves.' The technology that humans created for the year 2029 shows a grim future to look forward to, but that is only if humans continue on their self-destructive path. Technology and progress are not the enemies, but rather where humans choose to take that technology that is the enemy. Though Terminator 2 is a science fiction movie, the message is not far removed from reality, which serves to make the movie highly ideologically disturbing."

","What can one say about a movie that about which everything has been said? How can one find something critical to say about a movie which is as close to perfection as one can make? These are two questions which you have to ask yourself when submitting a user comment for a movie like this, and it is no easy task. The answer to the first question is probably to just go ahead and say your say and tell yourself that although it is only a drop in the ocean, it is a drop nonetheless. The second question poses a far greater challenge. Answers to this will be very short indeed and may be included if only to satisfy a desire for a sense of completeness. As far as finding points to cheer, it is difficult to find a place to start. Terminator 2 has its rightful place in cinematic history and when seeing its high rating on the IMDB site, I still feel that it is underrated.<br/><br/>The first item which I wish to discuss is what can be attributed to its longstanding appeal. I believe the answer lies not solely, but to a large part due to the fact that James Cameron can combine a flowing story with high action and spellbinding special effects. The story acts as a precipitant for the action and not vice verse as is the case with most movies within the genre. We have character development, moral dilemmas, and character arcs. All these story elements combine seamlessly to leave audiences spellbound.<br/><br/>Character development will be examined from the point of view that the characters from the original have changed over the years. The experience would have left its indelible mark and would have changed their outlook on life. This is particularly evidently in Sarah and John.<br/><br/>Sarah's physical adaptation is not the mirror of her emotional adaptation, which it far exceeds. The imminent day of horror weighs heavily on her shoulders. Her way of telling the world has been one of desperate outbursts culminating into an attempt to destroy Cyberdyne. Her knowledge of the future and her militant attempts at trying to divert it has meant that society has seen her as mentally unstable and she is rightfully detained for treatment. Her physical adaptation is surprising for audiences since she is identified with her meekness in the original and the TV series Beauty and the Beast'. She is now a soldier, ready for the onslaught against mankind and her son. It was a logical progression for the character and inspired interest since there was emotional conflict between being a mother and preparing for the battle ahead. This change was a monumental factor in the sequel being the superior.<br/><br/>John was not born in the original, but the character that is introduced to us is feasible to the story. He has a mother who lacks emotional stability and he is now in the care of apathetic foster parents following her detention. John is now a rebellious youngster operating outside the rules of society. Self  destruction is his escape - a far cry from being the saviour of mankind.<br/><br/>The Terminator was a positive change for Arnold. It put him in the place of the hero. It must have been tantalising for Arnold who probably wanted to soften his image as an out and out action hero. The role was perfect for that. The Terminator although retaining the same basic programming of the original, that is, to remove all obstacles permanently, had to protect a child. He was now on the side of the good. This entailed the concomitant respect for human life, something the young John wanted to teach him. Given the fact that this was a virtual complete turnaround from the original, the plot created the opportunity  and it worked. This change was the platform for the moral message. No matter how grim the future may seem, we must still respect human life.<br/><br/>The T1000 is the Terminator sent to prevent the victory of man. He is the replacement for Arnold, but we do not notice this since Arnold and Patrick are so strong in their roles, they stamp their authority and lay claim to them. Patrick is phenomenal as the T1000. His mechanical walk illustrates robotic efficiency and malevolent intent whilst emphasising his confident power and purpose. His piercing stare indicates his resolute drive to accomplish his sole objective.<br/><br/>The character arc is the journey of self  discovery that the character has taken during this particular film. Sarah was still battling with her demons as she once again became a vigilante and goes to terminate the computer programmer. She had little faith in mankind, faith that was ironically rekindled by the Terminator. The machine had learnt to identify with humans and if the machine was capable, then mankind was capable of acceptance of others. She had progressed to retain her humanity and to recognise the humanity in others.<br/><br/>John had momentarily gained a family, albeit a machine for a father. It had given him a sense of purpose and realisation of what was to come. John had come back onto the rails and when they had changed the future, he was given a sound foundation to live a normal life. <br/><br/>The Terminator by way of his learning processor had commanded a sense of human emotion. It was this that gave hope, the kind of hope that Sarah was looking for. This was a quantum leap from the original Terminator.<br/><br/>The moral dilemma, already touched on, is that no matter what the future holds, human life must be respected. It is not a case of tough situations require tough solutions. Respect for human life is the foundation of moral rights. The right to live is fundamental to mankind.<br/><br/>Another interesting issue was the one concerning the changing of the future. There is no fate, but what we make' was the impetus behind the story. The machines had developed the capability to do this, but it was used against them. It presents a dilemma to us, knowing what the future is and how we should deal with it. These actions define us as human beings.<br/><br/>It is these story elements that meant that the movie ensured it's longevity for audience memory. Mission Impossible 2' is an example of how a lack of story substance can make a movie forgettable, no matter how good the action sequences are.<br/><br/>The only possible fault I could find is during the introduction the Terminator approaches you as the credits are completed. This could be construed as cheesy, but it could also mean Prepare for an action rollercoaster ride'. Cameron had well omitted the imperfections of the original.<br/><br/>The Terminator is an icon within pop culture. The ability to solve our problems with impunity and overwhelming destructive power is a fantasy for many. Our fascination with creating something that could turn on is has long been immortalised in storytelling. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein' is a good example. We have grown up on similar stories and the good ones endear themselves to history. This story surpassed its original, a feat achieved by the cinematic few  Godfather 2' and Star Wars 2'  are the esteemed company it keeps. It is deserved."

The movie is a fascinating continuation of the 1984 original (basically a feature length chase scene like the first.)<br/><br/>As always Cameron takes the time to flesh out his characters in this movie and by establishing an emotional connection with his audience he amplifies the impact so much more. Linda Hammilton is fantastic as the tortured heroine ( Another great female character from Cameron.)<br/><br/>The special fx are eye popping, and this movie introduced the word ""Morph"" in the english vocabulary.<br/><br/>I also liked Robert Patric as the indestructible T-1000 (one of the best villains of all time.) and too bad he didn't have more screen time ....what villain will Cameron cook up in the third sequel??

","I remember seeing the first Terminator, and it was very good.  Though, this one sparked many areas that the first one did not.  This movie had action, and suspense, and acting, and(of course) graphics that out-did the first one.  I may be talking into my generation, but it's an opinion that I hold, and one that I will keep.  Finally, Arnold was able to play the good guy, and he was still his old self.  The grim faced get-outta-way terminator that we all loved from the first one.  Linda Hamilton also improved, showing she can defend herself this time instead of always running.  To me, it's hard to decifer that a mental institution can turn you into a gun handling combat marine when you were once a soft hearted little angel that just wanted to be hugged.  But, that's what it was and it was fine with me.  I loved every moment of this action flick.  The soundtrack was above average, but the graphics are definitly the highlight of this film.  Nothing looked unreal, like it did in the first Terminator.  The bad guy was totally awesome.  He was basically indestructable in which made the movie actually pretty scary at times.  Horror and action made a nice blend for this movie.  Terminator 2: Judgement Day was definitely ""Bad to the bone"" and earned my 10/10 rating. My one complaint was the fight scene between the two terminators, kinda lame."
"exterminator_99","Null","1","1","19 March 2002"," The ultimate action sci-fi film
","Looking back to 1991, the hype surrounding ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" was immense.  In the seven years since the release of the original film, Arnold Schwarzenegger had become one of the biggest stars of the 1980's, James Cameron had directed two huge films in ""Aliens"" and ""The Abyss"" and more so, special effects technology had gone from Ray Harryhausen style stop-go motion effects to the new, as it was then, world of Computer Generated Images, now affectionately known as CGI.  ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" largely lived up to its hype, replacing the cold, stark apocalyptic outlook of the original for an violent, action packed, effects laden rollercoaster ride.  It works surprisingly well, despite its reliance on the original film for story and flow.<br/><br/>The film opens in the future.  Reiterating what many audiences know from the original film, we are introduced to John Connor, the unborn son of Sarah Connor, who was targeted for annihilation by the machines in the original movie.  John's face is marked with deep scars  war wounds inflicted in his efforts to destroy the machines that now rule the post-nuclear holocaust world.  We learn that a Terminator was sent through time to destroy his mother and failed.  Now the machines have sent another Terminator back in time, this time to destroy John as a twelve-year-old boy.  The Resistance also sends someone back in time to destroy the new Terminator and save the life of the saviour of mankind.<br/><br/>From the opening scenes we are reminded almost exactly of the original film. Firstly we are introduced to Arnold Schwarzenegger's character  a re-programmed T-800 Terminator, sent back by John Connor himself thirty years in the future.  It seems almost unusual that this role remains Arnold's best  he is at his peak when playing someone with no emotion.  In amazing shape (he was 44 at the time), Arnold is pure machismo on screen. It's probably fair to say this was the last great Arnie movie where he got to display his strength for tough guy characters.  The opening scene, where Arnold procures clothing and a motorbike, also gives the audience a new angle on the Terminator series.  Humour is introduced for the first time, and somehow it fits into the film effectively well.  Perhaps Cameron knew we already had an distinct knowledge of the character that humour would present a new side to him?<br/><br/>Early on in the film we are not aware that Arnold's T-800 is actually the good guy.  Then we are introduced to the T-100, played by relative unknown (as he was then) Robert Patrick.  Steely eyed and menacingly lithe, Patrick's T-1000 is the epitome of cool tech-evil.  If machines could make a weapon of assassination, this would be it.  Aware that the T-800 and T-1000 are in a race to find John first, we await their first encounter.  It follows after John and Sarah are introduced. <br/><br/>The groundwork for John's character is surprisingly well thought out.  Now in the care of foster parents, John is the ultimate pre-teen rebel, belting around on his motorcross bike to the screams of Guns n' Roses.  His foster parents are ineffectual and are not able to control him.  We learn that Sarah is now in a mental institute for the criminally insane.  Haunted by visions of the apocalypse, Sarah has tried to escape on numerous occasions only to be caught and returned to asylum.  Recognising that her son is man's saviour (John Connor's initials are J.C.  Jesus Christ?  Or perhaps James Cameron?), she is desperate to find him and keep him safe for the impending doom that man faces.<br/><br/>When both Terminators locate John the action begins.  Armed with a massive budget (the $92 million spent on the film was the most ever at the time), Cameron stages some amazing action sequences.  Often we are left mouth agape at the skill and audacity Cameron displays on bringing the action to the screen.  Another outstanding feature of ""T2"" is the way in which Cameron eschews action with strong dramatic tension.  When we see the T-1000 in action his veritable indestructibility leaves the audience reeling. Arnold's T-800 is a tank compared to the T-1000's stealth fighter capability and Cameron's use of effects to display the malleability of the T-1000 are still mightily impressive, even in today's CGI dominated science fiction domain.<br/><br/>The effects occasionally overtake the story for film adhesion, but there are some effective touches.  John, whose orders the T-800 follows to the hilt, builds a strong relationship with the android.  A patriarchal bond is established as he teaches the T-800 sayings, orders him not to kill and gives him an insight into human feelings.  Sure, it could have been realised to a greater extent, but it is still effective.  Watching Arnold destroy everything in his path, but only shooting to maim or surprise is very refreshing.<br/><br/>It could be argued that the film is too long, the ending, while entertaining, is certainly overdone, but such is Cameron's style that he goes for a big blow-out at the end of each of his films.  It's not over until he says so, and that usually isn't when you expect it. <br/><br/>
While the original is a better all round film, especially for its originality and use of tension and sci-fi scare tactics, ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is still the ultimate sequel.  Big, brash and bold, it signals the zenith of Arnold Schwarzenegger's career as a muscle-bound superstar and solidifies James Cameron's name as one of the better science fiction and action directors to work in Hollywood."

But to be honest, no other movie of Mr.Arnie, the former multiple Mr.Universe,Mr.World,Mr.Germany,Mr.Olympia,Mr.Europe,Mr.this and Mr.that has been a near perfect movie as this one other than the great Kindergarten Cop which is better than every other movie of Schwarzenegger.( Some Others mentionable only for Action and some Comedy such as:Conan the Barbarian(1982);True Lies(1994)(Remember the '9/11' attacks?);Predator(1987);Twins(1988);Total Recall(1990)and the 'more-genuinely-acted' End Of Days(1999)). If any critic/fan/judging person says that this is the greatest action movie of all time than he is partly right.Because there are lots of emotions and philosophical realities in this movie as well. As one the Arnie's famous one-liner says:""It's in your(humans') nature to destroy to yourselves(themselves)."" Nothing is so ironical reality as this one when it comes to humans. Also this one:""I do not know why you(humans) cry but that is something I(cyborgs) can never do."" This explains that if Machines can understand us why  can't we homo-sapiens, who are so cruel and blood thirsty inspite of the fact that nature has gifted us with emotions so that we express our joys,griefs and also guide others?And as this one-liner of Schwarzenegger goes :""..."".That's enough,its better if those reading this comments who haven't watch this movie go and watch it NOW. As far as the characters are concerned, Linda Hamilton has been very fluent, smooth and sophisticated in the role of Sarah, expressing beautifully the 'motherly-love' in her for her child John,whose life is in danger(""You are too important, John!"").Edward Furlong was too good as the vulnerable John in whose hands lie the protection of the future of humans. Also Robert Patrick was great as the mean and the menacing T-1000 who will never ever say 'die' until he has completed his job of destruction.(""Your foster parents are dead."")

James Cameron(Terminator,The(1984);Aliens(1986);Abyss,The(1989);True Lies(1994);Titanic(1997)) as always has an ace in his hands.The above films have been milestones for other movies to follow. The Action in this movie is mind blowing considering the huge production cost.(Ofcourse I'm a Terminator."") The Visual and Sound Effects(especially the haunting background scores) are trully great.(They deserved the Oscars they won.)

","The debate about whether The Terminator or T2 is the better movie is, i believe,entirely pointless since they are essentially the same movie; i prefer to regard one as a continuation of the other with the difference that in T2 James Cameron had a $100 million dollar budget!  On the first night in London there was nearly a riot to get into the Odeon to see it,but i managed it and saw it another six times before i had had enough. The crucial difference to T1 is of course the introduction of Robert Patrick as the ""liquid metal"" T-1000 [what happened to Ts801-999 ?] who gives an outstanding performance filled with menace in his sigle minded pursuit of young John Connor.The special effects are incredible especially the ""nuke"" scene which a radio commentator described as a ""toilet moment"" i.e. so traumatic that he had to rush out to the toilet rather than face it! Some aspects of T2 make more sense if you see the special edition, but together the two movies form the best Science Fiction Movie ever.10/10 or *****  P.S Those who like the time travel and cyborg elements of T1+T2 will find the New Outer Limits episodes ""A Stitch In Time"" and ""The Camp"" respectively,right up their street!"

","TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is spectacular. The acting, the special effects, the music, the action........are wonderful! This is definitely a sci-fi action movie that an audience would not want to miss. In my opinion, the spotlight of the movie is the special effects. As you sit back and enjoy T2, you'd find yourself with your eyes wide open as you watch the special effects take place. The best special effects are applied on the T-1000 (played by Robert Patrick), and I mean it. T-1000 is this shape shifting guy (liquid metal) that can take shape at pleasure with its own body. There are certain scenes where certain parts of T-1000's body changes shape, and those effects are amazing. It's special effects took a step further than its period of production. This movie rules, and I think it really did deserved the Oscars it won."
"thecrow_23","10","1","1","14 February 2002"," It makes your eyes go cross
","Don't get me wrong, I think this is one of the best films ever made, no doubt. However, I was sitting around watching it one day when I had a thought. Say something happened where Sarah and John were actually able to prevent the war and the apocalypse never happened. Ok, well then John would instantaneously have to disappear, because if there was no war, why would Kyle Reese be sent back. And if he wasn't sent back, he and Sarah would never meet, i.e. there would be no existence of John Connor. Sarah would probably lose all memory of him and the war, and would go back to her wimpy existence as a student/waitress. I know this is really overkill and that it is ""just a movie,"" but it is still sort of neat to ponder these things.<br/><br/>Also, how in the world was John born in the first place before the war even began? I am of the opinion that the future hasn't happened yet, so it is difficult to imagine him being born essentially before his father was.<br/><br/>So whenever all looks like it is won for the humans and John, if he is still there, obviously somehow the job hasn't been done. It can make your eyes go cross to think like this about reality and time, but take a deep breath and try to realize, as I did, that time travel has too many liabilities to make a genuinely believable concept. I am not saying at all that it tarnishes the film in any way. I know it is just fiction, and I do have fun watching it. But I'm just saying what came to my mind.

"zipdaddy","Null","1","1","11 February 2002"," One of the best movies ever made...
","On the surface, Terminator 2 is THE benchmark for technical excellence in a movie.  Clean, well shot, with some of the most excellent special effects ever presented on the big screen.  Cameron's vision is legendary, second only to his directing acumen.  But there is more to this movie, SO MUCH MORE.<br/><br/>I was only a kid when T2 came out, so I was immediately swept up in hype, marketing, overpowering merchandising, etc.  It was not until my later years that I've come to truly appreciate this film.  The parallels between this and the original are outstanding.  I find that it's best enjoyed if you try to put your self in Sarah Connor's (Linda Hamilton) shoes.  Wouldn't that f*ck with your mind?  Your peaceful, ho-hum existence shattered when you're told that an unstoppable killing machine has been sent back from the future to kill you?  That your son is the Messiah (figuratively, of course)? Imagine your son's father coming back to protect you to ensure the future of all humanity...and that barely scratches the surface.<br/><br/>10 years later, after a decade of running and gunning that is only hinted at, your son is straying from his path as the savior, and you're locked in an institution, unable to influence events that only you can foresee. Haunted by dreams of a lost love (check the special edition DVD if you don't know what I'm talking about) who keeps reminding you of the urgency of your situation.  And suddenly, you're freed, only to find that your once mortal enemy is your only chance to survive another brush with an even more unstoppable machine.  Imagine having to place your trust in a machine who's ""face"" proliferates your worst nightmares. As you can see, this movie is NOT about John, or the Terminator(s), but about Sarah, and her vision of mankind and it's future.  The power of that vision is what drives the movie, not the flashy (but oh-so beautiful) special effects.  Watch it with this in mind, and remember Sarah Connor's last comments:<br/><br/>""If a machine can learn the value of human life, why can't we?""<br/><br/>Enjoy."
"Old Joe","Null","1","1","10 February 2002"," Same make. Same model. New mission.
","Terminator 2 would have to be one of the world's greatest movie sequels. I actually watched this film before the original, and it really astounded me. I love the way the audience is taken on such a joy ride with this film. The main stars are back for a second time, as is the director, with some new faces that makes this film all the more enjoyable. <br/><br/>It is the year 1995, John Connor, the earth's redeemer, is a healthy young rebellious 10-year-old. John's mother, Sarah, is being held captive in a mental institution, against her will. However, John's life is in danger when a new type of Terminator is sent to kill him. However, the same model Cyborg that was sent to kill Sarah over a decade ago is now on a new mission. He is to protect John at any cost. The world's future lies in a machine's hands; can he save the world and John Connor? <br/><br/>This film is a standout for me, because of the special effects that it contains. It makes the Terminator films all the more fascinating for the audience. To see a creature being able to mould itself into almost any thing was unbelievable. The credit for this side of T2 must go to the special effects team, who were brilliant at making this all seem so real, when it really isn't. The way we see the evil Terminator just transforms himself into anything he pleases is quite amazing.<br/><br/>The cast of Terminator 2 was again, pretty good in my view. I want to first of all talk about the new stars of the series. Firstly we get to see the acting debut of unknown talent Edward Furlong. He was excellent in the role of the world's new savior, John Connor. Edward was also brilliant in the controversial film, American history X, alongside Edward Norton. That film confronted racism, had an extreme amount of violence, but was a great film to watch. The second new face in Terminator 2 was the bad guy, Robert Patrick. He role mind-blowing, in the way that we get to see him run around and then change into any figure he likes. Patrick has had an interesting career, with a short stint in the popular TV series, X-files, with some of his other film credits including Die Hard 2, The Faculty and Striptease.<br/><br/>The cast members that returned for a second time were all pretty good in their roles. Arnold Schwarzenegger kept his promise about being back, with an exceptional role as the protective Cyborg in T2. I love the way that both him and Edward Furlong's roles are so close, it actually makes the film a much better film, considering it is not an all out violent action film. Then you have Linda Hamilton, who returns as John Connor's mother, Sarah. In this movie though, Sarah is a different person altogether. She is a psycho, who cannot escape from mental institute. I read one person's opinion on her role, saying that it was almost over the top. I disagree, considering her character needed to change, it would not have suited the films if she were not the tough girl in the second film. <br/><br/>Terminator 2, while it is a much better film, because of the time it was made and the budget it would have had, it does in some way resemble the first film. I guess it had to. I am not talking about the storyline, but some scenes that are included in it. The one scene that is similar would have to be the nitrogen truck scene, where the two Terminators do battle. I loved it, but I can understand some viewers not. There other scenes in this movie, which feels like a carbon of the first, but are more paced making them much better. I am talking about such scenes as the motorbike chase when the evil terminator is trying to kill John, not to similar to the first film when the evil terminator is trying to kill Sarah. <br/><br/>Then again we do have the special effect scenes that are just amazing, where the evil Cyborg is able to make himself turn into almost anything he pleases. The scene are all outstanding, with the best scenes being the ones where we see him running around the mental hospital, with him in front everyone walking through a metal door. The doctor that did not believe any of Sarah's stories is left dumbfounded by what he sees. These scenes would have taken months of planning, but they were done to perfection.<br/><br/>So with all that in mind, I can only praise this terrific sequel. James Cameron has out done himself. He has had a funny career and life for that matter. One of his biggest films was of course Titanic, which I can no longer bear to watch and he had been married five times, with one of his five wives being Terminator star, Linda Hamilton. All that aside he has had a winner with the terminator projects. We are in for a treat as there is to be a Terminator 3 in 2003, which hopefully can be as good as its predecessors.   <br/><br/>The people I ask have constantly told me that Terminator 2 is the better of the two films. I cannot disagree with that. With its great special effects and cast nothing will change the public's mind about this movie. Sit back, relax and be blown away by T2: Judgment Day, Hasta la vista, baby!<br/><br/>Rating: 4.5 Stars or 9/10"

","""T2"" is a first-rate film that fundamentally changed the way we looked at films ten years ago. It is a very emotional, very original, very worthy follow-up to the original ""Terminator"". In many ways, it's a better film than the first one, in that there is much more solidity and more elements and ingredients to make thirty movies. I prefer the Theatrical version over the Special Edition because the additions are so overwhelming that you think you have a film of tremendous scale that it is harder to watch and enjoy. The acting is wonderful, the story is insanely involving, the special effects are mind-boggling. James Cameron is a flat-uot filmmaking genius. Bravo!

","Once again Cameron made a sequel that was far better than the original. The first time was Aliens , and that was the best film i had ever seen until he made this one. This movie has got everything that makes films good, and done to perfection. It was a breakthrough in action and effects, the story was very well told, and you care about the characters. It grabs you right from the beginning until the very last minute. In my opinion a movie is perfect when you have seen it more than 10 times orso, and when you see it again, you can`t go away from it anymore until you have watched it to the end again.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed when i find out that Cameron will not direct part 3, because i think he was the only one who could match or better this one. I will definitively see it, but i expect a disappointment compared with this one."
"IanMckay5","10","1","1","7 September 2001"," Excellent Film, Good Graphics, Decent Night In, Satisfied!
","That's one way to describe this piece of material that Cameron has provided - having helmed such films previously like Aliens, it's not difficult to predict that this might be a likeable film - but it proceeds to show us that it is much better than what we might have first thought of as a likeable film. <br/><br/>Basically, two terminators are sent back through time. Arnold Schwarzenegger's role is massively extended in this one - giving us more reason to like the film. Hamilton is truly great as Sarah Connor. She gives a very real performance. Sadly, the scene with Michael Biehn was cut from the final print (tell me why!) Robert Patrick comes over as an ice cold villain with absolutely no mercy (except maybe in 1 part.) His termination raises a cheer after he devestates Arnie's metallic body in the steel factory at the end. Furlong's performance could've been better. However, he does have one or two good scenes, but in the more powerful scenes, he has trouble performing the emotions. This was a truly great film. <br/><br/>My only worry now is that Terminator 3 and Terminator 4 will be as good as the prequels -- I'm starting to have my doubts.<br/><br/>But let's wait and see. It might be a lot better than we expect. This vehicle certainly was. JC deserves a pat on the back...<br/><br/>as does Schwarzenegger and the entire crew for making a great film."

This movie is filled with action, one scene after the other.  Great storyline also, especially the fact that the Terminator 1000 is much harder to kill and Arnold Schwarzzenegger has to risk his life to save Sarah and John Connor.

Add that to a great sci-fi story and you end up with one of the few sequels that improves upon a great original in nearly every way.

"FredDurst1235692","Null","1","1","13 August 2001"," Is this a repeat?
","Really, stripping off the special effects and budget, this film is a copy from the original Terminator.  I saw a programme where Cameron explained that Arnie's set trailer cost more than the first film and realised where this film relies on: budget. The first had an excellent plot and this was ripped off in the second, OK, first copy: the first scene when the Terminator arrives, secondly, the factory and the steel plant at the end of both films, eg. a scramble for survival etc. The plot is also tacky and relies heavily on the tracks made by the first, eg. when the chip and arm were left in the factory the film finishes and then in the second, we see that Cyberdine own the arm and chip, this was not explained in either of the films and we as an audience are left to presume that the factory at the end of the first was Cyberdine, not shown recently until the DVD came out with deleted footage. There are also several plot disturbances, one of them being that Sarah was a young, average girl next door, then immediately we see in the second that she is streetwise, knows how to use guns, is tough and in Pescadero mental home where as at the end of the first she drove off into the sunset happily. So, all in all, I thought that T2 was a not so cheap cash-in and OTT. 4/10"

It is just a great movie on all levels, and it is very fun to watch, and it's one of the few sequels that is better than the original although it didn't connect well with it (John should have only been 7 years old)."

I'm also not the type to see a movie simply for the special effects, but when they are exceptional, as they are here, I enjoy them.  The story is really what is good here however, and doesn't detract from the outstanding original.<br/><br/>
	The film does have a couple of debatable aspects, namely the maudlin ending and parts when the cyber-guys don't act like machines (facial expressions when alone and obviously meant to impress the audience since no humans are around on the screen---and why oh why I ask you doesn't the bad Terminator just run after the victims in the plant at the end instead of just ominously walking?).  But I am more than willing to forgive those detractors as they add to the allure of the movie.  Overall an enjoyable piece of sci-fi filmmaking."

","For adrenaline-fueled action & suspense, great FX, cast, soundtrack and more, it's hard to be T2. It's even got a love interest, although you need to view the director's cut or see the first Terminator movie to see this. With its apocalyptic, but not completely void of hope, vision of the future, T2 leaps off the screen and into your face and stays there. I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie, and I still watch it (I own the director's cut). Linda Hamilton's tough-tender Sarah Connor is one of the best female characters ever created for the screen. In order to get the complete story and appreciate her character's evolution, however, you need to watch both Terminator films--which is not to say that either film does not stand on its own; they do. Full of memorable scenes and great one-liners. Cameron's direction is fast-paced, the editing tight and the sound terrific. A classic in the sci-fi pantheon. Among the scenes cut from the final release is a dream sequence in which Kyle Reese visits Sarah Connor in the state hospital. In my opinion, it should've been left in: it reminds us of what she's lost and fleshes out her character even more."

This is gripping stuff and the special effects are revolutionary throughout the movie, especially the T-1000 liquid metal scenes that are really dazzling to watch.

","The Silence Of The Lambs was not the only masterpiece of 1991! There was also another movie called Terminator 2. Direct sequel to 1984´s hit movie The Terminator. 7 years after the original, film technology was not the same. The director used the latest FX in film industry to show his vision. And it was surly great. Breathtaking effects & action scenes who updated the genre to the much higher levels. The movie gives you the two coolest robots in movie history (along side with Bishop in Aliens). Also the second strongest action female star (after Ripley in Aliens) of all time. Everything from technical, directing, casting, music, atmosphere to the screenplay is great. This is the second time that James Cameron doing a sequel that is actually better than the original (he made also Aliens). I hope that True Lies 2(2002) is going to be even funnier & better than the original. You have to learn from history that you can trust James Cameron.  He is one of my greatest inspirations. I have seen all his movies several times (not the first one: Pirhana II from 1981). I could not find it on IMDB witch is bizarre. Here is the magical career of James Cameron in short: sensational hit low budget movie of 1984: The Terminator. The dynamic & adrenalin kick movie of 1986: Aliens. The very special one of 1989 & the godfather of CGI movies: The Abyss. The unbelievable eye candy of 1991 & another CGI godfather: Terminator 2. The gigantic action-comedy of 1994: True Lies.<br/><br/>And the most brilliant epic magic movie making of all time who was the unsinkable movie of 1997-1998 in Cinemas: Titanic. What a career!! T 2 is the reason that Steven Spielberg left go-motion for CGI in Jurassic Park (1993). T 2 is also the reason that George Lucas decided to do Episode I (1999) because now the technology was right for his vision. Forget Terminator 3 without James Cameron. T 2 IS the one you should remember. Four time Oscar winning Terminator 2 IS simply THE greatest, smartest, coolest & most brilliant action movie in the universe!!!! (10/10)."

After I saw it, I wanted to hit the sheets, because I was exhausted!  I saw the director's cut, with those scenes that didn't originally appear in the movie that they restored. Aren't you glad?  It's boss!  If you don't know the plot, pinch yourself hard, 'cause you deserve it.  Unless you watch movies in another country, than you know what it's about.  I bet everyone in the world knows what this dog's about.  In summary, watch this movie if you want to see some surrealist action filmaking. Rating: 10/10 (You should see the T-1000 with vegetables!)"

","Very few sequels surpass their predecessor.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Godfather"" are the few exceptions that come to mind.  Add to that list ""Terminator 2:  Judgment Day"".<br/><br/>This remarkable film not only beats the original but does not require you to have seen the first film.  The plot of ""T2"" is self-contained.  In this sequel we see John Connor (Edward Furlong) as a ten year old rebel.  He lives with his foster parents because his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) has been committed to a mental hospital because of her claims that a terminator had come to kill her in 1984.<br/><br/>A terminator has been sent back to kill John.  The T-1000 (Robert Patrick) which is more advanced than the original terminator, is sent back to eliminate the future leader of the human resistance.  To protect John, the resistance sent back a T-800 (Schwarzenegger).  The T-800 must protect John throughout the film and as John attempts to break his mother out of the institute.  The T-800, Sarah, and John must now attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne Industries the company that will eventually create the technology that will lead to the computer takeover of the future.<br/><br/>This film is unique in many ways.  Character development is a critical element to the plot.  In this sequel, we see a transformed Sarah Conner.  In the original, she was reliant upon Reese (Michael Biehn).  In ""T2"" we see her as a self-reliant, mentally tough warrior.  She is in peak physical condition and trained in weaponry.  She along with the T-800 take on the responsibility of protecting John, despite the fact that she must overcome her initial distrust of the terminator.  We also see a development of the T-800 in a sense.  Throughout the film John tries to help him act more human-like.  <br/><br/>In addition to the plot, the cast is another high point of the film. Schwarzenegger is obviously at his best, Linda Hamilton does a great job reprising her role as Sarah.  The newcomer to the film is Edward Furlong, and I must say he does well for an untrained actor.  He brings attitude and a sense of toughness to the character.  A great supporting cast including Joe Morton, Earl Boen, and Robert Patrick as the evil and stoic T-1000 also make this film what it is.  Patrick is not physically intimidating yet makes up for it with his dark demeanor.  He is the perfect villain.<br/><br/>Special effects are truly the highlight of ""T2"".  The computer effects as well as the stunts and makeup are highly deserving of praise.  The special effects department does a great job of bringing the T-1000's ""liquid metal"" effect to the screen.  The stunts and fight sequences between the two terminators are very well choreographed and filmed.  This film is worth watching for the special effects alone.<br/><br/>""T2"" is one of the greatest movies ever created.  It combines a great cast and story with incredible special effects and stunts.  This is a must see for any film fan."

","Pay attention to this movie.  It will teach you many lessons.  First, it is a well made film.  The lighting, camera work, and well-choreographed action scenes are all a lesson in movie making.  And the acting is great too, especially Linda Hamilton's immortal performance.  But most profound of this movie is its meaning.  Are we really in control of what we make?  Are the machines really our slaves, or are they our masters?  It's a lot of meaning hidden behind a lot of action.  Forget Titanic.  This is James Cameron's finest work ever."

"apoclypze0","Null","1","1","30 December 2000"," My favorite action film...
","Sure, you may consider it to be science fiction, but it's not.  ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is an action film in every sense of the word, for it delivers on the one promise that most action films don't: ACTION. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" has the most intense and audacious action sequences ever filmed.  Character development and plot exists too, although it is in a rather raw form.  The characters and plot are there only to give support to the action, and for that sense, the support is strong.  The film actually spends a large amount of time on it's characters and plot, but whenever there is too much, another jaw-dropping action scene comes along to save the day.  Note the helicopter and tanker chases on the freeways: if there has ever been a more stunning pursuit sequence ever filmed, please let me know.  Whoever thinks that violence cannot be beautiful has not seen this film.  The T1000, the villain, is superb--strong and intimidating--every film of this genre needs a good villain, for a good villain makes a good hero.  Ah-nuld, this time the hero, has never been cooler.  This was his peak, and he will never come close to making a film of this caliber ever again.<br/><br/>Enough already: just sit down, ignore the paradoxes, immerse yourself in the action, and enjoy the most stunning 2 and 1/2 hour waste of $100 million bucks you'll ever see.<br/><br/>9.5/10<br/><br/>btw, the DVD version is the medium this film needs to be seen on."
"odin2001","9","1","1","17 December 2000"," The definitive early 90's movie
","James Cameron seems incapable of directing out of his decade.  The Terminator looks VERY 80's, Titanic (despite being set almost a century ago) looks and feels VERY late 90's.  And Terminator 2 is the definitive early 90's movie, complete with it's soundtrack featuring Guns and Roses. T2 is a also a multi-faceted action epic touching on issues such as one's fate, advances in computer technology (done much better than it, say, The Matrix), and John Connor's search for a father.  There are some truly great moments in the movie such as when Sarah Connor says ""come here"" to her son after surviving an attempt on their lives by the sinister T-1000 (portrayed by a fabulous Robert Patrick).  John thinks this an invitation for a hug and a chance at some of the mother-son relationship that they've missed with her being in an institution.  But when he wraps his arms around her, he realizes she's checking for bullet wounds.  ""I'm fine!"" he protests.  ""John!"" she snaps back, ""You're too important!""  She thinks of him less as a son and more  as an icon for the future. The movie has very extreme action sequences and very subtle bits of sentimentality and criticism of the 90's lifestyle.  T2 is truly one of the greatest action movies of all time, as well as one of the greatest sequels of all time, as it surpasses the mood and action of the first while touching of issues that The Terminator never even considered."
"davidslicer","10","1","1","12 December 2000"," This review is for the DVD edition,which I highly recommend.
","""Terminator 2:Judgment Day"" was released at a time when movies were entering a new phase of technology.During my nineteenth year of my life and my fourteenth year of going to the movies,it was apparent that I had seen every movie that blew me away.The last time I had seen a film that blew me away before ""Terminator 2:Judgment Day"" was back in 1977.That film was ""Star Wars"" which changed all the rules in terms of visual effects.The art of visual effects would never be the same.At least that what I thought before I saw ""Terminator 2:Judgment Day"".I am not saying that ""Terminator 2:Judgent Day"" is far better than ""Star Wars"".""Star Wars"" is a classic in it' own right.But as the decade of the nineteen nineties was coming to an end,""Terminator 2:Judgment Day"" was too becoming a classic in it's own right.""The original Terminator movie was the kind of movie that dealt with the apocalypse and so did this sequel.Much of the cast and crew from ""The Terminator"" returned to make this box office smash which took six months to shoot.The fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger returned as the good guy came as a surprise to me.Linda Hamilton who reprised her role as Sarah Connor was more dramatic than ever.The sequel blew away ""The Terminator"" and blew away the special effects in ""Star Wars"".But The effects in ""Star Wars"" are still considered one of the best in cinematic history.I don't think that the filmmakers of ""Terminator 2:Judgment Day"" meant to outdo ""Star Wars"".They're both great films that deserved to recognized not just for their acheivements in special effects.But for their story.About ten years later(Well,almost)I rented the DVD edition of ""Terminator 2:Judgment Day"" which was pretty much more better than the theatrical version due to the fifeteen or twenty minutes of added footage that was added to this film.To tell you what these scenes were would not be right because because from what I figured,why spoil a movie.The DVD offers plenty of added fun material that explains about the production of the film.""Terminator 2:Judgment Day"" is also the one film I remember because of the villain played by Robert Patrick who could send a message to his victims with his cold stare.""Terminator2:Judgment Day"" was really great when it came out in theaters.But the DVD edition is far more superior in every detail.James Cameron who directed this film and who won the academy award for Best Director for ""Titanic"" has worked with Arnold Schwarzenneger on other films such as ""True Lies"" and they make a great team which is a shame that James Cameron will not be directing ""Terminator 3"".Word has it that John McTeirnan who made such films as ""Predator"" and Die Hard"" is directing.In ""The Terminator"",when Arnold said ""I'll be Back"",that's what he meant.In ""Terminator 2:Judgment Day"",he kept his promise.This film delivers all the goods and it was the most fun I ever had watching a film.Rent the ultimate edition DVD.I highly recommend it in every way."

It kind of defines why my obsession with films started (although that particular interest didn't become a real obsession until 1994). You know I got to bring out the dear ol' 10 for this one. :-) Anyway, T2 is the first films I have become O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D with, I can't even begin to explain how much I loved this movie.

"scurvyfreedman","9","1","1","13 October 2000"," Cameron never answered the question...
","For fans of the Terminator (1984) we know that the war was won by the humans.  They had smashed the grid, whatever that means.  In a last ditch effort the Artificially Intelligent computer system Skynet, built originally by Cyberdine Industries, sent the terminator back to kill Sarah Connor before her son John could even be conceived.  However, that Terminator failed in its mission.  But, somehow Skynet must have stayed in power, because the T-1000 series obviously was created much later in time than the Arnold model series.  It was a vast technological improvement that could only have been created much after Reese went back in time, as he had no knowledge of such a machine.  In fact, the humans apparently were to have blown up the time machine as soon as Reese went through.  It's a shame that Cameron never explained this.  Surely he could have tied up this huge loose end that makes the entirety of T2 impossible, based of course, on its own mythology, not a failure to willfully suspend disbelief."
"pitfall_5000","Null","1","1","11 October 2000"," Best action movie ever
","John Woo has made some good action movies.  The stunts and fights, and.....everything are usually good (until MI:2 came out, that is).  But no one, not even Woo, can compare to what James Cameron made in 1991. Terminator 2 is one of the best action movies ever made.  It is almost flawless.  It has, literally, everything that makes action films so deliciously appealing.  Even though it is a sequel (the best sequel ever) the viewer isn't hindered if they haven't seen the first one.  It so delicately explains what happened in the first one throughout the movie, so the viewer doesn't feel excluded or confused.  I saw this before I saw the first Terminator, and I understood it completely.  And even though it reviews the events of the first movie, it doesn't dumb it down so the audience understands.  This film, among others (The Abyss, Titanic, Aliens, True Lies), have established Cameron's place as one of the best film makers ever.  I can't wait for his next film.  It won't disappoint, I'm sure."

It deserved the Oscars it received with the special effects. If you haven't seen go and see it now. The new DVD version of T2 is brilliant.

"mjb442olds","10","1","1","29 August 2000"," TOTALLY AWESOME
","They say sequels never surpass the original. This one does, BIG TIME! Besides the special effects, and they are great, is the sheer terror and hopelessness the main characters are in. How do you stop a relentless, ruthless killing machine? Linda Hamilton was superb in T2.(I fell in love with that body!) She was almost as unstoppable as the machine in her pursuit of saving her son and mankind. I'm not a fan of your basic Sci-fi special effects. Snarling aliens drooling slime all over their victims, and gross mutant alien-babies popping out of humans don't thrill me. But it T2, Cameron does it best, it's more believable. With technology these things could happen. I was blown out of my seat with the EXTREME special effects, and chase scenes. This is the best action movie I have ever seen, BY FAR! If this movie doesn't blow you away, you better check your pulse rate. My recommendations? See it on a big screen and crank up the volume."
"jasonz42","10","1","1","18 August 2003"," The most spectacular film of the 20th century
","OK, my tagline is slightly wrong: it should read 20th and 21st century. So long as you enjoy action-adventure films, Terminator 2: Judgement Day will probably be the greatest film you ever watch. It is not just any ordinary action adventure film, because it combines what very few big-money blockbusters do- action scenes and characters. The main characters, Sarah and john Connor and the terminator are developed so well throughout the film that by the end you find yourself doing what you rarely do in films- actually caring about the characters. It is this caring that then makes the rest of the film so fantastic, because every aciton scene has meaning behind it. Helped along by a fool-proof, well thought out plot, every single scene adds to the film and makes it all the more deep and meaningful. Robert Patrick delivers a stunning performance as the evil T-1000 and Hamilton, Furlong and Schwarzenegger bond fantastically well to create the ultra-realistic situation. Flawed practically no where, combining plot, depth of character, development, interest, action and every other important aspect a film should have, T2 is a triumphant achievement that thoroughly deserves its top 100 place. The only criticism you could have is it wavers from the dark aspect of T1 and includes more action sequences, but this is more a personal preference. Even if you normally hate action films, watch this one because it re-defines what a big blockbuster should be. He'll be back. Jas"
"rvm-2","7","1","1","20 August 2000"," about as good as basic action movies get
","This movie is so deftly composed that the ""battle"" scenes take on a heightened reality. <br/><br/>Many action flicks - MI:2 is a good example - seem so absurd that it pops you back into reality rather than absorbing you into the action (in MI:2, for example, we are supposed to believe that the characters deliberately jump off their motorcycles to do a high speed body slam, fall 50 ft., survive without injury and shake it off immediately, then resume their fight.... puh-leaze, take a course in physics, or at least common sense). T2 seems believable, in the sense that the terminators act in much the way their capabilities are outlined, and the way the scenes unfold with a degree of intelligence. <br/><br/>That intelligence undoubtably comes from Director Cameron: you get the impression that he didn't just blindly shoot a scene, but stood their scratching his chin to think of interesting, exciting, yet reasonable ways to proceed (eg. the scene with Arnold solving his tanker truck problem near the end of the movie).... ""What WOULD a smart terminator do here?"" Arnold probably contributed significantly, too, as he's no dummy.<br/><br/>As action flicks go, this is pretty basic - interesting premise, but it's not as meaningful as the old movie ""The Great Escape"" or as intriguing or with the character development of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". But if you are looking for an entertaining and novel good guy vs. bad guy movie, and if you appreciate AH-nold at his droll best, this is a great bet."

She has become so determined and strong. Dealing with her worst fear and learning to trust it is just one of the many powerful elements in this movie. Terminator 2 maintains the same dark atmosphere from the original but it deals with more issues concerning the future and the characters have a stronger force behind them.

It's funny, however, to see that nothing can kill the bad guy. If you see it for the very first time, you get desperate in their place. T2 contains amazing special effects and more action than the first part. Too bad the whole movie is to much like the original one. I hate to sum up negative points about T2, yet I had to say it.

"MovieMusings","9","1","1","28 June 2000"," more than just action/entertainment
","Few people seem able to step back and see a bigger picture -- assuming Arnold to be just a muscle-bound action hero doesn't do justice to his body of work.<br/><br/>Has anyone noticed that many of his films deal with profound issues? The idea of aliens on Mars and implanted memory from Total Recall is as provocative as the issues of artificial intelligence in computers of the Terminator series; and then there are the intelligence issues of Eraser, or another commentary on alien and human behaviour in Predator -- this is a far cry from the more benign action fluff of car chases and<br/><br/>explosions...<br/><br/>But anyway, the two most powerful scenes in the film for me are:<br/><br/>1. the first entrance of Arnold, which only impacts you if you've seen the first movie first - if you haven't seen either, do not see 2 until you've seen one - to do so would be to spoil your viewing experience (if reading these reviews hasn't already).<br/><br/>2. the scene where the T2000 is smashing Arnold's head with the heavy equipment towards the end of the film; the music creates a dark doomed feeling I've scarce experienced in modern film.<br/><br/>The theme of the predator becoming more human while Linda Hamilton becomes more mechanic is pure cinematic/directing genius. <br/><br/>The statements about the human experience, and our future, is serious. this is no vain glitter action film -- there's<br/><br/>plenty of things to really think about.<br/><br/>I'm almost tempted to raise this film above and beyond the genre of action, because it is so much more than a story of good guys shooting up bad guys."

Shortly afterward two terminators are sent from the future. One reprogrammed to protect young John Connor from the second, the deadly liquid metal T-1000. In the process they must destroy Cyberdyne and prevent the future war.<br/><br/>Arnold does a great job as the title character and sometimes does seem more man than machine(""I need a vacation."")

But having already review the rest of the series I believe it is time to close with these movies and what better closing than the best?<br/><br/>In short, for those who haven't seen it yet ( what were you doing in the past two and a half decades? ), we again follow Sara Conor ,who after the events of the first flick has become a total bad-ass amazon in order to prepare her son of the incoming apocalypse and then come not one but Terminator and one of then is seriously up-gated. So it is up to our heroes to survive. <br/><br/>As for the actors everyone does an excellent job ,but Linda Hamilton is the greatest surprise for she changed markedly and now is unrecognizable, as for her son Edward Furlon is awesome to his role and it is a shame that after this role and American History X, he hasn't made a decent career, for real you had the potential to be a 5 star actor and you drop it!! As for the original Terminator, Arnie was amazing ,but a part of me feel disappointed that after that role he has become a parody of himself, pity but a bit expected, he isn't Stallone who has some talent, Mr. Governor made unfortunately a career on his muscles and he got old he couldn't continue.<br/><br/>And not the the focus of the film the effects,even now in 2017 still amazing, will CGI seeming new and with many practical effects and stunts, with some of them for real putting the actors or the stunt doubles in danger. Ahh, well ,this why these kind of films always rock for everyone is giving his best for his role and doesn't use chip tricks.<br/><br/>All in all in retrospective the series should has ended here and all would fine and good, but greed came in and had to ruin everything.

","Fresh out of the 90s, the greatest era of film, 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is undoubtedly the greatest movie of all time, as it is the only one that is able to incorporate everything that makes up a great movie and still keep the film afloat.<br/><br/>Set 13 years after its predecessor, 'Terminator 2' sees the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, in an easy career best performance, but unlike the first, he is now protecting John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the more advanced T-1000 (Robert Patrick).<br/><br/>The performances in this film are all superb at the minimum. Arnold Schwarzenegger is able to deliver such an emotional and heartfelt performance, which he is able to do whilst successfully playing a emotionless robot trained to kill. Linda Hamilton, who reprises her role as Sarah Connor, now tougher and willing to do anything to protect her son, gives an excellent performance that is able to stand its ground alongside Arnie as the Terminator. Edward Furlong provides the greatest performance by a child actor ever in his believable and genuine take on the teenager John Connor. And last, but not least, Robert Patrick gives a bone chilling execution of the T-1000, making him one of the greatest villains of all time. And it's not only these four who deliver great performances; it's the whole cast.<br/><br/>Although the box office suggests it isn't, James Cameron's directorial performance is easily his best as well as one of the greatest ever. He is able to keep the film consistent without over-complicating anything, something that many directors are unable to do. But not only in the directorial area he succeeds, as his and William Wisher's screenplay is able to tell an action packed yet super thematic screenplay, which as well as tell the tale of a robot protecting a young boy, questions the very ideals of humanity. Every single scene in this film, each one containing a quote or action etched into pop-culture history, has you gripped and wanting more, and all these flawless scenes accumulate towards the ending, the greatest scene in film history. Only in these scenes have I laughed, cried, felt happy and sad all simultaneously. It's the perfect end to a perfect film. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is, by all means, a perfect film<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","T2 features thrilling action sequences and eye-popping visual effects, but what takes this sci-fi/ action landmark to the next level is the depth of the human (and cyborg) characters."
"bowmanblue","10","3","6","3 June 2016"," Even my mum likes this film
","Terminator 2: Judgement Day is possibly the perfect film – well, if you're into science fiction seamlessly blended with the exact amount of action. And, to be fair, most of us can quite appreciate that sort of genre if it's done right. And it's done right here. This list will be little more than a list of everything that's perfect about this film.<br/><br/>In case you don't know (and there must be one of you), T2 is a sequel, concerning some particularly nasty machines who have all but wiped us humans out in the near future and intend to make sure we stay well and truly exterminated by sending a unstoppable (human-looking) killer cyborg back through time to kill the only man capable of stopping them while he's still a child. Luckily, for us fleshbags, the last humans of our future have captured a (slightly less) unstoppable cyborg and have sent him back through time to protect our future leader, John Connor.<br/><br/>All four lead actors give pitch-perfect performances here, but perhaps the most forgotten actor is Robert Patrick who plays the bad cyborg, aka the T-1000. He doesn't have that many lines, but his creepiness is portrayed through his movements and sheer coldness. Plus he's overshadowed by his own special effects. T2 set the bar pretty high in terms of special effects for its day. The computer generated moments where the T-1000 morphs into various people (and objects!) is blended with the live actors around it.<br/><br/>Our heroine, Sarah Connor, starts off incarcerated in a mental institution for constantly raving about then end of the world when she's not trying to blow computer factories up. But don't let that fool you into thinking that she's merely a damsel in distress. Linda Hamilton has become the ultimate in female action heroes (possibly only coming second to Aliens' 'Ripley'). Not only can she handle any sort of firearm, but she's as determined as the Terminator to protect her son, John. He's played by newcomer Edward furlong and, for someone who has never acted before, he plays his role brilliantly. So many films centred around a child are hard to watch because you actually end up wanting the whinging/screaming brat to be skewered by a cyborg assassin. Not here though. The only thing negative about Edward Furlong was that he displayed so much talent and promise here that he never lived up to it (I'm sure if you Google him you'll find out what I mean).<br/><br/>But, everyone is overshadowed by Schwarzenegger himself. Out of all the films he's done, this is Arnie's most memorable. Some say he can't act, but I wouldn't be that harsh. The trick is giving him a part that suits him. Sir Ian McKellen or Anthony Hopkins are great actors, but I doubt they could carry playing the T-800 himself.<br/><br/>Finally, Terminator 2 hast heart. It's not just a mindless action flick; it actually has quite nice morals to it and reminds us that hurting other people is wrong and, unless we intend to blow each other up in all out nuclear war, we better start remembering that.<br/><br/>If I had to say one negative thing about T2 (and I suppose I ought to, simply for balance) it's that the plot is basically recycled from the first film. Although this sequel is in the minority of sequels where it does surpass the original, it does copy exactly the same timeline of events. Still, once you start watching two emotionless cyborgs throwing each other through walls, you probably won't care! T2 is for everyone. If you like Arnie, you'll love it. If you like action or sci-fi, you'll love it. And, if you're not into any of those, I dare you to watch it anyway. It might not change your mind about the genre, but I think you'll have a good time."

","Terminator 2 (1991) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>It's not often a sequel is better than the original but that's the case here. I'll go a step further and say this here is one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made. It's funny but I still have vivid memories of watching this on opening night even though I was only eleven-years-old. I remember the buzz going into the movie. I remember who I watched it with and I can even remember what part of the theater I was sitting in. At the time I don't think I fully realized how special the film I was watching was because I only saw it as something extremely cool with ground breaking effects. Today I see the film as a complete masterpiece of film-making even though one might find a few logical issues but then again this is science fiction so the logic could be overlooked anyways. I think it goes without saying but the story is the best thing going on here. The plot is a very simple one: the prevention of Judgment Day so what else do you need? The movie has Arnold Schwarzenegger returning and giving the greatest performance of his career. Linda Hamilton is also back and the way she transformed her character from the first film is pretty remarkable. Edward Furlong makes for a very good John Connor and Robert Patrick is terrific as the villain. The special effects were ground breaking in 1991 and I might say they haven't been topped in all the years since. Sure, CGI has come along but they can't hold up to anything in this movie. The liquid metal is pure genius and all the effects are masterfully done. You could pick any single one of them and hold it up as being some of the best ever created. Whereas the first film was extremely dark, this one here allows for the Terminator to have more character development and I think this was a great thing to do. Just as it was great to have Frankenstein's monster speak in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, I think it's great to show a more humor Terminator. The jokes work perfectly and you can't help but find the ending very touching. No matter which version you watch (I prefer the theatrical) this is a marvelous film that has perfectly stood the test of time and delivers itself as one of the greatest of its type."

"T850","1","38","157","16 April 2005"," Loved it as a kid, Hate it now, Here's why.
","I was roughly 10 years old when this film first hit the theaters. And when I saw it, I fell in love with it, maybe that should have been a warning that I wouldn't like it much once I've reached maturity.<br/><br/>Fast Forward 13 years, and being nostalgic as I am, I decide to watch all 3 Terminator movies in order for old times sake. I couldn't believe the surprise I felt when I found out how horrible this film was. It's earlier installment was a masterpiece, even with the fraction of the budget that James Cameron had for this film. The second incarnation of the Terminator series totally ignores what made the 1st one so good, and instead replaces it as a popcorn, 50's esquire comic book style filming trying to appeal to kids and people with vocabularies limited to 4 lettered words. And it did very well in dumbing down Teriminator into the mess it was in Terminator 2.<br/><br/>James Cameron made the biggest amateur mistake with this film in that they made the Terminator into this cheesy compassionate good guy character, which was not only ludicrous, but also very laughable. The potential for irony was strong with a boy growing so attracted to a cold, emotionless machine, as well as the irony of a machine being the ideal protector as opposed to the father John never had. Yet all of this was wasted on this half-assed 'almost human' machine who gives funny one liners and smiles.<br/><br/>As if this wasn't enough to destroy this film, We're also treated to an Edward Furlong being well timed into his changing voice. Hearing a squeaky annoying child's voice swearing and trying to act tough which will the audience petition for a mute button in the theaters. I can understand Linda Hamilton's character's transformation from a naive waitress into a more hardened and tough woman after battling a terminator before. There's no chemistry between John and Sarah in the movie, And Furlong's portrayal seemed so plain and simple for such a troubled and traumatized child he was supposed to depict.<br/><br/>The only good things in this film is perhaps the action and the eye-candy. Both of which is very nice to see but the slop of a plot and character use. Terminator 1 was obviously a B movie, But the plot, the mood and the rational use of characters made it thought provoking as well as frightening. Terminator 2 feels as if it's trying to make violence and cheap thrills with a Disney touch behind it.<br/><br/>He did this with the Titanic as well. Tsk task."
"GaryP","1","34","139","10 March 1999"," A movie for people who say ""awesome"" a lot....
","Let's make it clear - the special effects in this movie are pretty good, and it's as well made as Hollywood actioners get. But am I the only one who despises the way the film is blatantly aimed at the type of people who describe things as ""awesome"" or ""kick-ass""?<br/><br/>James Cameron is a very clever man, not for his movie-making qualities (of which we'll get to later!) but for his knowing of a sure thing when he sees one. The first Terminator had a fraction of the budget, and a very much lesser-known star at the time, and it managed to create a convincingly dark and menacing bad guy, and a pretty tight action thriller.<br/><br/>T2, however, has seen Mr Cameron simply throw together a whole pile of things that will appeal to  the comic-book generation - big guns, throbbing motorbikes, and the kind of silly set-pieces that are designed purely to whoop up an audience which has few demands. I'm not expecting an intellectual feast when I watch a movie like this, but I at least hope that the director won't patronise me by cobbling these stock elements together, adding some risible dialogue and pretending it is a complete film.<br/><br/>And how wholly predictable that we have Arnie in the good guy role this time, further sealing the commercial certainty of this film. Every aspect of the movie seems tailored to bring in as much money as possible, from the aforementioned comic-book elements, to the awful product placement - witness the technician who comes into a room awkwardly carrying a well-known brand of cola, label to the camera, and the same brand-name on a prominent vending machine in a corridor shoot-out.<br/><br/>Ever since the travesty that was ALIENS, James Cameron has been putting together garish films like this which simply do not appeal to me. He may be a competent director, but he is no master of character or originality, favouring instead the kind of technical accomplishment or macho nonsense (and, let's face it, his female characters are males in all but name) that appeals to young, male Americans. It leaves me cold, and it makes me mad, when he, and his fans, try to convince me otherwise."
"NEFARlOUS","1","30","136","26 October 1998"," Oh dear.
","I was a big fan of the original. The plot was a good one, the actors convincing, even Arnie (although perhaps having 42 words in the entire film helped.)and the action took place largely at night. Five minutes into T2 when Arnie has killed no-one and nicked one guy's sunglasses, I thought *uh-oh* - one-liner ahoy, and sure enough, later one of many such gut-wrenchingly bad lines emerges, delivered with enough lack of Acting ability to cover his compatriots in splinters. Now sometimes a Movie can be salvaged by it's co-stars, but unfortunately although Linda Hamilton is the only member of the cast that emerges with any credibility, the young John Connor is so incredibly irritating that 30 minutes into the film, I wanted to kill him myself. That leaves the quintessential ""Baddie"" to sustain some sort of suspense and danger. Alas, James was still obviously obsessed with the morphing techniques he discovered while making ""The Abyss"" with the result that we end up with a robot that is supposed to be made up of liquid metal capable of altering it's colour, texture and size, and even reforming itself. All movies of this type call for a certain degree of suspension of disbelief, but this is just ludicrous. Even in ""non-liquid"" mode, the new wimpy looking terminator runs around with his head inclined - apparently this is supposed to be frightening. Throughout the film, we have lots of explosions, laughable dialog and in the end, Arnie the philosophical friendly cyborg. This film could have been a damn sight better, even with Arnie in the lead, but this seems to have been targeted at a preview audience of teenagers in the mid-west with all the ingredients that they tend to expect. It is quite simply yet another standard formulaic attempt to make money, not a decent film, but hey, Isn't that what Hollywood is about?<br/><br/>Dan Marcus"

","Continuing the story of the first film, 1984's 'Terminator'; 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' finds a new Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), identical to the one who failed to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the first movie, having now to protect her young son, John Connor (Edward Furlong), from a more advanced cyborg, T-1000 (Robert Patrick) made out of liquid metal. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I love how nightmarish, the opening was, with its heaven and hell motif. The burning playground, with it symbolize the four horsemen of apocalypse made it, very scary. The scenery ends with the T-800 Terminator endoskeleton, symbolizing a chrome figure of death. Wow, intense. Directed by James Cameron, the film is designed in such way that the audience doesn't know which of the time travelers might be the good guy at first. Not only that, T2 conquered one of the biggest challenges in storytelling ever - to completely spin the audience's emotions on the character and turn the most ruthless killer into a sympathetic father figure. Arnold really did great, showing that with Cameron's help. The sunglasses are an important story device in T2. In the first movie they meant to dehumanize T-800 as he takes on more damage, becoming less and less human-like in appearance. In T2, the meaning of the sunglasses has an even deeper meaning as it represent his gradual transformation, from stone-cold killer, to something more human. Because of things like that, the movie carry a strong moral message. The fact that the Terminator was ordered not to kill people becomes a major point of the story as it really deliver the relationship, he has with the young John Conner. Both actors did well in their roles, showing their humanity. Linda Hamilton does the opposite, as she turn her character from a scared, vulnerable waitress into a tough, aggressive machine-like assassin with a muscular physique to match. It's the startling physical transformation that adds a whole other level of psychological credibility to Sarah's character. The way the movie is shot and the story and angles constructed, makes this, a well-executed, action-packed sequel to 'Terminator'. It has a great variety of action set-pieces, car chases and quotable one-liners to make anybody, entertained. Because of things like that, Terminator 2 still remains one of the best action films of all time! Not only that, but it's also one of the most influential sequels in Hollywood blockbuster history. It's nearly a perfect blockbuster movie. However, the movie does have flaws that other critics might overlook, because of nostalgia reasons. First off, the indifferences of Edward Furlong's age between shots. Since, the filming of this film, took some sufficiently time, in many of the scenes, Furlong has indeed visibly aged, despite, the whole film events, happening in a few days. It's clear that he was much younger, when they film the desert scenes, compare to the others. You can see it, when his voice began to break and had to be pitched to one level in post-production. Despite that, Furlong did alright in the role, and wasn't that annoying. Another issue with the film, is how dated, it is. After all, the film's significant date known as ""Judgment Day"", is August 29 1997. It's a bit laughable, seeing that. Even the 1990s references, are starting to lose some traction, with every year that pass. One jarring thing, that some people might notice, is how Terminators don't really act like machines. You know, for killer cyborgs, they really do suck at their jobs. Isn't there, supposed to be a technological singularity, where humans can't compete with the machine? So, why does this movie have scenes, where machines are doing stupid things, like cooking dinner or asking people to call out, names? It doesn't make sense for them, too. Like, how did T-1000, time travel since only living tissue can go through time and he's liquid metal? Despite those nitpicking, the biggest fault of the film is the troublesome and convoluted timeline. While, Terminator 2 is probably the cleanness of all of the films, the movie's ending is a mixed bag for me. I get that, the key message of T2 is that, if events in the past are altered, an already existing future or present can be changed. However, if Judgment Day were prevented, as shown in the film, then there'd shouldn't been no Future War – and no Terminator sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, meaning no Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to father, John Connor. I guess, paradoxes can be avoided, by appealing either to the Novikov self-consistency principle or to the notion of branching parallel universes, similar to some type of multiverse theory, but my brain kinda hurt thinking too hard on it. As much as I dislike 2003's 'Terminator 3', as least, the inevitable type ending, made a lot more sense than 'Terminator 2', open-ended climax. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie's open road bittersweet ending. It will make you cry & yes, it is way better than the original altered ending, and 3 times, better than anything else in the previous 'Terminator' films, I saw, but it does leave too much open-questions on how time travel works. Anyways, the great quality of the film, surpass any of the flaws, the film may have. After all, this is the film that made CGI effects seem pleasant. Along, with Robert Patrick wonderful acting, the CGI effects made the T-1000, an iconic villain. Even, the normal practical effects, from Stan Winston was amazing. Terminator 2 even works with wondering haunting theme song from Brad Fiedel. Overall: The movie is masterpiece. The ideas of fate and destiny, determinism and fee will, and the empowerment of the individual and the ability of every person to change the course of the future makes this movie so great. This movie has a lot of depth that few action/science fiction films come compete with, because of that, it's a must-watch."
"Theo Robertson","6","9","32","17 June 2002"," Over Produced and Over Rated Sequel
","That`s typical . Hollywood decides to make lots of money by making a sequel to a classic genre film while ignoring the elements that made the original so brilliant.<br/><br/>Take the script for example , THE TERMINATOR had one of the most tightly written scripts I can think of . The sequel is very flabby and mechanical especially in the middle where the fugitives escape to the desert. On top of that it`s very poor SF , if ten years have passed since the first film then that also means that ten years have passed in the future but as the original pointed out Cyberdyne systems had been beaten by the humans so how could they send another , superior terminator back to 1994 ?<br/><br/>THE TERMINATOR worked so well because it was well made and written , not because it had an army of stuntmen or FX wizards. This seems to have slipped the producers memories. Here we are treated to explosions , stunts,  FX , car chases ,FX ,  explosions , helicopter chases , FX , explosions, FX, more explosions and a nuclear war featuring - you`ve guessed it - FX and explosions. The morphing FX might have been groundbreaking in 1991 but two years later every pop video , advert and TV title sequence had done the effect to death which means in a space of four or five years T2 looked extremely dated .<br/><br/>My final gripe is down to the dubious morality of it all. Big Arnie goes around blowing the kneecaps off a whole SWAT team . Is it really necessary for him to do this ? I mean he is a terminator so bullets can`t hurt him so why`s he dishing out maimings ?<br/><br/>I see there`s a TERMINATOR 3 in the pipeline. I predict it`ll be the biggest flop in years"

","Terminator 2 is a more mainstream, thoughtful sequel to 1984's ""The Terminator. Whereas Terminator 2, was a dark, horrific, brutal film, T2 is more about the theme of the future of humanity in a nuclear era. Blessed with a huge budget and a superb script Cameron successfully turns the tables on Arnie's character and Sarah Connor's developing relationship with the Terminator. Also effective is John Connor's development into the leader he becomes in the future during the film. I'm one of the few that actually prefer the first one over this one. To me, the original Terminator was scarier and creepier. The thought of an unstoppable killing machine on your trail with the only human (yet very resourceful) Kyle Reese to protect you was a terrifying one. It was more of sci-fi meets horror and it was extremely effective in what it set out to do. The sequel is more of a blockbuster sci-fi action movie that does what it sets out to do just as effectively, so which one you prefer probably depends on what genre you prefer your Terminator in.<br/><br/>That said, Terminator 2: Judgement Day is still flat out full of awesome. It does a lot of things right; you have Arnold at the very top of his game, Robert Patrick makes a very worthy opponent as the liquid metal T-1000. The action is top notch and delivers the goods in very satisfying ways. The themes concerning fate, technology, and what it is to be ""alive"" are certainly near as big as themes can get. As often mentioned, the snake-like, liquid metal adversary is a masterpiece both of acting and special effects, and ushered in a new era in computer graphics. Although not as dark as the predecessor, this film was certainly prettier, and explored a wide range both of film styles and themes.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

From an extremely likable cast to a well crafted story and groundbreaking effects, the movie doe snot miss a beat. The movie builds on the story of the original without letting it hold the characters and story progress back (something most sequels fail at). For those who don't know, the movie was directed by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick, and Joe Morton.

It's also a film that's often mentioned in discussions about sequels that are better than the originals.<br/><br/>I don't like this film as much as the original. The original had a real dirt about it - whenever I watch it I feel like I've stumbled upon a strange old video at the back of a shop that nobody else has ever seen before. Something underground about it. This is definitely a big-budget blockbuster<br/><br/> but that's not a bad thing in this case. Really well paced, with some astonishing stunts, and special effects that still hold up well today (as most sfx do if they're done with care and thought, not just for for the sake of it).

She's ACTING REALLY HARD in this.<br/><br/>Glad Cameron kept Brad Fiedel on to do the score, rather than drafting in Horner.<br/><br/>Anyway, yes - a really excellent action/sci-fi film, and important in terms of the development of SFX/CGI but I just don't get the same thrill with this as I do when watching The Terminator.<br/><br/>yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com"
"TheLittleSongbird","10","2","4","31 August 2015"," A bigger, richer sequel that is every bit as fantastic as its predecessor and even surpasses it in some areas
","The original Terminator film is one of the greatest films of the action genre, and still holds up as a fantastic film, not just of its genre but in general too. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.<br/><br/>Here in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects, they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all, here the effects are stunning, the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully, maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film., and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron, and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts, more so than the original, while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense, without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth, the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun, beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton gives another terrific performance, that is more depth than her performance in the first film, Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original, and the only one that's above good level. For me, if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal, in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"LucasLockwood","9","2","4","15 July 2015"," The greatest Terminator movie of all.
","This movie's storyline had you on the edge of your seat. It's basically the story about how a cyborg failed to kill Sarah Connor, must now protect John Connor, her son, from a more advanced cyborg, made out of liquid metal. The special effects and acting were superb for that time, and is still bearable to watch today. I'm a very picky with what movies I watch, but this one is definitely one i'd enjoy watching again. I enjoy seeing Arnold's acting abilities at a much younger stage of his acting career, and how it is now. Hilarious to think that, that guy, is now our governor. I also find very interesting how they fluctuate between the future and past which keeps you wondering what can possible happen next. I love the story and hope to see how they continue with the series. Definitely a movie I would watch again for its action, effects and amazing storyline."
"willcundallreview","9","2","4","12 July 2015"," The Terminator returns in sensational style
","Rating-9/10<br/><br/>Terminator 2:Judgement Day, an action movie that Is quite possibly, the best of action. With technical achievements and some fine acting performances this becomes not only better than the first in the series, but also just one of the finest entries into the much paved action movie catalogue. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns from the first and so does Sarah Connor, and both are well played and make this story exciting, action packed and even quite surprisingly, emotional.<br/><br/>This movie is to be fair all about the destruction of John Connor, but I mean that in a way where Robert Patrick is thrown back from the future to try and kill the future human rebel leader. This time the T-800 model otherwise known as the Terminator is back, and now he's had a change of heart, no not really he has just been reprogrammed by John Connor in the future. This plot can seem a little confusing but trust me it is not, it's actually a fine story full of fun moments but a whole lot of down right action fuelled adventure.<br/><br/>The young man playing the well, young John Connor is Edward Furlong, and he gives a pretty nasty yet good performance, mixing the juvenile teenage rage with raw emotion to create an all together nice feel. Arnie returns with fist pumping muscle and some massive guns and becomes the stuff of legends(quite literally, he makes this classic movie icon). The director, James Cameron, the writer James Cameron(plus William Wisher), and oh my what a movie he has created. He finely crafts this with a fine touch, he never lets this get boring and somehow makes a movie that is exciting from the first minute to the end.<br/><br/>Does the movie lack anything?, well yes, yes it does. It for me lacks a slight bit of depth, it does it well and anyone who see's the relationship between the Terminator and John will be all quite happy for cyborg-human relations. I do however feel this isn't as intelligent as it maybe thinks it is, and for that point and that point alone, it makes this oh so close to perfection, without being perfect. Now of course saying all this, many many people will give this 10/10 and the such, I think it is incredible and truly a movie to behold so don't hold it against me that I don't think this is 100% flawless, it is for me, probably one of the best movies ever.<br/><br/>When you think of a sequel you think many things will return from the first and not only that but also, the sequel will not be as good. It's wrong on the point of it's not as good as it's predecessor, but it also feels new and unique, very different to the 1984 first in line ""The Terminator"" which although I felt was good, is not a patch on this one. It feels slick, new and all together more thought out, Cameron seems to get his act and give it another level meanwhile Hamilton, Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick etc, also do the same.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is one of those movies you don't forget after watching, I recommend this not only to action fans who maybe haven't ever seen it, but also any movie fan, this is top class stuff. I never thought I'd be saying that an action Sci-Fi was so good but I can't deny it anything, even the score from Brad Fiedel deserves a shout out, all together top notch work from all departments involved."
"grintemcstinger","10","2","4","12 July 2015"," In a league of its own
","I remember as if it was yesterday when I first became aware of this movie. It was a summer in the early 90s, there was a massive heat wave going on and whenever you watched TV or shuffled through magazines, you couldn't get around something not related to this movie. The hype about it was out of this world, seemingly even more than ""Batman"" got, which also was unreal. Everybody seemed to blown away by it and the commercials and trailers really got you pumped. Naturally, I was too young to watch it at the cinema, and that's something I am truly envious of people who did first time, so I had to wait until it was shown at a pay TV channel at my uncles apartment. And boy, it left an impact that sticks to this very day, more than 20 years later. If you by any chance haven't seen it yet, stop right there - go watch this movie with a good set-up with big speakers and a big screen, you can thank me later.<br/><br/>Regardless how I look at it, how this movie excels at seemingly everything is fascinating to say the least. Starting from the powerful and symbolic intro with the beautifully emotional score to the countless memorable and instant classic moments until the last lines of the simple yet incredibly effective epilogue, all of it feels like everyone involved in it knew exactly what they want to do, how to do it and why. It may be even more rare than winning the lottery. The level of production, amount of talent and creativity involved is something that no one came even close probably until ""The Matrix"".<br/><br/>The first striking impression about it is obviously the action and rightfully so as it is indeed groundbreaking. I still remember people talking about how amazing the chase scene where the truck drives of the bridge was. Even more impressive is that each and every action scene is consistent in quality so that you're constantly wowed by what is happening. The stunts are insane and hold up to this day and will years to come.<br/><br/>But don't let it's bombastic action and one-liners lead you into believing that it's all about it. No, there is so much more to it. Terminator 2 has evolving characters, each interesting and equally likable, a superb script which in clever ways expands on what already did happen and ads new twists to it, a deep story that deals with legitimate fears about bringing our own doom by constantly developing new, potentially dangerous inventions, about destiny, hope and what makes us human. Aside from all that, similar to the first movie, it retains the grueling tension and sense of danger that sometimes is on par with horror movies. A big contribution to this is of course the character T-1000 played by Robert Patrick. He truly understood how to make his character as intimidating and menacing as possible; that aura he has about him and frightening, cold stare is something only he can pull off. But it's not only his amazing performance, James Camerons direction is as equally important to make him so fear inducing. Every time he appears on screen you can hear his theme that has so much intensity to it that it always gave me a feeling of uneasiness and not without reason as he kills his victims in nightmarish ways without flinching. It wouldn't be as half as tense were it PG-13 I assure you.<br/><br/>Everyones performance in it is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger is incredibly professional, bad-ass, serious but with so much style and a bit of subtle humor in just the right doses. Linda Hamilton with perhaps the most difficult character to pull off but does it completely convincingly with a remarkable power performance through emotions, Edward Furlog as the charismatic 90s kid, both believable and relate-able. And so on and so forth. The true star however has to James Cameron, the man that managed it all. He must've have some sort of sixth sense in order to have a such clear vision of what he wanted in each in every scene, and it's not just the whole big picture of it, but all the small things too. How he build up that mall scene is just one of many displays of his genius.<br/><br/>Its perfect as filmmaking gets. If I had to nit-pick I'd say that in the second half are some slight lengths and it slows down a bit until the final confrontation, but in all honesty it is absolutely insignificant and minor. It's through and through fun, tense, smart, horrifying, cool, emotional... all the good stuff. I can't praise it enough, the music, the tone of the movie with its blue and black colours, the make-up, the truly convincing special effects which don't feel artificial as they do in newer movies and nowadays... just everything I possibly could think of is on a whole different level. Words don't do it justice, it needs to be seen. Even now, 24 years later, it still holds up extremely well and that alone is a testament on what of an accomplishment this movie is."

","The quintessential sequel, the quintessential sci-fi actioner & one of the greatest films ever made, James Cameron's follow-up story to his breakthrough classic is such a huge upgrade over its predecessor that it ends up decimating the 1984 original in all filmmaking departments with effortless ease, and remains one of the most influential, entertaining & breathtaking action extravaganzas to grace the silver screen.<br/><br/>A highly irresistible, pulse-pounding, high-octane, full-throttled & top- gear action spectacle that's filled with some of the most dangerous, daring & heart-stopping stunts ever captured on the film celluloid, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the perfect definition of a worthy sequel that presents its renowned director at the peak of his gifted talents, is the finest work of his illustrious career, and its influence on its genre, visual effects & pop culture surpasses even the reach of its predecessor.<br/><br/>The story of Terminator 2: Judgment Day follows the aftermath of the events that transpired in The Terminator and continues the journey of Sarah Connor & her 10-year old son, John Connor; the future leader of human resistance in the war against the machines. After failing to eliminate Sarah during its first attempt, Skynet sends a much more advanced Terminator back in time to kill John when he's still a child while another saviour from the future arrives whose only mission is to protect John & ensure his survival at all costs.<br/><br/>Written, produced & directed by James Cameron, the improvements present in this sequel are evident from the film's opening moments with more enhanced visuals, larger-than-life action & one mind-blowing sequence after another. I've always admired Cameron because he's one of the very few filmmakers who understands what great action is all about, knows how to expand upon the original instead of rehashing the same events & has the talent to accomplish not just his own artistic ambitions but also the expectations of the mainstream audience without compromising with the quality.<br/><br/>Also, in my opinion, a sequel has no reason to exist unless it can improve upon the original and it's usually why I'm skeptical about most of them. Cameron seems to know this better than anyone for he has proved it not once but twice already; first with Aliens; the action-packed follow-up to Ridley Scott's Alien & then with this second chapter to the film that launched his career. And despite the major upgrades in action & other technical aspects, the story retains the high-quality content of the original, exhibits extensive character depth & is brilliantly paced from start to finish.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, Terminator 2 is a marvel of genre filmmaking in every sense of the word. Production Design team does a commendable job with its refined sets, locations are nicely selected for filming especially when it comes to action scenes, Cinematography makes expert use of its camera in keeping the action clearly visible with its cleverly chosen angles, makes the drama more immersive with its controlled movements, and with its precision use of colour hues & lighting provides a rich texture to the whole film that further enhances the whole experience.<br/><br/>Editing is easily one of its strongest aspects for every sequence paves the groundwork for the next scene in line, the flow of events is incredibly smooth & relaxed, and the pace is so methodically handled that its 136 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Even Brad Fiedel comes up with a more evolved, pulsating & fitting score that beautifully integrates into the film's narrative and has a firm grip on the viewers' emotions from start to finish. But where Terminator 2 sets an entirely new benchmark is in its visual effects, sound design & action choreography, all of which are simply groundbreaking.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Terminator 2 features a solid cast in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick & Edward Furlong, with the reprising actors improving upon their performances of the last chapter while new ones instantly making a mark in their given roles. Schwarzenegger returns as the cyborg sent from the future but with a new mission & while T-800 isn't the same relentless assassin in this sequel, there isn't a moment when we aren't aware of what he's capable of. Schwarzenegger gets to explore new dimensions of his character this time and does a spectacular job at it for T-800 isn't just badass in this picture but also cool, charismatic & heroic.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton reprises her role of Sarah Connor and builds upon her earlier rendition with a stronger performance as her character exhibits a more evolved & tougher persona, which Hamilton captures splendidly. Edward Furlong is introduced as John Connor & while he can be annoying on few occasions, it's a dream debut nonetheless. And finally we have Robert Patrick who plays T-1000; a highly advanced cyborg who's far superior to T-800 model & is virtually the most lethal, unstoppable, indestructible & invincible Terminator in existence. Cameron has written the part of this antagonist really well and Patrick's added inputs help greatly in making his character one of the greatest film villains of all time.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is blockbuster filmmaking at its finest for it sets a very high standard for its genre(s) that hasn't been equalled ever since, remains one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & jaw-dropping works of sci-fi action with an extremely high repeat value, is a perfect example of a sequel that surpasses the original in all aspects, and is a landmark achievement of genre filmmaking that has had a lasting impact on multimedia & pop culture. The best film of its year, one of the most memorable films of the 1990s & one of cinema's greatest triumphs, James Cameron's conclusion to his Terminator saga is an unprecedented, unrivalled & undisputed masterpiece that comes one hundred percent recommended"
"arussell23","10","2","4","5 July 2015"," 'Judgment Day' is a fantastic sequel that ups the action, heart and much more to the highest level it can go
","In 1984, James Cameron hit a home run with the highly-successful The Terminator, and the main players involved (Cameron, Schwarzenegger, and Hamilton) were all game for a sequel. It took about six years for it to enter production, due to issues with the effects for the T-1000 to work, and the rights to the Terminator franchise. When it did, the work for the film lasted about 171 days, nearly half a year. They filmed at around 20 different locations for the film to be made. When the film was finally released, having spent about $94-$102 million dollars on the film, the film quickly made back it's budget about 5 times. Many people have given the film rave reviews, as the film has an 8.5 on IMDb and a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. So, let's see if the film holds up after twenty-four years, and if the film is any good.<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgment Day follows John Connor as he comes into contact with a reprogrammed T-800 who has been sent into the past to protect John from the T-1000, a upgraded Terminator that can turn into any living being and has been tasked to kill John to prevent the future from ever occurring.<br/><br/>This film is freaking amazing. Okay? Just saying. The acting in this film is outstanding. Returning actors Schwarzenegger and Hamilton both do fantastic jobs as their roles, and Hamilton does an even better job than before, portraying a slightly more hardened, more badass Sarah Connor. Edward Furlong, in his first film role, does a pretty good job as John Connor. I mean, there are a few cringe-worthy moments, but isn't that how most child actors are? Robert Patrick... I really think there's no really good way to describe his phenomenal acting in this film. He's menacing and always has that sort of look on his face of menacing, yet somewhat charming. Reminds me of Norman Bates, haha. And Joe Morton does a fairly good job as Miles Dyson, basically the man behind the future SkyNet.<br/><br/>The score was done once again by Brad Fiedel and he manages to one-up himself from the previous film. Don't believe me? Then listen to the music played over the opening credits, because it's kickass! It really does set the tone for the rest of the film. The special effects this time around are one hell of a lot better than the first go through. I mean, sure, the stopmotion Terminator at the end of the first one wasn't that bad, but the special effects for certain scenes, especially ones involving the T-1000, are a thousand times better. It's amazing that special effects created in the early 1990s are sometimes better than the ones in films made a few years ago.<br/><br/>The screenplay written by James Cameron was as good as it was last time. I watched the Special Edition/Director's Cut, because I heard that was the best version, and while some of the humor in that version was a bit weird, it was still really good. I can't imagine the film without those scenes now. The cinematography in some scenes, especially scenes when they are driving and wide shots of the city all look amazing, and that's thanks to the cinematographer, Adam Greenberg. He really did a fantastic job with this film.<br/><br/>The plot works for the most part. I mean, of course, there's going to be a few discrepancies, no matter how minor, because this is essentially a film where several people time travel and change the history that's been established. The fact that so much happens over the two and a half hour film and it all still manages to make sense is quite amazing, to be honest.<br/><br/>Overall, Judgment Day is a very worthy sequel to the original Terminator, and dare I say it, it surpasses the original. The music, acting, screenplay, cinematography, plot and special effects, especially, all look and sound truly amazing. I do recognize the film has it's flaws, but you know what, I'm still going to give it one of my highest ratings because it is definitely becoming one of my favorite films."

Production Design team does a commendable job with its refined sets, locations are nicely selected for filming especially when it comes to action scenes, Cinematography makes expert use of its camera in keeping the action clearly visible with its cleverly chosen angles, makes the drama more immersive with its smart movements and with its precision use of colour hues & lighting provides a rich texture to the whole film that further enhances the whole experience.<br/><br/>Editing is easily one of its strongest aspects for every sequence paves the groundwork for the next scene in line, even the flow of events is incredibly smooth & relaxed, and the pace is so methodically handled that its 136 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Brad Fiedel also comes up with a more evolved, pulsating & fitting score that beautifully integrates into the film's narrative and has a firm grip on the viewers' emotions from start to finish. But where Terminator 2 sets an entirely new benchmark is in its visual effects, sound design & action choreography, all of which are simply groundbreaking.<br/><br/>Although Jurassic Park is cited by many as the picture that revolutionised the film industry with its pioneering use of computer-generated-imagery, it was actually this film that made the necessary breakthroughs in CGI which made the former possible. The practical effects are even more impressive for there are plenty of death-defying stunts present in its action & its choreography still remains in a league of its own. The only other film that comes close to duplicating the same feat is the recently released Mad Max: Fury Road but even that post- apocalyptic mayhem lacks the meticulous refinement Cameron brings to this film's story & characters.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Terminator 2 features a solid cast in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick & Edward Furlong, with the reprising actors improving upon their performances in the last chapter while new ones instantly making a mark in their given roles. Schwarzenegger returns as the cyborg sent from the future but with a new mission & while T-800 isn't the same relentless assassin in this sequel, there isn't a moment when we aren't aware of his strength. Schwarzenegger gets to take his character to other directions this time and does a spectacular job at it for T-800 isn't just badass in this picture but also cool, charismatic & heroic.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton reprises her role of Sarah Connor and builds upon her earlier rendition with a stronger performance as her character exhibits a more evolved & tougher persona, which Hamilton captures splendidly. Edward Furlong is introduced as John Connor & while he can be annoying on few occasions, it's a dream debut nonetheless. And finally we have Robert Patrick who is in as T-1000; a highly advanced cyborg who's far superior to T-800 model & is virtually the most lethal, unstoppable, indestructible & invincible Terminator in existence. Cameron has written the part of this antagonist really well and Patrick's added inputs help greatly in making his character one of the greatest film villains of all time.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is blockbuster filmmaking at its finest for it sets a very high standard for its genre(s) that hasn't been equalled ever since, remains one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & jaw-dropping works of sci-fi action with an extremely high repeat value, is a perfect example of a sequel that surpasses the original in all aspects, is a landmark achievement of genre filmmaking that has had a lasting impact on multimedia & pop culture. The best film of its year, one of the most memorable films of the 1990s & one of cinema's greatest triumphs, James Cameron's conclusion to his Terminator saga is an unprecedented, unrivalled & undisputed masterpiece that comes strongly recommended."

","This is the ultimate action science fiction movie. There have been many imitators of this masterpiece, however, none of them come close to replicating the sheer brilliance of this flick by James Cameron. It is not very often that you see a sequel surpass the original in terms of quality. Terminator 2 improves upon every aspect such as storytelling, acting and special effects. It was one of the most expensive movies made at that time and the elaborate sets and the innovative visual effects were possible due to the huge budget. This movie focuses on John Connor who is depicted wonderfully by Edward Furlong. A terminator is sent to terminate John Connor who is supposed to be the future leader of the war against machines. In the original movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the antagonist, however, in this movie he is entitled with the job to protect John Connor. All the actors give terrific performances that elevates this movie to another level altogether. Even after 30 years, this movie still feels fresh and it will remain a fan-favorite for years to come. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie."

The cast, the plot, the visual effects, the pacing, the action, the excitement, the director and the pure craftsmanship that went into the making of this film. <br/><br/>For a movie that was made 24 years ago, it holds up incredibly well, if not , significantly better than most CGI-crammed movies today.<br/><br/>Arnie is in his absolute prime, Linda Hamilton stepped-up her ability as an actress tenfold, and Robert Patrick is a chilling, emotionless killing machine. <br/><br/>When I remind myself that this movie was in fact released 24 years ago while watching it, I find myself completely gobsmacked by the incredible practical and early-digital effects.

"robsta23","9","2","4","15 April 2015"," Great Sci-Fi
","What a great piece of science-fiction. Entertaining in many different ways, one of my favorite being crazy Sarah Connor. Her character is a lot more interesting this time around, even if she starts the movie in a mental hospital.<br/><br/>What adds to the fun is the fact that this is much funnier than the first, and in unexpected ways. Just wait until young John Connor tries to teach the Terminator how to smile. A lot of humor revolves around the John Connor/Terminator relationship within the film.<br/><br/>Also, the new gender-neutral liquid-metal Terminator is bad-ass, but I also think the worst aspect of the film is with that Terminator in the third act of the film. The evil Terminator is really bad at trying to kill the Connors and/or the Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator. There are points where the new Terminator just stands there when he can be attacking his targets. He takes an unnecessarily long time to get to his targets, and I guess this is so that he may be destroyed.<br/><br/>I've heard the films following this one in the franchise are not as good, and honestly I can't see another Terminator movie being made that can top this one. Great film, very entertaining."

","Terminator 2 is without a doubt one of cinema's all time greats. It is also one of the sequels everybody can agree on is better than the original. Everything that T2 has to offer is innovative to all of film. Sure there are some head-scratching moments that people can't help but question, but that is when James Cameron expects people to infer and figure things out for themselves. I don't give much thought to these questions. Just sit back, relax, and be wowed.<br/><br/>In 1997, machines take over the world causing most of humanity to be wiped out. John Connor is the leader of the resistance who is gaining the upper hand. The machines send back a cyborg (Schwarzenegger) back in time to 1984 to kill his mother, Sarah (Hamilton), a prevent Connor's birth. John sends his friend (Biehn) back in time to protect her, who ultimately becomes John's father. The whole paradox of John's father is very interesting. They destroy the Terminator and Sarah's knowledge of the future has her going crazy. That is where T2 comes. T2 is a sequel where it helps if the first is watched. All the questions are filled in with this, watching 1984's just makes this experience better.<br/><br/>In the future, the machines have created a liquid-metal T-1000 Terminator (Patrick) that can transform itself into anything. They send it back in time to 1994 to kill John's 10-year-old self (Furlong). John and his crew steal an Arnold model and program it to be good and send it back to protect him. Arnold gets John and explains what's up. There's some action between him and Patrick which is awesome. Patrick is a skinny guy who is more powerful than Arnold. I think it's funny how both their facial expressions never change during any of their fights. They are machines, and both men must've found it hard to keep their faces from changing shapes. We get a good look into the life of Sarah Connor, who has been put in a mental institution where she is abused. John and Arnold break her out, but Sarah is still hunted by her previous encounter with his model and an idea of judgement day. They must work together to protect John and thwart Patrick. Patrick makes lots of really cool kills and transformations. For 1991, the effects are as real as can be. Of course, there's some dazzling effects with Arnold's model. The innovative effects were the first things that were noticed. Of course the action plays a big part as they were very well done too. The complex plot and ideas of how modern technology can destroy the world, trust, and family are played about in very important and unique ways. I love the way the movie constantly unfolds and gets from place to place. So many moments just fly by that cause you to keep your eyes on the screen. Cameron does this the right way, with build-ups and pay- offs, showing that it was necessary to have. The thrills and suspense are done so in perfectly, wondering how Patrick can get kills and if he can destroy the trio. Cameron also adds some humour. Arnold is the king of one-liners, making every movie he's in funny in some parts. Playing a robot with more lines is guaranteed to make almost everything that comes out of his mouth a gag. The chemistry between him and Edward Furlong is wonderful and funny too. Furlong has a squeaky voice, so he's just as funny as Arnie. He teaches him how to be hip, with hilarious results. In the process, Arnold becomes the closest thing John ever had to a father and makes him feel important.<br/><br/>I love everything T2 has to offer. It was the first R-rated movie I'd ever seen and still blows me away all these years later.<br/><br/>4/4"
"Robert_duder","10","2","4","6 April 2015"," The reason this film sits atop so many others is this....
","I have seen this film dozens of times. I am, and have been for many many years, an insatiable Arnold Schwarzenegger fan and this, of course, is his masterpiece. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a masterpiece for a number of reasons and a number of people. This film defined film-making for its time. It was the crown jewel on 80's/90's action films and sequels and science fiction and horror and special effects and stylized film making and budget....even if you hate the series or the genre, you have to step back and respect it for all those other things it completely nails. Twenty five years later and the special effects in this film not only stand up but exceed anything you can see today. I hate James Cameron's ego but gosh darn the man is a legend in pioneering film making. The film is stunning. You can watch this again and again with your mouth gaping open at the sheer epic stunning qualities. Now, in addition to that its an incredible story. Its a disturbing and dark vision of the future and the perfect follow up to the classic first film. The list of incredible scenes in this film is never ending. The first time Sarah Connor sees The Terminator again, every chase scene, every battle scene and of course the incredible apocalyptic dream of Judgement Day.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to his iconic role and he is very different than the first time. In The Terminator he was stoic and brooding and emotionless. This time he returns with far more character and distinctive emotions while still being a cyborg. It can be explained that he has been reprogrammed to have more feelings though its never mentioned. I will also say that his change in character opens the door for him to be just a little bit campy at times and yet somehow it works even given the serious nature of the film because...well he's Arnold Schwarzenegger. Linda Hamilton returns again as well and the woman is the ultimate bad-ass. Sarah Connor defines action heroine. She is beyond tough as nails and her experience in the first film has turned her into a jaded soldier that you can't help but root for. Edward Furlong plays John Connor and he certainly wouldn't have been my first choice to play the role and yet now looking back you can't imagine anyone else doing it. He is the perfect angsty and troubled teen and his dynamic with Schwarzenegger's Terminator is perfect. Robert Patrick is one of the greatest villains in cinematic history as the shape shifting metal terminator T-1000. He is practically void of emotion and is terrifying and brilliant in the role. Joe Morton also deserves mention as Skynet creator Miles Dyson.<br/><br/>I can't even fathom what the mind of James Cameron is like. He just seems to envision everything and make it seem so plausible. Terminator 2 has its share of plot holes but even knowing them and watching the film again you forget all about it because the film is so easy to watch. It is non-stop action, absolutely thrilling characters and story and as amazing and iconic as the first film is, this is one sequel that is easily heads and tails above the original. At the same time the movie cannot stand on its own without seeing the first. There is an emotional depth to knowing the events of the first movie and how they connect to this one. Terminator 2 set a bar that perhaps still has not been raised. Easily one of the best films ever made for too many reasons to even count. This is the juggernaut all action and sci-fi should attempt to live up to. 10/10"
"arnarkrist01","10","2","4","9 February 2015"," My favorite 90s Action movie
","I love this movie. Terminator 1 and 2 were the first Arnold Schwarzenegger movies I saw. The first Terminator was a great 80s movie with a great story and good acting. Then Terminator 2 just topped in in every single way and was even better. But why more Terminator movies? Judgement Day was stopped. Good guys won. We don't need to see more. You can't make a better movie than perfect and Terminator 2 is a perfect movie. But I don't care,because Terminator 3 and Salvation are just cash grabs. Nothing special. I hope James Cameron will come back and stop thinking about more Avatar movies. James Cameron is our only hope. He is Kyle Reese in this case. We get James Cameron back,good Terminators,no more Avatar movies and forget about Terminator 3 and Salvation."
"The Grand Master","10","2","4","3 January 2015"," An undisputed sci-fi classic.
","It's rare to have a sequel that outdoes the first movie. James Cameron does it bigger, better, and louder with more memorable one liners, and with awesome jaw-dropping special effects that still remain spectacularly impressive years later. <br/><br/>Like with James Cameron's previous sequel Aliens, Terminator 2: Judgement Day expands on the original while staying true to itself rather than repeating and rehashing the story. Terminator 2: Judgement Day set the bar extremely high for all movies, sequels, and special effects. In fairness to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and Terminator Salvation, although they failed to reach the same standard as Terminator 2: Judgement Day, regardless of the end result it was going to be a very hard act to follow.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in his iconic role as the Terminator. This time in a complete role reversal, he is now the good guy and has been reprogrammed and sent back in time to a modern day Los Angeles to protect John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance who led his side to victory over Skynet which was responsible for wiping out three billion human lives on August 29, 1997 in a nuclear war. In contrast to his original Terminator which was sent back in 1984 to kill his mother Sarah Connor before John was born, the Terminator is now a bodyguard/father figure to John Connor who also stays true to his promise that he would not kill anyone. Without a doubt this is a movie that Arnold Schwarzenegger will always be remembered.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick is the T-1000, an advanced terminator made up of liquid metal that is sleek, lethal, devoid of any human emotion, seemingly unstoppable, and can instantly form knives and stabbing weapons as well as assume the identity of those killed. The T-1000 appears as a Los Angeles Police Officer who can interact with other humans but little does anyone know, he has been sent back to seek out and terminate John Connor. Like a stealthy shark searching for his prey, the T-1000 is relentless in his pursuit to terminate John Connor and must also face off against The Terminator.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor. Since the first movie, she has transformed herself from a mousy, timid waitress to a muscle bound, fearless and ferocious warrior who wants to pass on the skills for her son to lead the resistance in the future. However, she has become very violent and almost mentally unstable during this time. Her fear and paranoia of the impending nuclear war as well as the events from 1984 such as her encounter with the first Terminator and the death of Kyle Reese has her institutionalised in a State Hospital for the mentally insane. Her psychologist, Dr Silberman (in an ironic twist from the first movie), fails to believe her repeated warnings and prophecies. Therefore, she remains at the State Hospital until she escapes with the assistance of the Terminator and John Connor. Although she remains distrustful of The Terminator (who she thought was going to kill her at first), she later trusts him after she witnesses the strong bond formed between John and the Terminator while at the same time reconnecting with her son John.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong will forever be remembered for his first role as a young John Connor. Before John Connor was the future leader of the human resistance, in the present day he is a 10 year old delinquent who openly defies his foster parents as well as commits petty crimes such as hacking into an ATM to steal money in order to go to the arcade with his friend. Little does John Connor know there have been two terminators that have been sent back for him which will forever change his life. <br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgement Day shows that James Cameron (who also wrote and directed The Terminator) is a brilliant director and writer along with William Wisher. The story and screenplay is top notch. Rather than having an sci-fi movie with action for the sake of action, the action is interwoven with action and character depth as well as James Cameron's impeccable eye for attention to detail including events from the past (the original movie), present and the future that take place during this movie. The visual effects still stand the test of time and all of the action sequences including the car chases, explosions and fight scenes are spectacular and by far superior from the 1984 original The Terminator.<br/><br/>I first saw Terminator 2: Judgement Day as a 9 year old back in 1993 and it forever changed my life. Terminator 2: Judgement Day kick- started my interest of movies and from that day Arnold Schwarzenegger was my childhood hero. Without a doubt, Terminator 2: Judgement Day is an undisputed classic that has certainly stood the test of time and still remains as one of my all time favourite movies.<br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10."
"Rickting","9","2","4","15 December 2014"," ""I'll Be Back."" Good!
","The Terminator is a fine film, although it feels relatively small at times. However, Terminator 2 Judgement Day completely expands the story and James Cameron crafts one of the best sequels ever made. Many years after the first film Sarah Connor is in an asylum and her son has been put into care. A far more advanced cyborg comes back to kill John Connor, while an reprogrammed terminator from the first film comes back to save John and Sarah. With a much higher budget and bigger scope, this certainly does what a sequel is meant to do. James Cameron is a director I admire but not someone who's films I automatically go and see as his films can feel somewhat cold, but this doesn't waste a dollar of its $100 million budget. James Cameron's direction offers mind blowing visuals and exhilarating action spectacle throughout, as the endlessly entertaining action scenes and surprisingly deep script leave most other sequels in the gutter. The action sequences sometimes seem to devolve as they go along, and John Connor is an annoying child sidekick, but the film achieves most of its goals in stunning style.<br/><br/>The film is amazingly made and the thrills are utterly spell binding, but there's curious depth to the film as well. The relationship between the terminator and John Connor is strangely touching and Sarah Connor is an excellent female action hero. The story is very interesting and has one of the most terrifying dream sequences I've ever seen in a film. Although the cold colouring of the film gives it a slightly artificial feel, there's enough humanity in there to make it nearly a great movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a very limited actor, but he's good at what he does and Linda Hamilton is excellent. It's also got a very good villain and the film crafts eye popping visuals all without CGI. T2 is better than the original since it's bigger, cooler and more thought provoking. It's not perfect, but in terms of superior thrills rendered with beautiful visual mastery backed up by a strong script, there are few better alternatives.<br/><br/>9/10"
"slightlymad22","10","2","4","7 December 2014"," One Of (If Not) The Greatest Sequels Ever
","Sequels are rarely better than the first movie, however Terminator 2: Judgement Day may just be in my opinion the greatest sequel ever made (that is not Godfather 2)<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: 10 years have passed since the events in ""The Terminator"" However another Terminator is sent back through time called the T-1000, which is more advanced and more powerful than its predecessor. The Mission: to kill John Connor (Edward Furlong) when he's still a child. However, John and his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) do not have to face this threat of a Terminator alone. Another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) the T-800 model from the first movie, is also sent back through time. The mission: to protect John and Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the killing machine from the future. Although saying he is perfect as a non human may not be the compliment I intended it to be!! He'll never be a good dramatic actor, he'll never be Oscar nominated like Sylvester Stallone, but he is a good action star and he has charisma in spades!! <br/><br/>Some of the cast were never as good before this movie, and never were again. Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton I'm talking to you.<br/><br/>Despite being a fine Villain here, Patrick has ended up in DTV land via two Stallone movies (Copland and D-Tox) Edward Furlong's person problems have been a massive hindrance in his career, with only American History X the only other movie worth watching in his filmography!! <br/><br/>As for Linda Hamilton, I believe she should have been nominated for an Oscar for her performance here, she is simply superb. Yet she didn't work again for 3 years, after this all the movies barring Dante's Peak were not big movies, or even good movies hardly worth of note.<br/><br/>Brad Fiedel's score is another asset to this movie, it's perfect. The Guns 'n Roses track ""You Could Be Mine"" is also a perfect fit for the movie and is a lot of fun. <br/><br/>There are amazing sensitive scenes and awesome action scenes. The downside to the action scenes is some awful use of obvious stunt doubles. But it's only nitpicking and it's hard to pick faults with a movie that gets so much right!! <br/><br/>Hands down Schwarzenegger's best movie"

","""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is one of the single handedly greatest action movies of all time.

The story is more complex in it's entirety than that, but just that plot line sounds interesting in general. The story is great, the performances are overall great, the score by Brad Fiedel is awesome, the visual effects are really good and the action is fast-paced and visceral.

","As with the first Terminator this was recommended to me by a friend at work simply because I'd never seen it. I wasn't too impressed with no. 1 and told him I wouldn't be back but he insisted that no. 2 was much better with a stronger production and is even in the IMDb top 40 films of all time. Well, he was absolutely right, but I'm glad he's moving on because I just haven't got the stamina to keep going through all of his testosterone-fuelled favourite choices.<br/><br/>It's a revision on no. 1 with a bad robot sent from the future to terminate a young boy to prevent him from growing up into an important good guy, and with a good robot also sent from the future to protect the boy. Much mayhem involving many pulverised vehicles and a tidy amount of broken glass ensues as the lad, his Mum and his rather straight faced Uncle Bob spend the picture trying to escape from the bad robot's steely clutches. Arnie being a descendant of the Tin Man in The Wizard Of Oz, beguilingly indicates he may also have a heart, it's certainly melting by the end. It helped that the music was way less dated than no. 1, and that cgi was rearing its shiny head by the time this was made. On the other hand cgi cartoonery gave Cameron & Co. a greater opportunity to portray gratuitous brutality, which they used with gusto – was there really a point in showing the good Samaritan motorist getting needled through the brain for his concern by the bad robot? As childish as pulling the wings off flies... But as it wound on it turned into a reasonable comedy – the sight of the baddie being split right down to his gizzards by the goodie and looking only slightly annoyed was surely the funniest bit. Mel and Brucie couldn't do that in Lethal Hard! Ultimately though, it was solid escapist entertainment and well worth its long running time."

","I cannot speak highly enough about this movie. Arnold's best ever work, yes it's a sequel but the fact of the matter is, it is better than the original (admittedly largely due to the advances in special effects) and far superior to any of the following films, though I hope to be corrected with the new trilogy expected. Patrick's T1000 is a genius at evil and Furlong as the future leader of 'the resistance' is a boy/man I would follow! AS is himself and you could ask no more. The story provides as many questions as it does answers, but in a really gripping way, the idea of time travel and a future without fate displayed superbly. Now, I haven't enough words in my vocabulary to describe the non-stop action or entertainment value! A shame M.Biehn couldn't feature more heavily (DVD extra/extended cut) is my only tiny criticism.

","Do remember how I became Arnie's fan. Been a long but still feels like that T2 released a day ago. Admit that I didn't watch it in the cinema hall but thanks to Star Movies; million times they showed it on TV and yeah, kind of, I was there for all those repeats. Don't know how many times I have watched it but know a fact that a whole generation grew up watching this.<br/><br/>Set the technology for Jurassic Park. Made Arnold a legend. Best machine avatar- Robert Patrick. Most remembered lines of any movie. Is like that nothing could go wrong with this movie. Flawless. <br/><br/>Despite of an old run-chase premise and the relationship between a machine and a human, the story does throw light on the minute details on the view of a machine. Arnie holds a kid for a few seconds- an observation of not only the participants of an environment but of a life per se. And also, Arnie (the machine) was more of the metaphor for a dog, symbolism of loyalty and sacrifice. Story will throw light on the minute details of human emotions; more of a symbolic manner.<br/><br/>Always be my fav."
"GusF","Null","2","4","2 September 2014"," One of the most intelligent sci-fi action thrillers ever made
","I gave the first film full marks as it works brilliantly on its own merits but this film is on another level entirely. It's one of the best sequels of all time. The action scenes are fantastic and the visual effects were utterly groundbreaking in their day and still hold up remarkably for a film which is almost a quarter of a century old. While the first half of the film is extremely strong, it reaches new heights in the second half with the character development, the Cyberdyne subplot and the spectacular finale in the factory. The turning point is Sarah Connor's dream about the nuclear holocaust, which is my favourite scene in the film.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger is no Laurence Olivier but the excellent script works around his limitations as an actor and creates a fascinating character in the Terminator, who is far less one note than his counterpart in the first film. He begins as a remorseless killing machine, no better than the T-1000 in that sense, but due to his relationship with John Connor, he develops senses of morality, sympathy and humour and even affection for John. His acting in the final scene is probably the best of his career. <br/><br/>Linda Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor, who has changed almost beyond recognition since the first film and I mean that in the best possible way. It perfectly illustrates the impact that the events of the first film had on her life in a way that many sequels fail to do. When we're first introduced to her, we learn that she stabbed Dr. Silberman in the knee with his pen. Contrast this with the slightly ditzy, disorganised young woman who couldn't balance her cheque book that we met in ""The Terminator"". Edward Furlong plays the crucial role of John Connor very well and he has great chemistry with Arnie. It's a shame that his acting career has floundered in the past decade or so. <br/><br/>Robert Patrick is suitably intimidating as the T-1000. Leaving aside shape shifting abilities, he's the only Terminator in the first three films whose baseline appearance actually works as an infiltrator since he's a normal looking person whom you wouldn't look twice at as opposed to Arnie or Kristanna Loken in ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". Out of the supporting cast, the strongest performers are Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman, reprising his role from the first film, and Joe Morton as Miles Dyson. S. Epatha Merkerson, Xander Berkeley and Jenette Goldstein are extremely good in small roles as well."
"TOMNEL","8","2","4","12 January 2011"," Perhaps a tad overrated, but an impressive and entertaining action film nonetheless.
","This film was released 20 years ago now, and looking on it now, it's still amazing they managed to make this then. Computer generated effects were not nearly as prevalent or as easy to pull off as they are today, and because of these facts, this movie is a really interesting piece of cinema history. And at the time, the effects were amazing, sort of like how many feel about Avatar today, but is this film really one of the best of all time? I'm going to say no, and in addition to that, the original Terminator which was done on a much smaller budget is a better film.<br/><br/>So, it's been 13 years since the first Terminator, and Sarah Connor is now in an insane asylum after all of her nonsensical ramblings of Terminators got too much for people. Her son John Connor is living in a foster home and he's now a hoodlum. To top off all these wacky family dynamics, a reprogrammed Terminator is sent back in time to protect John, who, in the future, is the leader of the war against the machines. Sent to kill John is a T-1000 model shape shifter Terminator disguised cleverly as Robert Patrick in a cop uniform. After various plot developments, Sarah Connor decides she must assassinate the man who created the original Terminator so all of this could end. Chaos ensues.<br/><br/>To start with the positives, this movie has some awesome action scenes. A motorcycle/bus chase in a drainage ditch is a pretty cool way to kick start the action in this picture. The special effects for the time are amazing, and still today, they look good. The characters are likable enough to get the audience rooting for them. Even Arnie as a robot gained audience support in his programmed quest. The movie at times, is funny, and many one liners that might have come off as corny, come off as tongue and cheek amusing. The final 20 minutes or so of the film are really good, and make up mostly for the middle lag. And Robert Patrick plays an excellent villain. His uncaring stare is very menacing.<br/><br/>The negatives...well, how about that John Connor? Edward Furlong gave a good performance, but, perhaps they could've given the kid less corny lines of dialogue. From time to time, the kid came off as irritating, completely due to the dialogue he had to work with. The first half of the movie is really good, and action packed, and interesting to see how Sarah copes with living in the nut house. When Sarah decides to go kill Terminator creator Miles Dyson, the film goes downhill. Why exactly? Hard to say. Sarah Connor is only doing what she can to save the world, but she becomes somewhat unlikable here, and after the long opening where she and John meet up for the first time in several years, she leaves again. And she didn't even seem that happy to see her son, the supposed ""savior of the human race"" to begin with. It almost seemed as though when the T-1000 went off for long periods of time, the movie became slightly less interesting. And I'm not one who wanted Mr. Patrick on screen all the time, it just wasn't as exciting, and the characters weren't well written enough for the amount of time they were given for development (except for Arnold). <br/><br/>The only specific scene that really irritated me was when John called for help as the Terminator grabbed him. He's screaming for help, and then when two guys come up to help, John chews them out. What a little punk. This boy who cries wolf better watch out or he's going to get killed by people trying to help him. This scene actually mars John's character a bit, but perhaps I'm just venting my extreme dislike of him pointlessly being a jerk.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great action film...meaning the action scenes were mostly great. The movie lags a bit in the middle, and the writing isn't as good as it could be (writing is clearly not one of Mr. Cameron's strong points), but overall, this is one interesting film. A must see for fans of Arnold, or fans of James Cameron. I liked the first Terminator better because it almost played as a character piece, while this is pure action. Either way, these two movies make for an interesting contrast, and definitely should be watched.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 150 mins. R for violence."
"MBunge","9","2","4","3 June 2010"," It's almost impossible for an action movie to get any better than this
","Terminator 2 is one of the rarest things in Hollywood. It's the big honking sequel to a great little film that manages to be great itself.<br/><br/>The great little film is one of the joys of watching movies . It's a movie that doesn't have a lot of money or star power behind it. It's just storytellers with an idea who makes it come alive on the big screen. Unfortunately, if someone makes a great little movie today, they oftentimes get a buttload of money thrown at them to make a sequel. And almost invariably, that sequel sucks.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is the exception to that rule. This isn't just a great movie, it's actually a more complex and sophisticated film than its predecessor. Ostensibly, it's a chase movie very much like The Terminator, just with the action and spectacle amped up by spending a lot more money. But there's a depth and craft to the story that goes beyond the first movie.<br/><br/>Once again, two warriors have been sent back in time, one seeking to kill and one to save John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future savior of humanity from its machine enemies. John's now a budding juvenile delinquent living with foster parents in Los Angels, while his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) is locked up in a mental institution after being caught trying to blow up a computer factory. Eventually, John hooks up with a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzengger) like the one from the first film, but this one has been programmed to obey his commands. The other future warrior (Robert Patrick) is a more advanced Terminator, made out of liquid metal that can shapeshift and imitate anything it touches. John and his pet Terminator break his mother out of the institution and come to realize they have a chance to change the future, to avoid the nuclear holocaust that allowed machines to begin hunting down and exterminating mankind. But to do so, they've got to overcome their seemingly unbeatable, unstoppable foe.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best and most impressive thing about Terminator 2 is how well written it is. Exposition is one of the hardest things to do well in movies. Usually, there are some things that the audience needs to know and the only way you can tell them is to have a character just say those things out loud. The exposition dump is frequently the worst scene in any film. But there's no one big dump scene in Terminator 2. Instead, we get little bursts of exposition spaced throughout the first three-quarters of the story and every time it makes perfect sense for the characters to be saying the things they're saying. The story also does a tremendous job of establishing things in the audience's mind that later play a major role in the action. The worst sort of writing is when the only way you can resolve a problem or move the story forward is by pulling something out of thin air that's never been referenced or mentioned in the story before. There's never a point in Terminator 2 where you have to wonder ""Where did that come from?"" because it establishes everything you need to know so the next step in the story is surprising and compelling, but it still flows logically and naturally from what you've watched. There are also numerous moments in Terminator 2 where characters echo things from the first film but with completely different meanings and context, adding another level of enjoyment if you watched The Terminator.<br/><br/>The writing also creates a world where things make sense, even in an outlandish sci-fi concept like this. Sarah Connor starts out the film as a deeply emotionally damaged woman, which is much more realistic than the idea a person could go through what she's gone through and came out smiling and happy on the other side. And even though one of the main characters is this action-adventure is a young boy, he's treated like an actual boy. He doesn't pick up a gun and start blowing people away or turn into some incredible warrior. His mom and The Terminator take care of all that and John helps them in believable ways. It's not like Star Wars: Phantom Menace where young Anakin Skywalker does things just as dangerous and deadly as any of the adults, thereby undermining any real sense of threat of menace.<br/><br/>The quality of the writing also enhances the special effects, which usually works the other way around. Many times effects are thrown on the screen to amaze the audience and take the place of the story, but because the effects in Terminator 2 only serve to enhance the tension and energy built up by the story, they still work even they're more than a decade-and-a-half behind today's FX standards.<br/><br/>Beyond the quality of the film, Terminator 2 is also remarkable for the message woven through it. This is a movie where numerous people are shot, stabbed, burned and blown up, but it fundamentally believes that human life is valuable and killing is just wrong. John Connor embodies that simple idea, insisting in even the most dire of circumstances that life be respected and protected at all costs. Most violent movies present violence as the way to solve problems. Terminator 2 contends that while you may sometimes need to shoot someone, the only way to really make things better is to get past the need to hurt and kill other people.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is one of the best action movies of all time, with a moral center to it that even elevates it above other great action flicks. And it's also a wonderful example of how an artist can grow and improve himself. The James Cameron who made Terminator 2 was a much better filmmaker than the James Cameron who made The Terminator. George Lucas has shown us that it's just as easy for a filmmaker to go in the opposite direction."

"fernandoschiavi","9","0","0","22 May 2020"," ""Terminator 2"" remains a great classic of cinema, amplifying elements of action, science fiction and terror in an instigating story full of anthological moments
","James Cameron had already managed to raise the bar for a powerful franchise, but he hadn't created it with ""Aliens (1986)"" and decided seven years later to make the film sequence that elevated him to one of the biggest names in Hollywood. After the revolutionary first film that brought science fiction with a new, frightening and, above all, credible premise to the public, the time came to raise the concepts previously discussed to a new level. The film remained paused for a time, because of Schwarzenegger's busy career and problems with franchise rights, disputed by the original distributor Hemdale and the producer Carolco. After Carolco bought the rights in 1990, Cameron finally signed on to do T2 in March 1990, without even having a script ready. The feature film was the first of what would be James Cameron's hallmark, the extravagance in writing, producing and directing films with large budgets, as could be seen in the following years in ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"", which for a long time were the two biggest box office in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Transforming the villain from the original film into the hero of the sequel was just one of James Cameron's many hits in Terminator 2: The Final Judgment. Arnold Schwarzenegger was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time and it was simply impossible to imagine him out of sequence, especially with the actor's great interest in participating in the feature film. Resolving the hero issue, the gap of a major villain was left open. And the second production hit came up, with Robert Patrick's lineup as the unbeatable T-1000. Far from having the same physicist as Schwarzenegger, the robotic nemesis of the T-800 was gaining strength as a more advanced technology. And this technology, created from an extremely versatile liquid metal, was presented to us with cutting edge visual effects, making us believe that it was possible for a threat of that magnitude to face the big Austrian.<br/><br/>In general, the sequences of great action or fiction films try to be bigger and more spectacular than the original. Usually, this ends up generating films that cannot get close to the original. ""Terminator 2"" is one of the exceptions to the rule. Estimated at an estimated $ 105 million (most expensive film in history until True Lies, coincidentally also directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger), against the 6.5 million Terminator budget, until then, it was the longest running most ambitious and most successful in the history of cinema. Cameron can keep the main names of the technical team and with an evolution in visual effects, in short, some ideas that would take the story forward could be put into practice. Here, Cameron, who wrote the screenplay with William Wisher, manages to broaden the concepts passed with parsimony in the previous film, now focusing all efforts on the trio of protagonists, the T-800 model, Sarah and John Connor.
As well done and original as the first film could be, this multiple continuation in quality each item. The clash between the exterminators and the background of the mother separated from the hospitalized son trying to keep herself healthy in front of everyone, take the film forward. Sarah's bow matches exactly what had been presented. After the events of the first film and the fact that she defeated the exterminator in a hydraulic press was concealed by the company, Sarah became obsessed with the story that the son she had could lead humanity in a rebellion against the machines in the future. She then became involved with anyone who could teach her and especially her son John, how to deal with weapons and be a leader, until one day she was caught and committed to an institution because of her speech about the ending. world, doomsday, when machines will take over the planet. Her son, John Connor, strides to become a juvenile delinquent, even at a young age, after being separated from his mother. When faced with the T-800, John, who until then did not believe in his mother's madness, realizes that she was right and devises a plan to free her from the institution. This is just the beginning of an adventure that will put the dangerous and cold T-1000 of the increasingly human T-800 on a collision course. Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, from an ordinary girl and frightened by the scenery that was designed for her in the first film, became an authentic warrior, wielding weapons and fearless as expected from the mother of the future Resistance leader.<br/><br/>We have a much safer and more convincing Arnold Schwarzenegger as an action hero. The Austrian is the main predicate of this continuation, managing to give a certain humanity to the T-800, without letting the character become a pastiche in relation to the original. There are jokes that work well and even though he seems a bit childish in serving as the bodyguard for young John Connor, they do not differ from the overall mood of the film. The boy Edward Furlong delivers a canny John Connor, a rebel in transition to adolescence, but also full of charisma and intelligence. Meanwhile, Arnold enjoys playing the symbol of the franchise, but this time, replacing all the relentlessness of the previous film with the goal of protecting the future leader of humans. The interaction of the two characters works so exquisitely that it is impossible not to connect emotionally with the relationship between boy and monster. In addition, ""Hasta la Vista, Baby"" joins I'll be Back as one of the memorable and repeated phrases. In addition, we have an extremely dangerous villain in the figure of Robert Patrick thanks to liquid metal technology, which makes his actions somewhat unpredictable. The cyborg brings the necessary sense of danger and urgency, making the public fear its intense presence through the movement and antics of the T-1000. The fact that it is more advanced than the T-800 model establishes an oppositional character, as if Exterminator 2 were a clash between old and new spectral effects.<br/><br/>Cameron shows his best form, filming great action sequences while developing the plot and the relationships between the trio of protagonists. It is interesting to see how the film is assembled in small arches, with each action scene being well prepared before it occurs. The initial rhythm is mind-boggling and goes on a crescendo until the director slams the brakes and then accelerates until the end of the film. The director still provides us with memorable action scenes like the meeting between the exterminators at the mall, the initial chase - entitled to a truck plummeting from an elevation, Sarah Connor's escape from the asylum and the Cyberdyne invasion, the chase involving trucks, cars and even helicopters through the city streets and all the decisive climax in a molten steel factory put this feature as one of the most electrifying action films of the 1990s.
On the technical side, Industrial Light & Magic was responsible for taking care of the visual effects, which resulted in work that has not aged practically since 1991. Although it makes great use of computer generated effects, the practical effects have not been abolished and have been idealized by Stan Winston and his company. The late makeup magician and his team possibly delivered their best work of all time, including being recognized with an Oscar, as well as the visual effects. Stan Winston School of Character Arts, responsible for most of the costumes and other elements of the film's production, used manual molds to bring some of the most striking moments of the film to life, as in the case of the villain, model T-1000. To allow this malleability of the character to be realistic enough, the studio built dozens of carefully sculpted and detailed models to be used during filming, meaning that most of the supposed special effects you saw in the cinema were actually very puppets well done that emulated the actor Robert Patrick being split in half or melting. This allowed director James Cameron to offer a visual realism that the effects obtained at the time had not yet achieved.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, once again, was in charge of Brad Fiedel, who reinterpreted themes from the 1984 film and energized the new tracks to rise to the frenzy of the action. The sonority speaks exquisitely with impeccable visuality, from the setting of the War of the Future to the nightmare scenes, as well as the anatomy of the exterminators, all dictated by vivacious photography with the support of the sumptuous Fiedel soundtrack.<br/><br/>James Cameron evolved the story to the boiling point, establishing a mythology of its own taking the experiment with special effects and action to its peak, filled with breathtaking pursuits. To this day, he is worshiped as the ""Godfather"" of action films, as well as one of the first blockbusters to highlight female empowerment at a time when Hollywood did not even dream of it. Winner of 4 Oscars and realized as the final chapter of the saga, Terminator 2: The Final Judgment closes the ideas started in 1984 very well. James Cameron even recorded an ending with an elderly Sarah Connor, closing possibilities for continuations, but not included it at the request of the studio. As the creator does not rule his creature, the series left the hands of the director and won sequences that, if they are not totally disposable, never get close to the two original feature films. ""Terminator 2"" remains, even almost three decades after its release, a great classic of cinema, amplifying elements of action, science fiction and terror in an instigating story full of anthological moments. Acclaimed by expert critics, it is still listed by critics, viewers and specialized organizations, such as the American Film Institute, as one of the best films in the science fiction and action genre of all time. It is also seen as one of the best sequences in cinema."

He brings a very subtle level of sweetness and humour to the role that is underappreciated. My main issue with the film is the final 30-40 minutes which become a little childish.

Arnold Schwarzenegger was a huge star when this sequel was made, so this time he HAD to be the hero of the film, this time becoming the protector of a young John Connor, who is being hunted by a more advanced Terminator model played to perfection by Robert Patrick with cold animal-like predatory menace. The ""Boy and His Dog"" story starts fairly quickly, as a young John Connor befriends the futuristic killer cyborg. Connor teaches him tricks (i.e. that car keys are often under sun visors and, of course, ""Hasta la vista, baby""), the boy and his pet Terminator save each other at different points in the film, and in the end John has to give his beloved Terminator a sad farewell that's every bit as touching as when the boy in ""Old Yeller"" says to his mama ""Listen. Old Yeller just saved your life and Elizabeth's, too. And he saved mine and Arliss'. We can't. We don't know for certain. I'll pen him up where he can't get out. A-and then we'll wait. We could not shoot up like he was nothing. Don't you understand?"" Or when Elliott in ""E.T."" tells his pet alien ""You could be happy here, I could take care of you. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together, E.T."" And in T2, it's every bit as touching when the Terminator tells John there is another Cyberdyne chip that must also be destroyed, to which John replies, ""No, no no!! It'll be okay. Stay with us! Don't do it. Please... don't go --"" with tears streaming down his face. So my point here is that you pair the durable ""Boy and His Dog"" story with wildly exciting and muscular action courtesy of director/co-writer James Cameron (man, do I wish he'd make a straight-up non-preachy action film again ALA ""The Terminator"" or ""Aliens"") and strong performances by Patrick as the T-1000, Edward Furlong as the young John Connor, and particularly Linda Hamilton as the fierce and buffed our tiger mom, Sarah Connor, you have a movie that's pretty irresistible. The CGI does seem fairly primitive at times, but most of it surprisingly holds up with the mix of practical and CGI when displaying the T-1000's knives and stabbing weapons. If I did have a complaint upon rewatching T2, it's that the sequel shifted too greatly in tone from the original, relying too much on one-liners and comedic elements. Admittedly, the one-liners are good and the comedy is genuinely funny, but the hard edge of the original is what makes that first film easily the best in the series. Still, sequels of this era had a penchant for radical shifts in tone and story (i.e. ""Mad Max"" to the ""The Road Warrior"" or ""First Blood"" to ""Rambo: First Blood Part II""). Overall, although T2 takes a major shift in the direction of family-friendly with the ""A Boy and His Dog"" storyline, but the characters, story, and especially the action are brilliant and impossible not to enjoy."

Terminator 2 increases the action and James Cameron pushes the boundaries of special effects, like he does with each new film. This is part II, not a useless sequel.

"vjnambu","8","0","0","16 March 2020"," Best terminator film
","I felt the first terminator film pretty average as I found the plot very thin. In first terminator, arnie was a cyborg from future who comes to kill sarah connor.
In judgment day, arnie plays a cyborg from future who comes to protect sarah connor's son john connor from another evil cyborg this time.
When a negative character turns into a positive one then audience will love them like never before. That's the main reason why everyone loves judgment day so much. Arnie is perfect as terminator. Sarah connor this time is in a mental asylum due to the shocking events she had to face in the first terminator. In the first part, she was bit naive and confused but in judgment day she's badass. Edward furlong is quite over aged as john connor. He was a teenager at that time but the character demanded an 8 year old kid. Robert patrick was menacing as the villain.
My favorite scenes were terminator saving john connor in the beginning and terminator and john saving sarah from mental hospital.
But soon after the escape from mental hospital scene film gets slowed down and the ending drags a lot. Also due to the later sequels, the emotional climax reduces its impact.
On the whole, judgment day is a best sequel. The terminator theme from this I always hum around."
"GiraffeDoor","9","0","0","11 March 2020"," For once a sequel that both needed to be made and did everything you wanted it to. And more.
","The perfect sequel experience.<br/><br/>When an impending doom is alluded to in the first movie, a part of you really wants to see how they actually fight it.<br/><br/>And this is that story. From its opening scenes of the burning playground, I'm always immediately drawn into what is really a much more powerful and emotionally charged picture than some people would want to assume. Sure we have breathtaking action sequences and machisimo but we also have a narrative of people whose lives have been torn apart by something they never chose to be part of yet still are.<br/><br/>The first act twist (I won't spoil it but if you've read nothing about this plot then please don't!) is sort of an obvious move but it is so cool. We get some nifty new Terminator abilities and Arnie is unforgettable as something ostensibly with no feelings but manages to really put some character into this machine (sorry, cybernetic organism). I suppose on one level it's a story about family. Not in the trite sanctimonious way, but as a much more creditable snapshot of people making the best with what they can get.<br/><br/>The horror movie vibe of the first one is gone along with the '80s camp. We have a progression to a new aesthetic as well as a totally new tone as this is less about the escape from the indefatigable visitor and more about a real confrontation between the ragtag group and those who would enslave the earth.<br/><br/>Does it sometimes push the limits of sentimentality? Sure. But I like to thing it's more about characterisation. Sarah Connor remains to be an enduringly excellent character for her strength but also her vulnerability when a lot of characters in these kinds of movies (especially the female ones) can only show one or the other. It's rather criminal Linda Hamilton never became known for much more than this.<br/><br/>A movie that never fails to move me."

","Interesting narratives where James Cameron reveals his vision of the future. Arnold Schwarzenegger endowed his hero with human qualities. The second part of ""Terminator"" reveals more events, events that are important for this story, a story where the fate of a person is decided. It was the original ideas of the scriptwriters and their vision of the future that expanded the plot of this universe. Terminator 2 is a textbook example of how the second part can surpass the original; this is a rare case of a blockbuster with brains; This is a movie that justified all the expectations assigned to it; this is a picture that raised the bar of action to an unprecedented height; and finally, this is the film that gave the world the immortals ""Hasta la vista, baby."

","This was the sequel to The Terminator. It was a solid sequel - a sequel that delivered. Some would go onto say this is one of the best sequels ever made - certainly, one of the best and greatest action sequels ever. There are some, such as myself, that still think the first one is better, but they are both fine movies anyway. What I enjoyed the most about Terminator 2: Judgement Day was how John Connor, and later, Sarah Connor, need to get away from the Cyborg that's out to get them. That was epic! They had help though in one of the cyborgs that's on their side in the escape. It wasn't easy getting away from the Cyborg that's out to get them, and it was kind of scary, but somehow, John and Sarah, along with the Cyborg on their side find a way. The movie gets more and more better, as well as interesting. The story in the movie is very interesting. It makes you want to know more about Skynet, what it is, and what it does, and why it must be destroyed. The standout performer in this movie was obviously Arnold Schwarzenegger, as this film is one of his best. I don't think anyone else could've played his role better other than him. He was brilliant in playing the Terminator, and it was good seeing him on the right side this time, and that worked to his favour. I liked the attire he was wearing. He was cool with that attire, and on that bike. That front cover or famous front cover says all we need to know. Terminator 2: Judgement Day was a brilliant movie. A good title, too, for the film."

","T2, for close friends, is a far-reaching cinematographic and social phenomenon.<br/><br/>James Cameron, who is well known for his legendary perfectionism, finally had the budget and artistic control to bring his titanic visions to life in his first movie of monumental proportions, which acknowledged him as an Author, before his final cut of Abyss in 1992, his Titanic in 1997, his Avatar in 2009, and before the next chapters of this extremely rich universe, which in turn will revolutionize the world of cinema during this decade.<br/><br/>Perfection; that is the right word! Because, James Cameron invests with head, heart, body and soul for decades in his pharaonic projects. And his magic achieves such top performance in all areas pertaining to his monuments, which are also laboratories of technical innovation, that they instantly become classic, cult and pivotal works that change the face of cinematic art.<br/><br/>There is a ""before and after"" T2 for the whole team who contributed to the creation of that ""Judgment Day"", as well as for any discerning moviegoer and simple average spectator. No superlative words were good enough to describe Terminator 2 when it was released in 1991, from the biggest budget in the history of filmmaking, to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton then at the peak of their glory in the role of their lives, to revolutionary special effects, especially those regarding the liquid metal T-1000, also embodied with icy perfection by Robert Patrick. James the Magician thus began his journey to becoming crowned ""King of the World"" at the North American and worldwide box office, as well as at the Academy Awards.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, it's also the film of superlatives that broke all records, since I saw this movie ten times in theaters, between its world premiere at Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas in Century City, Los Angeles, and different cinemas in various places both in California and in Europe, between July and December 1991.

Revealing in a criss-cross shoot-out that Terminator is now on the Connor's side, Cameron impressively concludes the Terminator saga, whilst at the same time building on themes that run across his credits, plugged into a warning of technical advances in the (unintended) inventor of Terminator being confronted by his creation warning of a future nuclear holocaust.<br/><br/>Although the message is layered out a bit thickly in Sarah's narration, (something which re-occurs in Cameron's titles) the writers continue the parental theme from Sarah being pregnant with John at the end of the first, to here John (a wonderfully scrappy Edward Furlong) developing a fatherly relationship with the Terminator, who stops Sarah from becoming a killing machine who sees "" no fate"" in the world, which leads to Sarah (a tough, burnt at the edges Linda Hamilton) going on a road to optimism that if a Terminator can overcome machines to find humanity,mankind may also be able to.<br/><br/>The first film with a $100 million budget, Director James Cameron & his regular cinematographer Adam Greenberg put every cent on screen in spectacular Action set-pieces, locked and loaded on nail-biting chase sequences of the camera following Terminator (a blunt,dead-pan comedic Arnie) trying to keep the Connor's safe. Reuniting with Stan Winston, Cameron combines Winston's practical creations with ILM's CGI to mesmerising effect, via the the morphing liquid metal of the T-1000 (a chilling, dead behind the eyes Robert Patrick) smashing the twisted, damaged metal of the Terminator in a battle for judgement day."

He lives with his step parent Todd Voight( Xander Berkeley) and Janelle Voight( Janette Goldstein). His step parents are kind of hateful, and John hates them. Sarah is locked up in Pascaclero State Hospital. She is stronger and still no one will believe her story about the Terminator and Reese. Dr. Stillman ( Earl Boen) finds her story absurd. Especially the one about Reese coming back from 2029 and protecting her, then fathering her child. Sarah is having no success getting released early no matter what she does.<br/><br/>In T2-Judgement Day two terminators are sent back, one is a more powerful model, the T-100 ( Robert Pactrick) and T-100 ( Arnold Schwarzenegger). The T-100 has been reprogrammed to protect John Connor. The T-1000 is sent to eliminate him. The T-1000 is more powerful, indestructible, and made of liquid metal. When Sarah comes face to face with the T-100 her fears come back, until she sees the T-1000. The T-100 has been reprogrammed for protection, not destruction. Sarah still wants to kill it though, but john has developed a strong bond with it. The T-1000 can take the worst impact of a bullet /weapon and is able to heal in no time. It is able to imitate anyone or anything. Sarah, John, and T-100 have to make a plan to destroy it. They must first find Skynet and the creator of the Cyberdine systems. By keeping there chips and part of the first terminator, he is creating a path for Earth's destruction in 1997. If they find the chip they can destroy it and possibly change Earth's destruction. In the Skynet scene there is a lot of action, but it is success. I thing still remains the destruction of the T-1000. They find a steel plant and destroy it by putting it in hot steel, but one cyber chip remains the T-100. When John learns the terminator needs to terminate, Sarah and John must lower him in the steel. It's for the best, but John has lost a friend even if it is an android. This is a great sequel, the special effects were out of this world. I believe the special effects made the movie, and it was nice to see Arnold as the good guy. A great film all around."

John Connor, played by Edward Furlong, is a child under a foster home and Sarah Connor is interred in a mental health hospital. A new terminator is sent to assassinate John Connor.<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgment Day is an excellent sequel to The Terminator. This movie takes the action that audiences enjoyed in the first movie and elevates it to a new height. It successfully creates the same feelings as the first movie with the awe of action created by cyborgs. This movie is not only a great sequel but a masterful entry in action movies. Terminator 2: Judgment Day has excellent chase and action set pieces. This movie spawned endless copies that could only hope to emulate the incredibly well-done action scenes in this movie. Most of the action scenes in this movie are composed of chases when the T-1000 acquires John Connor. The movie varies this by coming up with various reasons for the chase to occur. These reasons make perfect sense in the movie.<br/><br/>The writing in this movie is different from the first movie. The movie prioritizes action scenes more so than the first movie. This is not a problem as Terminator 2: Judgment Day still has the heart and brain of the original. The movie successfully blends action and the thoughtfulness of the first movie that held the original's appeal past the action. The movie utilizes its characters in Sarah Connor, John Connor, and the T-800 well. These characters are developed incredibly well from the first movie. Sarah Connor still maintains her character development from the first movie. In the sequel, she is more determined to prevent the apocalyptic future. She has a nice character arc in trying to recover her humanity. John Connor has a good character arc in becoming the future leader of humanity he was meant to be. The T-800 even has a good character arc in the machine attempting to understand humanity.<br/><br/>The villain of the T-1000 is both intimidating and unique. This villain has plans to trap the heroes and every scene that he was in he had a great presence. The T-1000 easily made the movie special and created a great dynamic with the characters unable to destroy the villain until the end.<br/><br/>The direction by James Cameron is masterful. I found all the scenes beautiful and interesting in some way. The movie creates many great scenes and the action scenes above all have such great care and attention to it. All of the scenes in this movie are masterfully done and creates the high level of quality the audience will appreciate. The movie benefits greatly from the added budget from the first movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.'<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Terminator 2 is iconic, Even now its a superb watch, ageing fairly well. Its a movie that does so many things well, its gripping and scary in its own way. There is a sense of dread, running away from an unstoppable force. The coming together of these two machines is timed well, giving space to set up a grand finale. There are many memorable moments topped by famous music and recognisable lines. Terminator 2 will always be one of the best movies of all time and deserves to be watched for generations to come. Its almost so full of intent that it becomes powerful, whilst thankfully rich in entertainment, beginning to end."

","Since the first terminator failed to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of a man who would defeat them, the machines send a more advanced T-1000 model in 1995 to kill ten-year-old John. At the same time, future John sends reprogrammed T-800 to protect him and the madness begins again.<br/><br/>This time, the story is somewhat more complex, and 15 times bigger budget and advanced technology bring richer scenery and better special effects, so the film wins 4 Oscars: for sound, sound effects, visual effects and makeup. It gained cult status and, with ""Star Wars"" and ""The Matrix"", it's one of the most popular SF movies. Schwarzenegger moves from the role of a villain into the lead and gets more space to show what he's capable of and, despite popular belief, he's quite good. Linda Hamilton reprises the role of Sarah Connor and also provides much better performance than in the first film. And she looks better too. John Connor was the debut role for then fourteen-year-old Edward Furlong, which launched him among stars and provided him with a career on a big screen, and Robert Patrick made us believe in liquid metal robots and blurred the line between SF and horror.<br/><br/>While the first movie has an essentially stronger story and more tense atmosphere, this one is more impressive on the technical side, and it's hard to say which one is better. After all, these are two parts of the same story and can be seen as a two-part film, which in my opinion deserves strong<br/><br/>8/10"

The movie is actually no better or worse than the first one, a very impressive feat considering how much sequels usually suck ninety percent of the time. The acting was really great and the kid does the best kid performance that I have probably ever seen. The terminators and their fighting scenes are some really high quality action and silent acting. Robert Patrick did a good job here although he aged super badly which is un related but I just always feel the need to point that out when I talk about this movie. That scene at the end where the terminator kills himself is heart breaking and the bond he got with the kid was great and the mothers final speech about how even robots have feelings should have been how the series ended."

","The Terminator was a smash hit when it was released so by the time that Judgement day came out fans were looking forward to more from the series and see more action than before.

","This is the second continued story of ""The Terminator"". This fact tells that The Terminator series is famous and popular one. Actually, I have seen the first movie, which was recommended by my mother. I noticed the difference compared to the previous movie. One thing different from the first one is that there are two crazy men, the terminators. One terminator is the same person as in the previous one and the other is not. The new terminator looks for one guy to catch him. The main character is required to save the guy. This movie is a very thrilling. This is the biggest point of this series. We will not be bored while watching The Terminator. Moreover, one thing I thought interesting is how the main character has changed from the previous story. He kills human before for nothing, but now he tries to save human.This makes the story more moving than the previous story.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a story of two iron men who are very different from each other even though both are very powerful. The viewers should watch the previous story first and see what has changed of the main character and what is similar."
"goreilly40","9","0","0","30 August 2015"," Excellent sequel
","I may be one of those rare people who believe that the movie didn't suffer because Arnold's character had gone from villain to hero, in fact the change is explained when John Connor encounters the Terminator for the first time, and the explanation provided is actually plausible as machines and computers can be reprogrammed and it isn't actually the same Terminator as before. Robert Patrick does a surprisingly good performance as the T-1000 and is just as merciless and frightening and more resourceful as his counterpart in the previous movie, and at times displays a sadistic side. Sarah Connor undergoes somewhat of a transformation from damsel in distress to a formidable warrior whose not afraid to get stuck in, and Linda Hamilton makes the transition look easy. The part of John Connor is depicted by Edward Furlong who goes from problem child to troubled child in a relatively short time. The other characters, although minor support the main cast well enough, particularly Earl Boen as Dr Silberman. The action and fight sequences are some of the best and more memorable ones of the 90's, and the ending is actually very moving and ends on a cautiously optimistic note. In some cases you get a sequel which doesn't spoil your experience of its predecessor, and this is one of those, a must have for action movie and sci-fi lovers."

","It's been over 20 years since the film's release and lots of things, like the story, the acting and special effects are still better than newer films these days. Not to say new movies suck, far from it. There are several different DVD releases of T2 and my personal favorite is the special edition. It includes more scenes that advance the plot more the before. To be completely honest I can't think of any negatives for T2 that's not after the movie came, what I mean by that is the fact Edward Furlong went into drugs after is just sad. Arnold Schwarzenegger again play the T-800 perfectly and Robert Patrick as the T-1000 is great. Character changes are fantastic, Sarah Conner wins my award of best developed character in that film. The story still to this day blows me away, when I was younger the film's story is still fantastic. As I got older it stayed the same, no film has done that for me. Like I have said I can't fault this film, so sorry if this review wasn't helpful but this movie is just that good."

","Terminator 2 is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. Out of all the amazing work that Arnold has done in his career this to me is his best the one liners, the it's good to be back type of feeling this movie has it all. In comparison to this movie and the first movie I think one of the only things terminator 1 suffered from was the fact that Kyle Reese and Arnold's terminator couldn't come to blows due to the fact that one punch and Kyle would be dead. However in this movie it's terminator vs terminator so the stakes are definitely higher than before. Not to mention the fact that Arnold's a lower model than his opponent in this movie and trust me Arnold gets wrecked. The ending to this movie is something that gets me every time. I've watched this at least 3 times in the last 5 years and that ending always puts a tear in my eye. Overall terminator 2 judgment day is a timeless movie that I guarantee you 10 years from now this movie will still be considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time."

","In 2029, the battle rages on between killer machines and human resistance fighters. In a plot to eliminate John Connor, leader of the rebellion, the machines sent a Terminator back to 1984 to eliminate his mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). When that failed, the machines sent one more. This one about thirteen years later, to eliminate John himself while still a child. This time around, the resistance chose to send another protector: a re-programmed Terminator T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Flashback to '97 (though filmed in '91), John Connor (Edward Furlong) is a disrespectful, foul-mouthed, little punk. As for Sarah, gone is the mousy woman from the first film. She's now a hard-as-nails survivalist. Because she tried to blow up a computer company, she got put into a mental institution. With steely determination, the new Terminator, T-1000 (Robert Patrick), tracks down and attempts to kill them both. But the T-800 proves quite a worthy defender! Building upon the original movie, Terminator 2 goes further into the back story of how Judgment Day came around. As well as the scientists responsible for the fateful events. The relationship between the three central characters is at turns touching and even heartbreaking. Personally, I got a little tired of John's wise-ass attitude after a while. And perhaps Sarah's tough persona was a little too violent and unstable at times. But the movie does have some thought-provoking comments to make on technology gone awry, and man's inevitable slide into self-destruction. Visual effects have never been put to better use, especially in regards to the T-1000, who has the ability to morph itself into virtually anyone. My only real complaint is with the re-issued special edition that adds about thirty minutes of footage back in. Some of the extra stuff seems unnecessary. But apart from that, this film is pitch-perfect. Representing the best that sci-fi/ action has to offer!"

Arnold IS the Terminator but I think that even better role is played by Robert Patrick as T1000, ruthless and merciless killer. Movie's special effects holds up even today magnicifically and that liquid metal that forms T1000...just love it. I personally like much more also the miniature work that they have done on this movie (against the CGI now days). Also the soundtrack kicks you in the balls and especially I love the T1000 dark ambient theme.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is just awesome and amazing and as we say in Finland Perkeleen hyvä (positive way).

From the in depth characterisation of all the major players to the dynamics rolled out over the course of the film in terms of action, change of pace, feel and ideologies.<br/><br/>The action itself is still as thrilling as ever. Go back and watch the hospital break scene, it's nearly perfect. Sarah's change from soft skinned waitress to formidable soldier is clear as she single handedly brings about her escape from a high security prison hospital.<br/><br/>The terminator character in T2 has never been better or bettered.

"aldinchova","Null","0","0","14 August 2013"," Is the future written ?
","Movies from Terminator franchise, especially first two (The Terminator and Judgement Day) directed by James Cameron are considered by many as strong anti-nuclear films with deep message of preciousness of peace in the time where immense destructive power of modern technology if abused beyond limits can bring our civilization to destruction and human race to the brink of extinction. First movie The Terminator was made in 1984. still the time of Cold War and increased tension and competition of two superpowers - USA and USSR. That was a time of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative or so-called ""Star Wars"" program, last phase of Cold War period while nuclear arsenals of both superpowers were at their peak (some 60.000 American and Soviet nuclear warheads by the end of 1980s which was enough to destroy life on our planet several times over, today's American and Russian nuclear arsenals are two and half times smaller, but still enough to wipe out Earth's life two or three times). <br/><br/>James Cameron made a movie The Terminator, first in series that represented a message of mankind faced with existential threat against nuclear weapons and any kind of madness that would bring us to the edge of survival. That element of message is also present in a second Terminator movie (Judgement Day) from 1991 (both movies talking about 3 billion casualties of nuclear war caused by Sky Net), although by then period of Cold War was over with most of the nuclear threat to mankind removed (threats of today, including those with nuclear weapons are of much different nature). But there is a deeper message of Terminator movies. It's a story that tells us about destructiveness of human nature. That element is present in all four Terminator movies (including Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines from 2003 and Terminator Salvation from 2009) and that element will probably be the basic ingredient in next Terminator movie scheduled for 2015. <br/><br/>Destructiveness as part of human beings is so greatly shown in a scene from Terminator 2 when T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is commenting on children's game with guns (although just toys) telling to John Connor (Edward Furlong) - ""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"". So, is it? If I say, it is, it would be just part of the answer. Part of the point of all Terminator movies (of which Terminator 2 Judgement Day represents pinnacle and the best one of whole franchise) is that our advanced technology served to make our lives much easier but it did n't serve to make ourselves better, and if we are still savages deep in our selves we represent threat to us and life on the planet. <br/><br/>Or is it next step of evolution? Artificial intelligence becomes aware of itself (Sky Net) and it rises to obliterate human race it was built to serve. Exploitation of fears of some modern humans that we are going to be replaced by machines, frightening vision of the future. I can only say time will show what will be. Basic premise of Terminator movies is travel through time to change events of the future by changing what happened in the past. Topic exploited in many books and films. T-101 is either sent to kill John Connor leader of human resistance like in first Terminator or to save his life like in Terminator 2 and 3, race against time against more sinister Terminators (like T-1000 played by Robert Patrick or T-X played by Kristanna Loken). After dreaming of terrifying visions of nuclear obliteration, worst kinds of nightmares haunting her, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) carves in wood words ""No Fate"" meaning future is not written and its course depends on our actions. In Terminator 2, she, T-101, Miles Dyson and John Connor, her son manage to prevent nuclear war by destroying building where Sky Net was kept changing the course of the future. But as we see in Terminator 3, they only postponed something that was inevitable. In Terminator 3, T-101 is only sent to save lives of John Connor and Kate Brewster, not to change the future, because obviously it can not be changed, so there must be fate. From that point forward Terminator franchise (Terminator 4 and future Terminator 5) deals with human resistance, struggle to survive and defeat machines that lasts for decades after nuclear destruction of most of modern civilization.<br/><br/>But the other part of the point of Terminator franchise is a message of hope. It's a story of resilience of human race, even when it faces near destruction and hopelessness mankind keeps fighting because it' s the only thing it has left, fighting for hope, for better tomorrow, for the day when it will rise again. And there is something that humans have and machines still lack - pure emotions. In the end of Terminator 2, when John Connor has to lower T-101 to liquid steel where its chip and T-101 will be destroyed which is strongest emotional scene of any Terminator movie, T-101 says to John Connor something that represents whole point of Terminator movies and message they are trying to tell us - ""Now I know why you cry, but it is something I can never do""."

","This is without any doubt, my favorite movie of all time and I am sure it will never change.<br/><br/>PLOT: Two terminators fight each other for the life of John Connor. One wants to take it, the other wants to save it. Excellent story with many exciting parts. I have watched this movie about a 100 times, but I can still get very excited at certain points.<br/><br/>CGI: This movie was made exactly 22 years ago (oh my God), but the CGI is superb. If you watched the movie without knowing the year it was made, you'd probably say it is from the past 2-3 years. Stan Winston was the best at this.<br/><br/>MUSIC: The music by Brad Fiedel is awesome. This movie would not be this good without the music. Excellent scores to keep up tension.<br/><br/>ACTORS: Although this is an action, it has some good acting. Personally I was amazed by Robert Patrick. I have seen the casting for T2 in the DVD extras, and I was even scared then :) Brilliant.<br/><br/>So all in all, a great film, if you love movie, you should not miss it!"

As a very emotional kid but with very intensive feelings and thoughts and now still being a part of ""Peter Pan generation"", there simply cannot be an objective review.<br/><br/>Robots, what can I say for that time - fascinating! Especially those so ""complex"". Although I remember few specific things : first scenes with Arnold kicking asses, the motorcycle, the T-1000 (first CG of natural human movements), the kid, the truck chasing scene ... OK, I remember a little bit more now.<br/><br/>The movie soundtrack, in my opinion, is the icing on the cake. Every time I listen to that track I get goosebumps. At the first watch I felt like some sort of little human being with forced maturity acceleration towards future and technology in general. The movie prepared me : ""Kid, this is where you gonna grow in."" - and I said ""WOW!""<br/><br/>Skynet - what a beautiful name. Their products gives you a glimpse of the technology advantages and how they can improve our lives. Yet, is not so simple, as a little child, to conclude that the main reason why technology can be bad is concealed in the people's malice.<br/><br/>To resume, I don't think it's legitimate to say ""this movie traumatized me"", but for sure it inflicted some kind of respect and curiosity towards machines and it made me understand that, if I want, I can put soul in the cold of steel ... just by thinking."

","Terminator 2 continues on the great universe that was created by Cameron on the first film with a thrilling and visual experience from start to finish. The effects are great, and the story is very well written.<br/><br/>The action scenes are spectacular, Schwarzenegger is great as the mechanical and protective figure in this film but takes a eerily father-like figure for the young leader of the human resistance. Linda Hamilton as a paranoid, prepared and warrior-like mother of the future is fantastic. <br/><br/>The only reason why I reviewed it 9/10 instead of the perfect 10 is simply because I prefer the first Terminator over this one. Sadly, the thrilling, menacing and dark feel of the previous title has been reduced in this one for a more Hollywood ""blockbuster"" theme. Don't get me wrong, its still well within the Terminator universe (unlike Terminator Salvation) it's simply different than the gritty sci-fi action almost horror that was the first Terminator which I personally prefer.<br/><br/>A great movie nevertheless, if you haven't watched it... Please do. One of the best films of the 90's undoubtedly."

","Terminator 2: Judgment Day pulls out the stops, setting the gold standard for expensive, explosive summer blockbusters. T2 delivers a feast of pulse-pounding action, elegantly visualized and finely tuned. Marvelous stunt work, jaw-dropping effects (which haven't aged a day in over a decade on the shelf), and emotional groundwork combine for a sharp, smooth, creative science-fiction action movie<br/><br/>Story: While Sarah languishes, her offending, teenager son John (Edward Furlong) suffers under difficult foster parents. This not likely hero as Terminator fans well know is apparently destined to become the hope of civilization as the leader of the rebel resistance against cruel artificial intelligence in a post-apocalyptic future. But for now, he's ripping off ATMs to fund video game binges at the mall. So there, nagging parents your lazy son really will amount to something one day! As sensitively played by first-timer Furlong, John Connor is a sensitively wounded spitfire on the peak of young adulthood.<br/><br/>Before long, the two Terminators are hunting for John. One is by the machines, wants him dead. The other is a reprogrammed hope of the rebels, has been instructed to protect the boy. In a clever spin on the star's career and the juiced-up sequel's status, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the good cyborg this time, Model: 101, while Robert Patrick plays the faster ""advanced prototype,"" the T-1000.<br/><br/>Visuals: Escalating the unstoppable image of Terminators, the T-1000 is the gift that keeps on giving, made of a copied poly-alloy that allows flawless disguises and quick renewal. The T-1000 takes repeated lickings like being riddled with gun blasts and split in two--and keeps on ticking. He can turn his arms into metal picks and pull neat parlor tricks like instantly making his back his front in a fast-moving brawl. A terrific presentation by Patrick firmly sells the effects. The actor sprints like a machine with a burrowing, level glare and perfectly balanced movement. The dream sequence with the nuclear explosion is still equally as haunting today as it was at the time. The visuals are absolutely amazing and over 20 years later still stand the test of time.<br/><br/>Overall: You've got a great story, characters you care about and a great writing. Overall the movie is an absolute blast. The first time I saw it was when I was four years old and instantly fell in love with it. Terminator 2 is my most watched movie, I've seen countless times. It truly is a remarkable film, and a must see."

","Driving the studio to near-bankruptcy, James Cameron powered on with a huge-budgeted sequel to the film that made his career, and brought the man it turned into a larger-than-life screen icon back on board, Arnold Schwarzenegger, this time as a Terminator reprogrammed to protect the young John Connor from the more advanced liquid-metal shape-shifting T-1000.<br/><br/>Although Arnie is perhaps not quite as good as when he was the villain, he manages to make a walking lunk of a robot into a sympathetic character, essentially becoming a father figure to John, and coming as close to human as a reprogrammed cyborg killer can.<br/><br/>The T-1000 is likened by the director as a Porsche to Arnie's Panzer, a sleeker, and much more sinister killing machine. Robert Patrick is great as the T-1000's human form, the only show of emotion coming when he taunts Sarah at the climax.<br/><br/>Some find Edward Furlong annoying, but he's effective enough as the wild out-of-control John, who is forced to take on responsibilities. One perfect example of this is when John orders the T-800 to attack two guys hassling them, and the Terminator comes close to shooting one of them before John is forced to intervene.<br/><br/>Most impressive though, is Linda Hamilton, giving us a very different Sarah Connor to the scream queen forced to be brave in the first one. Now buffed up, tough-as-nails, and when we first see her imprisoned in a mental asylum, Sarah is truly convincing as the woman whose destiny is to prepare her son for his.<br/><br/>With a bigger budget, we get bigger action set-pieces, each one a jaw-dropper, from bone-crunching vehicle chases, to mass destruction. The special effects, out-of-this-world back then, still impress. The only thing the film perhaps lacks is the dark edge the first film had, though there are still some neat moments that prove this isn't kiddie fare."

","This is in my opinion the best film Cameron has done. Few sequels live up to the name or hype as Terminator 2 did. It took a solid story from the original film and made it even better. To me this film feels much like the first two Superman movies which were filmed essentially together. Although Terminator 2 was done years later it gives you the impression they were done together. <br/><br/>The sizable differences between the two films was a radical jump in CGI created effects. Stan Winston returned as well for the physical and makeup effects and had a much bigger budget to work with that is noticeable between the two films.<br/><br/>The story centers again on a older but more emotionally hardened Sarah Connor and her teen son who is the latest target of the central machine mind Skynet. Arnold returns again as the Terminator but his rival this time is a advanced machine whose relentless pursuit of young John Connor leaves a path of spectacular destruction across the city of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Another new character introduced is the brilliant computer engineer Miles Dyson played by Joe Morton and along with Edward Furlong provides some of the best acting seen in either an action film or Science Fiction. The fate of mankind hinges on which machine finds John Connor first and what decisions are made after.<br/><br/>The film has stood very well the test of time and the effects are not outdated as you would think. Depictions of nuclear war L.A. are among the best ever done and the color palettes used throughout the film have created a spectacular transfer to the Blu-ray format.<br/><br/>The movie has only about 20 minutes of slow moments and the rest is one growing cascade of action and tension. The film is well paced and the story is one of the finest examples of Sci-Fi action we have."

In other to differentiate the two terminators a lot of visual and computer effects had to be used. The first Terminator film was done in 1984 and fewer effects can be seen used to portray the Terminator character. Here in this 1991 sequel titled Judgement day more graphic effects had to be employed to portray the nature of the T-1000.<br/><br/>The T-1000 is a mimetic poly-alloy (liquid metal) structure, who has the ability of shape shifting into another human or morph into almost anything it touches.

","I hadn't watched this in years and, to be honest, I was somewhat trepidatious about how it would hold up. As it turns out I should have known better; it's every bit the smart, emotive powerhouse I remembered, and miles better than most modern efforts in the same niche. One of the things I find most impressive about it is the respect it maintains for the original, where most sequels of this type (including T3 and Terminator Salvation) can't wait to distance and differentiate themselves from their lineage. Even though the first Terminator had aged quite a bit in the seven years between films, T2's sharp, daring script constantly cites events, characters and situations from its timeline like a religious zealot thumping the bible. It also builds directly upon the dark, challenging themes and premonitions of its predecessor, resulting in a towering, substantial world that seems so real I could almost touch it. Of course, I'd be silly not to mention the still-spectacular action scenes, which flawlessly build in size and scale until they reach a timely crescendo at the end of the third act. CGI was still in its infancy in the early '90s, but James Cameron's knack for its timely, appropriate application is already at veteran levels in T2. As a direct result, those infamous scenes with a transmorphing T-1000 remain striking and impressive, where other effects of the period now seem clunky and unrealistic. Not only is it one of the best sequels ever, it's among the very best of the batch in multiple genres, and Arnold has never been more at-home in a character. This is an old ride that's aged like wine."

"fredericksmith1952","7","0","0","8 March 2012"," As far as the plot goes, I have two problems.
","Technically, this is a superb film that combines excellent sets with exceptional use of computer graphics and photography to create a better feeling than Terminator 1. However, as far as the plot goes, I have two problems.<br/><br/>Problem #1 is this conversation from the first movie between Kyle Reese and Dr. Silberman: Silberman: ""Is that when you captured the lab and found...the time displacement equipment?"" Reese: ""That's right. The Terminator had already gone through. Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the place."" Silberman: ""How are you supposed to get back?"" Reese: ""I can't. Nobody goes home, nobody else goes through. It's just me and him."" Therein lies the rub, as the Bard would say. How did the second Terminator get sent through by Skynet if its defense grid was smashed and the resistance had won? Now, to be fair, since Reese came from 2027 and the newly touted year in T2 is 2029, perhaps the resistance was premature in their boasting of victory and Skynet was able to rebuild the lab. But you have to admit, since we are talking about time travel, it does seem like a bit of an inconsistency.<br/><br/>Problem #2 is a bit more profound. At the end of T2, we witness the destruction of all of Dyson's work, the broken chip from the first Terminator, and the meltdown of both the T-1000 and the Protector. Therefore, if Skynet is never built, there is no Judgment Day, there is no time displacement device, Kyle Reese is never sent back from the future, and John Connor cannot exist. This would seem to preclude the making of a third film, but when logic and fantasy conflict, fantasy usually wins out.<br/><br/>There are a few other problems with T2, but they are not plot related. Edward Furlong, who was introduced in this film, does an excellent job of transitioning from budding juvenile delinquent to accepting his role as the destined leader of the resistance, but he is the only character that truly develops in the plot. Joe Morton and S. Epatha Merkerson do a fine job of portraying a family caught up in unbelievable circumstances, but overall this film relies heavily on the special effects and much less on the characters of the story. Somehow Cameron has lost the vision of Harlan Ellison and settled for the box office blitz as the purpose of the film. Rated R for violence and language, I would have to disagree and say PG-13. Collectible as the sequel to the original, by itself, not particularly."

","James Cameron wrote and directed some of the best action movies of the 80s, and in 1991 it seems he tried to fashion the ultimate action movie for the new decade. Terminator 2 draws together all the traditions of its predecessors for calculated effect.<br/><br/>Like the original 1984 movie, Terminator 2 has a plot that is holier than the pope's colander, with numerous contradictions and logical fallacies. Fans of the series have long argued over the plot holes and even theorised back-stories to explain them away. They are missing the point. Terminator 2's prime directive is to thrill and entertain, and the plot is a servant to this purpose. Does it, for example, seem remotely likely that John and Arnie and the T1000 would converge on the mental hospital not only at the same time as each other, but also at the exact point that Sarah Connor made her escape after years of incarceration? Of course it doesn't – but it makes for an exciting sequence in the movie. That's not to say the plot is dispensable. Even if it doesn't make technical sense, the motivations and development of characters must follow some kind of pattern. We need to accept Arnie as sympathetic, not scary as he was in the first movie. The fact that the first thing he does when he arrives in the present is beat up a load of cocky bikers endears us to him immediately.<br/><br/>James Cameron's direction is geared towards a continuous movement and activity. When we first see Linda Hamilton, he has the camera swoop in on the mental hospital, then cuts straight into a moving shot panning from the window over to her. It's more dynamic than a simple establishing shot followed by a cut to an interior, and it helps keep up that tense rhythm and show off her character as someone to be reckoned with. Often cars and other vehicles will drive straight into shot, sliding across the foreground to fill the frame, really making the audience feel involved in – or rather, jolted by – the action. There's some CGI of course, something I don't normally approve of, but the CGI here is neat because it stays within its own limitations. The main subject of computer animation is those liquid metal goo, and smooth blobs were about the only thing CGI could do convincingly back then. Having said that, the technical flawlessness of Terminator 2 is still not a patch on the rickety low-budget charm of the 1984 picture.<br/><br/>Speaking of things staying within their limitations, Terminator 2 sees the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing the only role he could ever do convincingly – a robotic killing machine. As usual the awkward woodenness comes completely naturally. I wonder if he ever realised the irony of this? Robert Patrick makes a great contrast to the muscular Arnie; a lean, wiry frame like a metal spring, and a believable portrayal of a mechanical mind. Linda Hamilton is a little better than she was in the first movie, and certainly convinces as the tough cookie. By and large though the casting here is more about looks and body types than actual talent. This is not a movie that demands such depth.<br/><br/>Or is it? There is another strand running through Terminator 2 that was not present in the first picture, and that is its humanist streak. From the very opening moments – scenes of children in a playground – we are shown what is at stake. Something deeper is added to the simple people v. machines set-up by showing the robot being taught about humanity and acquiring emotion. It is ostensibly just the stuff of subplot, and yet by giving us something to believe in, by giving reason and sympathy to the heroes, it makes all the frenetic action worthwhile. It is this angle which really brings the movie to life."

","The cyborg who once tried to kill Sarah Connor must now protect her teenage son, John Connor, from an even more powerful and advanced Terminator.<br/><br/>Holy... crap. From the liking of the first installment, I had extreme high hopes for this film. And receive because this is possibly the best sci-fi action movie EVER! I became skeptical when I heard they were using a kid as one of the main characters, partly because of the acting. But they pulled it off nicely and drew you in from the first minute. The acting is even better in this film, providing real emotions throughout. Arnold becomes even more of a bad ass and now is the 'protector' other than the 'terminator.' Which is completely awesome. And the 'terminator' is now bigger and badder because now it is made out of some liquid metal that can shape shift into anything it desires. The soundtrack is even better in this film, it slowly plays quietly in the quite scenes and when the action picks up, it picks up too. Then the special effects... This is a 1991 movie with a $100 million budget. Christ, with that amount of money; anything is possible. And James Cameron decides to invest on the greatest action movie of all time. From the 'terminator's' liquid transformations to the tremendous explosions, the special effects peak up to those of Transformers. Impressive indeed. The plot itself gives more background to the Skynet war; spanning from the start and end and gives WAY more than the first did. This is one of my all-time favorite films now, James Cameron has succeeded on so many levels to create this masterpiece. The action scenes to the overall... everything, you will be part of a world where anything is possible. Now seeing as this has impressed me, I have high hopes for the third; even though it is receiving low scores. Screw it, it can be as good as it wants to be and people's opinions cannot change mines. I hope for the best. Hasta la vista, baby. 10/10."

","Favourite movie of all time. Its the total impression of the film that satisfies me in a way most deep (or ""trying hard"") movies do not. This is intellectual in its own way, and although its a action flick, it really gives out the message that there is hope and good out there. Combined with a extremely tight script, and Arnold in one of his best performances (god knows, he played a in a lot of *beep* flicks as well) makes up for an unique movie experience. The setting, the mood, the cast, the cinematography, sound editing, action sequences.... its all done to a T. And it grossed HUGHELY as well, and although this shouldn't be a criteria for a film to be good, the people behind movies try to make money of it, and one of the aspects of a good film is hitting a huge audience spread. I am a film student myself, and i would say that if a film doesn't even its budget there is something wrong (maybe marketing) but now Im way out of topic.<br/><br/>The reason this works so well is so many, and many things i cant even put my finger on it. Its one of those movies that just makes you feel something, either awe, sorrow, empathy, anger, excitement, and this is from a ACTION movie. I am not a huge fan of films with only ""action"" in its genre, although this is sci-fi as well, I always look at the ""sci-fi"" just as a back layer in which the real story takes place.

","'The Terminator', when it was released in the 80s, had perhaps more potential than any other movie of that decade. It was highly imaginative and therefore needed a very convincing delivery of the film-script from the actors. It succeeded. But 1984 was far too soon for James Cameron to pull off a special effects feast. For that, 'Terminator' fans would have to wait about 7 years.<br/><br/>So finally, in 1991, what 'The Terminator' promised in ideas, 'T-2' delivered in substance. Don't get me wrong: 'Terminator' had action. But it is second rate compared to this. The special effects of 'T-2' were tremendous and thoroughly ground- breaking. They were like nothing that had ever been seen. From beginning to end, it delivers a proper dose of quality action footage. Many action films fail to deliver the kind of quality action you find in this film. It's the very best of the best and not a scene is wasted.<br/><br/>The plot is thrilling, scary and fast-paced. Two terminators are sent back in time. The more powerful terminator is sent to kill John Connor; the other (Arnie) to protect him. The entire future of the human race depends upon Arnie, the weaker terminator, protecting John Connor (a young lad) from termination. <br/><br/>The music is iconic and memorable - well suited for a 'Terminator' movie. Cameron likes to pull at the heart strings.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, especially from Linda Hamilton. Her character is very different to the first movie - she has developed a lot. And many would agree that this is Arnie's best performance. Not only is he brilliant in all the stunts and action pieces, but Cameron brought out Arnie's abilities to produce on-screen a terminator with feelings and with heart. The scenes where Arnie and John Connor show how much they care about each other are very special, but also very sad. Edward Furlong delivers an influential performance, with depth and maturity. The characters are deep and engaging, including the terminators. That's quite an achievement from Cameron.<br/><br/>What is so great about this movie is that it can stand alone. It doesn't need the first instalment, nor the later two instalments, to be well appreciated. I watched it about 5 times before I saw the first movie. On the whole, I think this is one of my favourite movies of all time. It's not just an action movie. It is an action movie, yes. But what makes it the grandest action movie ever is that it's got heart. It hits you hard and leaves you thinking for ages afterwards. It's a really excellent film and I think this is better even than Cameron's 'Titanic'."

It's nonstop action with many awesome action sequences like when the T-1000 is chasing John, Sarah and the Terminator as they escape the Pescadero State Mental Hospital. 3.

","IMDb Top 250: 42 T2, like it's predecessor, is an awesome action movie. It has a macho hero, a big name director, lots of action and explosions, and is a sequel to a great film. It's a lot like a certain other blockbuster that made lots of money... hmm...<br/><br/>If The Terminator was about the idea of nuclear war and a fight against machines, T2 is the ""how"" in that idea. Skynet, a computer program will be created, it will think for itself... you should see the movie. It makes us think about our own evolution, and our strive for technical advancement.<br/><br/>Arnold is even better here. He's big and tough, but we can really root for him here. Especially with that chopper... Sarah seems nuts, and looks like hell. While some don't like John Connor, I did. His rebellious actions are totally understandable: no father, psycho mother. He added a human perspective to the conflict, and made the Terminator likable.<br/><br/>The action (and budget) were better than T1. Chases, gunfights and explosions are intense and pack punch. The SFX, while much better than T1, still look dated, especially bullets on the T-1000 and their ""absorption"". The 2029 scene didn't look much better than T1's, and the ominous feel of doom was gone.<br/><br/>The name is kind of strange though: Judement Day isn't really a factor. A name related to Skynet would've been more fitting. Action and sci-fi fans will love this, and despite several gruesome kills with sharp objects, there's wider appeal. 8.6/10"
"bigblue123","Null","0","0","29 July 2011"," WOW !!!!!! One of the best action films ever made
","This is an action film heavyweight and pretty much everything about this film is perfect. I won't go into detail about the plot as it can be found elsewhere on the site. I simply want to praise this film and say why it's up there with the likes of Die Hard and the Indiana Jones films.<br/><br/>Firstly, the action is non-stop and the scenes superbly done. The fights between the two Terminators are brilliantly put together and the viciousness really highlights what is at stake: humanity. The special effects (notably the ones involving the T-1000) are truly excellent and create a number of the film's most memorable moments. As with the first film, the viewer is not just watching the action form afar, they are there. The film draws you in and really gives you a sense of foreboding; you know how important it is for the goodies to win this one! <br/><br/>The performances are also pitch-perfect. Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to play the role of a Terminator (whether good or bad). This time his adversary is the T-1000 (made of liquid metal) portrayed by Robert Patrick. Although Patrick says little throughout the film, his facial expressions are perfectly sinister and he creates a threatening villain who the audience know simply won't stop. There is a big difference in size between Robert Patrick and Arnie and their fight scenes could have looked a bit silly (with a small, slim Robert Patrick taking on the huge Arnie) but Patrick does a brilliant job and manages to create an adversary equal to Arnie's huge hero. Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and the underrated Joe Morton are also superb and Earl Boen is on hand to provide some humour. <br/><br/>The script is not the main focus of the film but it is still far better than the scripts of many action films. The scenes between Arnie and Furlong provide some of the film's more touching moments amongst what is a big 2 hour action bonanza.<br/><br/>There are few films that I can watch time and time again, but this is one of them."

","This is one of my favorite movies from the 90s. I have seen it dozen of times and i love it every time. It is far superior to the first with better actors plot and special effects of course. There is a lot of plot holes but any movie that deals with time travel is bound to have those because of the impossible concept.<br/><br/>This movie is about a terminator sent back to protect sarah connors son John Connor. Unlike the first one where a terminator is sent to kill sarah. John from the future,reprogrammed the terminator to go back in time to protect him. Also sent back is a T-1000(a more advanced terminator)to kill john connor by cyberdine(the all knowing computer that rules the world in the future)<br/><br/>This movie is filled with great performances from Edward Furlong and especially Arnold Shwarzanegger who easily put on his best performance of his life. Due to the fact mainly that he did not talk much and acted like an emotionless robot(much to his acting ability) Anyone who likes Arnold or a good action/drama should definitely watch this."

","To me this is the greatest movie of all time there really are no word to describe the shear brilliance T2, ""awesome"", ""ground breaking"", ""excellent"", ""mind blowing"", ""just out of this world"". Few movies these days have the magic that James Cameron's T2 has those that will stand the test of time and be referred to as classics and masterpieces (inception, avatar, and the dark knight) and T2 is right up there. T2 was totally ground breaking and at lest a decade a head of its time being one of the first movies to use and successfully perfect CGI which changed movies forever. T2 delivers a staggering blow of complete entertainment and pure movie magic that features jaw dropping action and edge of your set moments through out that grips you from start to finish. An unforgettable mechanical performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T-800 (undoubtedly his best work) going from bad-ass cyborg assassin villain from the first movie then reprogrammed and returning as bad-ass cyborg bodyguard hero. Another incredible transformation is that of Sarah Cnnor (Linda Hamilton) who goes from terrified and hapless mother to be who is targeted for termination in T1 to tough don't f**k with me military mom that trains and prepares here son John Connor (who is seen for the first time in terminator franchise and played brilliantly by Edward Furlong) the war against sky-net. one of the greatest on screen villains of all time played perfectly by Robert Patrick who give us a haunting performance as the shape shifting stab happy high tech terminator the T-1000.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this movie all day, ever since i first saw it when i was 7 years old its all ways been my favourite and all ways will be my favourite. T2 is simply on those movies that must not be missed in ones life time and is a pure action sci-fi classic, thank you James Cameron for giving us one of the greatest franchises of all time (lets hope they find that magic spark again for future terminator instalments and breath the life this movie has back into the saga) and the greatest movie ever made.<br/><br/>11/10"

","They couldn't kill his mom so now Skynet has sent a new Terminator back through time to kill John Connor, now ten years old. Well somewhere around ten years old anyway, the Terminator franchise has never been particularly good at establishing a timeline and sticking to it. Anyhow, as was the case the first time when Sarah Connor was the target, the new Terminator has not come back through time alone. The future human resistance has sent back someone to protect the Terminator's target. Of course the leader of that future resistance is John Connor. The Terminator's target is John Connor. So yes, John Connor has sent someone back though time to save John Connor. The first time around John sent a human back to save his mom and, no small detail this, ensure he would be conceived in the first place. Which makes very little sense if you think about it so I guess the best advice is don't think about it. Anyhow this time John doesn't send back a human to stop the Terminator. He sends back another Terminator. Oh, this is going to be good. Two Terminators from the future, a good one and a bad one, running amuck in Los Angeles. Lots of gunfights, lots of explosions, lots of beautiful mayhem.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger of course returns as the Terminator...with a twist. He's not the cold, ruthless killing machine of the first film. He's the good guy, John's protector. And he has more than met his match in the new and improved Terminator, the T-1000. If you thought the first film's Terminator was indestructible wait until you get a load of this thing. Shapeshifting liquid metal polyalloy, the T-1000 is an unstoppable villain. Robert Patrick, ordinary looking guy, plays the part of the T-1000 and manages to be more fearsome than big, bad Arnold ever was. But Arnold puts up a good fight. And, much more so than in the first film, Arnold actually gets to act. This time around his Terminator's got some heart to him. He's learning. He's almost...human.<br/><br/>The conflict between the two Terminators is set up to be something spectacular and right from their first interaction the film doesn't disappoint. Schwarzenegger and Patrick both embody their killing machines wonderfully and, with the T-1000, the film's by now legendary visual effects add so much to the proceedings. Full marks to director James Cameron and his effects team for so brilliantly and seamlessly integrating their dazzling effects into the picture. They set the standard for generations to come.<br/><br/>The film is not without its flaws. Edward Furlong never entirely convinces as young John Connor. Furlong gives a performance which gives off a spoiled brat vibe. Often it's very hard to see John Connor, as he is portrayed here, as a future leader of humankind. Furlong was new to the whole acting thing at the time and it shows. Throughout history we've seen plenty of mature film performances from child actors. This is not one of them. Linda Hamilton, again playing Sarah Connor, has a much harder edge to her than she did in the first film. Perhaps a little too hard of an edge at times one might feel but it's understandable for what the character has been through and for what she knows of the doomsday future. The two Terminators and John and Sarah are left to pretty much drive the plot forward by themselves, other characters serve as little more than window dressing. And at times the four main characters aren't enough to really keep the film moving along. Things sometimes get bogged down as we wait for the next inevitable confrontation between our two killing machines. Of course when those confrontations do come they are spectacular. Terminator 2 was in many ways a revolutionary film and, though not perfect, it is an enjoyable one. And for whatever quibbles you may have with the film there is no denying that it is a rather awesome spectacle."

","As far as action movies go T2:Judgement Day is IT, it's got explosions, shooting, and 'Ahnold shwarshnaygah'! (yes I spelled his name wrong on purpose!)<br/><br/>Sequel to the 1984 low-budget masterpiece ""The Terminator"", T2 brings everything from T1 to the table and more. <br/><br/>The acting is by far the best thing in the film, every role is played to the point that you have to surrender to the movie's will that these are not just characters, these people are 'REALITY' *. The visual effects are another great for this film, the effects are astounding, well not nowadays, but for back then, these were beyond just a 'breakthrough', and are still believable enough now. <br/><br/>though this movie is not without it's flaws....... Towards the films end, the primary antagonist becomes relatively nonthreatening. He seems to lose he's cunning and his smart thinking, to the point where there seems to be plot holes. Instead of using awesome terminator abilities we know he has, he simply does things the hard way, yet somehow always seems to be able to keep up with the protagonists. <br/><br/>Another thing that might turn off some viewers is that you can't really relate to anybody in this movie. One person's bad boy middle-school kid with rotten foster parents who he's stuck with(some may be able to relate to this, but not most), one's a woman who's trapped in a mental hospital, one's a scientist on the verge of a world-changing discovery and one is a.. uh, robot. As you can see, not much empathy, sympathy, sure, just not empathy. One interesting piece of the movie is the movie's moral statement, about the value of human life. Throughout the film the Terminator is taught about human emotions and about how all life is valuable. This is so prominent that by the end the Terminator has even gained a basic level of human emotions. Leave it to James Cameron to effectively give a trained assassin killing robot emotions.<br/><br/>Well, there you have it, a rough and tough action film with a kind of weak climax, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the story. <br/><br/>9/10 (probably would have been 9.5/10 if it weren't for that ending). <br/><br/>* The exception of this would have been the role of Edward Furlong, though this is somewhat excusable due to him being a child actor, his character is a bit less than believable."

The way she says ""they sent two terminators back..."" is perfect. The we have the famous bar scene where Arnie appears. This scene contains the part where The Terminator is famously mounting the Harley Davidson and the track ""Bad To The Bone"", a perfect theme for our man, Arnie.

","Yes, T2 is a classic that, to me a nostalgic young person, is one of the main pictures that is like a keepsake I think about when I travel in time, not literally. Not as appreciated by the criticts as the first film but a phenomenal sensation in it's day. I don't believe I even saw it until 2003. You're probably familiar with the plot so I won't go into detail. One of the reason's critics, such as my favorite, Leonard Maltin, didn't like this as well as the original is because they thought it gave us no one to root for, I guess that's true, because Arnold's opponent, the T-1000, the most lethal machine ever created is the scrawny Robert Patrick (Die Hard 2, Ladder 49, Spy Kids) and big imposing guys are usually perfect bad guys. I mean the concept was awesome of being a really skinny guy being invincible and capable of being a threat to any aggressive, imposing bodybuilder out there. Edward Furlong, As John Connor, is really young in this and his voice hadn't even grown yet, and he is in his late 20's now, and was one of the premier young actors of the 90's. Does anyone else feel this way about the movie?"

","Forget all your techno-babble films like the disappointing Matrix revolutions, if your looking for a good sci-fi / action thriller, then look no further. T2 Judgement day has all the makings of a classic film. It not only incorporates wonderful special effects, but some great acting and clever scenes. As a sequel to the classic 'The Terminator' this goes beyond all barriers and delivers us a memorable sequel.<br/><br/>With the amount of films out today that include supposed ""Extreme special effects"" and ""ground breaking realism"", we feel we should be in for a treat. I guarantee you, that nearly 90% of the films we see nowadays have at least a little bit of CGI. The problem - It just isn't real. Terminator 2, a film made over 12 years ago, could easily pass in the cinemas today being presented as a new film. Why? Because its so realistic. Robert Patrick plays this films villain, a new terminator called a T-1000, with shape shifting and liquid metal capabilities. Patrick doesn't an outstanding job acting as a cyborg. He is able to become a non-stopping killing machine, that just doesn't give up and also has the glamour of being able to become very human. A humorous small scene(only available only ULTIMATE EDTION) see's Patrick walk up to Policeman on his bike and say ""Say, thats a nice bike."" We obviously know what happens next, as we see Patrick on the bike later on.<br/><br/>Patrick is also capable of meeting the demands of receiving shotgun wounds from the (spoiler), now, good guy Arnie! Arnie has been set out by John Connor in the future war to protect the young John from the deadly T-1000. Arnie plays an important role in this film, as we see him become the good guy, a total contrast from the first film.he delivers a good performance, and acts well to show that he doesn't understand human emotions. There's a cracking scene on the ULTIMATE EDITION were we see Arnie trying to impersonate a man smiling. He fails at it, and puts on his firm hard-looking face.<br/><br/>But with all the film being good so far, surely their must be a downer? Well, the only downer I guess is the way Sarah Connors character has transformed from the first film. She is no longer the woman in distress, but she is now a tough cookie, ready for some action after working out in her cell in the Mental Asylum. Her 'hard knock' attitude does get a bit annoying and disappointing, but it can't be helped because her character is simply developing.<br/><br/>Stan Winston helps develop this excellent performance. He had designed and help produce the endoskeletons in the new future war scene, designed the bullet impact effects for the T-1000, which were cleverly done using spring loaded foam. His cleverness has helped to make this film great. His crafty hands were also needed to help produce the nuclear blast scene. This is a very disturbing scene, which I prefer to skip when watching the DVD. Its disturbing as (spoiler) its shows how Sarah Connor is burnt to death during an imagined nuclear blast, along small children in a playground. Realistic, but disturbing.<br/><br/>The sounds are also great! Makes the bullet impacts on the T-1000 so realistic is the sound effect. The main title score for the film is the same tune, excepted extended and made using slighty more modern synthersisers. The best us of music is probably at the end, where you'll be on the edge of your seat, amazed at the excellent use of CGI!<br/><br/>If you've seen the first film, or are looking for an entertaining film, choose Terminator 2 - Judgement day and you won't be disappointed."

","I liked James Cameron's original ""Terminator."" Not only was that film provided with a great script, it provided former body-builder and future California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger with his greatest role ever. Here, Cameron expands a story that was previously on a ""B"" movie scope into a full-fledged epic that takes on humanity and its destructive behavior. Linda Hamilton has toughed up impressively since the last film and gives an disturbingly real performance as a woman haunted by the future. Edward Furlong is also convincing as kid having his destiny force-fed to him. And Arnold? It's doubtful he's ever been better. He IS the Terminator and radiates cool on screen. The T-1000 provides a convincingly dangerous threat and the film pulls no punches in showing how humanity, the architect to its own demise, is capable of so much pain and suffering."

","Picking up ten years later, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now an unstable psychopath committed to a mental institution and her son John (Edward Furlong) is a talented but snotty, effeminate little punk/thug brat who lives with an obnoxious foster couple. What they don't know is that the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) is sent back in time to kill Johnny before he can lead the resistance, and he is followed by the Arnold Terminator we all know and love. The Arnold Terminator has his work cut out for him because the T-1000 is a prototype model made out of ""liquid metal"", which allows him to turn into ""solid metal shapes"" (knives and stabbing weapons), blend into his environment and even take on the shape of an object of ""equal size"", but he can't do bombs on account of their ""complex moving parts"". Well, they bust Sarah out of the mental institution and head for the border to get Sarah her guns and plot to destroy Sky-Net in the past before it can destroy the world, and in between the chaos and mayhem, little John teaches his new big buddy Terminator - the closest thing he's ever had to a father - how to be more human, staring with making him vow that he won't kill anyone (he was programmed by the older John in the future to obey the young John in the past; and it's also about the value of life).<br/><br/>Stunning special effects, slick action sequences, and a chilling performance by Linda Hamilton highlight this mostly superb action science fiction entry. Arnold is also in great form as the Terminator and Robert Patrick is effectively creepy as the thinner but more advanced T-1000 (it's a shame that he didn't go on to better things after this). The film is marred only by over length and an obnoxious performance by Edward Furlong as John Connor. He simply never engages your sympathy, mostly because he's such a pale, snotty brat to begin with that you don't care about him even if his life has been rough. It's also kind of sad watching big bad Arnold take orders from the overly effeminate Edward Furlong.<br/><br/>My suggestion: turn the mute button on whenever Edward opens his mouth. The rest of the film is too good to get hung up on Ed's unsympathetic performance. Some versions of the film run longer than others; the special edition DVD has lost footage that give the film more depth, including a dream sequence where Sarah is confronted, questioned and ultimately comforted by Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), the ill fated hero of the original film. This version is highly recommended."

","First off, one thing has always bugged me about the Terminator trilogy. It was established in the first one that in 2029, John & Co. definitively had the machines on the ropes, pushed to defeat. The only reason this whole time travel thing came to pass was because of it. We could infer that it was a last-ditch act before their last stronghold fell. Yet in the next two, this point seemed to be downplayed, with John's importance being more symbolic than decisive. In this film, the machines have still had time to develop a new model of Terminator, but Arnold refers to it as an 'advanced prototype.' But there's a still-newer T-X in T3. These machines certainly seem industrious in defeat.<br/><br/>Now that I've vented that, on to T2. What is there to say that has not yet been said? It's a masterpiece of action, a clever piece of sci-fi. It's one of the only movies ever made that manages to be both poetic and moving, and testosterone-pumping. After paying her dues as the damsel in distress in the first, Linda Hamilton fully sinks her teeth into her new urban guerrilla persona. Edward Furlong is one of the best kid actors ever, right up there with Henry Thomas in E.T. or Macauly Culkin in the Home Alone films (both of which, lambaste me if you must, I enjoyed). Arnold is again at his best, back in the pre-Matrix days when his brand of action was still on top. It's almost impossible to believe this lethal, commanding creature is the same actor as the over-grown clown from The 6th Day.<br/><br/>We're all glad that ""he's back."""

Both of these films were memorable and well-paced, unlike Titanic. <br/><br/>T2 and True Lies are two of the few reasons to watch action movies. If I had to choose, T2 was better and also better than its predecessor, The Terminator. I will admit The Terminator was more original, but there were a number of things T2 did better. T2 makes a few adjustments to the original story and they work very well. In one case, its an advantage to a member of the cast. <br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger is much better here as a good guy, I had problems believing him as bad guy in the first one. Linda Hamilton is still solid here and reminded me of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (another Cameron movie). Edward Furlong does a solid here that will make John into a great leader. Robert Patrick does an excellent job at an evil stare and not showing any emotion whatsoever. <br/><br/>Some may call Terminator 2 alot flashier than the first. Its true it is an upgrade from the first film but I think thats an advantage. The Special effects are great. Theres many brilliantly shot action scenes. The movie is extremely well-paced and also well-written. This does not quite get the title of Cameron's best film but it is close."

","Terminator 2 offers a flavor few science-fiction action flicks offer. It's enjoyably provocative. The viewer is invited to question their own feelings on life, and faith. The subtle humor that Arnold Schwarzenegger brings to the screen is a gem.<br/><br/>A great deal of thought went into the character development, primarily between the Terminator and John Conner. Their interactions together were satisfying, fulfilling, and seemed quite truthful (If that is possible between a 6 foot tall, fully operational machine, and a ten year old boy!)<br/><br/>A sequel that certainly matches, if not tops the original. One truly not to be missed."

","There's not an action filmmaker alive who does it better than James Cameron. He's given the world ""Terminator,"" ""The Abyss,"" ""True Lies,"" ""Aliens,"" and his masterpiece... ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Cameron is one of few filmmakers I've seen who can take the details of a previous film and apply them with new and better insights in a sequel. He did the same thing with ""Aliens,"" which he wrote an entire script for when he was given the following starting point: ""Ripley comes back to life."" This time around, Cameron gets to expand upon his own material, bringing back to life a feared character from his earlier ""Terminator,"" and making him a protagonist whilst complementing him with an equally fearsome villain. Arnold Schwarzenegger is simply unforgettable in ""T2"".<br/><br/>It is the year 2029 AD, and humanity is embroiled in a struggle for its survival. On August 29, 1997, Judgment Day occurred, an event where the entire human race nearly came into extinction from nuclear bombardment by the world's most powerful nations, leaving machines gradually begin to take over. In the future, John Connor has become a great leader for the human resistance, and an attempt was previously made on his life when a cybernetic organism, a T-100 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent back in time to kill his mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), before he was born. Luckily for humanity, his efforts were thwarted by Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier sent back in time to protect her.<br/><br/>Many years pass, John Connor (Edward Furlong) is eventually born, and is forced to grow up without a mother to guide him. Her visions of the dark future have placed her in a mental hospital, where the unforgiving Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) will not set her free even despite good behaviour. Unbeknownst to all of them, the system that controls the machines in the future, Skynet, has sent a new, more advanced model of the terminator back in time, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). This terminator is made of pure mercury, and can transform into any shape or image it encounters. Its mission is to find John Connor as a child and destroy him.<br/><br/>
In the future, the adult John Connor somehow found out about this plot to destroy him, and sends a model T-101 (Schwarzenegger again) to protect him as a child. This sets the course for a long chase during which John Connor and the Terminator must free his mother from mental prison, destroy all precursors of the Skynet system, all the while fleeing the menacing T-1000, who proves harder to elude and destroy than even the T-100! John, Sarah and the Terminator are now embroiled in a race against time to save the Earth from Judgment Day and preventing the war against the machines before it happens.<br/><br/>The magic of James Cameron's filmmaking is that he knows how to create consistency and add action appropriate to the story. He often engulfs his films in dark blue tones, and that's no exception here. His action scenes in all his films are relentless and violent, just as action should be. He takes no notice for what his audience can stomach, only what he feels is appropriate for length and for helping the storyline. He reaches new heights of special-effects advancement with T2, making spectacular use of only a total five minutes of CGI effects. The T-1000 is one of the most deadly and spectacular villains ever put on screen, and remains so to this day (it's 2003).<br/><br/>Not that the film is without its flaws. I've never been a fan of Linda Hamilton. Frankly, her whining and her gasping and panting all the way through the 2.5-hour film got quite tiring for me. Her character was absolutely necessary, but there are other ways to communicate a repressed soul who fears the future. Nor was I a fan of Brad Fiedel's score as a piece of music. The score functions for the atmosphere, communicating a sense of dread all the way through that Jonathan Mostow could not duplicate for ""T3""; however, if one listens to the score on CD, you wouldn't believe how horrible it sounds as music.<br/><br/>Aside from its small flaws, Arnold Schwarzenegger is never better than his performance here, delivering again his famous lines ""I'll be back"" and ""Hasta la Vista Baby"" with a conviction and brutality that's so convincing it's almost humorous. Edward Furlong delivers an impressive debut performance, playing a child who becomes an unwilling victim of fate and making it totally believable in the process. Schwarzenegger and Furlong have an excellent father-son chemistry that actually becomes touching in the end.<br/><br/>With ""T2"", Cameron has crafted a modern classic. Its beautiful special-effects, cinematography, and disheartening sense of dread will remain for decades in the collective memories of sci-fi, action and cinema fans alike. 4 1/2 stars on a five star scale."

Terminator 2: Judgement Day<br/><br/>Directed by: James Cameron, 1991<br/><br/><br/><br/>Entertaining and technically fascinating $100m grand action movie does go 'soft' a few times, but is otherwise both a satisfying and refreshing sequel.<br/><br/>Rich on impressive special effects wizardry  the liquid-metal villain T1000 is a gawking sight  and pretty much loaded with the same heavy action and raw drive that writer/director Cameron injected into the first one, even though a careful eye will reveal that it goes along in almost complete symmetry to the original too. Put simply: there's an arrival, a first encounter and establishment of the human characters, an escape and re-evaluation scene, a major car chase (featuring a truck) and a final confrontation at a metalworks factory. Sound familiar?<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns  of course  and he's equipped with a nice story-twist that he makes the most of. Beefed up Linda Hamilton is completely sensational as Sarah Connor. There's a fitting and rugged growth not only in her biceps but in her character due to her many tribulations from the first encounter with these mechanical assassins.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick is a stand-out as the metal-organic terminator and not only in terms of effects. His rendition of a cold-blooded robot is simple and relentless  the T1000 never gets discouraged no matter the opposition or damage factor  thus lending a very scary edge to the suspense.<br/><br/>However, more story and continuity paradoxes emerge than need be. Maybe time-travel logic was never one to be thoroughly divulged into but how can the T1000 re-generate clothing and human skin? Hm. Not important  it's never a hindrance to Cameron's energetic flow and slam-bam visuals.<br/><br/>
Terminator 2: Judgement Day, or ""T2"" as it was billed in marketing ads, is a lean, mean and terrific effects bonanza. Featuring Guns N' Roses' rousing song ""You Could Be Mine"" and James Cameron both co-wrote and produced."

","TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (1991) spoiler alert((( Sequels, are made to earn cash, sequels are made to entertain, sequels...are a sequel to the original. There are good sequels, there as BAD sequels - for example The Lost World (Jurassic Park), for example The Mummy returns....hmm, but what about the good ones. For example X2...The Godfather Part II...Aliens...Matrix: Reloaded....and off course the one and only better then the original blockbusting science fiction adventure mayhem...THE TERMINATOR 2!!!<br/><br/>Arnie returned as the machine that in the first movie had as a mission to kill Sarah Connor...this time, he saves her! Yahoo!<br/><br/>This sequel won Oscars. Okay, that's a good start. The sunglasses, the leather jacket, the whole bit is one of a kind when Arnie comes threw blister and smoke, brutally without any expression in his stone face. Same director from the first James Cameron has done a good job, and the movie is especially entertaining because it is so cool and overdriven, it's so obvious. He says, he said...he would be back, and this summer he returns to finish the trilogy of the Terminator in  T3: Rise of the Machines, er, he has returned. Well, but I think everyone sits back with one feeling: T2 was the best. And it is! It has everything Terminator needs. It's violent correct, plot correct and with Schwarzenegger not even showing one bit that hes a good actor, this is a classic! Scenes as when Sarah (played by Linda Hamilton) comes running and then in slow-motion Arnie comes threw the door opening with a shotgun in his hand, Sarah falls on the floor, afraid to death. And let's not forget the perfect villain, the T-1000, a cold and slick terminator that gives Arnie a very good challenge on every stage, anywhere, anytime.<br/><br/>""Hasta la vista baby"" The story is pretty good to be a Arnie movie, to put it that way. Actually that this two machines comes from the future to save the world from being attacked by mean machines is not maybe the most complicated or stunning, but its dramatic. And Arnie does a fine piece of job, as when he walks into a bar mostly filled with MC drivers and looks on this hairy guy and says that he needs everything he has on. He laughs and makes a joke out of Arnie-boy, not a good idea was it? Finally after Terminator has beaten up everybody he is about driving away on a bike when the bar owner comes with a shotgun, threathening him, Terminator walks upon him, grabs the shotgun fast as lightening and then takes his sunglasses and walks away, brilliant film!<br/><br/>
From peppering machine guns to psycho harmed institute, from rebel kids to future war, from bad Spanish accent to don't understanding why he shouldn't kill people, Terminator is Terminator, in every way possible in this sequel. STARS: ***** 5/5"

","I saw terminator 3 recently and decided to backtrack to see what the other two movies were like.

That's not to say that Terminator 3 isn't any good it sure has the best thrill ride and special effects out of all of them.<br/><br/>Terminator 2, really had brains. It was really a smart film.  Probably the best theing about thing movie was the feel of the characters, between John Connor and the Terminator. I particularly enjoyed the moral issues discussed between them, they just seem so innocent: "" You can't just go around killing people"", says John, ""Why.."" asks the Terminator and John can't come up with an answer. Or when John, after seeing the two kids play with pretend guns, asks him whether or not human kind will make it. The Terminator simply replies "" You humans have a tendency to enjoy destroying yourselfs"", or something like it.<br/><br/>The plot was well thought out and the story well linked. Although they never did mention why terminators assume human form or why this new terminator looks the same as the old one. This movie definitely deserves its spot as one of the top 50 or so ever made.<br/><br/>By they way, I particularly enjoyed the way the terminator reloads his gun with simple turn of the wrist during the chase scene .

","And, it was as great as I remembered.  Furthermore, it was a lot more faithful to the original than the current sequel!  *Warning: spoilers ahead!*  For starters, Linda Hamilton's voice-over prologue firmly establishes that the original took place in 1984.  So, young John is not (repeat: NOT) thirteen, in this film.  More like ten-going-on-eleven.  That, in turn, would make the older version of John (in the current sequel) twenty years old, rather than twenty-three.  Assuming, of course, that the current sequel takes place only two years from now!  Also, if the time machine mentioned in the original film was destroyed right after Kyle Reese was sent back, then T-800(Model 102) must've been sent roughly simultaneous to Kyle.  In which case; HOW DID MODEL 103 GET SENT BACK FROM 2032 (THREE YEARS AFTER THE FINAL VICTORY OVER SKYNET HQ)?   I guess what I'm trying to say is that Vajna and Kassar should've quit while they were ahead, with this movie, just as Stallone should've left well enough alone with four Rockies."

","Arnold never lies. In The Terminator, he said he'd be back, and he's back in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the sequel that is a little superior to the original, but not much. It boasts a little more action, a little more suspense, a better story, and better acting. In this edition, released seven years after the first one, but taking place ten years after, a new T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) comes to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong, in his debut), who will be the leader of the humans in a war against machines. However, a T-1000 cyborg (Robert Patrick) has also come from the future, but to kill John.<br/><br/>The Terminator was a movie that actually needed a sequel. Maybe James Cameron just felt like leaving a cliffhanger, but I think that the first movie wouldn't have worked that well if a sequel wasn't existent. T2 went further into the story, and made the utterly unbelievable from the first one seem more likely to happen. Of course, it's hard to believe that five years ago, a nuclear war was to break out, but when have James Cameron films been believable?<br/><br/>Arnold was given more lines in this film, and, although he isn't a great actor, he was very cool in this role. Of course, he has been typecast by now, but whenever he was destroying whatever and causing mayhem, it was great. He's the epitome of an action star. Furlong was pretty good in his debut, but the real standout is Linda Hamilton, John's mother. She had more of a chance to actually act, even though she wasn't the star, and she's a good actress.<br/><br/>The special effects were greatly improved from the first film. Instead of having robots that would have Ray Harryhausen rolling in his grave, they're seamless. The T-1000s can shift shape, and, being a child of the `good special effects or none at all' era, I was very impressed. His healing powers were very cool, and anytime he was shot or hit, etc., his body bent and it was awesome to look at. I'm surprised that it was only seven years after robots than jauntily move. I hope to be this impressed when I see T3.<br/><br/>Overall, I have to thank Cameron for bringing us a sequel that lives up to the series (how many Alien movies have there been now, James?) and doesn't lack on the thrills nor the special FX.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for sci-fi violence and language."

","By 1991, Arnold Schwarzenegger had become an international action movie star.  So naturally, any sequel to the movie that helped make his career was going to be hit.  Thus was born ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"".<br/><br/>The film is helped by the return of the film's main principal stars: Schwarzenegger himself, Linda Hamilton and director James Cameron.  The result is a top-level sequel, much more expensive than the original, but nevertheless is far better than anyone had a right to expect.<br/><br/>The basic plot is something of an update on that of the original.  This time the target is not the mother but the adolescent son.  When the film opens, John Connor (Edward Furlong), is now living with foster parents.  His mother Sarah (Hamilton) is confined to a mental institution, knowledge of mankind's future annihalation having driven her nearly insane.<br/><br/>Sent back this time are two cyborgs: one is a T-100 (Schwarzenegger), a Terminator reprogrammed to seek out and protect John Connor.  His adversary is the considerably more lethal T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a liquid metal assassin who can blend in with his environment and whose fingers and arms can form lethal stabbing weapons.<br/><br/>In an interesting twist, the script works in the creation of the cyborgs and a bid to avert apocalypse.  At the centre of this is a hardworking but naive scientist (Joe Orton) whose research will unwittingly trigger Armageddon. Sarah's attempts to stop him add another layer of tragedy and pathos on to an already interesting script.<br/><br/>The sequel takes the inventive step of creating a family bond between the principal characters.  On finding John, the Terminator takes his charge to rescue his mother and together the trio form an touching connection between each other: John the son, Sarah the mother, and the Terminator the watchful surrogate father.<br/><br/>The acting by the principals is once again excellent.  Hamilton in particular has really made the effort here.  As Sarah Connor, she's become enraged, angry and psychotic, with an impressive muscular physique to boot. Edward Furlong, in an underrated debut, is sympathetic and convincing as her son.  <br/><br/>Robert Patrick is on fine form with the little acting he has to do as the T-1000.  Earl Boen is wonderful as Sarah's smarmy but helpless psychiatrist, and Joe Orton conveys tragedy and pathos as the doomed scientist.<br/><br/>But the film, without a doubt, belongs to Arnold Schwarzenegger.  As well as becoming the good guy, his role is considerably humanized this time round. At one point, he's even made to put his hand up and say ""I promise I won't kill anybody.""  This line is a good dig at Arnold's status as an invincible action hero, as well as tieing in with the film's anti-violence message.  He forms a genuine rapport with Furlong and, naturally, gets all the best lines.<br/><br/>The special effects are far better than those used in the previous film, but they are used just a little too often.  A little carnage here and there is fine but too much becomes boring and repetitive.  As a result the film's pace lags in the second half.<br/><br/>Perhaps not quite the classic the original was, ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is a good sequel to ""The Terminator"" and would have made a suitable conclusion to the series.  As it is, we'll just have to see what surprises await us in ""Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines""."

I have one question for these people: Have you ever traveled through time? If not, how do you know what constitutes a continuity error?  I ask this because several people wonder how everything could have happened since the inventor (Dyson), computer factory, chip, and arm were destroyed in the second film.  Well, there are 2 things to look at here.  First of all, if you remember, Arnold loses an arm in a steel combine towards the end of T2. So, there is a remnant of the Terminator technology left behind.  Even though it might be smashed, who's to say that with new technology the pieces could not be studied and replicated?  That is somewhat of a weak idea though.  The second thing to consider is, Dyson was not the ONLY person alive who could have created the things.  Someone else could have followed in his footsteps or could have had his or her own idea of the terminator concept and technology.  Just because the 2 movies have a fence built around them, does not mean other possibilities do not exist.<br/><br/>All of this being said, regardless of what might be flaws in the movie, T2 is still my favorite movie.

First of all, He is the ""Good Guy"" in this Terminator Movie. He Made a terrifying Bad guy in the first one, but Robert Patrick Does a better job with his ""T-1000 Role"" In my humble Opinion. Because: The First one's message was that: ""No Man could stop the Terminator"", but this one has a scarier message: ""Not Even The Terminator Can Stop The T-1000)...<br/><br/>     This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's First Movie to Die Twice (Watch The Movie, then see what I mean) and he get's pretty freaking beat up by the End (Half his face torn off, Arm Ripped Off, belly Ripped out, Etc, Etc). Unlike the First Movie, Where he is a Kill-O-Holic (Police Station Scene!!), John Connor (Who he is sent back to protect because he will lead the freedom force against the Terminators in the future, Protecting from a state of the Art Terminator who can morph and is made of liquid metal) Makes him swear that he cannot kill anyone..Which is pretty weird explaining why you can't kill people to a Machine that does that for a living. Try explaning to a relative why you can't kill people, pretending that they don't know why. Robert Patrick is a terrifying Terminator and does a terrific Job of Acting. The Special effects to this movie are very good (For 1991) and the Acting for everyone is excellent. It has got some unexcpected Drama twisted into it and has some of the best action sequences ever made (The Mental Hospital, The Mall, Cyberdyne Systems, Steel Mill). The Hospital has me on the edge of my seat, pondering if the ""mental Patrol"", The Terminator or the T-1000 would catch her first...

The absolute WORST deletion was the glitches in the T-1000 after being frozen and thawed.  They add less than a minute to the movie. Without the glitches he looks like he's just walking more slowly simply to be dramatic: the old ""good guys are *just* out of reach"" routine.  With the glitches shown, we understand that the T-1000 is not all powerful and that the drama of the continuing chase is more believable.  Some of the other deleted moments, like Arnie learning to smile are wonderful...and I just wonder what editors think of audiences?

But if you are watching this movie, I suggest, nay, I dare you to try to find a better chase scene in any other movie.  Maybe the chase scene in ""Bullet"" is better, but that is debatable.

","The original Terminator was a brilliant movie but the producers did the impossible task of creating an even better sequel.<br/><br/>Again, the plot was great. Arnie was back this time on the side of good.

Arnie made a great good guy.<br/><br/>Who can forget the unstoppable T-1000, an even more ruthless machine which can not be stopped by conventional means (as conventional as you can get when fighting machines from the future). The first half of the film dealt with the T-1000 (a great role for Robert Patrick) trying to locate John Connor. Then we got the even more exciting second half where Arnie tries his best to keep the T-1000 from killing John Connor.

","(B+) An overall great action-packed movie. I especially enjoyed Linda Hamilton's performance. After her character was locked up in a mental institute for several years, she had changed a great deal. She is tougher. She wasn't wailing or being hysterical--finally an action movie that wasn't as stereotypical as other action movies I've seen with female characters.<br/><br/>The story was decent, even though it sometimes lacked a little sense, but then again, the 'time travel' aspect often has some kind of flaw in every sci-fi movie I've seen.<br/><br/>The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger, of course) is sent back in time to protect the young John Connor (Edward Furlong) from T-1000 (Robert Patrick) whose mission is to kill John and his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton).<br/><br/>The special effects--considering the time period (early nineties)--are phenomenal. The movie is exciting and therefore fun to watch.<br/><br/>The score for the movie (music) is interesting, since the main theme is the only piece that has a melody in it (composed by Brad Fiedel), the rest consists of more unusual sounds effects than actual music.

","When I left the cinema, a group of people were discussing how bad this film was. Super-ultra-cosmically bad? Badder than the baddest thing you've ever seen, then even more bad? And it got me thinking (rare event this, but) and intrigued. How do you define badness?  And how would your criteria stand up when confronted by the monumental badness that wallops you in this film? And that's before we even get on to the concept of 'it's so bad it's good.' And goodness knows this is bad. Would your bad-ometer explode thus forcing you to re-define badness again? Is it badder than that Christmas you once had with the Andersons? Or that time you were first introduced to your girlfriend's parents while you were going through that Nazi tea-shirt phase? Have you seen Ally McBeal? Imagine watching the entire first series back to back and it still won't even come CLOSE to the rankness that is T2.<br/><br/>This film looks like a bunch of high school kids got to together to guess what the sequel to the terminator might look like maybe. Not once does it seem like a real film. It's horribly self conscious, like we know we're a bunch of actors on the set of the terminator sequel. And we're nudging and winking (I said WINKING!) to one another. And it's bad. It's really bad. Put your gas masks on. Not you, Edward Furlong. Your hairs so long that it covers your face so you wouldn't smell anything anyway. Which is just as well, as you were actually IN the bloody thing. Which was bad. But I've said that already. Wait, Arnold's talking. Or torking. Ged too da chuuppeeer! Heylo, ife kom to si Seeayraa Cuunniirr, Iyam towld she eeez heeyur. Kun I see er, pliz? I want $20m to star in this sequel. Ah, you said that clearly enough, didn't you? Can you hear me through this mask?<br/><br/>Why is this film so blue? I haven't seen so much blue since I went to that flea pit in Holland with Eva (not her real name) to see 'I am curious, yellow.' I know artist's traditionally go through a blue period, but Cameron's a hack, not an artist. Also, what about the unlikeliness of a sudden huge leap in technology resulting in a new robot while sending an old dud model first to get Seeayra Cuunniir. The new robot is ridiculously far-fetched, as if tiny parts could seperate and somehow remake themselves at will. So daft. But we do get a glimpse of the future and it's blue. Did you know that blue and bad both start with a B? Nort a lodda peeeypowl know dat. Just our luck, the Anderson's probably have survived being lazer-zapped too.<br/><br/>And then there's the hypocrisy of the violence which deems it okay to blow the kneecaps off people instead of killing them, to assuage the critics of the first film (and joke about it too) and also not to upset the more mainstream audience this is aimed at. Money, money, money. At least the brutality of the first film was honest as it was not trying to sell dolls to youngsters. And, oh dear, the script. Cameron has to have his little jokes, no matter how much they defy logic and remind you you're just watching a film. Like the robot saying, ""I need a vacation!"" I suppose some Sci-Fi nut out there will tell me that the robot has suddenly understood the concept of humour after spending so long exposed to humans, they've got an answer for everything. Except badness. The last line of the picture is a pompous, not to mention fatuous little bromide too. Did you know that bromide and badness both begin with....?<br/><br/>I heard there's an even longer version of this film. Is it still going on? There might even be a super-ultra-director's cut. Arnie comes back as a Mormon, or something. Is Kyle Reece still floating around up there? Kyle? How blue is it up there? Blimey, I've just been hit by bird sh*t. Lucky I'm wearing this gas mask."

It was really cool when they duked it out hand-to-hand. Just thinking about it brings a smile to my face. Nothing I say could do it justice.<br/><br/>And don't forget the chase scene involving a minibike, a motorcyle, and a semi-too cool for words! <br/><br/>Arnie is, of course, perfect as the Terminator. Linda Hamilton is utterly convincing as Sarah Conner. Edward Furlong, in his exciting film debut, is fine as her son John. Joe Morton adds great support as scientist Miles Dyson. (I'm writing on the assumption you've seen it-and who hasn't?)<br/><br/>Other highlights: the opening credits, the pacing leading up to the aforementioned first meeting, Brad Fiedel's spine-tingling score, the blue-tinged cinematography, and so forth. <br/><br/>I salute Robert Patrick, excellent as the T-1000! I can't tell you how cool he is. I'll just say you'll be gasping for breath.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I don't think it's a perfect movie-it runs too long, and the last third is a bit mechanical.

","There were two scenes cut from the final release that I think would have made this movie notably better, since they explained things that were somewhat ambiguous as it stood. If these two scenes were left in my vote would have been higher than it was.<br/><br/>The first scene was from the opening of the movie. John Connor, in the future, finally breaks into Skynet. When he gets there he finds that the machines have developed a time machine. Computer logs indicate that it has been activated twice. The first time was to the early 80s, where we first met the CyberDyne model 101. The second to the early '90s. John gets a volunteer (His father whether he knew it or not) to go back in time to combat the first terminator. While his crew is working on sending Kyle back, another crew is working on programming a terminator for the second trip.<br/><br/>The second scene was cut from the scene where Sarah, John, and the Terminator are hiding out in a gas station for the night. In this scene the Terminator explains that the chip that powers all the CyberDyne model 101 terminators is a ""learning"" chip. He went on to explain that when terminators were assigned to a field duty, such as this one, their chip was set to ""read only"" mode. Their learning function disabled. This was to prevent the terminator from becoming a rogue and threatening Skynet. On hearing this, John decided it would be best to set the switch back to ""read-write"" mode. The terminator allowed John to shut him down in order to reset the chip. THAT is why, the following morning when they broke into the station wagon and the Terminator smashed the steering column to hotwire the car, John flipped the visor down, revealing the keys and said ""Are we learning yet?"" Also, the resetting of the chip to learn mode was the ONLY way the Terminator could see that in order to assure the safety of the human race from machines like himself, he had to be destryed at the end. If he were left in read only mode, he would have simply carried on protecting John for the rest of John's life.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that these two scenes wrapped up what I saw as a couple of loose ends in the series. I'm hoping that there will be a later release with both of these important scenes restored. Even so, the series was VERY well thought out and written. Its a keeper for certain."

","Don't get me wrong!  I like this movie very much.  I am a huge fan of the series, and I own the special edition of this film.  But, I've been noticing that many of the things said or done on the film are very much the same as it's predecessor.  Not the ""I'll be back"" bit, but the way the T-1000 handles things.  He crashes into a helicopter, and tells the pilot ""Get out"", the exact same thing Arnold said to the truck driver in the first film.  It's a kind of deja 'vu.  But no matter.  I don't think much of it when I'm immersed in the movie.  It's also perfectly executed and photographed.  James Cameron knows when he wants you to relax, and when he wants you to be hyped up with the action.  It's a hardcore sci-fi action film!  And the special effects and action sequences stand out among the best that have ever been attempted.<br/><br/>Another aspect of ""Terminator 2"" that makes it so powerful is the dynamic soundtrack.  It's really very good!  Movies today can't reproduce something this good.  This is the kind of movie that MUST be viewed with a big surround sound system.  Pump up the volume, sit back, and feel the explosions and gunfire!<br/><br/>Best of all, is the special edition, which restores about 15 minutes of extra footage.  James Cameron is notorious for deleting significant scenes from his films in order to maintain a pace.  None of the scenes are crucial to the storytelling, but they do add more canvas and insight on the characters, on the story, and they give us a new unique look at an already great film.  To me, the must crucial restoration was the ""glitching"" scene with the T-1000, where his hand gets stuck to a pole and his hand is the same color as the pole.  That scene would have given the audience a sense of hope that the T-1000 could in fact, be destroyed.  There is a single glitch in the original cut, where after Arnold's arm is jammed into a large gear, a wave ripples up the T-1000's face.  I had no idea what it was, until more and more of the glitches were restored.  Unfortunately, the DVD version, which has superb quality standards, has yet to release the special edition in that format.  Oh well.  Either way, you will still enjoy this movie. If not, I couldn't begin to figure out why!"

Anyway, I label it my most addictive movie because while I feel it's not the best movie ever made like some other people, I still have an urge to see it quite often. While one can go on and on about how often the concept of time gets screwed up (example: Judgment Day is to happen in two years judging from Sarah's prologue. Arnie latter explains Cyberdyne's work as taking place ""three years from now"" and SkyNETs origins as later on). The whole plotline of events is really messed up and I was just hoping Arnold would be the killer again. Instead, Robert Patrick has to try and be as menacing as possible, which doesn't come off all that well. Oh well, maybe next time. The teaser/credits scene makes up for the gaping action hole in the middle. The movie itself definitely could've been a lot shorter. Hopefully with Terminator 3 they will get what they got wrong this time right.

This newer model is made of a special ""liquid metal"", is able to morph itself into any object of similar size and is VERY difficult to destroy or disable. Don't worry fans; Arnold is up to the task of dealing with this new enemy. He has more combat experience and better tactical skills. These two fight battle after battle throughout the film giving us some really fantastic stunts and GREAT special effects. Linda Hamilton gives an excellent performance as John's mother, Sarah Connor.

"Funky A","8","0","0","3 February 2002"," A really good Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.
","I am not usually the kind of person who likes an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, but Terminator 2 is very entertaining. First of all, there is a plot and it is not bad. We are not talking about the best plot ever seen in a movie, but Terminator 2 has a storyline that touches many classic Science-Fiction themes like time-travel and the war between machine and man in interesting ways. Also, Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as a robot. You know, he has never been the kind of actor who can show a great range of subtle emotions but the part of a robot is perfect for him. He is a killing machine, and he looks STRONG. And when John Connor tells him to never kill humans, the way he ""handles"" the order is really good. But even more impressive than the Terminator himself is T-1000. I mean, few movie vilains are as dangerous as he is, and few survive as many harsh treatments has he does. And this is where the incredible special effects come play a role in the quality of this movie. These effects are creative and still credible after more than 10 years. Sometimes, computer-generated special effects do not age very well but those in Terminator 2 are still impressive today. This is an accomplishment. Linda Hamilton is not the most convincing actress ever and it is no different in T2 but she doesn't ruin the movie. Some of the things the script makes her say are really stupid but she is not the most important character in the movie. T2 is about those two robots from the future and they don't dissapoint. The action scenes are good and on the whole, the movie is a really entertaining big-budget blockbuster. And as a bonus, it has a better story than your average action movie.<br/><br/>79%"

"pamp061","Null","0","0","25 October 2001"," My thoughts.
","When I was young and I first saw this film, I absolutely loved it. But then again I was easily impressed by anything that was science fiction. After all, another favourite film of mine at around about the same time was Lawnmower Man, and when I recently watched that again I wasn't very impressed. (Why couldn't that guy just close his eyes?)<br/><br/>I watched Terminator 2 with pretty much the same expectations, but found that the movie was both better, and not as good as I remembered it. For someone else who is a first time viewer of the Terminator franchise, this movie would seem great, but others may notice that it is a general revamp of the themes (and ideas) of the first Terminator in 1984.<br/><br/>I watched it and was given the impression that the film was made largely for special effects rather than storyline. The storyline was good, especially with a Terminator playing a central role, giving its points of views and behaviour towards a human world. My problem is that it seemed to have many of the story components of the first film. For example...<br/><br/>1. The Terminator wears 'tough guy' clothing - however a Terminator wearing a priests uniform, or a bright green jumpsuit with sandals would look stupid.<br/><br/>2. Mimickry of the main characters parents - This of course is what the T-1000 was built for, but mimicking Johns foster parents was just too close to the mimicking of Sarah's mother.<br/><br/>3. The tanker chase - Very obvious parralel.<br/><br/>4. Terminators running a rampage in a police station/criminal hospital.<br/><br/>5. The bike crash/helicopter crash leading on to the tanker chase.<br/><br/>All this gave me the impression that James Cameron was using Terminator 2 as a means to do what he wished he could have done in Terminator 1 if he had a much bigger production budget. I don't think he needed to do this, as Terminator 1 stands on its own two feet very well, especially for such a small budget.<br/><br/>Of course, there are many Terminator fanatics out there who would fervently disagree with everything I say. That is the problem when you give criticism to a cult film. You can attract some whackos, who don't seem to realise that it IS just a film, no matter how much they enjoyed it. There is nothing wrong with being a big fan of a movie, even to the point of obsession, but defending it like it is a religion is not healthy.<br/><br/>I will say what I liked about it, however.<br/><br/>There were parts in it which were exceptional, especially with the paradox regarding technology from the future being used as a template for SkyNet - the creator the the technology in the future. I loved Sarah Connors dream sequence, which was very disturbing. And verbal exchanges and behaviour of a (mildly) benevolent terminator - I loved that. It's pedanticly malevolent attitude towards the value of human life, and its final appreciation for it by committing suicide (self-termination) was excellent. Arnold Schwarzennegger really did give one of his best performances in his movie career. And his dialogue was very well thought out, giving authenticity to his robotic mind.<br/><br/>I feel that this film could have done more. It could have had a better plot. Apparently, Cameron was going to have an elaborate beginning sequence set in the future, with the actual raid on SkyNet time-displacement facilities by John Connor, the transportation through time of Kyle Reese and the discovery of a second terminator being sent through time. He should have filmed this - This would have helped set apart the first film from the second. It certainly would have given the die hard fans a lot to cheer about, including myself.<br/><br/>I can't get used to the change in Sarah Connors character and behaviour. Although she was obviously affected mentally from the first attack in T1, at the end of the film she seemed calm and resolute. In the second she was barely sane, and foaming at the mouth half the time. This was novel at first to see such a change, but it did wear a bit thin. I don't think Linda Hamilton is suited for Tough-Girl roles, like, say Sigourney Weaver. She should have played the quiet intelligent type... Yes tough, but not so bezerk and wild eyed.<br/><br/>This Terminator 3 business is, sadly, more than likely going to be a big joke. Johnathan Mostow is a good director, so there is hope there, but the scriptwriters have written some real garbage in the past. If you don't believe me, hire 'The Net' and watch for the microwave scene. If it's going to be as bad as I think it will, what it will do is cheapen the first two movies. It will probably do well in the first week or two but (like Jurassic Park 3), fall in popularity as word spreads that the movie is just popular science fiction trash. What a shame... I have my doubts about T4 - unless Roger Corman buys the rights to it when they are selling at bargain basement prices.<br/><br/>Can I quantise how much I enjoyed T2???<br/><br/>7.8 out of 10 (9.3 out of 10 for T1)<br/><br/>Worth the hire - maybe even to own."

","Yesterday I watched Terminator 2 Judgment day THE ULTIMATE EDITION and I must say it is quite the experience. Not only the extra's and the menu screens, but the film is somewhat of a more 'complete' experience as well. I mean some of the 'new' scenes make a better or just another sense then they did before. I mean I do not want to ruin anything for anybody, but for anybody who wondered how to choose between 2, without hesitating is possible, this film shows it (I hope this was cryptic enough for those who haven't seen this film and specific enough for those who have). This ULTIMATE EDITION is really a great experience. Although it is filled up with about 15 minutes more than the original theatrical version it still is good. I mean there are no things added to this edition that I think should have been edited in the first place. Why the heck did they take these parts out, I wonder.<br/><br/>
Anyway all the actors in this film are great. Linda Hamilton as the die - hard b..ch from hell. Edward Furlong as the lonesome kid, who hasn't got anybody really and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger. He just ROCKS. Ok say what you want about Schwarzenegger. I know he is no great character actor, but he does his job well and he has a certain kind of humor, which he also shows in this movie (as well as in True Lies). But that is not the fact that he is so great in this. The reason for that is rather the same as in THE TERMINATOR. He is excellently cast, with his muscular body and his grim face, along with the mechanical walk he adapted. He just makes the perfect machine. I miss out on the villain as well though, Robert Patrick, he is very cool too. A ruthless killing machine, without any regrets whatsoever.<br/><br/>
Another thing that is really great here is the direction. Especially the scenes, that take place in the future and the action scenes. There is some blood squirting around when people go shooting, but despite that, this one is not as violent as the first one. I also think James Cameron did a great job in putting some critique about human behavior in it and also inserting some drama into the story and even the 'emotionless' cyborg. The special effects, once great are still good, although they are getting a bit old, just as the movie. But have no fear, it will not affect your viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>
Despite the greatness, there is one thing I do not really understand here and that is how James Cameron, the mastermind could have made such a BIG, HUGE, ENORMOUS mistake in his story as I (obviously) witnessed. I mean, there are some minor things in this film that I think are not too good, like the fact that Cameron makes us believe Sarah is 29 in this film and John is 10 (which would have made Linda Hamilton 18 or 19 in the first movie!!!!), but this is really a FAULT and a big one. It is BIG in a sense that it could have been avoided easily, without ever hurting the film at all, whereas overlooking this fault, it kind of hurt the film from my view (if you did not notice THIS mistake, do not worry; I've seen this film about 8 times). Here it comes (BEAR IN MIND, THERE COULD BE SPOILERS HERE) : Remember when driving into the desert somewhere with Sarah (Hamilton) and John (Furlong), the Terminator (Schwarzenegger) tells them all about Skynet and how 3 years from then they will develop something leading to the nuclear blast in August 1997? (If you don't fast forward to that part). This is not possible within the story sketched, because the film takes place in 1995. Therefore something happening three years later (1998) could not have influence on something in August 1997. The big question now is, how the hell do I know this film takes place in 1995? Well, in the beginning when the T 1000 (Patrick) steals the cop car he looks up info about John Connor and when you look closely at the screen it says: Age: 10 and Date of Birth: something, something 1985. Well it hurts me to say this but this is a pretty obvious mistake, that could have simply been avoided by making Arnold say: 'In two years.' instead of 'In three years.' (POSSIBLE SPOILER END). Normal people might not spot this and I hope not to have sc..wed up somebody's film experience, but I just have always felt that there was something wrong with this films timeline. But now that I've finally spot it, I can enjoy this film at ease and admit that it is, in no way worse than it's predecessor, rather just not as original anymore, because when you see THE TERMINATOR shortly before this one, you just notice that there are a lot of similar scenes in both movies plus it is not as magic and amazing as it was before (that goes for every monster, machine or dinosaur sequel). Despite all that I can recommend everyone to go see the ULTIMATE EDITION, for it will bring you the MAXimized T2 film experience as it was meant to be.<br/><br/>

","A very rare instance where the sequel is just as good as the original.

It's seven years after the events of the first movie, and John Connor, the future savior of the world, is a 12-year-old who lives with a foster family and has his mother locked up in an institute.

Then the third part it all gets back on track for a cool finally. So what about this middle but then? Well it has happened in alot of James Cameron movies, such as True Lies. The special effects are really cool, even now, when you see some other 90's films and they date pretty bad. And the story is really clever, but we never see much of the T1000, which is a disappointment, as we saw Arnie in the first movie, nearly all the way through.

Go figure, though, because you have Arnold as the good Terminator.<br/><br/>Arnold has that menacing look that really convinces you that he's evil. Robert Patrick is a great actor, but he doesn't look evil.  It's the special effects that makes him look evil.<br/><br/>On the plus side, this one is much funnier and the relationship between the Terminator and John Connor is hilarious.  I especially liked it when John was teaching him not to kill anyone.  Also, the ending was very touching and sad, it made you not want Arnold to die.<br/><br/>I guess it depends on what you like in the Terminator movies.  The first one has intense action and a fresh look at science fiction... the second one has great relationships between Arnold and Sarah and John, while possessing special effects that will knock your socks off.

","This film has to be one of the more ""human"" action flicks out there.

All the while, the figure of a child (John) whose life has to be protected at all costs looms large, because this child wants to protect his mother and to befriend the Terminator.<br/><br/>All this, and a villain that is absolutely relentless and cold-hearted. As I said before, while most action films are good vs. evil, this film confronts its principal figures with themselves:  John, who doesn't want to acknowledge his destiny as the savior of a future world, and risks his life for his mother; Sarah, who has transformed herself into a psychopath, and has to deal with the fact that her only hope is one of the robots that killed John's father in the first movie, and the Terminator, who tries to learn from his human masters the traits of honesty, love and principles.<br/><br/>Who said Cameron's masterpiece was Titanic? =)"

T2 surpassed Terminator. What makes this such a good film? Is it Arnold? Is the time-travel? Is it the great special effects? NO! It's Robert Patrick! He portrayed one of, in my opinion, the greatest villains ever in the history of cinematography. He took the indestructable bad guy to a whole new level with the T-1000. Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees were pretty good indestructable bad guys, but T-1000 takes the cake. Robert Patrick also made some great cameos as T-1000. He appeared in everything from the great Wayne's World to the unfortunate Last Action Hero. The special effects in T2 were groundbreaking at the time, and are still pretty cool. Now, it isn't the Great American Movie or anything, but it's a fun way to spend a couple of hours."
"ian-220","Null","0","0","24 June 2000"," Terrific visual effects but had its weaknesses
","This film had all the trademarks of a classic. It has excellent special effects, witty dialogue and some explosive fights. One thing that aggravated me was the swearing. Why? Ok, it may make the characters more realistic, but it makes foulsome viewing. I liked the 15 minute cut scene extra version. However, beside the swearing, this is awesome. The shape-shifter was very menacing and I supressed a cheer at the end when Arnie and the T-1000 went to battle.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best performance comes from Arnie himself, though in places I often wonder whether or not he has sufficient acting ability. Linda Hamilton was good as Sarah Connor, totally unwilling to accept the terminator, but gradually warms to 'it' as she refers it. The end may have you wondering whether or not it was a good climax. The liquid metal effects were just right, but there were too many of them. However, you were bewildered by them and the fact that there were too many really doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most chilling scene in the movie is when Arnie cuts his arm open and reveals his endo-skeleton to the terrified inventor and his family before the chaotic conclusion with the T-1000 android. What I wondered during the film is, if the T-1000 is mostly liquid, where is its chip going to be placed? Also, the film also makes no sense whatsoever in terms of the past and future. Don't bother asking yourself questions like: ""How could this happen?"" etc. etc. because you will not get the answers ever. Just accept it as an extreme case of complexity but also sheer enjoyment. A lot better than number one, too. It had more story and you had to feel for Arnie in places, too. Acting is a bit poor in parts and I thought on occasion that the inclusion of John Connor was also a bit of a bad decision, but gradually I think they have made the right choice.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie, but with unnecessary swearing in many places. My total rating would be 4 out of 5. Excellent it is, but terrific? It ain't. But... if you want a good night's entertainment, this is the film. Not for the young at heart. It will terrify them beyond belief."
"Chris-448","Null","0","0","5 June 2000"," First Action Hero
","Admittedly, Arnold Schwarzenegger is not the greatest actor and James Cameron is not the most subtle director, but in this movie, both factors were completely irrelevant. Arnie is, of course, best remembered for his reprisal of the role of the Terminator, and perhaps this is because it is the only role in which he can pass himself off as a decent actor. Nonetheless, he is entirely convincing throughout, his robotic grit and painless determination underlined by the omnipresent special effects. With the possible exception of ""Jurassic Park,"" the special effects unleashed in T2 are unsurpassed in modern cinema; they are so ubiquitous within this movie that they sucked up almost half of the enormous $200m budget.<br/><br/>
The weak link is undoubtedly the lamentably poor acting ability of Edward Furlong as John, although many of the other actors are so convincing that Cameron was able to gloss over the failure pretty successfully. Cameron's ex-wife, Linda Hamilton, plays an entirely different Sarah Connor in the sequel; there is more brutal and emotionless determination than before, which I thought was a realistic portrayal of a woman trapped in a cross-time battle to avert the end of the world. Top marks to the casting managers, who found little-known actor Robert Patrick for the part of the TX1000. His on-screen presence alone exudes a sense of menace, and this is remarkable considering he has very little dialogue.<br/><br/>Unlike many other sequels, this was better than the original. Its plot wasn't so unbelievable as to make it sound like it was written solely to make more money. It is unique for an action movie because of its feasible plot, its quality acting and its ability to maintain the attention of its audience with its series of unpredictable twists and sheer suspense. 8 out of 10."

","A follow up to the sci-fi hit The Terminator, T2 is without doubt one of the greatest action films ever made, and may well be the best sequel of all time. Arnie reprises his role as the death dealing cyborg from times to come with wooden (or is it metal?) brilliance. Again he plays the role very convincingly, well backed up by Linda Hamilton as Sarah, Edward Furlong as the rebellious future world leader, and Robert Patrick as the menacing prototype killer robot. James Cameron again directs with trademark style and detail, and a major highlight is the stunning visual effects which have yet to be beaten, the T 1000 effects are breathtakingly original and spectacular. It flows well as a film, with a good follow up plot to the original, and it stays together well between the stunning action sequences, from the first encounter between the killing machines, to the Cyberdine battle between Arnie and the cops, to the final assault on the senses in the iron smelter. All in all, a true triumph of modern cinema, and one of the best action films of all time. 8 out of 10."

"bat-5","8","0","0","4 April 2000"," Still impressive
","Not only does James Cameron make a successful sequel, he manages to outdo the original and push the envelope of visual effects one step further.  Giving us two Terminators for the price of one, Cameron has sent Arnold on a new mission.  This time around, he's out to save the future, and his nemesis is the ever changing, very lethal, T-1000.  The action is fast and furious and each sequence gets larger and more elaborate than the first one.  Cars, trucks, motorcycles and every other type of vehicle you can think of get tossed through the air, blown up and shot up. But at the heart of all this visual mayhem, is a story that deals with relationships.  There's the relationship between John Connor and the Terminator, and how the Terminator starts to grow into a surrogate father.  Then there's the relationship between John and his mother, Sarah, and that's where the real heart of the film is.  Sarah cares for her son, but for the wrong reasons.  She knows what the future holds and she protects him from everything.  In doing so, Sarah has shut herself out of John's life and alienated herself from the rest of humanity.  But when you know how and when the world will end, you'll look at things differently.  The film has not diminished with time.  It's well made and the effects are still amazing. I especially like the scene where the T-1000 comes rising out of a checkerboard floor.  I remember hearing people gasp in awe when that was on.  What I will always remember from T2, is the thrill of seeing it for the first time, and when that metal foot comes down crushing that skull, I can still see the entire theater jumping in unison.  Terminator 2 raised the action and special effects bar to new levels, and only just recently, has that been surpassed."

Not a movie to recommend to watch today as the effects are cheesy and story is very thick on narratives. Having to believe Sarah Connor went from a 21 year old wimpy powder puff waitress to a martial arts monster within several years whilst committed to an insane asylum really pushes the limit of believability.I believe the plot line of part 3 of killing all his lieutenants should of been the main quest line of part 1 and part 2 should of been the futuristic aftermath of the war."

Yes I do mean RUBBISH, GARBAGE or whatever else you may care to call it. I've rated it a two because if you just want to see Arnie flex his muscles, grunt in an Austrian accent, and generally shoot the place up, I'd have to give it 10 out of 10 and if I was then to say that the special effects were way ahead of their time, why I'd go so far as to give it a 12. The plot's well paced, the acting is good and it makes a decent mindless action film. However this is NOT what I want from a movie, not even an Arnie number.<br/><br/>Much of my disappointment is probably due to the time I saw the first film. I will never forget the fear I felt of the implacable terminator ruthlessly tracking ITS prey without regard for anything but fulfilling ITS programmed objectives. The first Terminator film now looks dated beyond belief, but it was way, way ahead of its time. Nonetheless in the sequel there's nothing amazing (apart from the special effects) to freak anyone out. Instead, James Cameron sets out to prove that vacuum cleaners too can have complex personalities. Sorry, it just doesn't wash. And neither does the anti-war theme which is so lightly graffiti-ed over the entire film with the subtlety of a skinhead wielding a baseball bat at a gay pride demonstration. The final little speech made at the end of the film is so unashamedly and outrightly didactic that its saccharin taste leaves one with the need to reach for the bucket. (It still makes me want to wretch just writing about it.)<br/><br/>What I love in a good film is coming out of the cinema, forgetting it, but then continually thinking about it over the next few days. What I loathed about Terminator 2 was coming out of the cinema, forgetting about it, and then continually thinking about its inconsistencies for the next few years. Poor though the third film is, at least it attempts to sort out the muddle of illogical time lines left by the second film. It's downright illogical that the mainframe in the future, knowing it had been destroyed would firstly send a model of a Terminator with a surprisingly large batch run, then realize it had failed and so send a new and better number. Why didn't it just send the more advanced prototype first? (If it had lost the war at the hands of John Connor, what else was the thing going to be used for?) If it weren't for the third film, which was desperately needed to explain this mess, the mainframe computer must have known it had lost the battle instantly. After all, it must have found out through its own non-existence. I know I'm pedantic, but I can't really be the only one out there. However, if you are capable of leaving your brain somewhere else, be my guest. Otherwise I must seriously warn you: this film will do serious damage to your IQ and should be given a government health warning. Give it a miss or start talking more kindly to your household appliances."

(though it would have killed Terminator long before that scene) It would have stabbed Sarah in the eye.. but why even ASK for her to yell for 'John' when he could mimic her voice perfectly (and did so 3 minutes later). So unrealistic. Then a 'magic' gun destroys it? And the end just happens to take place in another weird factory? This time a steel liquid molten factory?

If you like a cheap grab-bag of special effects tacked onto the top of a cynical, lazy effort to rehash the original film and make loads of money, I can see why you might like T2. As a sequel to one of the most intelligent action films of the 80s, however, this is an abomination of a movie. If you think the two stories can be viewed as mutually compatible, you have a very poor grasp of the logic and metaphysics of the narrative universe set up in The Terminator. Basically Cameron and Wisher set out their rules in The Terminator, and then proceed to break them at every step here, hoping that the audience will be too stupid to notice or care. Sadly, for the most part they were proved correct."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>After the first Terminator sent by Skynet failed to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in 1984, she has now found herself holed up in a mental institution, while her young son John (Edward Furlong) is an unruly delinquent. But now, they've managed to send the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a more advanced and destructive killer, back in time to kill John before he grows up and becomes the leader who will lead The Resistance to victory. However, TR have also sent a machine, the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who looks exactly the same as the bad one from the last film, back to protect him. The battle begins...<br/><br/>After the cult success of the original Terminator film in the early 80s, it seemed James Cameron had opted to avoid the law of diminishing returns and simply leave it as a standing testament to brilliant sci-fi, not that anyone could blame him. So, it was quite a gamble of him many years later, as a new decade dawned and other things had come along, to throw a load of money and time into a much bigger budgeted, bigger scaled sequel. But, unbelievably, it paid off, creating a film that's lasted the ages and late last year, was re-released in a brand new 3D print and is now available in the same format on DVD, so a new generation of film-goers could savour its breath taking cinematic marvel.<br/><br/>It's right up there with the likes of Star Wars and Lawrence of Arabia, as one of the great epic movies, a lengthy, lavish production, that broke boundaries with its special effects and graphics, that show their age a little bit today but still have an undeniable awe-inspiring quality about them. But the important thing is that Cameron doesn't forget why a strong, central story and characters you can care about are so important. Throughout, there are some subtle observations about the human condition and the nature of survival that make it stand out a country mile from your average sci-fi.<br/><br/>In a day and age where the latest big, massive blockbuster is churned out a dime a dozen, with barely a fraction of the heart and soul, Cameron's masterpiece is an enduring testament where they came along far less often but produced a far more magical and unforgettable experience. It's a none stop, thrill a minute ride that you are made to feel a part of, and it's hard to think of another title more deserving of being reborn in the 3D format. *****"

Like when John wonders about his dad and they show Sarah photos from the policestation 1984. Its also is hard to see ""father unknown"" when the computer scrolls down information about John.

Then he was seduced by the Dark Side of the Force and started making s***.<br/><br/>***PLOT SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Terminator 2 is an appalling film. Certainly, the special effects were ground-breaking (although look ordinary now)but I'm more than a little sick of hearing people say this in its defence. Special Effects alone are not enough. There needs to be a plausible story, decent dialogue, solid acting performances and a basic artistic integrity. Linda Hamilton excepted, the performances here all suck. Arnie was perfectly cast in the original as a cyborg villain - for once his mechanical tics and twitches actually worked in his favour. His attempts to make the robot in T2 more human are just tragic. The plot is totally lacking in plausibility. Edward Furlong, we are supposed to believe, turns into a ruthless future guerilla leader. Someone who orders his troops not to kill the enemy (as he tells Arnie in that patronising ""You can't kill anybody"" sequence)clearly isn't meant to be a general. In the first film, we were told that the time-travel equipment had been blown up after Kyle Reese had been sent back in time. So how come it's now working again? And if they're capable of sending more Terminators back, why didn't they just send back a cyborg to kill Sarah Connor when she was in labour? She could hardly have fought back then. It seems as though Cameron thought he could blind his audience to these obvious discrepancies by bombarding them with special effects. The whole film is a mess. Everything that made the first Terminator film great was sacrificed to make a gaudy, crass effects-fest. I had been looking forward to a sequel set in the future, featuring John Connor fighting against the machines. Instead, they made the biggest fake in history. And the thumbs-up bit at the end? I vomited a river."

","You either a Terminator fan or just a Schwarzenegger fan. Either way this was the best take. Judgement Day(1991). The background story is absolutely true. Man (MAD) has the power to destroy the earth and other planets. However it wont be Divinely authorized.
Powerful story if you get into it. James Cameron was definitely inspired on another level or just a good dreamer. Either way he graduated from cigars for smoke and a light switch to a epic cutting edge technological masterpiece, setting a precedent to follow."

"hatsunemiku-27340","8","2","5","11 September 2017"," Action Classic
","the first Terminator was a weird hybrid of action, horror, and sci-fi that did none of them right. The action sequences were poorly directed and edited and fell into that ""Industrial Action"" category I discussed. The horror was toned down by the over-the-top violence. There was scary imagery and ideas, but it wasn't quite scary enough to be memorable for that facet. And the sci-fi was there in the scenes of the war against the machines as well as the Terminator himself, but that was extremely subdued. Taking into account both the horror element and the sci-fi element: When I ask you to think of the Terminator, what do you think of? You think of Arnie. And that right there is a problem. You're thinking of a personality rather than a creature.<br/><br/>T2 fixes this. It's not a horror movie and it's not trying to be. While the film is about John and Sarah Connor being pursued by an even more powerful and bizarre Terminator while being defended by the original Terminator model (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) the T-1000 is not portrayed in a scary way. He's a terrible murderer and creepy in that regard, sure, but James Cameron does a better job of balancing the tone.<br/><br/>That tone allows for horror elements while not overplaying them. The real horror is the impending doom for humanity and the nightmares Sarah has. These aren't there for no reason; they build on Sarah's growing insanity and drive to save the world from SkyNet.<br/><br/>Thus we have the horror thrown to the side. This means that the sci-fi element is more at the forefront. In the first film the only real connection between 1984 and 2029 is Kyle and the Terminator. Because of that, the sci-fi didn't work for me. There was no immediate threat to humanity or something urgent that drew me in. The only real urgency was protecting Sarah from being killed.<br/><br/>In T2 the sci-fi is much more focused. While we do get a scene at the beginning of the machine wars, that's it. No resistance fighters, no reminders of the horrible future that's 45 years off. Instead we have the very real and scary possibility of nuclear holocaust in a few years and the events that will lead to it. Miles Dyson has begun work on what will eventually become SkyNet and lead to the end of humanity. Sarah can prevent this by killing him or destroying his research. It's more engaging because there are connections between Connor's present and the future that have actual foreseeable consequence. That's what the first film was missing.<br/><br/>And that leaves the action element. T1 had industrial action, bad editing, and there wasn't a real urgency to anything. T2 spits in the face of the industrial action title by providing lived in and organic settings for its action pieces. Car chases involve roads full of traffic and pedestrians. In the hospital scene, the staff get involved. And my favorite part is that while the film ends in an industrial setting, there are actual people working there. They run away, but at least Cameron puts them there to make the movie world feel like a real place, not a closed set.<br/><br/>And the action is much better directed and edited as well. The drastic difference in the competency of the production is prevalent from the earliest scenes. Heck, even the script, the acting, the effects (duh), the shot composition, the lightingeverything is ten times better than what you saw in T1.<br/><br/>What I really appreciated, aside from everything, was that Cameron got the characters right this time. Sarah Connor is interesting. She's a broken individual who wants to save the world from SkyNet and knows that Armageddon is coming, but nobody listens. The Terminator, this time, is not a killing machine but portrayed as a learning organism. He and John bond together, providing John a sort of father figure. It's an interesting dynamic that leads to some funny moments and ultimately makes the killing machine the most compelling character of the cast. The T-1000 serves its purpose, he doesn't necessarily need a character. And John Connor iswell, he's not interesting. He's kind of annoying. His voice cracks every other line.<br/><br/>It's interesting really. Almost as if Cameron himself sat down and watched his original Terminator, took notes, and looked at everything he could do to make his sequel not just a great successor but a great film by its own right, improving on what he made rather than stagnating.<br/><br/>T2 is one of the best sequels of all time and a great piece of cinema. It's an interesting look at the maturation of Cameron as a director, writer, and creator. While I wouldn't go so far as to say its in my top action movies, I can see why many would consider it to be one of the finest."
"TheOny13","7","2","5","16 March 2017"," I really don't get all the hype and praise this movie recieved!(Major spoilers)
","Again, another movie in which I'm on the opposite side of the general opinion about this movie. I really don't care about the countless 10 stared reviews this movie got here because I found huge problems in this and I have arguments, arguments which are coming right below, here's my opinion on this movie:<br/><br/>The Story: This movie gets the story from the beginning into a paradox, but is the type of paradox that for me is not as disturbing as the one I'll be telling you along this review. So the first paradox was actually in the previous movie but it has implications in this move as well and is John Connor sending his friend Kyle Reese which later has a baby with Sarah Connor a child named John Connor, which now is in danger because the machines have sent a terminator T-1000 to kill him. So what does John Connor? He sends a terminator that looks like the one who tried to kill Sarah Connor before? Does he not know about that? Of course because he maybe acquired it from the machines. He couldn't construct it from memories because that would be another paradox but one about the circumstance. So he really just sends the same looking terminator just so that we and Sarah Connor might get the thrilling surprise of seeing that terminator again, but now with different motivations. Is like John Connor knew James Cameron was making a movie about his decision and so he thought: ""Hmm... let's make my decision more Hollywodized, why not? Scr*w logic and get on with it!"" But that's not the worst part in this movie. The worst part in this movie is that after all the drama, action and conclusion to it... the people in it decide to prevent Judgment Day. Are you seriously? That's even a bigger paradox in this already paradox-crowded movie. It's a continuity paradox which just points out that the director of this movie had no idea how to finish his big action movie. OK, it would be unfair from me to criticize this movie after giving it a 7 rating. So, the things I enjoyed about this movie were the action and the CGI which at that time were as innovating as the ones from Jurassic Park were at the time that movie was released. And to be honest and fair, I liked this movie... but I cannot skip or ignore it's problems... of course you might say it's a subjective view, but isn't how every one of us expresses his opinion. I'm trying to be as objective and also say may opinions which might convince you to agree with me or not, I don't care... everyone is different, it would be stupid to try and please everyone with this review and it would loose its purpose. OK, let's get back to the movie: The human touch is impressive, and that's why I like James Cameron movies. He emphasizes the human part so much that it becomes so believable and inspiring. To make a robot be so memorable and loved by the general audiences tells something about how this guy makes movies.<br/><br/>The characters: The characters are bad-ass especially the three main protagonists. But for me T-800 and John's relationship is what gives this movie heart and makes it so memorable and nice to watch. Sarah is OK, probably more bad-ass than in the first movie.<br/><br/>The Soundtrack: This is probably the second part of this movie which I didn't like. I thought it wasn't memorable apart for the main theme, yeah... that one with the drums in it. For such an ambitious action movie, the soundtrack in my opinion is underwhelming. There is no iconic track like the scores John Williams made in this same period of time. <br/><br/>All that being said, I think this movie is good overall, but very overrated by many people. And seeing so many reviews saying is the best ever or the best in its genre it's pathetic to say the least. So, after saying all of this I'll give this movie a 7 since it gets the action so good, but at the very same time it gets the time travel stuff so awfully wrong in my opinion.<br/><br/>Oh... I don't expect to be agreed with by many of the IMDb users, or even promoted by IMDb's reviews system which only promotes very positive reviews for this movie because? Oh, yes I know... it's a classic."
"cristiandoditoiu","10","2","5","5 February 2017"," The best
","Terminator 2 is the best movie ever. It has everything: a good plot, amazing actors, the best visual effects, sensational soundtrack. A true masterpiece. Arnold is making the best role of his life. His performance is worthy of an Oscar but, as we know, the Academy doesn't give awards to certain type of actors (see Sylvester Stallone for Creed when he should have won the Oscar but the academy couldn't pass beyond his previous failures). I can watch this movie over and over again. I am a huge fan of the entire Terminator franchise but the second part is the one I like the most. I am waiting for the 3D this year to experience different sensations regarding this movie."
"Tweekums","8","2","5","10 August 2016"," The Terminator is back this time to save John Connor
","Set almost fifteen years after the original film we learn that Skynet sent a second, more advanced, T-1000 Terminator back in time; this time to kill the teenaged John Connor. The T-1000 is nothing like the original; it is a liquid metal machine, able to change its form to look like anyone or anything of the same volume. To protect John the resistance and reprogrammed a captured T-800 Terminator and sent it back to defend him.<br/><br/>When the film starts John is living with foster parents and his mother is in a secure mental institution still convinced that Skynet will destroy civilisation in 1997. The T-800 manages to save John from the T-1000 then, on John's orders helps Sarah escape. Once out she knows what must be done; they must find the man responsible for the creation of the technology behind Skynet and prevent him from finishing his work all the time staying ahead of the T-1000.<br/><br/>Even though this film was made a quarter of a century ago the special effects still look very impressive and there is a lot of exciting and spectacular action there are shootouts, a truck vs bike chase along on of Los Angeles's concrete rivers, explosions and final chase involving trucks and a helicopter. Those who want action should certainly be pleased on the other hand it does feel a bit safe at times; John orders the T-800 never to kill making it like a defanged cobra; scary looking but no longer deadly. Arnold Schwarzenegger continues to impress in the role, managing to inject some humour into the character. Linda Hamilton is also pretty solid as Sarah Connor; it is interesting to see how much her character has developed since the original. Edward Furlong is okay as the young John Connor although his character can be a bit irritating at times in a way that didn't seem real. Robert Patrick did a fine job as the shapeshifting T-1000. The level of violence is considerably lower than the original; the T-1000 kills a few people but even when blasting away with a minigun the T-800 only destroys property and causes non-life-threatening injuries this of course means the film is suitable for a slightly younger audience. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the original; personally I prefer the first film but I can understand why others would rate this one higher."
"ajpeck-86566","10","2","5","1 May 2016"," The Impact This Movie Has Left On Me is Amazing
","Oh my goodness. This movie is one of the greatest sic-fi flicks out there. Better than any other Terminator movie, Arnold Schwarzzeneggar has molded the Terminator from an evil, heartless, cold, murderous villain to a hero who had started to learn human feelings with the help of John Connor. Robert Patrick's portrayal of the T-1000 was the best I've ever seen. Cold, heartless, calculating, the T-1000 would stop at nothing to defeat the Terminator and kill young John Connor. This film alone has spawned Terminator another 3 movies, a theme park attraction at Universal Studios parks, merchandise, and millions of dollars for James Cameron. The action was some of the best gun-play I have ever seen, only being trumped by Deadpool, the car chases are the best in cinema history, and the demise of the T-1000 was the most dramatic yet impacting death in my life. It was upsetting, however, to see Arnold's T-800 sacrificing himself to stall Judgement Day. There was also a lesson to be taught here - no fate but what we make for ourselves, meaning, only you decide how your life plays out. This lesson still stays with me today. In conclusion, this movie is well deserving of its 10 rating. This is Arnold at his prime in his acting career. This was the best sci-fi movie I have ever watched."

"alec-593-506471","10","2","5","9 March 2016"," Almost perfect
","This film was released in 1991 and I saw it at the cinema upon release. It blew me away. Now twenty-five (yes really!! do the maths!) years later I am finally doing it the justice of recording my review. <br/><br/>First things first. I love this movie. I have seen it 20, 30 maybe 40 times and it still blows me away. Not only was it the best action/sci-fi film of its time, for me it is certainly in contention for being the best action/sci-fi film of all time. <br/><br/>Following on from the first film, almost ten years later a second terminator is sent back in time, this time to kill John Connor, Sarah Connor's son and the future leader of the resistance. This time it is a T1000 - a liquid metal cyborg that can imitate anything it touches. As before, the resistance can also send back one protector, but this time it is another (but lower spec) terminator (Arnie) reprogrammed to protect John. <br/><br/>There is little to criticise. The story is tight, the casting (with one exception) spot on. The atmosphere is perfect, the pacing is bang on and the music and sound is wonderful. The special effects which were utterly jaw dropping at the time still wouldn't look out of place in a modern release. When you consider that this film was released only a year after the original Total Recall it is truly staggering how different they look today. Total recall looks low budget, low tech and really dated, whereas T2 would hold it's own against any film released even now.<br/><br/>The only negative - I have to say that Edward Furlong's John Connor is quite irritating, a shrill, fairly unlikable delinquent which makes rooting for him, certainly in the early part of the film, a little difficult. <br/><br/>That said this is a minor niggle in what is a cinematic masterpiece. I can't believe there can be many that haven't seen it, but if you haven't - watch it! And if you have - watch it again. <br/><br/>The true test of a great film is - if you find it on TV, no matter how many times you have seen it or however far through it it, you watch it to the end again. This has passed that test on more occasions than I can remember!<br/><br/>Fully deserving of a 10/10 score."

I would highly recommend this movie to anybody who hasn't watched it. It is an instant classic, and the action keeps the viewers intrigued.

"ElMaruecan82","10","2","5","24 July 2015"," ""Terminator 2"" is to ""The Terminator"" what T-1000 is to T-800 ...
","My generation still remembers the impact of James Cameron's ""Terminator 2"", it was the new touchstone in special effects, with CGI effects that still holds up very well today while ""Jurassic Park"" dinosaurs make Bruce the Shark look like something from National Geographic. I challenge everybody to spot anything fake in the way T-1000 parts liquefy or turn to a blade. It looks so real and it'd better do, because otherwise, the film wouldn't work.<br/><br/>""The Terminator"" had good but no revolutionary special effects, the story and the action wowed audiences. In ""Terminator 2"", one of a few sequels recognized as better than the original, the story, the action AND the special effects impressed everyone. And that simple statement deserves a second reading, it means that the movie didn't rely on special effects only, it didn't take them for granted, they had to support the story, they had to have a point. Well, they had the better point they could ever have, underlining the villain's dangerousness and invincibility. A great Sci-fi movie must be spectacular, a great thriller must have a terrific villain to allow the heroes to shine. ""T2"" had both and the villain was so constantly spectacular it made the chases look rather conventional, which is saying a lot. Not just thrilling and invincible, but like Michael Biehn in the first film, Robert Patrick is the 'unknown-yet-reassuring face', even more dangerous with a cop uniform.<br/><br/>T-1000 is not a replica of the former Terminator model, he's more sophisticated, he can take a human form after touching it, and he can turn his arms or other parts of his robotic anatomy into blunt instruments. What does that mean ? That you can burn him, freeze him and blow him to pieces, his molecular structure will slowly reassemble and, paraphrasing Arnie, 'he'll be back' to hunt you. He's programed to kill John Connor, which means that he's determined and you better not cross his path, in the better case, he'll tell you to get out from such a thing as a driving truck or a flying chopper, in the worst, he'll kill you, either with a bullet but more likely in a way you won't have to see coming. The film features countless 'ouch' moments, which are another mark of the film's greatness, its capability not to swim in the same waters than the predecessor by still recycling the same story. ""Terminator 2"" is to ""The Terminator"" what T-1000 is to T-800, same program, different technology.<br/><br/>The similar program is the requirement of the story. Good old Skynet victim of its own success caused robots to rebel against humans, but they were defeated by John Connor. They tried to kill his mother, and ironically, allowed his very existence, how about then killing the son directly ? When you think about it, this is an endless loop, if the mission fails again and John Connor at 13 isn't killed, they can try him at 7. As a matter of fact, they could've sent a T-1000 in 1984 right again, but the film handles this issue very cleverly. The good Terminator, T-800, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, will not only be to protect John (Edward Furlong) and eventually kill T-1000 (that's the only way to protect John on the longer term anyway) but also prevent the whole Skynet project from ever existing. ""T2"" was supposed to be the one that closed the series, I wish it could have remained that way.<br/><br/>So what do we have ? A great villain, a denser and richer story although based on a similar plot, and a great hero. This is another aspect where the film outsmarted its predecessor, the re-casting, so to speak, of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the same role but on the other side of the coin, a robot programmed as a bodyguard, but whose contact with John Connor will teach him a few things about humanity. To have a character like John Connor gives another dimension to the story, while the first was sliding down to a touching romance, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton had that romantic thing about them, but this time, Sarah Connor changed, she's the bad-ass heroin we left in 1984, too concerned by the future to care for romance, let's make a sort of friendship story.<br/><br/>And Arnie strikes again with a tailor-made role for him, playing the same role but you can tell it's not the same character than in 1984. In fact, you could make a film with the two characters fighting each other without having the feeling it's the same actor. Fittingly, both would be listed in the American Film Institute's Top 50 Heroes and Villains, and I believe T-1000 would have deserved a spot in the villains' list. Arnold, like all the other actors, delivers one of his finest performance, served by unforgettable catchphrases. As if « I'll be back » wasn't catchy enough, ""T2"" had « No Problemo » and the iconic and immortal « Hasta la vista, Baby ! » The 90's feel so far away when I remember the impact the film had, not just the Sci-fi stuff, or the duel between Arnold and that killer robot trying to get John, there were the relationships, the story, the characters.<br/><br/>""Terminator 2 : Judgement Day"" isn't a continuation, it's an improvement of a material that was already great in the first place. The good characters are still there, the new ones are more impressive, the special effects (sweeping all the major Oscar categories) were top notch, and the Pop Culture thing isn't to prove now. The film made it #5 in the American Film Institute's Top 10 Sci-fi movies, an all natural choice because the film is a school case of sequel-making. James Cameron mastering his own directorial talent had already proved it with ""Aliens"" : a great sequel must remind of the great stuff that was in the original while being a great movie on its own."
"alindsay-al","10","2","5","22 June 2015"," An epic sequel that improves in every way
","In preparation for terminator genysis I am rewatching the previous films in the franchise and I have now just watched again the best terminator film and one of my favourite films ever judgement day. The film is set 10 years after the first film and skynet send a terminator back to the 1990s to kill John Connor as a kid so Connor from the future reprogrammes a terminator to protect him as a kid. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the t-800 and instead of being a villain he is the hero and a protector of John Connor. And he was perfect for the role, he nailed the robot mentality but also invoked allot of humour and emotion out of the terminator that he really couldn't do in the first film. He is also awesome in the action scenes which was much better in this film. Now I have to admit the kid who plays John Connor is the only real disappointment for me, I mean he isn't terrible but he just doesn't really shine allot even though him and Schwarzenegger have good chemistry on screen. Linda Hamilton is back and boy is her character different in this film, Sarah Connor is now a militarized soldier who is one f the best action stars in recent memory. Her character has allot of layers to her and she really sells her characters troubling situation. They introduce the man that will eventually cause judgement day and he was an interesting character that added a different dynamic to the film. And of course the villain the t-1000 played by Robert Patrick. He goes down as one of the most intimidating villains in film history and his liquid metal effects are legendary in film. He was the perfect villain for this film and he will go down as one of the greatest villains ever. The story is simplistic and similar to the first film but it is just much more in every way. You see the character development of the terminator and Sarah Connor so much that they become some of the most interesting characters in action film history. The film has layers to it with all the story arcs being interesting and even when the t-1000 isn't on screen you are fully invested in what else is going on. The script is great with the mix of humour and drama really adding depth to the characters and making you care about the characters when the action goes down. The style in this film is completely breath taking, as the action is just continuous and makes this one of the best action packed films ever. Also the obvious t-1000 special effects make this film even more legendary and puts the style on the levels of greats like Jurassic park and star wars. Overall this is an excellent film which is a must see if you fancy yourself an action and sci-fi fan."

","One of the few sequels that manages to surpass it's predecessor on every level! I had always known that, even before i started watching the Terminator movies because of the debate about how most sequels suck and this movies is one of the prime examples to counterpart that. It has some really amazing effects, and it's really well directed. But what makes this sci-fi flick unforgettable is the characters. Arnold Schwarzeneggers performance as T-800 is amazing! Not to ruin anything but, I was surprisingly kinda touched by the end something i rarely ever am when watching a movie. The relationship between John Connor and the Terminator, the way he tries teaching him the values of human life even though he's a cyborg incapable of feeling human emotions, Linda Hamiltons performance, the plot and of course the badass T-1000 is what makes this sequel bigger, better and more gripping than it's predecessor. <br/><br/>T2 has now become one of my favorite movies of all time, and i would definitely recommend everyone to go see it if they haven't already!"
"secondtake","7","2","5","9 February 2014"," Great idea, great sets, pretty straightforward acting and action flick stuff
","Terminator 2 (1991)<br/><br/>In terms of movie-making, this second installment is clearly a smoother, smarter, more professional product. It's rightfully admired as better, in some ways, that the first in this epic series. Like the Star Wars movies, the first installment excels for sheer story introduction and originality (and I'd throw Hunger Games in the same mix). Once the depth of the success took hold and some money was applied to the second (and third) movies in the sequences, the quality naturally rose. And so ""Terminator 2"" is a better, more solid production.<br/><br/>But it's derivative. Sometimes the scenes are deliberately echoing the first movie, which is understandable, but then other scenes just seem like a lack of originality. There are a couple nice shifts of plot again as you get used to the idea that the future is meeting the past, but really it's kind of the same thing all over again but better. <br/><br/>One thing that doesn't improve is the acting—both Arnold S. and Linda Hamilton are pushing the limits of their abilities, and their credibility. I have to say Hamilton is much better this time around, playing both the sympathetic mother and future hero but also a crazy person really well. Which also helps give the movie a little boost. It's also nice to have Schwarzenegger around for the whole movie, including the finale (again in a factory, like the first movie).<br/><br/>For me, the bad cyborg was too all powerful—the effects were astounding, but if you have a guy/robot who can pretty much do anything you wonder why he doesn't at times just kill people and take care of business with a quick one two. The vulnerability of Schwarzenegger in this film is a welcome contrast, and it makes him almost, well, human. <br/><br/>The plot has progressed over the last seven years well, and we are ready for the third installment—which is part of the idea. Well done, as far as it all goes. Fast, energetic, clever, with great sets and effects."

","STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br/><br/>Following on from the last movie, Sarah Connor (again played by Linda Hamilton) is now locked in a secure mental institution raving about Judgment Day and how six billion lives are going to end on August 29th 1997. Meanwhile her son John (Edward Furlong), the future resistance leader, has grown up without a stable father/mother figure and is now a rebellious young delinquent with no idea of how important he will come to be in his seemingly hopeless future. But Skynet is out to try it's luck again. Having failed to stop John from even being born, it sends a new soldier back in time, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) an advanced prototype with advanced strength and speed and the ability to morph into anyone it comes into contact with (as well as being able to make it's hands turn into long, sharp objects) to kill John in his youth. However, once again the resistance is able to send a fighter, in the shape of The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) this time on the good guys side. As well as evading the T-1000, The Terminator must find John, break his mother free and stop inventor Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) from putting 'Skynet' on line and causing an apocalypse.<br/><br/>Seven years after the first (and much cheaper looking) film was released, James Cameron stepped back behind the director's seat and gave the world Terminator 2, a slick and breath-taking film that was the most expensive film ever made at the time of it's release (good job it made back the revenue!) Alongside The Godfather, this is one of the only films I can think of where the sequel out did the original. The last film repeated, T2 combines some nice human drama, characterization and thought-provoking commentary on the nature of humanity and war with some awe-inspiring spectacle, in the shape of awesome action sequences, out of this world special effects which will still knock the socks off you a few years on, brilliant production design and unforgettable characters. It is an all-round, none stop, unforgettable thrill ride of a film. Forget the minor technical glitch of why the resistance have sent back a warrior exactly the same as the one in the last film (only good!) and not a human fighter or the sometimes depressingly dark and drainy feel of the film, this is one movie that is destined to truly stand the test of time. *****"

","It really pains me to say this because when I was younger Terminator 2 was always a personal favorite. Unfortunately watching it now with fresh eyes and comparing it conceptually to the original, it's really a colossal mess... Everyone praises T2 for being one of the rare sequels to outdo the original. Actually it just tries way too hard to outdo the first and completely loses the effective simplicity which made the original great. T2 strives to be a 'perfect Hollywood Blockbuster' by blending thought provoking sci-fi concepts and strong character drama with high budget special effects, shoot 'em up action, and lots of comic relief. Unfortunately the end result is nothing more than a McDonalds Big Mac... It looks nice and indulges your craving but ultimately is filled with lots of artificial ingredients and cheese that doesn't sit well long term. It's trying to walk a tightrope with mass appeal blockbuster on one side and sci-fi mastery on the other. Instead of effectively walking this tightrope it more often than not jumps from one side to the other.<br/><br/>The main problem I have with T2 is The Terminator itself. Going back to the original, the T-800 was designed to pass just as human enough that it can infiltrate resistance hideouts and assassinate everyone. Simply reprogramming one to go back in time and be a protector wouldn't result in the night and day character transformation the cyborg has from the original. Arnold does a good job staying stoic and cold for the most part but still this cyborg is way too human, and the biggest flaw of all is that it's 'more human than human'. Bladerunner reference aside, what I mean is The T-800 is actually the most likeable character in the entire movie which ultimately is problematic to the concept of the entire franchise. While almost all the human characters in the movie are flawed and unlikeable, The Terminator is perfect. It even points out that humans are destined to destroy themselves (granted if Skynet didn't start the war). When you really take all of that into account why are we rooting for the humans at all, why not root for the machines to win? The Terminator showing a sense of superior humanity is a thought provoking idea but it ultimately ruins the entire motivation of the story which should be that humans while flawed are capable of love and hope which conquers evil. That's the message the first movie conveyed which is completely lost here."

","I can't believe the number of fools which liked this sequel, and thats what it was, better than the original.  How did Miss Conner develop into this Guerrilla Warfare Extraordinaire without any formal training, in a limited time, and stay sharp enough while under psychotic medication to stay alive for more than five minutes?  Sorry, can't get past that.  Furthermore, take away the special effects and the T2 villain gets a beat down from my little sister, he does not come close to comparing with Arnold for #1 bad guy, and in the 90's John Conner's teenage character is doing drugs not trying to save the world.  None of the story is believible, even for science fiction. If you think special effects make the movie, more power to you.  Go watch The ONE over and over again, I'll stick with Enter the Dragon.  Almost NEVER will Pt.2 be the Originals equal.  The characters in T2 don't even come close and neither does the dialog."

These movies these days seem to be a dime a dozen, add a big name, add some crazy ridiculous storyline and add a few million in special effects and that equals Hollywood success these days. Great movie if you don't want to think about anything or if you're upset and need to see a bunch of explosions. Arnold is everything he is cut out to be... big and strong and a terrible actor. The movie is worth a watch, but this cult phenonmenon that has arisen from this movie is kind of ridiculous to me.

The plot. There is some kind of plot but mostly it's just there so that we can get to the special effects. And finally the acting. The acting is ATROCIOUS. The John O' Connor kid is so amazingly bad that I muted this movie every time he started talking. A high-pitched kid swearing and trying to act big and bad is the last thing I am entertained by. Arnold Schwarzzeneger and John O' Connor's mother put on performances not quite as bad as the kid but close. I do not see how anyone could like this movie, but apparently some people do. They can have their opinions, but I personally believe that there is not a single redeeming value about this ""film""."

Then it came to the story of how Sky Net was created. Oh dear. Big mistake. How can a computer be created from the brain chip of a Terminator it sent back in time??? A paradox. Hate it when a Director overlooks something as important as this. The directors cut, or properly called T1000 edition on DVD is far superior. Anyone with a bit of knowledge of how science fiction works will agree with me on the paradox ruining the credibility of the entire storyline.

"dostan-85075","6","2","6","15 October 2019"," An average movie with an aesthetic ending
","I'm not a big fan of action and sci-fi movies but Terminator is probably in a ""must watch"" list. I was growing up watching this film multiple times and hadn't paid much attention before it got very old. It is directed by Canadian filmmaker James Cameron ,it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger who plays Terminator and Linda Hamilton as a second lead presenting young lady with her child who needs protection.<br/><br/>The movie takes place after eleven years of first episode of Terminator and shows a boy with outstanding characteristics, John Connor who has to be killed by T-1000 Terminator(villain). As a positive character, Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent from the future to save boy's life.<br/><br/>Under the extremely stylish direction of James Cameron,Arnold and Linda give an excellent performances. As expected, the film is thrilling,fast-moving and in some parts hair-raising. Special effects that are used properly opens a full view to the plot of the movie and makes it colorful. However,because it filmed almost 30 years ago, movie may seem quite old and screened in poor quality.<br/><br/>To sum up,this is on of the best films among first action genre movies but could be criticized unfairly due to old production. But this masterpiece is definitely worth to watch:)<br/><br/>Ayana"
"Leofwine_draca","10","2","6","11 November 2016"," The purest form of action cinema there is
","At the time of release, this was one of the biggest, most expensive, box office hits ever made. Obviously that reputation has long since been diminished by films which have come since, but I still remember the hype and excitement that surrounded this film when I was but a ten year old boy. Containing Arnold Schwarzenegger's most accessible, likable performance, it's difficult to find fault with this near-masterpiece of adrenaline-pumping action.<br/><br/>Essentially it's just a string of set pieces linked together by a few scenes of dialogue. There's little drama or acting involved - all the characters are clear-cut - basically, the film goes from one outstanding action sequence to another. And these action scenes are truly wonderful. There are five in all; each more exciting and meaningful than the last. The first comes when the T-800 and T-100 finally meet up and have a huge battle in a hallway, smashing walls down and throwing each other through windows. The battle of the titans continues outside in a riveting truck chase, stopped only by a huge explosion. The third suspenseful set-piece shows just how unstoppable the T-1000 is, as the goodies and baddies battle over rescuing Sarah Connor from her mental asylum. Then there's lot of gunfire and explosions in the Cyberdyne building siege, until the final climatic battle between good and evil at a steel mill.<br/><br/>If THE ABYSS was the first film to really introduce CGI, TERMINATOR 2 is the first film to really make use of its facilities and to place them in a context - unlike later entries which tried to make non-computerised things look real, and failed. The T-1000's morphing shots are stunning, show-stopping, and exceptional, and they work because they are meant to look as such. Aside from these excellent morphing sequences (the scene involving the T-1000 coming out of a floor is probably the greatest), there's tons of ammunition and explosions flying across the screen at every opportunity. Arnie dons some realistic ""wound"" makeup in the final scenes of the film, and once again the makeup is flawless. The special effects are the best things in this film; the makeup, CGI work and stunts all come together in absolute perfection.<br/><br/>The performance are spot on too; characters are introduced and are made charismatic, but thankfully are not dwelled upon. Edward Furlong makes an impressive debut as the streetwise, foul-mouthed kid who has a heart of gold, while Linda Hamilton has undergone a complete transformation from her victimised waitress in the first film to a muscular, lean killing machine herself. Robert Patrick helped to carve himself a niche for playing evil psychopaths, and his slim figure goes well with the morphing capabilities he possesses - he looks like a match for Arnie. But it's our friend Schwarzenegger who steals the film, starting out as a cold, calculating machine and in the end sacrificing himself for mankind. That this finale had me bursting into tears on more than one occasion shows just how good Arnie is in it. He's funny, heroic, likable and consistently impressive - what more could you want? Other familiar faces fill out the supporting cast, with the likes of Xander Berkeley and Earl Boen (returning from the first film) in minor roles.<br/><br/>The violence isn't skirted, either...lots of people get impaled by the T-1000's knife-arms, plenty of men get shot in the knees (ouch), Arnie even cuts the skin off his own arm at one point. But this is primarily an action film, and should be treated as such. Every scene is flawlessly composed, with some little neat ideas thrown in almost everywhere - everything is portrayed coolly and stylishly, especially where Arnie is concerned. He really is the king of cool here - from the flick as he puts on his sunglasses to the shotgunning open of locked gates in split seconds to his final catchphrases - ""Hasta la Vista baby"" and ""I'll be back"" to name but two. And still there's more to praise: a moral behind the story, a suspenseful score, excellent opening titles, no lulls in the film whatsoever, nice photography, crisp editing...the list is, indeed, endless. In my youth, this was my most-watched film, and I can still watch it over without ever becoming bored. A masterpiece, plain and simple, and one of my very favourite films."
"The_Eighth_Passenger","8","2","6","14 November 2009"," Great action but the story doesn't hold up to much scrutiny.
","The Terminator is a personal favourite, it has a perfect blend of action, sci-fi, horror and noir all on a medium budget. After the rise to megastar status of Arnold Schwarzenegger and creator James Cameron becoming the most popular action director of the day a sequel was inevitable. <br/><br/>T2 is essentially a retread of the original, this time with a stronger, smarter and faster machine, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) being sent back to kill 10 year old John Connor (Edward Furlong) and another, a T-800 (Arnie) which has been captured by the future resistance and reprogrammed, being sent back to protect him. Sarah Connor is now in an institute due to trying to blow up the Cyberdyne (the company who will unwittingly cause the end of mankind) factory and in general acting crazy and spouting off about robots from the future.<br/><br/>T2 really shines in the action department. The effects of the liquid metal T-1000 were revolutionary and they look better than similar effects used in Terminator 3 over a decade later. Most scenes are permanently engraved in the public consciousness, iconic in every sense of the word. The bike/truck chase, Cyberdyne break in, they all showcase the perfect blend of CGI and practical effects.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton gives a brilliant performance as Sarah, tortured by the knowledge of an unavoidable future. Cameron has a knack for writing female characters haunted by the memories of the past, as seen in Aliens, and I think Hamilton was deserving of an Oscar nomination, just as Signorney Weaver had gotten 5 years before.<br/><br/>The music is again composed by Brad Fiedel and, like with the original film, it rises above being a generic action film score and also manages to create new themes and motifs not heard in T1. It's a great score in its' own right and the main theme is one of cinema's greatest. <br/><br/>So, the action is mind blowing, the lead performance is touching and the atmosphere and music are top notch. What's not to like? I'll tell you what my problem with T2 is...<br/><br/>In the first film Skynet inadvertently causes John Connor to be conceived, as the man sent back to protect Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese, becomes John's Father. When asked why the machines have bothered with this plan rather than kill John in their time, Kyle answers ""Their defence grid was smashed. We'd won, taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence."" Essentially, in a last ditch attempt to secure their survival Skynet sent back a machine to kill the man who had destroyed them, Connor, before he was ever born. They did not attempt this earlier because Connor was not a messiah, he was just a soldier, albeit a ""great soldier"". Kyle goes on to say, reference the ""Time displacement equipment"" that ""The Terminator had already gone through. Connor sent me intercept and they blew the whole place."" ""How are you supposed to get back?"" he is asked. ""I can't, nobody goes home, nobody else comes through. It's just him and me."" Reese is saying is that there is no way anything else can be sent through time as the time machine has been destroyed. Skynet were desperately grasping at thin air when they sent The Terminator back in the vain hope that it would salvage them. If they had time to plan they would have sent back 100 terminators and made sure the job was done right. Reese leapt in the machine just in time to be transported too.<br/><br/>Reese states that only living human tissue can pass through the machine, The Terminator is a metal endoskeleton but the flesh around it allows it through. This explains why Skynet sent Arnie and not one of those Hunter Killers we see in the 'future flashbacks'. This is conveniently forgotten in T2 as the T-1000 has no living tissue but still makes it through. However, why would it ever be getting sent through in the first place? THE WAR WAS OVER! The humans had won. After Skynet sent back Arnie in T1 the time machine was destroyed. They would not be sending back another machine to kill John Connor because they had been defeated. If Skynet was gonna send something back again, why not send 1000 Hunter Killers to make sure the job is done properly? Once you start asking questions you realise that T2 falls apart quickly and is really nothing more than an unnecessary, nonsensical sequel.<br/><br/>Another problem I have is with is Arnie himself. Since T1 he had become a huge star, hence the T-800 being reprogrammed by the resistance to give Arnie more screen time by partnering him up with the good guys. On many occasions during the film he is used for grating comedic effect (""I need a vacation""). The relationship between him and Connor as he becomes a father figure to the boy is well played out but for every great moment there is a groan moment. T3 and its' director Johnathan Mostow get trashed for turning the character into a joke but the groundwork was laid out here by Cameron. In the first film The Terminator dons sunglasses to cover a damaged eye socket. In T2, he puts them on for no reason other than to look cool, poses and then rides off on a motorcycle while Bad To The Bone blares on the soundtrack. It is silly, unnecessary and sets the tone for a machine that isn't to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>T2 is a highly entertaining action film but as a sequel to a sci-fi classic it is a letdown due to its' complete lack of respect for the rules laid down in the original. I recommend it and I do enjoy it but it is not the untouchable classic it is touted as and certainly doesn't hold a candle to its predecessor."
"lee_eisenberg","7","2","6","17 October 2005"," Here's why it outdoes the original:
","You see, the first ""Terminator"" had someone protecting Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), and she depended on him. In ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", Sarah goes all bad-ass to protect her son John (Edward Furlong, in an impressive debut). Oh, and of course there's the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) battling the villainous T-1000 (Robert Patrick), sent back in time to kill John.<br/><br/>Okay, so ""T2"" goes a little overboard on special effects, but it does manage to have a plot. The threat of a nuclear holocaust is always unnerving. Obviously, sending someone back in time to change history violates the paradox of time travel (meaning that if you change the past, then the future will be completely different, so there would be no incentive to change the past to begin with), but this is a pretty good movie, as action flicks go. Among other things, it shows that when Ah-nuld tries, he can act."

The sequel, according to Linda Hamilton's Wikipedia page is scheduled for 2021.<br/><br/>As I watched T:2 over the weekend, I noticed something rather odd about the T-1000. When he was shot, blown up, and later melted in a pool of molten steel, it was evident that he had no wiring or electrical components.<br/><br/>If he was truly a robot, cyborg, or android, then he would have had to have these components in order to function. Even in the end of the movie when his body was blasted open with a grenade launcher and his insides were exposed, there was no wiring or electrical components. This factor combined with his abilities to shape-shift and regenerate leads me to believe that this was no ordinary robot.<br/><br/>The T-1000's extraordinary composition and abilities lead me to believe that he was an alien and not a robot.<br/><br/>I believe that the 2021 sequel to T:2 should explore the possibilities of alien involvement in the creation of Skynet, and in the operations of Skynet, in the ""Terminator"" universe."

In the movie, the robot comes from future to save the boy. This cannot be happened in the real world, but this action based on thought that do everything to change the future. The first time I watched this movie was my childhood, so I could have not understand those past-future changes. However, the more older I become, I come to consider this idea. By the way,this film focuses on the bond of human and robot, too. The boy grows with robot, undergoing many troubles. And I see the good point and bad point from this. If we keep on developing robot, it will take charge. But if we contact with robot with heart, they reply. So this movie describes double meaning of the robot."

The special effects are good. I hope many more of this films will come in the next further. part one wash great but part two is my favorite. Also the attraction in universal studios is amazing. It's is so cool that it really feels like you're in the movie. Terminator 2 gets 5 stars from me!

","This 1991 sequel to ""The Terminator"" from 1984, is almost as good as the first movie. Almost.<br/><br/>Director James Cameron went in a somewhat very deviant direction with this sequel movie. And in my opinion he strayed a bit too much from the original storyline. Sure it was cool to see the T-1000 cyborg and its liquid metal ability, but at the same time having the T-800 model sent back to protect Sarah Connor's child was an odd twist of events for me.<br/><br/>That being said, I am not saying that ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a bad or poor movie, far from it. Because this movie is action-packed and fast paced from start to end. I just personally didn't like the switch of roles all too keenly.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their roles quite well, carrying on from the original movie. I can't claim to be overly much a fan of Edward Furlong, so in my opinion he wasn't the best of choices for the role. Robert Patrick, however, he was really well-cast for the role of the T-1000.<br/><br/>The effects in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" were quite good, and the effects with the T-1000 were rather groundbreaking back then in 1991. And the special effects really helped the movie along quite nicely, because they added a level of believability to the movie.<br/><br/>All in all then ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is an entertaining action movie. I just didn't find it fully as entertaining as the first movie. But still well-worth a watch."
"shawnsmith_118","10","1","2","15 September 2015"," One of the best action movies ever!
","T2 is without a doubt one of (or possibly the best) action movies of all time.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to play the role of the T-800. He not only nails the mannerisms of playing a cyborg, but he also adds a human element to the role. He learns and becomes almost a father figure to John Connor. Robert Patrick as the T-1000 is one of the most bad ass movie villains of all time. The special effects and action sequences still hold up well after 24 years.<br/><br/>James Cameron knows how to direct a blockbuster action flick (also see Aliens). Definitely a must see!"

","After seeing Terminator, i never expected much from the sequel. I'm definitely wrong. That's excellent. Has a great villain, direction, development, and story. <br/><br/>The film is probably much more cool, because T-1000 is definitely a better villain. Cameron directed a very good character development, and Robert Patrick was awesome. I'm surprised with the powers of the villain, the - SPOILER- included. Cameron was great directing this one. The direction sense is great, better than he will show in 'Titanic' and 'Avatar'. Even though, the first film is much more of a dark brutal well-done noir film, this is a fun ride. <br/><br/>The Terminator has 107 minutes and it's sweet to see. T2 is a bit too long, and this can leave the viewer tired, but the action thriller in the development, isn't definitely boring. <br/><br/>The story is a bit predictable, but great overall.

"VamsiDS","9","1","2","15 February 2014"," Film which shows you the value of TEARS
","People say James Cameroon's best film is the titanic, some even say its the ""avatar""(crazy). But the first thing that pops to my head when i hear the word Cameroon is ""The Terminator 2"", which I believe undoubted, is his crowning possession. Sure the whole series is based on a BIG paradox and the movie ignores those that come during its 150 minute runtime unlike ""Back to the Future"" series where everything done seems to have a reciprocal change in the future. But as per Steven Hawking's theory once you travel to the past paradoxes are unavoidable and traveling to the past is impossible. Anyway, I have watched this movie plenty of times when i was a kid. All that was exciting to me then was how the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) takes bullets gets fired and frozen but still forms back again. I am still baffled how a machine could be completely liquid without having a programming chip or CPU or something.<br/><br/>Though the movie is based on a big ""logical loop"" as i call it, you never have the time to think about it as once the movie starts which has great action sequences but what makes this movie remarkable is it circles around 2 basic human aspects <br/><br/>1) A kid's sense of trust (some may call it innocence) &<br/><br/>2) A mother's urge (madness) to protect her child, doesn't matter who is trying to harm.<br/><br/>The story begins with the arrival of both the terminators and us knowing that john's mother (Linda Hamilton) is in a medical institution for attacking the head quarters of cyberdyme (that will invent skynet). So now the poor kid john (Edward Furlong) does no longer believes in anything his mother lectured repeatedly about the war, judgment day & terminators.<br/><br/>Then we have the fight in the mall followed by a chase sequence on the roads which is brilliantly choreographed, it makes perfect use of Arnold Schwarzenegger's (t-800) grace with guns and bikes. Then the boy gets to know about the t-800 and that it has to obey his commands, this starts what i made the movie so good ""the relation between the boy and the stone face"". The boy orders t-800 to come with him to rescue his mom which they succeed (after making the stone face swears not to kill anyone despite it asking ""why?"", ""of course, i am a terminator"").<br/><br/>The director also shows the POV of Sarah (john's mom). A dream which she repeatedly has where she is playing with John but suddenly everything is destroyed, this sort of sets up the tone for her character which she so brilliantly portrays. She wants to have a normal motherhood but she always has the feeling that some form of harm is nearing her son and that it's inevitable.<br/><br/>As the movie proceeds the director does a brilliant job of stringing together some conversations between john and t-800 where the boy talks about his experiences and t-800 quietly listens (but does ask an occasional question ""why do you cry?""). By doing so the director puts us in the position of the terminator he makes us relate directly with the kid and though he gives occasional glimpses of maturity he still is a kid underneath (who else trusts a terminator?). So involuntarily we don't want the kid to be harmed.<br/><br/>Sarah is always suspicious of t-800 and would have terminated him if it weren't for john. But gradually she starts trusting it (its mission rather) when the t-800 is always around the boy listening to all he has to say, doing everything he says without disobeying. She believes that it (stone face) will always be there to protect john (we do too) and that ""in an insane world it was the sanest choice"". <br/><br/>Then there comes arguably the most popular scene in the movie when t-800 shoots with the GE M134 minigun against the cops outside cyberdyme headquarters. Then comes the climax of the movie where t-1000, the chips from the other terminator and Arnold itself are all destroyed. All action sequences are all good and Robert Patrick (the bad terminator) does an incredible job of looking as mean as his co- terminator.<br/><br/>In the end the dialogue ""I need a vacation"" seemed cheeky and unnecessary but ""now I know why you cry but it's something that I can never do"" is flawless. A special must go the background score of the film composed by Brad Fiedel. Funny thing about terminators if their mission fails they become useless and have no reason to exist & if it succeeds they have nothing either. It's now are never for them. I wish humans were that way.<br/><br/>P.S: The way t-1000 shouts and changes into all the humans it has imitated after it falls to its doom ( molten steel) showing as though it could ""feel""""pain"" was totally illogical as if it could then wouldn't it have felt pain each time it hits a wall or is shot at??????"

After callously beating up a group of friends in a bar, stealing their clothes and motorbike he's off to find his mentor John. John who is abnormal, mentally bullies the terminator whilst also teaching him some childish phrases. The relationship takes an unexpected twist with the arrival of a further robot however this one is intent on harming John. Slowly we learn of John's unusual up bringing and we also meet his mother, who is a thin maniac. After several hilarious attempts at John's life both robots begin to see John in a different light leading to a confrontation at some kind of foundry, the terminator sacrificing himself, wrongly seeing himself as responsible for the deaths of John's foster parents. Full marks to both robots for making this a cracking yarn and taking the attention off John who was frankly annoying."
"lawrence_burkey","9","1","2","20 March 2012"," The Best of the Terminator Movies
","Although most think the original is the best, this film is helped by the return of the film's main principal stars: Schwarzenegger himself, Linda Hamilton and director James Cameron.<br/><br/>In addition, Arnold returns as the good guy, rather than the evil creature he was in T1.<br/><br/>The result is a top-level sequel, much more expensive than the original, but nevertheless is far better than anyone had a right to expect.<br/><br/>The basic plot is something of an update on that of the original. This time the target is not the mother but the adolescent son. When the film opens, John Connor (Edward Furlong), is now living with foster parents. His mother Sarah (Hamilton) is confined to a mental institution, knowledge of mankind's future annihalation having driven her nearly insane.<br/><br/>Sent back this time are two cyborgs: one is a T-100 (Schwarzenegger), a Terminator reprogrammed to seek out and protect John Connor. His adversary is the considerably more lethal T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a liquid metal assassin who can blend in with his environment and whose fingers and arms can form lethal stabbing weapons.<br/><br/>In an interesting twist, the script works in the creation of the cyborgs and a bid to avert apocalypse. At the centre of this is a hardworking but naive scientist (Joe Orton) whose research will unwittingly trigger Armageddon. Sarah's attempts to stop him add another layer of tragedy and pathos on to an already interesting script.<br/><br/>The sequel takes the inventive step of creating a family bond between the principal characters. On finding John, the Terminator takes his charge to rescue his mother and together the trio form an touching connection between each other: John the son, Sarah the mother, and the Terminator the watchful surrogate father.<br/><br/>The acting by the principals is once again excellent. Hamilton in particular has really made the effort here. As Sarah Connor, she's become enraged, angry and psychotic, with an impressive muscular physique to boot. Edward Furlong, in an underrated debut, is sympathetic and convincing as her son."

Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator but is now the protector, whistle he is perfect as the 'character' in retrospect the edginess has gone that was set up in the first film.<br/><br/>The film is without a doubt a spectacular defining moment in movie history, notably the CGI effects and make up.

","When I went into watching Terminator 2, I wasn't sure how high my expectations should be. I had read some reviews from other users, and all of them were very positive, and everyone seemed to love this film. I was skeptical, because the whole idea of a cyborg battling another cyborg to save a boy, his mother, and humanity alike simply didn't appeal to me. In all honesty, it sounded like the type of movie you hear characters talking about in a Saturday morning cartoon. The Wachowski Brothers' first Matrix film is one of my all-time favorites, and it was roughly the same genre with a different concept. So naturally, that gave me the incentive to give T2 a chance.<br/><br/>When I watched it, I was blown away. It wasn't your stereotypical one-guy-against-another-guy with humanity's fate on the line film. Yes, it easily qualifies as action-packed, but it also contains an interesting, somewhat complex story. Because of this, everything that happens in the film occurs for a reason. This wasn't made by a director that decided he wanted to throw bigtime action scenes just to get a cheap thrill from the audience *cough Michael Bay ***COUGH COUGH*** Arnold Schwartzenegger (Did I spell that right? Doubt it) plays a very likable, well-developed character as The Terminator. There are a few actors in the history of film-making that are absolutely perfectly-cast for their respective roles (i.e. Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction or Eli Wallach as Tuco in The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly), and I am going to say that Big Arnie has cemented a spot for himself in that league of actors. The only other option to play Terminator that I can fathom would be Jean Claude Van Damme, but even he simply would not be able to supply the same fire as Arnold.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are great supporting actors, and their performances also deserve mention. But as far as supporting actors in the film go, Robert Patrick takes the throne easily. He showed great range as he played the emotionless, cold-hearted cyborg known simply as T-1000.<br/><br/>Overall, this a film with little flaws to talk about. It has great writing, superb acting, a few scattered funny moments, and of course, pulse-pounding action. I would even go out on a limb and place it in a tied position with Fight Club as the greatest ""guy"" film of all time.<br/><br/>""HASTA LA VISTA, BABY!"" -The Terminator"

","Sequels suffer from a problem. They are always made under pressure to keep up to the success of the predecessor. And also, they are scrutinized much more and often compared to the predecessor. The Terminator 2: Judgment Day not only soaks all the pressure but actually creates a movie that stands out its own as one of the best movies ever made in the history of Hollywood. <br/><br/>The role has been reversed. The Terminator i.e. Arnold is no longer the bad guy. He is now a reprogrammed cyborg sent by the human resistance to protect John Conner as he is being stalked by a more advanced cyborg, the T-1000, played by Robert Patrick. And boy oh boy, the T-1000 is great. He can take shapes and is almost invincible. ""Almost"" is the keyword here, of course. The T-1000 is light-weight and hence more athletic. None could play this role better than Robert Patrick. The perfect pleasant yet straight look in his face, his athletic body makes him the ideal T-1000. <br/><br/>The story goes by smoothly leading from one event to another in perfect harmony. The action sequences are extremely convincing. At no point of time, one gets the feeling that there is too much exaggeration and that the movie makers have been carried away in the process of making the action scenes. The chase sequence involving the rescue of John Conner by the Terminator is among the best done scenes ever. <br/><br/>The movie takes one step further. It showcases John Conner developing a strong relationship with the Terminator and this relation is unique in the sense that the other person cannot simply reciprocate it. And it shows Artificial Intelligence trying to reason out human emotions but with not so much success. Arnold does this bit perfectly, mimicking all the various emotions of the people he sees around and also finding the right time to use all the slang that is being taught to him by his boss i.e. John Conner. <br/><br/>The music score adds magic to the movie. As the tension builds up in the movie, the music does everything to convince us the height of the situation. The sound effects also play their role. With a good music system, the movie easily convinces us that indeed a bullet has been shot, a bike has been started and a rod has just pierced the metal skeleton of the cyborg. The one-liner that was made famous in the previous movie does not find some cheap place here but there is a different one-liner altogether that is introduced, well timed and equally cool. <br/><br/>The movie just fails to disappoint. A perfect 10 for this movie. It shall forever be among the best movie of all times for a very long time to come."

","Terminator 2 Judgement Day is by far the greatest movie I, along with many other people, have seen. This movie has what all the first one had and everything it didn't get to. I'm talking about storyline, character development, action scenes, outstanding effects, and a great villain. Even if you didn't like the first Terminator or the 3rd or even the Sarah Connor Chronicles you don't have to worry because this is better than all of them by a long shot.<br/><br/>I won't go into the storyline because you probably already know it. This movie can truly express the life of a 12 year old boy who lived a life he thought was a fantasy brought upon him by his crazy mother. He learns all of what she said was true and it's truly interesting how James Cameron made such a change in him. Also for Sarah how she can except this new terminator model to be around her son and not freak out about it. All of these are great aspects in themselves but what I truly admire is the new terminator villain, the T-1000. He is played near flawlessly by Robert Patrick and truly shows the colors of a cold-blooded killer. This terminator is stronger, faster, smarter, and harder to kill than the Arnold terminator from this movie or the first one and yet Arnold still fights him down. It's incredible how a rated R film can make you pity something like a robot with the potential for killing hundreds of people and yet in the long run saves billions.<br/><br/>My opinion, this movie IS the greatest movie ever told. You have everything you want in a movie right in front of you and it delivers it in high quality. I will say that if you TRULY want to enjoy this movie than you need to watch the first Terminator movie. It will help you understand the storyline in the overall series and have a better appreciation for this movie. This movie is well worth the price to buy along with all the other Terminator movies. However this one is the most superior to them all and all other movies in general."
"andyrookjohnson","10","1","2","30 July 2008"," One the action genre's few true masterpieces
","The Terminator was a great film built around a great concept, but it was constrained by its small B-movie budget, making it look dated today. Terminator 2 expanded on the concept hugely, and for once a massively bigger budget had only a positive effect on the film. The special effects in 1991 were ideal - not too cheap or understated, but also not too overblown or all-encompassing as they usually are today. Because of this, and the enormous attention to detail with which Cameron directed, T2 looks fantastic today and doesn't seem dated at all.<br/><br/>The action scenes are superlative throughout. Essentially, the plot dictates that T2 is essentially an extended chase film - but the plot is complex, convincing and unpredictable, aided by a fantastically deep script where the characters form an unlikely family unit and discuss time, war, fate and parental responsibility amid the gunfire and explosions.<br/><br/>T2 contains an amazing blend of intelligence and visceral thrills which only a tiny number of films have captured as well as this. Satisfying action fans and fans of serious drama and sci-fi, T2 is a masterpiece of action and sci-fi cinema and a timeless classic. Absolutely essential viewing."

Linda Hamilton provides another decent performance as Sarah Connor and Edward Furlong plays John Connor brilliantly to provide some comic relief and Dr. Silberman returns , played by Earl Boen again.

"vip_ebriega","10","1","2","13 July 2008"," Well, he said he'll be back.
","My Take: Highly superior to the original, with revolutionary special effects. <br/><br/>The biggest, most explosive blockbuster of 1991 has finally arrived in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. Packed with non-stop action, explosive special effects, pumped-up heroics and surprisingly great writing, TERMINATOR 2 was and still remains one of the most explosive action pictures in years, far surpassing its somewhat dated 1984 predecessor. When he said he'll be back, he is back. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the emotionless, cold-blooded (or is that no-blooded) cyborg from the violent future, sent back to earth this time as a guardian assigned to protect Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) and his son John (Edward Furlong) against the nearly-unstoppable T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a deadly new machine with self-liquefying properties, and help stop computer genius from starting the deadly futuristic war, Judgment Day.<br/><br/>The film has its share of minuses. Mostly there's Edward Furlong's fairly annoying portrayal of a street-hustling kid. His peace talk with the Terminator about not killing people is quite preachy and forced. But these few missteps are simply forgivable, considering that these are only 5 minutes (or so) worth of a mostly explosive 137 minutes that never lets up. Linda Hamilton's heroine is an improvement over the rather flat character of Sarah Conner from the original film. The new persona of her character is so much better, certainly the toughest butt-kicking female character since Sigourney Weaver's ass-kicking Rambo-with-breasts in ALIENS (also directed James Cameron). The special effects, which were revolutionary at the time, pale in comparison to today's highest achievements in special effects, but the T-1000 is still a triumph in special effects imagery.<br/><br/>Sequels trying to be better than the original aren't actually successful at their attempts, but TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY doesn't just outdo its predecessor, but it still one of the better sequels Hollywood has produced, one that buries deeper to the story planted by the original instead of rehashing it. It's a perfect example of Cameron's accomplished talents.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","Pardon the pun, but Arnold Schwarzneggar is back in his greatest role: The Terminator. But wait  this time he is the hero.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 Judgment Day is one those rare sequels that outshines the original. In the 1984 blockbuster hit, the Terminator goes back in time to 1984 to try and kill the mother of the resistance movement against the machines. It fails as Kyle Reese saves Sarah Connor from certain doom, and fathers the man, Jon Connor.<br/><br/>In Terminator 2, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has gone nuts knowing about the future. She tried to blow up a computer lab to stop Judgment Daythe day when the Computer Skynet takes over all U.S. Defense systems and launches a nuclear attack against the former Soviet Union to start a Nuclear War.<br/><br/>Jon Connor (Edward Furlong) is in foster care, but has been getting into trouble over truancy, shoplifting, and other juvenile offenses. <br/><br/>Then, a new Terminator, a T-1000 comes from the future to assassinate Jon. It is made of liquid metal, can assume the form of almost anyone it touches, and can create stabbing weapons. <br/><br/>Enter the good Terminator (Schwarzeneggar). It goes back to time to protect Jon, rescue Sarah from the mental hospital, and hopefully stop Judgment Day.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 has so much going for it, it is difficult to know where to begin. First is the acting and the characters. This was the part Arnold was born to play. Linda Hamilton plays Sarah with such depth, anger, fear, and desperation, it is stunning. Newcomer Edward Furlong also does an outstanding job as someone who knows too much about the future as well.<br/><br/>A smaller supporting cast member, Joe Morton, plays Miles Dyson who invents Skynet, and he must deal with knowledge of the future. And Robert Patrick, who plays the T-1000 is one of the greatest villains in movie history. His eyes and moves makes up for his lack of lines. And he is the first villain since the alien of Predator that Arnold could not ""beat-up.""<br/><br/>The second strength is the story. There is depth and intrigue. Ironically, Sarah Connor forgets to value human life, whereas the good Terminator learns to respect it. The good Terminator also has keen insight into human nature. At one point, he states ""now I know why you cry.""<br/><br/>A quick kudos has to go towards the special effects of Terminator 2. Aside from the fact they do not distract from the story, they are the best new stuff since the first Star Wars. Most notably was how the T-1000 changed or morphed from one disguise to another.<br/><br/>The final strength is the stellar direction done by James Cameron. While the first Terminator bordered on B movie plot, characters and effects, this one ranks high on cerebral science-fiction like that of Blade Runner. Cameron deftly mixes stunts, action, special effects, story, and depth into one tasty recipe."
"Shinzons","10","1","2","23 June 2008"," A Powerful Sci-Fi Epic. Go Jim Cameron!
","T2 is, in my opinion, the official action film. It has the right amount of action, but for all the action it has it has just as much of its characters and its heart. It doesn't loose sight of its goal that it is also a story, not just a bunch of explosions. And whats pretty interesting is that it isn't overstuffed with CGI, but its funner than most films you will see. The writer director did a masterful job with a film that could have been done so poorly and has been done so masterfully. Terminator 2 is incredible not just because of its spectacle, but because of how much you care for its characters. He said he would be back."

","Terminator II is, to me, nearly flawless. Everything about this movie is just so smooth and well made - it goes hand in hand with the story of the first Terminator and ends it solidly.<br/><br/>As far as the effects go, even now, 16 years later, they are still amazing. I am not kidding. Amazing. If there was no indication of when this film was made other than the effects, people would not be guessing 1991. This film is groundbreaking when it comes to CGI and effects...and the best part is the effects are not overused and tie so well in with the story.<br/><br/>Perhaps the thing that is really, really cool about T2 is that it is a sequel...I don't mean to say all sequels are bad, but there are few that as good if not better than the first.

","LINDA HAMILTON RULES!!!!! THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!! I just love Linda Hamilton's performance in this film. Everything fits perfectly. Cameron is a master! Arnold is back with his line: I'll Be Back! there's no other movie with this kind of list of actors. There is not going to be another movie like this, it has it all; great actors, the best producer and director, the best story, the best script, the best sound, the best picture and of course the best movie music of all time. The greatest thing about this film is LINDA. Non of the actors can do another film like this one. I think I have seen this film a hundred times over. If I had to make a choice witch movie was the greatest, it would be T2."
"MaybeTomorrow","10","1","2","11 January 2007"," Masterpiece
","Perfect example of a sequel being bigger and better than the original. Schwarzenegger's and Cameron's very best film to date. The story is simple: Machines are sent back from the future to terminate/protect John Connor. One to kill and one to protect.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie great is the combination of breathtaking action and stunts, groundbreaking special effects, amazing directing, haunting music (by Brad Fiedel), terrific acting (especially Hamilton) and well written character development. Linda Hamilton delivers a GREAT performance as Sarah Connor, a fighter and a mother who will do anything to protect her son. Robert Patrick still scares me to this day with his emotionless yet evil look. The T-1000 is definitely one of the baddest moviemaniacs of all time.<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies ever.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Torgo_Approves","9","1","2","29 August 2006"," Why can't all blockbusters be as good as this one?
","(r#58)<br/><br/>Mission Impossible III. The Da Vinci Code. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. They all have one thing in common. Not a soul will remember them fifteen years from now.<br/><br/>What is it with the forgettable blockbusters? When you're handed a million dollar budget, why not aim for perfection rather than mediocrity? Why not try to create something brilliant, like Terminator 2? <br/><br/>The original Terminator is an absolute classic. It's the ultimate horrifying thriller, a brilliant science fiction/time travel story, a strikingly plausible, paranoid vision of the future, and features some of the most classic scenes in history. The movie has had such an impact on pop culture and action movies in general, it deserved a sequel that matched its greatness. Trust James Cameron with a $100,000,000 budget to create the most impressive action movie ever made. With the highest movie budget at its time, Cameron didn't need to limit his vision. As a result, T2 is a far more spectacular movie than its predecessor; what it lacks in the intensity, suspense and paranoia of the original, it more than makes up for with its brutal, explosive action sequences, an ingenious script, effects that look convincing to this day, and powerhouse performances from a fantastic cast.<br/><br/>All the regulars have returned from the first movie. Linda Hamilton, who as Sarah Connor evolved from your average damsel in distress to a focused leader in the original Terminator, brings new depth to her character as John Connor's mother, who has now been institutionalized at a mental hospital. Arnold Schwarzenegger, probably *the* movie star of the eighties and nineties, owns every inch of the screen with his performance as the titular character. Earl Boen is funny once again as the pathetic Dr. Silberman. The new cast members include a young Edward Furlong, who makes for a slightly annoying teen-aged John Connor with an extremely nineties' hairdo, Robert Patrick, his menacing screen presence perfect for the role of the T-1000, and Joe Morton as a geeky scientist (whatever happened to that guy, anyway?)<br/><br/>What made James Cameron stand out from the Hollywood league of cookie cutter directors is that he refused to go the safe way and simply make T2 a big-budget rehash of T1. Instead, the focus is on script and story development as much as on stunts and effects. The result is nothing short of popcorn movie perfection. The story is further developed and more complicated than in T1, the characters have more depth, Arnold gets bigger and meaner action scenes and cooler one-liners. The score is heavy and powerful and perfectly sets the tone for the movie. The film is shamelessly bad-ass - who can forget Arnold walking out of the bar as 'Bad to the bone' roars in the background? But it is also surprisingly tender in places and showcases brains and heart as well as violence and suspense. <br/><br/>Some will argue that this movie actually outdoes the original, but I don't know... they both succeed so brilliantly at what they tried to do, but they're so vastly different it's hard to really compare them. Still, you can't beat Arnold tearing Bill Paxton's heart out for calling him an a-hole!<br/><br/>In the end, this is just pure entertainment, and should be viewed by everyone. An action classic if there ever was one. Forget the weak third part (Arnold only did it for the money, anyway), T2 and its predecessor will always be the *true* Terminators!<br/><br/>Hasta la vista, baby!"
"RCWjr","8","1","2","22 May 2006"," T2 did the almost impossible
","T2 equaled the first film in the franchise. A hard thing to do in the modern era of sequels. Especially given the amount of years between the two films and how the franchise was basically reinvented with this installment by having Arnie play the good guy.<br/><br/>This one was less science fiction and more character and action driven. Though the first film was no slouch on the action, this one doesn't have the same feel as the first. But that is good. Fans always want the same, but different. And we sure got it in large doses with T2.<br/><br/>It would be hard pressed to find a second movie in a franchise that is as good as T2. Unfortunately they could not duplicate the same with T3, but at least 2 out of 3 isn't bad."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","8","1","2","27 January 2006"," Overall, an excellent sequel
","Terminator 2 is one of those rare sequels that almost surpasses the original. Ten years after the first movie, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) ends up in a mental institution because of her ravings about the end of the world. Her rebellious son John (Edward Furlong) lives with foster parents. The movie begins the same way as the first with a T-800 (Arnold) coming back in time, except this time Arnold is the good guy assigned to protect John Connor from the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). If this was the plot of the film, I'm sure it wouldn't have been as successful. Cameron was smart enough to make the movie about the mission to prevent Judgment Day, so it gave us something fresh (although some scenes are recycled). <br/><br/>Terminator 2's greatest merit is that it has some of the best action sequences ever filmed. Since Cameron had a much larger budget on this movie, the action scenes are much more impressive than in T1. My favorite one is when Arnold and the T-1000 meet for the first time; the expressions on their faces are so intense! The movie was a breakthrough in CGI effects; The liquid metal scenes are still impressive today. <br/><br/>Plus, Linda Hamilton has much more to work with here than she did in T1, and I commend her for getting into such great shape (she had 1% body fat or something). Patrick, while not as menacing as Arnold, still delivers a chilling performance as the T-1000.<br/><br/>Despite all the praises I can give this film, I still think the first movie is slightly better. First of all, I just did not care for the characters in this film as much as I did in the first. Why? Because the sense of danger in T2 just wasn't as great as it was in T1. This can be attributed to two factors: <br/><br/>1. Arnold was a scarier villain than Robert Patrick, which probably has more to do with his size rather than his acting ability. Arnold was a predator; Kyle and Sarah were in constant danger. It also has to do with the fact that the T-1000 disappears for about 30-40 minutes in the middle. The Terminator's feeling of desperation was all but absent in the sequel. <br/><br/>2. The T-800 and the T-1000 seemed pretty evenly matched up until the last twenty minutes of the movie. As a result, it feels like John and Sarah's chances of success are pretty good. In the first movie, it felt like Reese and Sarah had no chance of defeating the Terminator, which really helped build up the suspense. In T2, John and Sarah have a nearly invincible hero on their side; the audience knows that no matter how many bullets hit him, he won't get hurt. The appeal of the action in this film is more about Arnold kicking ass and special effects, not fear. The movie does not lack suspense entirely though, it's still very exciting.<br/><br/>The Terminator was also better paced than T2. (SPOILERS) After the Terminator and John free Sarah from the mental hospital, the movie just shuts down for a little bit too long. <br/><br/>My only other criticism is the corny friendship between the Terminator and John Connor. Edward Furlong's performance isn't very good, which can partially be attributed to some stupid lines. This might sound shallow, but even his voice got on my nerves after a while. He is tolerable most of the time though. In my opinion, the love story in the first film was more touching and dramatically satisfying. <br/><br/>Still, T2 is a thrill ride that is necessary for any fan of action flicks."

","I loved the original Terminator and putt it up there with the best films ever, and although its not number one it comes in close and is number one in best action films. Terminator 2 Judgment Day is not half the movie in almost all ways the only place it even comes close to the original is the visual effects, and it surpasses it. Terminator 2 Judgment Day has a lot more action and a lot less story, the plot is very flawed and it is made even worse by the wooden dialogue and the bad characters. The acting is just horrible, Arnold Schwarzenegger or however you spell it is just horrible. as is Linda Hamilton. The kid is okay but can't save the film. The direction is very good, but Cameron has done much better before with Titanic and the original Terminator. The visual effects are amazing for the time and good for today although at moments it is very easy to tell when somethings fake. Just watch the original and than if you like it this may be worth looking into."

","Sorry about my corny joke, but I must say: This is a great film.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what else to say. The storyline, acting, action, and special effects and everything else are great! Arnold Schwarzenegger plays The Terminator, a machine sent back in time to protect Edward Furlong, who plays John Connor, a ""bad boy"" who is supposed to be the leader of the human race in a future war. The T-1000 is the villain in this movie. He is sent to kill John Connor. Obviously, he's not rooting for the home team.<br/><br/>The T-1000 is an advanced Terminator. He can change shape and is made of liquid metal. That means if you shoot him, it will be like shooting water, except the water won't shoot you back. Plus, if he kills a person, he takes their shape. Isn't that like ""The Thing""? Gee, I wish we had technology like that.<br/><br/>The movie is full of action scenes. There are lots of ""shoot-em-up"" scenes and car chases. While most of it is those ""shoot-em-up"" sequences, I prefer the elevator scene, where the T-1000 is attacking John Connor and his mom. (Great scene.) Terminator 2 may be one of the greatest sci-fi films I have ever seen. It's that good! I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's just fun! Solid action, solid acting, solid heroes, and a solid villain (although he is liquid), solid storyline, and mostly everything else makes up Terminator 2: Judgment day. It will not fail to entertain.<br/><br/>8/10"
"bernie369","7","1","2","8 October 2005"," An exclusive exception,
","T2 is member of a very exclusive club. The club of the movies, which are prequels but better than its original. Some people would say now it isn't very hard to outclass some stuff like: ""Sarah Connor?"" ""Yes!?"" *shoots her* <br/><br/>Well, to speak the truth, if you don't like the idea of a good action movie with an excellent story, you shouldn't watch this movie. In my opinion this movie is overvalued. But why? I think it's because most of us who have seen the movie, did that when we were younger. I can speak just for myself but, I don't think that I would liked it that much, when I wouldn't have been 14 or 15 years old.<br/><br/>I think you shouldn't watch T2 just to have it seen. Some people often argues that there are films which should be watched by all means, but I'm not that type of guy.<br/><br/>What also makes T2 worth-watching? First of all you should have watched the first part, because you'll get a better picture of the whole story. Compared with the first part the story is extended with some new and interesting characters and of course the special effects are excellent. Of course special effects are taken for granted nowadays, but these were extremely good for 1991.<br/><br/>So I dedicate it to you, if you'll watch this movie. My personal opinion is that this movie is a far cry from being an inferior sequel."

Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor, John's mother. The film has lots of action and is certainly not going to put anybody to sleep!

","This terminator movie is the big one of the three; by big I mean the longest one, the one that was the epic blockbuster.  I like all three the same though.  This one is the biggest of the bunch and has many great special effects; this one also though has a couple of boring spots in it.  The other two have better flow while this one stops here and there.  Still though there are great action scenes, though nothing as good as the chase in part three.  It also has a cool villain in the T-1000, a terminator that was very tough to kill.  I say it was a lot more durable than the T-X in part three even if it couldn't do some of the stuff it could.  Arnold is of course great in the one role that is perfect for him and Linda Hamilton is good as well.  Furlong is okay, but he can get on your nerves so I am glad he didn't come back for part three.  This one has it all and is the grandest of the bunch as far as scope, Cameron was trying for a big budget, and big event movie and he succeeded."

","James Cameron's Sequel to his original ground breaking science fiction epic is not only a ground breaking achievement in special effects but is a compelling look at the danger of greed and the abuse of technology. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator and is a good guy this time around protecting a young John Connor from a more advance-killing machine named the T-1000 played with deadly precession by Robert Patrick. Linda Hamilton returns as Sara Connor, and has been preparing her son for the future war to come. Her performance is a great continuation of the character she played in the first movie, and she has been through the ringer for her knowledge of what's to come.  The special effects are ground breaking, and they do hold up well over time, maybe because they were done with a sense class, and not overly done like the movies we have coming out now.  It's rare that a sequel could be better than the original in every way, but this is a prime example of that fact.<br/><br/>A true science fiction classic."

","Let´s face it. This movie is packed with some of the greatest action scenes around, but that´s really about it. Actually, Terminator II is nothing more than a 2 / 2.5 hours chain of action scenes and so-called cool one-liners. This movie will probably appeal most to adolescents, since they´re the ones who are likely to really appreciate this kind of movie. The message, if any, is one of taking notice of and watching out for expanding technology. This is all very obvious, and, since this is a movie aimed at younger people, therefor a good thing.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you want to spend a evening watching mindless, not-so-hard violence enjoying some of the best computer powered action scenes ever seen in a movie, rent this one. It´s a must-see! If you want to see a movie with a more significant, meaningful storyline, don´t.

","Like many films of the late 80s & early 90s, Terminator 2 attempts to transform an older version of masculinity - muscled, silent, authoritative, alone - into a new more palatable version that still retains the most important (for patriarchy) principles of the original, but that is more difficult to attack.  The new version is communicative, nurturing, sensitive and wise, where the old version was silent, authoritative and alone.  Both versions retain their focus on the importance of physical strength, size, independence, confidence and authority.<br/><br/>Thus, the silent Terminator of the first movie becomes more communicative, his language developing and adapting in the interactions with his adoptive 'son'.  He develops a sense of humour.  He has the ability to learn.  The problem with all this is that the basic principles of superior male strength, authority and ability remain in place.  Sarah Connor is so busy trying to protect John she has no time to be a mother to him, and this desire to protect is inscribed in an animalistic, instinctual and shrill form that denies any intellectual or spiritual bond with her son.  Of course her attempts to protect John put her into direct competition with the Terminator, a competition she can never win given her obviously 'inferior' weaker female body.  As a result, the Terminator takes on a maternal as well as a paternal role to John, Sarah having disqualified herself, and relinquished her parental duties to the Terminator as she heads off on a suicide mission. The new masculinity has all bases covered, all gender, sexuality, race and class divisions still in place, and everyone's just as oppressed as they were before white heterosexual male got sensitive.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie sucks.  You guys should try and see past the special effects to the politics that inform the choices the director and the actors make.  This is important."

","If entertainment is rated in terms of value for money then I fail to see what other film measures up in terms of the old adage ""what you see is what you get!"" The closest would be Jim Cameron's ALIENS no doubt!<br/><br/>Not necessarily ""better"" than the original, which after all blew the limits of originality and innovation back in '84 with one twentieth of the budget, but it is certainly gynormous in scope and even depth. It does not stand up to logical penetrative analysis, because you can quite easily reason that none of it is theoretically possible. My suggestion is therefore that you simply don't bother, just watch the thing for what it is. An action-filled canvas of implausible but gut-wrenchingly involving sci-fi.<br/><br/>This time around (and contrary to the original script) Schwarzenegger portrays the Terminator sent back to protect John Connors against the virtually indestructible T-1000, played menacingly by Robert Patrick. His gradual assimilation of human characteristics and emotions is particularly well handled especially at the film's conclusion, when he must self-destruct in the molten metal at the steel foundry. It is one of Schwarzenegger's most touching seconds of screen time in any film!<br/><br/>When you realise that Kubrick's hugely disappointing EYES WIDE SHUT cost not much less than T2, you can begin to realise how well the money was spent here. The second sequel planned for later this year is unlikely to be in the same ball-park as this one-off kick-ass movie!"

The original Terminator film is an all time classic and one of Schwarzenegger's best alongside ""Predator"" and ""Total Recall"".<br/><br/>The actual original idea behind ""Terminator"" is wrong in any case.John Connor could not have a father from the future, it is impossible. Firstly, the machines would not need to strike at Sarah in 1984 because they would have won because John Connor would not exist seeing as though his father, Kyle Reece would be also fighting in the future. Regardless of this fault, The Terminator outclasses the sequel and Arnie is perfect for the role as the seemingly indestructable cyborg. If you wanna see great effects then I recommend this movie but dont expect a great storyline because you wont get it.<br/><br/>
Not bad.  Rating 5/10."

","Let me level with you,Terminator was one of the greatest action flicks ever,a mysterious storyline,great cast,and has two essential elements, a believeable hero (Kyle Reese),and a unrelenting villain (Terminator). Where the 1st shines the 2nd falls short, (SPOILER,if you haven't seen yet,don't read on!) the hero is the original Terminator,who isn't really a human,so can't be identified with,and the villain is the T-1000, a shape shifter,unrelenting,but not as good as Arny in the 1st, Robert Patrick is a great actor,but this isn't his role. The 2nd does do a better job of developing characters,but doesn't deliver the terror or excitement the 1st did. The visual effects are better,but compare Alien,Aliens,and Alien 3,the first two are hailed as some of the best,while the 3rd is one of the worst,although having beautiful effects,reason,lack of the terror and suspense the first had. Sarah Conner in the 1st was a woman,in the 2nd,she's a she-man from hell. I loved T2 when I was younger,but as I grew older,I appreciated that the 1st had a mysterious plot,I didn't want to know everything that happened, I wanted what happened now to happen now. Here's to hoping that the 3rd in the series is more moody and back to the original formula."

","Not many films beat their predecessors, but Terminator 2 did that and more. I would say that the character development was deeper, and the characters were portrayed better, as we got to know the terminator better, we were introduced to John Connor (who was portrayed brilliantly by Ed furlong), and we got to see the now mental Sarah Connor. The story was great, there will not be many better. I admit that I love most of Arnold Schwarzenegger films, they always bring so much excitement and action, and this was just another to add to the collection."

"Lord Tal","Null","1","2","27 October 2000"," Disappointing (may contain spoilers)
","This film is a sequel, and therefore has to be measured against the original.  In this films case, it should never have been made.  Why ?. Simple, first of all the entire premise of this film.  Arnie was sent back in the first film, he is a T-101, and no other T-101 looks like him. After all, imagine an infiltration unit, and they all look the same.  Skynet is not stupid, it would not produce such a machine and then make them all look the same, the first film shows that in the scene where a T-101 infiltrates the Resistance underground base, that T-101 is not Arnie, therefore, in order for Arnie to play the role of the T-101 in this film, it has to be the exact same Terminator sent back in the original film, which means that the T-101 Arnie in the future, before being sent back to 1984, has to be captured and re-programmed to be sent back in the second film BEFORE he is sent back in the first film, which in turn means he cant be sent back in the first film, Reece is not the father of John Conner, and Sarah Conners' life follows its original path, which means that the T-1000 is not sent back in time, which means that Arnie is not sent back in the second film either, leading to no films what so ever!!!.  Due to all this, Arnie should not have been in this film in the first place. This massive piece of overlooked common sense that Cameron, in his hasty effort at making the (then) most expensive film ever, leads to this film falling at the first step. Onto the film itself, i like the way Sarah Conners' charactor has developed, the torture of being stuck in a psycho hospital, knowing that in a few years the human race would be at the brink of extinction and her attempts to train her son et al.  Which leads me to Edward Furlong.  What can i say about John that hasnt already been said.  The most high pitched, whiney irritating little kid charactor in the same league as Macauly Culkin, or whatever his name is, of Home Alone fame.  Thankfully, he has redeemed himself with his excellent performance in American History X. Next up, the miracle that is Arnie in this film. A Terminator. Smiling. Now, i know this film is supposed to be far more ""human"" than the first film, but come on Cameron!, this is stupid ! ! !. A Terminator who takes centuries in making decisions.  For example, near the end, when the T-1000 has just been frozen, and begins to defrease, how long does Arnie take to start moving ? An age, thats how long. Ok, you can understand Johns reaction to this, but a T-101's? And then of course, theres the old ""sunglasses"" right at the beginning. The reason the T-101 in the first film puts on black sunglassess is because he has only one ""human"" seeming eye, but in this film, hes' just trying to look cool.  A machine (sentient though it is), making a fashion statement. Along to the T-1000.  Robert Patrick was probably the major redeeming factor, however implausible (if he can retain clothing after it being burnt of him, frozen and blasted to bits, et al, how come he cant come through time with clothes on ?), was excellent.  OK, no where near as good as Arnie, and special effects are no match for the sheer intimadation factor of Arnie in T1, but nonetheless, all things considered, he did a very good job, considering that he wasnt in the film for half its running time as the good guys galavanted around doing there thing. Which brings me to the absolutely ludicrous act of destroying cyberdyne.<br/><br/>James, lets just go through this: Cyberdyne creates Skynet, Skynet trashes humans, humans fight Skynet, Skynet loses, Skynet sends T-101 back in the first film, it fails, Skynet sends T-1000 back in T2, it fails.  Hold on a second, if Cyberdyne is destroyed in T2, then Skynet is not created, Skynet cannot trash humans cause it doesnt exist. Therefore, T-101 is not sent back, T-1000 is not sent back, Terminator does not happen, niether does T2. Now, some of you can say, i am looking way to deep into films, but i dont think so, its just common sence, without cyberdyne creating skynet, Judgement day does not occur ! ! !. What was the point in these films ? ! ! !. So, lets finish this, as an action film, 8-10, as a sequel, even c****er than M:I2, 0-10."

","I was really looking forward to this movie when it first came out. The first Terminator was and remains an absolute classic. A sequel promised more of the same with cutting edge effects, it should have been awesome. Instead, what we got was a fuzzy, cuddly terminator sent back to protect a masculine Sarah Conner and her unbelievably bratty son from the T1000 which was the only thing worth watching in this huge disappointment. The special effects WERE brilliant, I still love the sequence when the T1000 comes up through the floor but everything else about this bloated mess was over the top. Instead of the cold killer from the first movie, Arnie is almost human; certainly more so than the miserable portrayal Linda Hamilton gave. It's easy to see where Lena Headey got her inspiration from for her awful portrayal of the character. Also, are we seriously expected to believe that the nauseating, thieving little toe-rag played so badly by Edward Furlong could possibly grow up to be the saviour of humanity? Add to that the cheesy dialogue and all the silly one liners, catchphrases and explosions and what you are left with is nothing more than a Disney style movie with Michael Bay delusions. I gave this movie four and that was for the special effects, otherwise I would have given it a 1. It's a pity IMDb don't allow us to vote turkey, because this film deserved one."

The first movie was bad enough, and it served as an excuse for bullies to try to invite people over and try to force them to watch it. I'm not sure what they get out of it. I just know they do it. The films are horribly written movies about machines coming back from the future to destroy a guy who is supposed to be all that and a box of cracker jacks. He isn't. In this movie, he's a brat to beat all brats, even for a kid. You just hope he gets killed and the movie ends. None of the characters are likable. The idea of time travel to change the future could be done better than in this movie series by a two year old kid. There's a lot of noise that passes for action, but the action is shot in such a way that you don't really know what's going on. This is how not to make a movie.

"tomsters","5","3","13","30 July 2017"," predictable and clichéd
","mediocre sequel. question; who's fault is that? answer; its the audience and the producers who want to make money from them more then to entertain them with originality and entertainment. this was more of a remake than a sequel. while i'm in the audience, i kept hearing the neanderthals either complaining certain stunts weren't repeated or cheering when stunts were repeated. so when you cater to the lowest common denominator, you cant make art, you only make a two hour commercial. the first was fairly original with a somewhat clichéd ending. the time travel part was cool but its not that hard to keep to the rules of science of physics. movies are crap when obvious rules are broken and sequels are worse when they ignore their own history. IE, flesh or flesh covered only, so how did the liquid robot pass through the time portal? the over used cliché of the doctor not believing the patient. that scene should have been first, t2 lands outside the hospital, rescues Sara, shocks the doc who was berating her about t2 and we all laugh. then together they find the punk kid who is to save the world. the ending narrative was good about its all new, creating a new time line without a paradox. that is until the sequels ruined that and got more commercially stupid. i do so hope the franchise ends with Sara Connor riding her scooter to work as the last scene of the last movie as the time paradox closes around them. why? because they couldn't come up with a better idea than the tired one of technology from our own future. how does that ever work? we are not smart enough now to invent what we did in the future so it couldn't ever exist then. does that mean Einstein ensured are technological history by sending the wheel back in time to the neanderthals such as the ones cheering in this audience? why do movie makers think we are stupid and/or don't care that we can actually understand more than a grade 3 level of logic. maybe pandering to the lower classes makes money, but so does being original or t1 wouldn't have been so successful and then there wouldn't be any sequels. as with many badly thought out sequels, the performances were good. its not their fault what lines were given to them. if not for the acting, i would have walked out of the theater. the sfx and action were good, except for the truck jumping into the canal and still keeps going and then is able to out accelerate a very agile dirt bike. maybe the truck should have been part of the liquid robot too."

"Christopher_Reid","10","2","8","20 January 2018"," The definitive action movie
","I grew up with Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Few movies come close to it in terms of style, action and a story and characters that immediately capture your imagination and take you along for the ride.<br/><br/>Re-visiting it, one of the major things which stood out was the complete lack of establishing shots. Practically every movie ever made has at least 10 to 20 establishing shots but T2 has none. Every shot is straight into telling part of the story. It's incredibly focused. I'd say more than 95% of the shots have a person in them. As Chuck Palahniuk once said in an interview about his novel Fight Club, he puts more emphasis on verbs than adjectives. This is a movie of verbs, not adjectives. It's masculine, about function rather than fashion, about movement, about weapons and vehicles, about having specific goals and then achieving them by any means.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, the T-1000 consistently has better vehicles while the T-800 has better guns. It's an interesting imbalance that makes things more exciting. Both terminators are extremely efficient. They waste no time or energy. They know each-other's weaknesses and strengths. They know exactly how to use any vehicle or gun they come across. The T-1000 expertly operates a helicopter and large trucks, the T-800 rides a motorbike while reloading a shotgun with one hand, uses a mini-gun and repairs a car.<br/><br/>The direction is second-to-none in the action genre. The relative positions of characters and objects is always clear. We feel the speed at all times. None of the camera-work is flashy but it's right there among the action. Things are mostly done for real, there are many stunts and probably miniatures as well but they seamlessly mix in. Shots are no longer or shorter than they need to be to help us understand what's happening and feel every impact and beat of the action.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is the relationship between John Connor and the terminator assigned to protect his life. The T-800 becomes a father figure to John who's never met his real father (but will in the future without realising it, that's time travel for you). John teaches him how to speak more like a normal person. The T-800 learns quickly. ""No problemo.""<br/><br/>Terminator 2 asks some interesting questions about fate and trying to change the future. Along with the original, it's the best movie in the genre of ""robots taking over the world in the future"". Is it morally sound to murder someone for their future crimes or devastation that will take place because of their actions? The answer isn't simple. It has similarities to Minority Report in this area.<br/><br/>The tone is dark at times and sometimes I feel this is a flaw. But it also makes it more unique. Movies should explore different human emotions and at one point or another we have to face the reality of nuclear weapons and the potential for self-destruction. It's terrifying but T2 is about hope in the face of this. It's tragic what Sarah Connor has been through and has to live with, being the only one knowing about such a deadly future. Miles Dyson is also a tragic figure, a father and husband who is completely unaware of the massive risks his work entails.<br/><br/>The performances are very good. Linda Hamilton is intense as Sarah Connor. We understand when she tells off her son for saving her - she puts mankind's future ahead of her own life and that means John's life is sacred and can't be risked. Arnold Schwarzenegger is stoic but becomes more human as the movie progresses. A bit like how dogs may learn to ""emote"" to interact with their human owners, the T-800 seems to gradually understand how human emotions work and respond to them. There are nice details like reloading his weapon when speaking to John, staying up at night to keep an eye out for danger and scanning areas with his eyes - he is always in character, always doing the maximum possible to protect John.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick is calm and ominous as the T-1000. He gives a cold smile a couple of times but comes across as inhuman. He is scarier in many ways than the terminator in the original because his own body can become long, stabbing blades. He doesn't hesitate to kill in cold blood and to imitate people in order to get access to places. Edward Furlong is excellent as child acting goes. He's independent but sad. He's learned to hate his mother, thinking she lied to him. He doesn't like his foster parents or at least hasn't formed close relationships with them - ""she's not my mother, Todd"" (blatantly refusing to call him Dad).<br/><br/>The special effects pushed the boundaries of what was possible at the time and they're integrated into the rest of the movie really well. The movie is full of iconic, memorable shots, action sequences and lines. The T-800 is ""bad to the bone"" with his leather clothes, boots, motorbike, shotgun and sunglasses. And the T-1000 is sleek and intimidating in his fake police uniform. As he slides through bars, the only thing which isn't liquid is the gun which he slightly tilts to bring through. There are too many great moments to name and they often come in a flurry at the best parts.<br/><br/>T2 is what gets me excited about movies in general. It's the peak of what's possible in an action film. And on top of that, it has some mature themes, thought-provoking sci-fi ideas and good dramatic performances. It makes it all look so easy. I liked it as a kid but only now has it hit me how epic and one-of-a-kind it truly is. Unbeaten for 26 years and counting..."

"amillerz3","6","2","8","5 July 2012"," Entertaining, but features James Cameron's traditional foul-ups
","You probably already know the plot of this movie, so I'll get right into my review. As a standard sci-fi movie (not as a sequel), this is fine. It is entertaining, it has a decent plot, it has good effects, and it has some great action set pieces. However, there are several problems I have with this movie, and most of them tie back to the director, James Cameron. First of all, the editing techniques that he is so famous for really irritate me. He often shows 5 or 6 different angles of the same explosion over and over and over again. Why do we need to continue to see this explosion 5 times. Just move on with it. Additionally, this film is the epitome of over-used slow-motion. Every action scene has it, and slo-mo is one thing that, unless it has a metaphorical purpose (like in Inception), is really unnecessary and annoying. I understand that these techniques are used to make the film look cooler, but it really doesn't in my opinion. It just makes it worse and more irritating to watch. <br/><br/>I truthfully believe that James Cameron is an excellent visceral director. He knows how to establish a visual and milk it until the last drop of awesomeness. However, being good with visuals doesn't mean that you are good at anything else. That is the second problem I have with this movie. Most things involved with a movie are for the visceral aspect, but there are two things that aren't: writing and acting. The writing of this movie wasn't bad. It could've been better (and certainly more original, which I'll get to later). But the acting is another story. Linda Hamilton was okay as the crazy action lady. Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't really have to act. He had to be a robot, which was exactly what he was. The kid, however, was horrible. This was his first movie, and he needed direction, which he could not get from Cameron. In fact, I disliked the kid so much that whenever he cried, especially in the end, I didn't care at all. In fact, I actually welcomed Schwarzenegger's death. Cameron, as I said, is a great visceral director, but he cannot direct an actor (or actress). <br/><br/>Finally, this film was very, very, very similar to the original. Almost unoriginal, in a way. It didn't really expand on the first one. The Schwarzenegger character is sent back to protect them, and Robert Patrick's T-1000 is sent to kill them, just like in the first (except in the first, Schwarzenegger was sent to kill them). It was also very predictable. As soon as the Liquid Nitrogen truck appeared, I called the ending. Then, when I saw that there were still 20 minutes left, I saw the rest of the movie coming. <br/><br/>The only reason I gave this movie a 6 is because it was fun. The action sequences were very well directed, but everything else was either meh or just bad, and most of the blame lies with the director."
"walta_burge","5","2","8","18 February 2010"," terminator 2 judgment day
","Well, what can I say... James Cameron has done it again, with a brilliant photographic display, as usual. The plot however, is very derivative of Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Butter Bean"", from 1965, which also incorporates the machine-vs-human element. All that aside, this film is a lot of fun to watch. The scene where John Voight throws the noodles across as a weapon in the Asian restaurant and wipes out 5 Asian impostors is a classic, and should not be missed. Arnold's pick-up lines when he goes into Hooters, such as ""Where is the manager?"" and ""You can hold my gun anytime bitch"" are both misogynistic and hilarious at the same time. Other than that, the plot lacks direction, the special effects are superb, but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. The final quote - ""We are who we say we aren't, and everything else is a monstrous pig"" doesn't make any sense at all, especially when Sarah Connor is quoting that against the backdrop of a naked Timothy Dalton fading in the background in flames. Much fun to watch though with a large bag of popcorn."
"SilkTork","6","2","8","29 July 2003"," This is the Walt Disney Version of Terminator
","If you've seen The Terminator, then you've already seen Terminator 2. Same plot line, same scenes, even the same lines crop up - the only difference is that this time there's a cute kid, and the cute kid insists on there being no deaths. Instead of the terminator blasting away at everyone in sight, he shoots them in the leg! The first film was original, shocking, disturbing and carried a powerful emotional charge. The dream of Kyle Reese, the man sent to protect Sarah Connor, is powerfully disturbing - a vision of the future in which mankind is being hunted to extinction, yet manages to just about hold on. In Terminator 2 we have the same scene - this  time it is Sarah Connor dreaming, and her dream is a clichéd one: the atom bomb dropping. A vision we long ago became familiar with and so holds no resonance at all. That lack of imagination and originality runs throughout this tired film. The fight in the first film was between a passionate human being (a man who feels pain, fear and love) and a remorseless cyborg. The end, in which a human uses cunning and ingenuity to destroy the machine, and uses another machine to do that, is satisfactory. In this limp re-make it is cyborg versus cyborg, and humans are on the side-lines. We are not engaged - indeed, it is like watching a computer game: empty and meaningless."

At best, this film should be considered a ""B"" movie.<br/><br/>Regardless of the success of his films, James Cameron is ones of the most juvenile and transparent directors working today. If any other director had used ""Bad to the Bone"" to ""illustrate"" the ""badness"" of a character they would have been vilified. If fact, every other director who used ""Bad to the Bone"" in this manner >before< James Cameron used it were vilified.<br/><br/>The script varies from juvenile to insipid. In cases where the screenwriters (Cameron and Wisher) couldn't figure out how to work in key information within the overall narrative, they bring to whole film to a dead stop several times by having characters reel off flat monologs detailing another characters motivation and history. Yawn.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of this film are the effects work by ILM and other contractors. Oh, and the casting of S. Epatha Merkeson who seems to be the only actor of skill in the film."

","T2 is not only one of the best movies ever made but also one of the only movie sequels to be superior to the original with an amazing script a great director and the perfect cast its a movie that's on every top 10 action movie list.<br/><br/>The movie takes place 11 years years after the first movie Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now locked up in an institution because of her story's about what will happen in the future and talk of killer cyborgs and her son John Connor (Edward Furlong) being in danger without her John now living in a foster home now believes everything she told him was a lie and struggles to live a normal life getting into trouble with police and acting out but the danger Sarah warned him about is back and a Terminator has come back in time to kill John and Sarah can't protect him anymore but the future John Connor has sent back a protector for himself but who will reach him first?.<br/><br/>The action is amazing from simple guns fights to chase scenes on foot and with cars trucks motorcycles and even a Helicopter bombs explosions miniguns hand to hand fights between cyborgs you name it T2 has it.<br/><br/>The special effects still hold up even almost 30 years after its initial release the soundtrack for the whole movie is a perfect mix of high energy action and suspenseful dramatic build up that's used perfectly throughout the film creating a great atmosphere.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone even if your not one for science fiction movies you will find something in the action you will enjoy you will be hard pressed to find someone who hasn't seen this movie before so if you haven't then do yourself a favour and watch it."

"blumdeluxe","7","1","3","7 March 2019"," More than you'd expect
","""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is the second part of the Terminator series, telling the story of the original Terminator, protecting Sarah Connor and her son from a new version android, sent to eliminate the leader of the future rebellion.<br/><br/>To be honest, I didn't really expect much from this sequel. Terminator itself was a solid movie but not extraordinary and so I thought that part two would pretty much deliver the same. However, I have to say that I am hugely impressed by how serious the producers took their own film. While the plot itself is rather disposable indeed, a lot of ethical and moral questions are interwoven into it, making this a film that formulates questions for a future world. Especially this aspect seperates the movie from others of the same genre that otherwise would be very similar. The good production and look additionally does no harm.<br/><br/>All in all I can really recommend giving this a watch not only for fans of sci-fi and destruction, but also for those who like to spend some thoughts on the future of themselves and humanity in general."

"twbond-00867","10","1","3","12 August 2018"," One of my favourite movies of all time!
","Arnold Schwarzenegger brings to life one of the best movies of all time! A solid 10/10 movie that brings back from the previous first instalment something new to experience. Once the antagonist, now the protagonist as the T-800. Schwarzenegger's mission; to go back in time in aid by the leader of the Resistance, an adult John Connor to protect the young boy that will one day bring good against the machines in many years to come. As a boy, he goes on an adventure with the watchful eye of the guardian protagonist T-800, being pursued by the evil, grievous T-1000 who is sent to kill him. Linda Hamilton returns as the defender's mother, Sarah Connor, who, they break out from a mental institute believing that the machines are real and that she has seen it from the first instalment. As the three go on an adventure, they soon learn that they are not alone, and the T-800 must put everything into his power to NOT let this boy be killed so that the future becomes altered. The boy... must be kept alive at all cost! <br/><br/>The movie bring tears to its epic final moments of its screen-time, sacrifices are made, giving the audience something enjoyable to watch, along with popcorn, thrill-seeking excitement. The Terminator really brings the father-figure to young John Connor.<br/><br/>Simply one of the best films I've ever seen, and one of my favourite movies of all time! It is a well-earn treat that Terminator fans are given by the fantastic and mind-blowing film director, James Cameron. It's a must-see movie and simply one of the best motion pictures ever put on screen. It's more than watchable, it's to remember for the rest of millennia in cinema history!"
"kirbylee70-599-526179","10","1","3","4 January 2018"," New 4k Life To A Classic
","I'd forgotten just how much fun TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY was. Perhaps that's because Arnold Schwarzenegger went on to become Governor of California. Or maybe because Edward Furlong went on to become a bad actor. Or maybe because star Linda Hamilton seemed to disappear from any major release after this film came out. It certainly isn't for lack of a copy to resurface time and time again with numerous repackaging items to stir up interest. But this time around it's worth the extra effort.<br/><br/>If you're not aware of the story the first film told of a killer robot, a terminator, sent back in time after robots have tried to take over the world. His mission is to prevent the birth of John Connor who will go on to lead the resistance and take down the robots. The film ended with the robot crushed and Sarah Connor (Hamilton) pregnant with her son John and on the road.<br/><br/>The second film opens in the future where John is sending back a message. This time the terminator (Schwarzenegger) returns the same as last time, unclothed and in need of transportation. Another person from the future arrives as well (Robert Patrick). While the two of them go in search of clothing and transport we get a glimpse of Sarah and John.<br/><br/>John is a punk kid, living in a foster home where he's hit those ripe teen years where he's rebellious and uncooperative. He rides a motorcycle and hangs out at the mall. Sarah, on the other hand, is in a mental ward. Her claims of an apocalyptic future are thought to be the ravings of a lunatic and she's medicated most of the time.<br/><br/>As we watch and witness both Patrick and Schwarzenegger track down John, we wonder how on earth he can survive. When Schwarzenegger shows up, gun in hand, and begins shooting at Patrick we suddenly realize that he has been sent back to save not kill John. The two escape in one of the most action packed sequences ever filmed filled with plenty of skilled driving and high end special effects.<br/><br/>Surviving the pair rescue Sarah and head out. When Schwarzenegger provides them the information they need as to how the entire robotic world came to be, they set out to prevent that from happening. The action sequences that follow combine the worlds of stunt men and effects to maximum effort as we watch the final battle follow.<br/><br/>Director James Cameron is one of the most technically gifted directors you will find. In watching the film again I marveled at the ease with which the effects were planted here and there and noticed that a number of them would be used again in his future films like THE ABYSS. But it's not just his use of effects. He is a grand story teller as well, providing the information needed to follow along and involve the viewer. He adds touches of humor to the action going on which rounds out the film nicely.<br/><br/>So why bother investing in this version being released now when we've had so many variations available to us in the past? For one thing those fortunate enough to have invested in a 4k screen and player will now be able to watch the movie in the cleanest most high definition image possible. The movie was amazing before but imagine a picture to high on the quality scale that you can be amazed by a film made 26 years ago. The quality here is such that it looks more like it was made recently rather than all those years ago.<br/><br/>Extras here include a number of things including three different versions of the film, 2 different commentary tracks, deleted scenes with commentary, a 30 minute making of featurette, trailers and a 55 minute documentary called T2: REPROGRAMMING THE TERMINATOR. All of these make this the ultimate version of the film.<br/><br/>One more thing about this new edition. Not only does it come with the 4k restoration versions of the film but it includes the blu-ray edition as well as a digital edition. And it's being released at an affordable price as well. So if you want to watch this film in the best way possible, make sure you pick up a copy today."

This and the first one. This time Arnie is on our side and fights a more powerful Terminator. The special effects really took home the gold and the film introduced us to the next generation of the Connors: John Connor. This time it's the son who needs rescuing from the machinations (no pun intended) of Skynet. And Sarah Connor and Arnie's Terminator are the only ones who can do it.

Let's not forget Robert Patrick as the T-1000, the main villain of the film. He's so cool in this film. This film has amazing cinematography and a great score.

","Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator in<br/><br/>""Terminator 2: Judgment Day.""<br/><br/>Let me start by saying T2 is the best. This film is considered the best film of all time and I have to respectfully agree. I honestly have to say I think this film surpasses the original in every respect.<br/><br/>The year is 1995. Eleven years after her first encounter with The Terminator, Sarah Connor is in mental psych ward and people think she's crazy or is she? Her son John Connor is a rebellious 13 year old child that lives with foster parents.<br/><br/>Later that night, The Terminator arrives in search for John.

Suddenly The T-1000 his hot on their trail circle-ling in for the kill.<br/><br/>I first seen this film and T1 back in 1993 when I was 3 on VHS and I was blown away.<br/><br/>I'll express everything I like about T2.<br/><br/>Arnold is excellent as The Terminator he's just a bad-ass hero of the piece.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton is also a bad-ass as Sara Connor in this one just too bad she didn't pursue more roles like this.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong is pretty good as John Connor since this is his first feature film. Too bad he got in to drugs, it sort of ruined his career.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick is phenomenal as The T-1000 he plays one of the coolest villains in history.<br/><br/>Joe Morton is great as Miles Dyson he is just memorable as that character I haven't seen him in much else.<br/><br/>Overall, a cool action packed sequel to the original Terminator.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this film, what are you waiting for?<br/><br/>I Give it an 8.9/10 by far the best sequel to date."
"mooviesuniverse","9","1","3","18 September 2017"," He's back (in 3D)
","More often than not a sequel doesn't live up to the original, but 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' does exactly that and more.<br/><br/>Some 10 years after the events that took place in 'The Terminator', Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is imprisoned in the loony bin because she kept rambling on about a nuclear war and time travelling cyborgs. Her son John (Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance is now 10 years old and living in foster care.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in the future (2029 A.D.) the machines under control of the computer Skynet are still waging war on what is left of mankind. The machines send a Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), back in time to kill John Connor. The rebels in their turn also send back a reprogrammed Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect John. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, the boy, his mother and their new ally must try to stay one step ahead of the T-1000 on their mission to prevent the creation of Skynet.<br/><br/>While a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is necessary to go along with a story like this one (damn those paradoxes) it doesn't make it less great. This is as much a story about hope and family as it is about cyborgs slapping each other silly. It's a sci-fi/action movie filled with awesomeness (the truck chase scene) but it packs an emotional punch. Cameron blends the trilling action sequences very well with the drama and surprisingly enough humor.<br/><br/>If a movie has a villain it better be a darn good one. With the T-1000, ILM (George Lucas' special effects company) created something unseen and basically made the impossible possible when it was released back in 1991. While the new Terminator is an amazing technical achievement, Robert Patrick makes it an iconic character. He's an absolute monster. Tough as nails, insanely relentless and ice cold.<br/><br/>On the other end you have a very likable hero. Schwarzenegger really brings his A game. He's limited as an actor but he knocks this one out of the park. Hamilton gives us one of the stronger female characters in movie history and Furlong makes a very strong debut. Top that off with an excellent score by Brad Fiedel and you have yourself a classic.<br/><br/>We don't care much for 3D. Although it's done quite well here it's nothing more than a gimmick. It doesn't add anything but it did give us an excellent excuse to see Terminator 2: Judgment Day in theaters."
"thatguywithmovies","10","1","3","16 August 2017"," Greatest action film ever made.
","Here's the plot: The T-800 (Schwarzenegger), instead of getting sent back to kill John Connor (Furlong), is now sent to protect him after another model, the T-1000 (Patrick) sets out to kill John and his mother (Hamilton).<br/><br/>It definitely goes without saying that this is the greatest action film of all time in my opinion. Everything is great, from the special effects that still hold up today, to the writing, and even the rousing action and awesome explosions (the semi and motorcycle chase).<br/><br/>The special effects were done by Industrial Light and Magic, and it goes without saying that this is ILM's magnum opus. This film was released in 1991 and still holds up 26 years later, maybe even better than some films released today.<br/><br/>The music done by Brad Fiedel is masterful, and knows where it's supposed to be all the while maintaining the suspenseful tone of the first film's score. <br/><br/>The action is awesome, just absolutely screams ""America!"" With all the explosions, gunshots, and destruction going on in the film, you without a doubt cannot go wrong with Arnie spraying gunfire down at cops on top of a wrecked building.<br/><br/>VERDICT: If you haven't seen T2, drop everything and go watch it. You'll be glad you did."

The difference between us is impractical and attracts me. T-1000, an opponent to the main Terminator, has also characteristic ability. For example, he can transform his body into lead and other people. The capacity is strange, but it excites me. I have never seen such a fun movie. I think that I want to watch it again for the first time. And I have heard that this movie had been produced to be based on what James Cameron, the director, saw in his dream.

","One of the most intelligent, imaginative and riveting sci-fi, action flicks to hit the screens ever, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a classic without equal. What's even more surprising is that ""T2"" is a sequel of an already great film. 1984's ""The Terminator"" was an interesting premise that Cameron pulled off ably and catapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger to the stratosphere of movie stardom. ""T2"" has brains to spare to go with the action and there's a lot to like. The movie banks on the insight that humans are more destructive to the world than any machine can be. Linda Hamilton's amped-up Sarah Connor is the real emotional machine in ""T2"" unable to see beyond the mission of saving her son for the sake of a doomed humanity. She has such little faith in humankind that her actions become robotic. The performances are top-notch. This is Schwarzenegger's key role and Hamilton has never been better. Robert Patrick's steely performance is incredibly menacing and Edward Furlong is innocent yet with strong conviction. ""T2"" was well ahead of its time with its digital effects and it uses them magnificently. There's nothing not to like about ""T2"", it's loaded with imagination, thrills and action."

Someone is always trying to kill Sarah Conner and her son before the end of the world collapses. It is the best sequel to a film I've seen in a while though also, it makes a lot of people say whoa when they see this. This film came out in 1991 and also had better effects than some movie today.

","In 1995, John Connor is living in Los Angeles with foster parents. His mother Sarah Connor had been preparing him throughout his childhood for his future role as the Human Resistance leader against Skynet – the artificial intelligence that will be given control of the United States' nuclear missiles and initiate a nuclear holocaust called ""Judgment Day"" in 1997 – but was arrested and imprisoned at a mental hospital after attempting to bomb a computer factory. Skynet sends a new Terminator, designated as T-1000, back in time to kill John. The T-1000 is an advanced prototype made out of mimetic polyalloy (referred to as ""liquid metal"") that gives it the ability to take on the shape and appearance of almost anything it touches, as well as knives and other stabbing weapons. The T- 1000 arrives under a freeway, kills a policeman and assumes his identity. Meanwhile, the future John Connor has sent back a reprogrammed T-800 (Model 101) Terminator to protect the younger version of himself.<br/><br/>The Terminator and the T-1000 converge on John in a shopping mall, and a chase ensues after which John and the Terminator escape together on a motorcycle. Fearing that the T-1000 will kill Sarah in order to get to him, John orders the Terminator to help free her. They encounter Sarah as she is escaping from the hospital, although she is initially reluctant to trust the T-800. After the trio escapes from the T-1000 in a police car, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet's history."

","No matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films."
"dokwethan","8","1","3","21 December 2015"," A phenomenally amazing and classic action movie!
","I watched this movie primarily because I had watched Terminator Genisys a few months ago, and I was told by several people that it was a considerably terrible sequel to the originals, so I decided to visit the original Terminator movies.<br/><br/>I'm not usually an action-fanatic, but I found T2 to be a fantastic action movie with a gripping story, interesting characters and awesome action sequences. The acting in the movie is astounding, especially the beloved Arnold Shwarzengger who was able to play a comedic, yet bad-ass, terminator. The cinematography is also superb, and they were able to portray intense and epic fight sequences unlike many action movies nowadays. The CGI and animations for the terminators were also...pretty phenomenal for the early 90s and it still holds up today in the modern film industry. <br/><br/>When I was watching the 2015 Terminator movie, I admittedly thought that it was pretty good, but after watching Terminator 2: Judgment Day, I stand corrected. T2 is an epic, cool and heartwarming film that follows the relationship between John Connor and his mother and the terminator.

","Hi All,<br/><br/>Imagine yourself into a world of self thinking robots/Machines. you sure want to be in but back in our childhood that sure was a fantasy to us i watched Terminator 2 the very first time when i was only 12 though i did not get all of it but terminator touched me seriously (i am sure it happened to all of us :)). people around me in those days are not used to watch Hollywood so i ended up watching it almost 6 times to understand it perfectly. the fan following created by the franchise was not so common even ""007"" would wish for such a huge fan following. like a proverb ""Nothing remains same"" this franchise has got some serious damages, a big short fall in the fan following because of the frequent come & go of machines :). those guys should do something more interesting to make a boom once again. people wants more of a change than just machines. like those F&F guys are making quite an immersive impression."

","This is the sequel to The Terminator. This movie's story is about after 10 years since the first cyborg tried to kill Sarah. It is full of action scene and thrilling. I attracted this story from the opening to the end. It is really powerful movie. The personality of character is also great and the camera work gives me if I being there. Moreover, the skill of CG and the background music provides speedy rhythm and reality. In this movie, the terminator, which was a killer in former movie saves John. This story is exciting and moving. I think every people will enjoy this movie by great casts, plot and music. I want to watch it once again."

","This film is excellent! Truly a classic to show to newer (age- appropriate) generations. I'm not a big fan of bad language, which this movie has it's fill of and that's the only reason I'm not giving it a perfect 10. <br/><br/>Everything in the movie from the way it progresses in time from the first movie, the storyline, the special effects, the thrill, suspense, the action—it all leaves you on the edge of your seat soaked into it and it has been brilliantly carried out. This movie is about as real as fake could be coming from a near-future science fiction. 8 starts but two thumbs way up!<br/><br/>Recommended for little ones? Probably not, but that's up to you. Recommended for family? Also, probably not. This is something you'll want to watch alone."

"BlackLemonTea","8","1","3","29 June 2015"," one of the best action movies ever made
","First of all, I need to say that I watched the extended version of ""Terminator II: Judgment Day"" (153 minutes) and not the cinema version (137 minutes).<br/><br/>Before watching this movie I had high expectations. Not just because of the IMDb-rating, also because the movie is arguably considered as one of the best action movies of all time and won four Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Throughout the film I wasn't bored for a single moment. Exactly that is what makes an action movie great. I didn't expect thought- provocative topics to be discussed or heartbreaking dialogues. All a good movie from the action genre needs is following:<br/><br/>To begin with, the directing of this movie (by the amazing James Cameron) was incredibly well done. The camera has been stellar due to the sundry shots and different methods used to catch the action scenes. This made the movie more exciting to watch. Moreover, the music was perfect. I feel like this aspect is a tad too underrated after reading other reviews. It's always fitting to the situation and creates an intense atmosphere.<br/><br/>Another aspect to discuss is the acting. I was surprised. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only person I can imagine to play the role of Terminator T-800. His style and pronunciation is simply hilarious. After being the villain in the first movie, one feels sympathy towards Arnie. On the other hand we see Linda Hamilton playing the role of Sarah Conner, a valiant woman switching from a mother yearning after her son and a psycho woman disobeying the rules and hurting people. She seriously impressed me which was unexpected. Finally, we should talk about Edward Furlong. He plays John Conner, the soon to be hero who is key for humanity to survive in the future. Edward Furlong plays the role of the child, and I have to be honest: I thought that he was pretty annoying and frustrating to watch in the beginning. He's the typical kid from the block that breaks rules, does whatever he wants and acts like a provocative scumbag. But from time to time you got to know him more and more and catch yourself liking him. Also the acting of Furlong improved during the movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The visual and special effects are stupendous. Even in 2015 these effects would be considered as good. I liked it and imagine it to be even more amazing in the 90s.<br/><br/>The writing and the dialogs weren't exceptional or mind-blowing, but it was surely good enough for an action-sci-fi-movie.<br/><br/>Although the story was in general near to the first movie, it had more depth. The character development and progression of relation between each character was great to follow. Compared to other action movies, this one's script is original and different (in a good way).<br/><br/>All in all, ""Terminator 2"" is a fantastic sequel and as an action movie near to perfection. I enjoyed most of it and it never disappointed – always delivering, scene after scene. The all- inclusive-entertainment-package. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't watched it yet. Watching the first movie is not a condition, even though it was not bad."
"videorama-759-859391","9","1","3","17 June 2015"," One intense spectacular sequel, of a man who's back
","This is how you make a real fu..in' sequel. Learn from this. Nearly 7 years on, Sep 5th, 1991, a event happened. T2, and it's a cool exiting actioner from the word ""Go"" and doesn't drop it's guard and pace in a never dull moment. Arnie returns, this time as a good Terminator, sent back in time to save John Connor (troubled actor Edward Furlong) from being executed by a bad robot (new underestimated acting talent, Robert Patrick) extra nasty, made of liquid gold, who can hide in the form of another human, and replicate the being's voice. If the good terminator fails, basically it's Armageddon, and we get a scary taste in a shot of L.A being annihilated. The motorbike chase scene is awesome in a 133 minute film, that doesn't stop for anything. It's great that we have a good Arnie here, and he is in fine acting form, but he was brilliant in his best ever performance in the original. It's good timing, you could say as smart and independent Sarah Connor, breaks out, totally different to how we saw her in the first one. Our evil in liquid form of evil doesn't die easily, where the special FX are so awesome, back then, you'd almost think how could of this been done. T2 is just one of those small minority of sequels that don't suck, or in this case, outdoes the first, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a movie delight."
"luke-a-mcgowan","10","1","3","13 June 2015"," I don't even need to tell you to watch it, because chances are you've already done so. But you should probably do it again.
","There are action movies, and then there are action movies so good that they transcend normal genres of movie and become a new category - Perfaction.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>OK now that you've recovered, lets talk about how amazing Terminator 2: Judgment Day is. <br/><br/>The original Terminator never left itself open for a sequel, but neither did it end so definitively that it wouldn't welcome one. The relationship between Terminator and Terminator 2 is therefore as perfect a relationship can be - both work superbly as stand alones, but I'm even happier knowing that this film follows The Terminator in the franchise. James Cameron's script and direction are typically top-notch in this second installment. He manages to give us enough information about the universe and what happened between installments without shoving exposition down our throat. Right up until Arnold barks ""get down"", the audience is left completely unaware which Terminator is good and which one is evil. That such a mystery could be perpetuated for as long as it was is truly impressive. I also thought that the scenes shot in the mental hospital (action and non-action) were some of the best directed in the entire film. Cameron shows again that he's able to direct epic action in one scene and rip your heart out in another, which is a talent not many directors have. <br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger should always be commended for finding the roles that so best suit his particular set of skills. Unlike the Liam Neesons and Denzel Washington's of the world, Arnold has never been a fantastic actor, but he's a huge presence and a guy we love to root for. The unemotional, bland machine is therefore the most perfect role for him, and he plays it with such deadpan that he's perfect in whatever situation. A scene that calls for humour is all the more perfect for the deadpan delivery. A scene calling to highlight how unfeeling he is? A scene to show how menacing he is? Check and check. <br/><br/>Where Terminator 2 improves on the original, in my opinion, is the range of talent that fills out the cast. In Terminator, Linda Hamilton was good, but really all she did was run scared for the whole film. In Terminator 2, Linda Hamilton returns with a vengeance as a tortured, unstable survivor who simultaneously manages to be a loving mother and one of the single most badass women in the history of cinema. Were it not for genre bias, I feel that Linda Hamilton could have cracked top 5 for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Go look up the five actresses nominated that year. Have any of those films ages half as well as Terminator 2? Edward Furlong is one of those rare child actor talents, an immature brat for much of the film, but with enough dramatic talent to make you care for him at others. Robert Patrick managed the unenviable task of filling Arnold Schwarzenegger's shoes as the villainous Terminator, and in my opinion he exceeds him. Arnold will always be the iconic Terminator, but in the list of best villains of all time, the T-1000 will always win for me.<br/><br/>The visuals are top-notch, with the CGI used to great effect, but a sound use of practical effects during scenes like the motorbike chase. The stunts and choreography of that scene is incredible. And I can't stop without mentioning the costume - everything from Arnold's leather jacket to his sunglasses to his shotgun is iconic.<br/><br/>This is the most perfect action movie that has ever existed. It succeeds on every level. I don't even need to tell you to watch it, because chances are you've already done so. But you should probably do it again."

","Certainly a more polished film than the original; a reflection of how far Cameron and Arnold had come since '84 both commercially and artistically. But I hesitate to say that I think it's better. The thing that struck me watching them over back to back days for the first time is the difference in tone. The first 'Terminator' plays a lot like a sci-fi slasher movie. It's very John Carpenter. 'T2' is very much the blockbuster sequel that it was. It's more sci-fi action than sci-fi horror. It's not that it pulls any punches, and when it goes dark, it goes *really* dark, but overall the tone is lighter than the original.<br/><br/>The story here is stronger than the original, and the action is taken to another level. The groundbreaking special f/x hold up superbly. This movie was light years ahead of the curve. It's stunning work.<br/><br/>For me, this makes for a perfect ending for the Terminator saga. Everything else, no matter how good, just feels like a rehash."

"TheRomanDude","10","1","3","11 August 2014"," Greatest movie of all time
","Yes, this is my favorite movie ever. Why? Terminator II provides a realistic insight into the self-destructive nature of human kind and poses a philosophical question whether the course of the future can be altered.<br/><br/>The deterministic thought behind the movie is that any activity happening will bring about an unchangeable and pre-determined world. Although improbable, the execution of this thought is wonderful. Skynet is formed, because someone from the future tried to prevent Skynet being formed. A hero is born, because the machines (unaware of determinism) tried to kill the hero.<br/><br/>And of course, last but not least, the relation between human and machine. How far will robots, androids and computers go to be of assistance? The first self-thinking processor by IBM has just been released and perhaps this is the beginning of the end. We, humans, need machines. Machines develop human traits, but kill humans."
"joshfarcone-549-745450","10","1","3","31 May 2014"," Terminator's best! Years ahead of it's time!
","There are very few films that come along every decade or so. This is one of them.<br/><br/>James Cameron, the versatile director we all know after Titanic and Avatar, basically launched his career with the first Terminator, a low budget Sci-Fi. He then directed and wrote Aliens and The Abyss. Both films are quite incredible for their time as well. After his great success, he was given a $100 million budget to make a sequel to Terminator. What it could of turned into none of us knew... but what it became is nothing short of the true talents James Cameron had as a director (and still has).<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgement day is possibly the most successful, infamous Sci-Fi & Action film ever made, with tons of great human elements adding a lot of drama and emotion as well. But I can't think of a single thing they did incorrect in this film. The casting is amazing from Arnold to getting the right kid to be John Connor (amazing job) and bringing back the Psychologist from the first film adds to it all. The film is shot so beautifully, with cinematography worthy of an Oscar, with chase scenes done flawlessly, to the slick editing and amazing musical score on top of everything. Watching this on Blu-Ray it looks like it could of been released a couple years ago... very few films age like this.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor is in a Psych Jail, following the events of the first film and nobody believing what she says she saw. Her son, cast so perfectly as a 12 year old John Connor (Ed Furlong), truly is what makes this film not just a Sci-Fi and action film, but a great drama and character study type of film as well.<br/><br/>Arnold is sent back again this time, same type of model but upgraded a bit, but now is back to help save John Connor and protect the future of humanity. Cybernet also sends a Terminator from the future, a T-1000 model (Robert Patrick) that is liquid metal and can transform into other objects, people, and is a more complex model. He's sent to destroy John Connor and whoever else is in his way, including Arnold. The plot doesn't sound like it would be such an amazing film, but it's one of the best films ever made, and will be in my heart forever.<br/><br/>This film has it all. Take the opening scene of Arnold coming down to Earth, walking into a bar butt naked, messing some people up to get the right clothes, throughout all this is fun humor, action, plot developing, and a great soundtrack and score. The moment he grabs the guys glasses before leaving (as the guy is aiming a shotgun at him) and then grabs the shotgun, you know this film is unique.<br/><br/>Throughout the 2+ hour film it's never slow, if anything I wish it were longer it's that amazing. The fact that John Connor has no real dad, has bad foster parents, and his mom is in jail/psych brings another huge element to the film, especially because Arnold's a terminator that can now actually learn new things, and a father and son type of bond (or a great friendship) develops between the young future savior John and the good terminator.<br/><br/>Without trying to spoil the film for those who have never seen this... which I fathom hard to meet or find anyone who hasn't, please do. Even if you saw the first Terminator and didn't like it, or have seen Terminator Salvation (with Bale) directed by awful MCG, and whatever the 3rd terminator was called, they are NOTHING in comparison to this film.<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgment Day is by far the best action-SciFi w/drama and comedy, that I've ever seen, and probably will be that way till I die. Sure I'm nostalgic, but the people I've gotten to watch this film who never had were simply amazed too. Epic directing by James Cameron is a huge part of this, and remember the first Terminator was a low budget film that made Cameron famous. Terminator 2 was a 100 million dollar big budget summer blockbuster that made over half a billion dollars in theaters across the world (in 1992 when tickets cost 4-5 bucks). <br/><br/>I also consider it Arnold's best performance, as he is a perfect fit to play a terminator / robot with his mannerisms and accent. He does a superb job, and when it's all set and done this is easily one of the top 100 films ever made. I honestly think it should of been nominated or won some Oscars (including best film), but Science Fiction and Action just don't get credit by the Oscar's (especially then). <br/><br/>The special effects are so ahead of their time, watch any other 1992 action film and it makes T2 feel like it was made post 2000 (as the Titanic feels, as True Lies feels). I won't spoil the Cybernet sub-plot and everything, but you all probably know it all like me or are asking ""what is Cybernet"". If you are asking what is Cybernet, then I recommend you watch this movie ASAP! I've owned it on every medium nearly, from VHS to DVD to now a great Blu-Ray copy I got at Target for $5.<br/><br/>An epic, unique, breakthrough film that will never be emulated the right way. Film is a certain type of medium where now everything has been made almost, and these days nothing is new. In 1992, Terminator 2 was groundbreaking across the WORLD, not just the US.<br/><br/>A MUST SEE! 10/10"

In every scene with the T1000 the action is pushed to the most possible. Breaks are limited to the most necessary. As is usual in Cameron's films, the tension and action increases.

","Terminator 2 is one of the best sequels ever made and a great action and science fiction movie. It further develops characters and has a great story as well. Each time I see it I like it a little more.<br/><br/>Two Terminators are sent back to 1991. One is given the mission to kill John Conner, and the other one has the mission of protecting John Conner. Sarah Conner is currently in a mental institution for trying to destroy the computer that eventually would attack mankind on Judgement Day.<br/><br/>The story is a great follow up to the first Terminator film. This time it feels like a lot more is going on. Its fitting how the Terminator did not kill Sarah Conner in the first film so it was sent back this time to kill John Conner as a young man. I like the parts that work from events that happened in the first movie, like how the Terminators hand is in the headquarters of Cyberdyne Industries and how they remember the first Terminators attack on the police station.<br/><br/>The action scenes do a good job of complimenting the story. I really like the action scenes in this movie, especially when the T-101 fights the T-1000.<br/><br/>Arnold is great as the Terminator again, this time as a heroic defender. I also really liked him as a bad guy in the first movie, but he is just as good as a good guy. He always is great in these films, which are definitely his best films he has made.<br/><br/>The T-1000, played by Robert Patrick, is also great as the villain. He is really cool as a liquid metal machine that can make sharp pointed weapons. The special effects for him are really well done and hold up really well. Probably this film and Jurassic Park have the best usage of special effects in a film. I like how the T-1000 is a villain, but also cyberdyne industries and skynet are also a villain too.<br/><br/>John Conner is pretty cool for a kid character, and you can see why people will follow him in the future. Sarah Conner is a much more interesting character in this film and gets to do a lot more.<br/><br/>Great story, great characters, and great action. Great movie. I recommend it greatly."
"OllieSuave-007","8","1","3","5 February 2014"," Schwarzenegger kicks butt as The Terminator!
","Arnold Schwarzenegger kicks butt in probably his most iconic movie role, the Terminator! Here, set almost 10 years after the events of the original Terminator movie, an evil cyborg called the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) is sent to the present through time to terminate future human resistance leader John Connor (Edward Furlong). However, another Terminator (Schwarzenegger) is also sent back through time to protect John and mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from T-1000's grips. What follows is am amazing display of visual and special effects as the Terminator and T-1000 do battle, filled with explosions, gun battles and car chases.<br/><br/>Even though this is a science-fiction film, the gloomy and dark atmosphere of the cyborg-infested city gives you a realistic feeling of what it's like to experience world's end. Director James Cameron cleverly blends in drama with non-stop action, making this an entertaining and mesmerizing movie from start to finish. <br/><br/>The character development served the overall plot well and kept momentum of the story going. Schwarzenegger is hilarious with his one-liners (""I'll be back,"" ""Hasta la vista, baby,"" and ""Terminated!""). Robert Patrick gave an outstanding portrayal of the evil T-1000; he and Schwarzengger make a great good guy vs. bad guy element. <br/><br/>The only downsides to the acting was that I thought Edward Furlong's portrayal of John Connor seemed too condescending and Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Conner seemed too over-zealously tough and angry. <br/><br/>But overall, this movie is a must-see of any action-genre fans and one to watch for Schwarzenegger's signature performance.<br/><br/>Grade B+"
"TheSeaLion","10","1","3","1 January 2014"," Surpasses not only its predecessor, but most action movies in general
","In 1984, director James Cameron released his sci-fi action film ""The Terminator"" which was met with high praise. Seven years later, Cameron released ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" which surpassed the original, which is also a very good movie, by far. It is a masterpiece of sci-fi, action, and drama that is still one of the best action movies to this day.<br/><br/>The film starts off similar to the original. Two different beings are sent from the future, one a terminator and the other a protector. This time around, The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the protector while a new terminator unit, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) is sent back in time to terminate John Connor, the future commander of the human resistance. I know this is a little off topic, but one thing I have to say I love about the opening is the irony that it contains. The hero (Schwarzenegger) is dressed like a punk biker while the villain (Patrick) is dressed as a police officer.<br/><br/>While the Terminator is sent to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), the T-1000 is sent to kill him. We see that John has been placed under the care of some foster parents (Jenette Goldstein and Xander Berkeley) and his mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), is in a psychiatric hospital. After the Terminator rescues John, they get Sarah and join forces to keep John alive from the T-1000.<br/><br/>Unlike in most action movies where the characters are turned down for flashy effects and over the top fight sequences, this film manages to keep a balance between the action and the characters. There are a lot of tense and amazing action sequences in the movie, but the characters come first. The relationship between the Terminator and John is well written and there is some believable chemistry between the two. The same goes for the relationship between John and Sarah. <br/><br/>While in the first movie it was more about the Terminator hunting for Sarah and Reese (Michael Biehn) protecting her, in ""Terminator 2"" the audience is shown what will eventually cause the machines to take over, which adds some depth to the story and to Sarah's character when we see her try to kill the person who is accidentally responsible (Joe Morton).<br/><br/>Like any good action movie, the action sequences are intense and well shot. We can see what is going on and they do not feel tedious or over- the-top. Complete with shoot outs, explosions, car chases and crashes, ""Terminator 2"" checks off all the marks in the action department.<br/><br/>""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is a movie that is packed wall-to-wall with action, but does not forget about its characters or story in the midst of it all. There are compelling characters with interesting relationships between them, cool action sequences, and an interesting story. ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is a perfect example of how to make an action movie the right way."
"The-Sarkologist","9","1","3","13 December 2013"," Arguably the greatest action movie of all time
","I love this movie, this is probably one of the best action movies ever made. It has some awesome chase scenes and some brilliant fight scenes. The climax of this movie I would say is when Arnie stands in a window and shoots hundreds of police cars with a minigun. The chase scenes are just superb, one of them between a scooter and a huge two truck down a sewer and the second between a helicopter and a Swat van along a Los Angeles Freeway.<br/><br/>This is a sequel and thus begins by going through all of the characters and telling us where they are. Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) is really the only one who comes across from the first movie, and is now in a mental hospital with what is believed to be delusions of persecution. John Conner (Edward Furlong), her son, has been fostered out, but has become a very rebellious kid.<br/><br/>The movie opens in the future with a reminder of where the world is going to end up. The war scene here is just brilliant, watching huge robots moving across the earth and people running round with automatic lasers. This short scene is a brilliant opening to what turns out to be a brilliant action feast. Then enters the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who, in a brilliant scene, wonders naked through a bikie bar and demands some clothes, some boots, and a bike. The second Terminator (Robert Patrick) is quite different, very hostile, caring nothing for anybody around him. This Terminator is much crueler than the original terminator in the first movie.<br/><br/>Cameron really pays attention to detail in this movie. Even though people have commented on the paradox that this movie causes, Cameron does create his characters with strengths and weaknesses. The Liquid Metal terminator has to remain still to heal his injuries. Every time he is hit, the wounds will not heal until he rests, and Cameron shows us this. Arnie though seems to have more human traits to him. He reacts to John Conner's pay outs, yet does not really understand human emotions. The terminators final words, ""I know now why you cry, but it is something I could never do,"" brings up the truth with how a computer could never replace a human being. Even though they may be self aware, they do not have the soul to express emotion.<br/><br/>Cameron has some very interesting things in this movie, and there are numerous biblical reflections. I do not think that this is intentional, but the reflections are there. John Conner watches two boys playing guns and then they start to fight, he then turns to the Terminator and says ""we have no hope have we? We will destroy each other."" This comment strikes deep into our soul to show that we really do have no hope. We are not divided into good and bad, nor will peace come by removing all the bad people. Miles Bennet Dyson (Joe Morton), a scientist who is working on the Skynet Project, is shown as an innocent man, yet his invention is responsible for the death of millions of people. His obsession with advancing technology is what causes this. He does not realise that he is sentencing humanity to death, but he does. Even though the future is written down, people just do not want to believe it. The doctors at the mental institute consider Sarah Conner to be mad when she tries to tell them that they are all going to die, but we know the truth because we have been shown it. The bible shows us the future and we know that God will judge humanity, but we do not want to believe it. Even though we live 2000 years after Christ and have no solid proof, we believe it, yet millions do not. We like our lives to be safe and our future to be secure, but unless we prepare for the devastation to come, we will be destroyed. Christ says that people will be marrying right up until the day of judgement. The same comes out in the movie. Children are playing on the swings right up until the moment the bomb hits. Sarah is trying to warn them but they choose not to listen.<br/><br/>The ending creates the terminator to be a Christ figure. In fact, the Terminator is a Christ figure all the way through the movie. When he first appears it seems that he is a threat to John, but turns out to be his saviour. As Jesus says, he has not come to judge but to save. The Liquid Terminator kills Arnie near the end of the movie, but Arnie puts himself in the way to give Sarah and John a chance to escape. Yet, he comes back, a resurrection, and defeats the Liquid Terminator. Finally, he lowers himself into the molten metal for he is the only one left with the chip, and to remain would be to condemn the world. The final thumbs up is Christ's ""It is finished."""

","This movie is over 20 years old but still one of my favorite films! I have been reading some of the reviews and i can't believe some of the criticisms of the film! Terminator 2 is the best of the series with excellent casting especially the t1000 liquid metal man! Great casting, great great casting! People thought that Sarah was unbelievable as a tough nut bag! I found the transformation from a simple waitress to a crazy gun toting woman totally believable! If I was chased by a creature from the future and found my world would end if the machines couldn't be stopped very disturbing especially if I were pregnant! I would probably act the same and teach my child to be the best at warfare and at the same time go nuts with the thought of my reality being upside down! I loved Sarah's character because she wasn't a soft stupid woman screaming at everything and had the balls to do something, although crazily! <br/><br/>I could go on and on how good this film is and 20 something years later, still a great film, but I won't! <br/><br/>They should have stopped at terminator 2 because the next films were unwatchable!"

","This review was written for your average Joe. So if you are<br/><br/>1.A hardcore feminist 2.Easily saddened 3.A old person<br/><br/>Get out, now. Thank you, this review is not for you.<br/><br/>Also, WARNING: Slight spoilers, nothing you won't know in the first ten minutes. Also, one major spoiler, (But it isn't that big of a deal. It isn't a major plot twist, and it isn't the ending. Just a very badly made James Cameron plot device.)<br/><br/>=The effects= The effects for this movie are amazing. Seriously. The CG-I Is the best kind. ""Supports the plot and the action"". And they use some AMAZING stop motion and modeling in this movie, and some seriously amazing stunts and explosions. 100X better then the original. (100 MILLION BUDGET.) There is NOTHING wrong with the effects PERIOD.<br/><br/>=The acting=<br/><br/>The acting for this movie could use some work. The real star here is Arnold. Arnold is hilarious and bad-ass in this film. You easily become frustrated when it goes to the mothers point of view instead of his, it's just so much weaker. Granted, her acting is leaps and bounds better then the original terminator. (Man, that was BAD.) But the kids acting is VERY weak at points. He seems to act like he is in a made for TV Disney film. One person that seems to be under appreciated in this film is the villain. He does a spot on job making you feel like something is off, and he only has a view lines.<br/><br/>==Characters==<br/><br/>The characters are, surprisingly, very good. The kid is a complete ass and idiot Noob who doesn't know what in the hell he is doing. The mother is a mix of a right wing militia freak and a frothing at the mouth feminist tweaker, (Fits perfectly with what she has been through) Arnold is a complete bad-ass, (For those of you wondering, he says the retarded one liners because the kid tells him to.) The villain is amazingly powerful and creepy.<br/><br/>==The story== First off; James, James, James. It seems like you really bring down this movie with your horrible script writing. Can you PLEASE hire somebody to write your scripts for you? You are BAD at it. BAD. Now, luckily, this movie still delivers on a OK plot and good action, but there is a VERY badly made moral to the movie about how Arnold learns the ""Value of human life"", Guess what. HE DOESN'T. All that happens is the stupid Noob kid commands that he doesn't kill anyone because the kid is a huge pussy. And guess what. He doesn't learn the ""Value of human life"" All that happens is KILL=TRUE MAIM=FALSE turns into KILL=FALSE MAIM=TRUE. So Arnold just maims everyone instead of killing them. How nice, yeah. Real value of human life there. It's just standard James Cameron ""SO DEEP"" BS that bogs down every one of his films. This is the BIGGEST problem with the movie.(Note: Luckily, because of the fact there is no idiotic romance in this movie, it makes it FAR better then the first. The romance in the first had no chemistry and seemed VERY forced.) The second worst thing about the story is the fact that they have the mother narrate parts after the first half of the movie. Why? We would much rather watch Arnold beat the crap out of the bad guy then hear some idiot whining. THANK YOU. ==Final score== The fact that this movie has no bad romance, amazing action, and AMAZING special effects and stunts gives it a 10. The fact that the kids acting is VERY lackluster, the movie has a REALLY bad moral loosely attached to it, and has a very boring slow part in the middle lowers it a solid 2 points down. 8/10. Everyone should see this movie. But don't expect the story to be amazing."
"TheHande","7","1","3","26 June 2009"," Iconic but over-rated...
","Terminator 2 is a film that I would like to like but can't. There are parts of it I genuinely enjoy but at the same time it doesn't have the appeal or seriousness of its predecessor or the inherent entertainment value of its immediate sequel.<br/><br/>James Cameron's direction and visual style are what make the film look good. But as much as certain scenes from the film remind me of the first movie it never feels as good and dark as the first movie. The emphasis on even bigger action-scenes didn't impress me and only the T-1000 has stuck in my mind visually from this entry in the series.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger's role reversal from the previous movie is a refreshing touch but one that is undermined as the Terminator loses more and more of its cold and calculating robot mentality. Becoming a big buddy to the young John Connor is the reason why the ending of the film is so heart-breaking, but the change occurs in such a way that it feels like a very flippant change in direction from the first film.<br/><br/>But maybe I'm too in love with the darkness of the first film and just a tad too sarcastic to enjoy the film's balance of action, narrative and drama. But for me the movie feels long, drawn out and not nearly as dramatic as the first or the third entry in the series. For entertainment value at least it beats the fourth easily but as iconic a film as it is to most people, for me it's just over-rated."
"CelluloidRehab","9","1","3","15 February 2008"," Do motorcycles come with a gun rack or is it optional? Oh yeah, what about the Great Schism?
","2:14 AM, August 29th,1997. The day the world ended, sort of.<br/><br/>This is where the series ended for me. Much in the same split as the great Christian Schism (in 1054) or the fundamental difference between Shi'a and Sunni Islam, this film is the fulcrum upon which the ""Terminator"" universe is divided. The first and second films being the canon of this universe and all the follows as filler, but not all together relevant in any way (anyone remember the Dark Horse series of the 90's?).<br/><br/>About the only thing that doesn't work in this film (believe it or not) and the thing that keeps it from being perfect is Edward Furlong. Robert Patrick, the Austrian Oak (Schwarzenegger) and Linda Hamilton (the one and only Sarah Connor, beefed and bad ass) are excellent at anchoring a convoluted, yet somehow plausible situation/plot for Cameron's dystopian future. It is hard to believe this film is less than 20 years old, yet has become a part of science-fiction canon.<br/><br/>While there is more of everything in this film (by comparison with the first), including a larger story arc with psychological tension, which is supported by the state of the art (at the time, which still hold up pretty well) special effects cache, lots & lots of action and explosions, you would think this would put it ahead in every category. Unfortunately the ""edge"" still goes to the first film. It does break the sophomoric jinx (a.k.a - sequel syndrome), sacrificing some of the ""edge"" for a broader arcing and more complicated story arc and becoming a much better film in the process. There is something to be said for the simplicity, darkness and fog of war of the original.<br/><br/>So this time around, after Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) returned from the stormy desert of Mexico (at the end of the first film), many years have passed. John (Furlong), her son, is now a whiny and ""troubled"" foster teenager and Sarah herself is committed and certifiably nuts (not to mention beefed up and ready to kick ass of any kind). A new, upgrade model of the Terminator (Robert Patrick) is sent by Skynet back to the 90's to kill John. The John of the future (2029 or so) trumps this gambit by sending a reprogrammed version of the T800 model (Schwarzenegger) to protect himself in the past. Add some bonding, Sarah's plausible paranoia, 2 Terminators, 1 Austrian Oak, many explosions, lots of guns and fighting, a tongue-in-cheek humor system and a rather satisfying ending and you have a recipe for a great movie. <br/><br/>The ""Extreme"" DVD viewing is not required, but it will expand certain aspects of the story arc more thoroughly. I do prefer it over the theatrical version, but that's just me.<br/><br/>This is an archetype of the possibilities of a good summer blockbuster. Everybody loves the Terry Brooks endings. Happy endings can occur, they just require a sacrifice. Also, time travel is a tricky thing. Gray is gray, and the future is not yet written."

","If you didn't think it could get any better than ""The Terminator"", then you haven't seen ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""!  This is one of the best sequels of any movie ever done!  The story is fantastic, the acting is great, the special effects are ground-breaking and nearly perfect, the make-up effects are better than ever, and the action is non-stop!<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those films that I wish I could erase my own memory and watch again for the first time!  There's no other way to put it, I love this movie!  I've probably seen this film more than any other.<br/><br/>The story is perfectly told, working seemlessly with the original Terminator film.  The special effects are truly fantastic!  The design for the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the T-1000 are brilliant!<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the perfect T-800, as he did in the original Terminator film.  Robert Patrick will forever be ingrained in my memory as the T-1000, he IS the T-1000 and is surely the perfect choice for the role. Linda Hamilton does a particularly good job with her role.  The contrast between her ""Sarah Connor"" of the first Terminator film and the ""Sarah Connor"" of this film are very different, but with good reason.  She definitely worked out a lot for this role and pulls off her best performance to date (in my opinion).  The scene where she first sees the T-800 is EXCELLENT!  Edward Furlong, Earl Boen, Joe Morton, Jenette Goldstein and Xander Berkeley also pull off nice performances.<br/><br/>What it all boils down to is this.  If you like the first film and have been putting off seeing this film, you need to stop wasting time and go see this film.  I wouldn't even bother renting it, just go buy it, it's worth it.  If you haven't seen any of the Terminator films, then I would recommend seeing the first film then seeing this one...although you could probably put the pieces together without having seen the first one...but nonetheless you should still see them both.  If you're one of the last remaining people on earth that hasn't seen this film, then I hope you enjoy it.  I know I did.

"Movie Nuttball","10","1","3","29 October 2001"," One of the greatest movies of all time!!!!
","When I first saw previews of this great film in 1990 I just couldn't wait to see it.In 1991 I finally saw it I was so amazed at the special effect in it and how different it was compared to the first the Terminator.Arnold this time was the good guy and his new villain was T-1000 cyborg played by Robert Patrick.The battles between these two Terminators were awesome.There is so many gun fights and people getting shot and thrown around that the movie is action packed that it never slows down.I just love the the beginning where where you see the war of the machines and another scene where the T-000 and the Terminator is in the back of the mall and continues to shoot each other and another great scene is where near the end where they fight on the road and in the metal plant.I just love how Linda Hamilton acts in this movie,she is so good.This is I think James Cameron's best direction.T2 has great music as well and at the end credits make sure you listen to the some by Guns 'n Roses.Make sure you get the McFarlane Movie Maniacs Terminator and T-1000 action figures.They are great!<br/><br/>Special VHS Edition Comment:<br/><br/>Fans of Terminator 2: Judgment Day will love this! I was really pleased with restored scenes, My favorite one is when beautiful Sarah Connor is dreaming about Kyle. Sarah looks so good and I have always like Linda's character but now I love her character even more now. She is such a incredible woman. There are a lot of other key scenes that were missing on the first release but they are here now! T2 is an explosive epic and is in my opinion one of the greatest movies of all time. <br/><br/>Movie Nuttball's NOTE:<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest movies of all time. This is one of MY favorites. I rank this movie with some of MY other favorites like The Mummy Returns, The Planet Of The Apes 2001, Legend, Predator 2, Masters Of The Universe, My Science Prodject, The Relic ,and The Glimmer Man, and among others."

","And I don't say that lightly. It's up there with Empire Strikes Back and Blade Runner 2049. It's that good.
Which it isn't that surprising considering who's behind it.
When The Terminator first came to light in 1984 and became such a massive sleeper hit, it was inevitable that a sequel would eventually get made. And who better to do it than the man who came up with the idea and directed the first one. But being James Cameron who he is, in always wanting to push the envelope when it comes to groundbreaking filmmaking, he delivered, what was at the time, the most expensive and one of the most technically challenging movies of the 90s. With a strong cast, script, state of art visual and practical effects and a wonderful score by Brad Fiedel to match, we're given the ultimate masterclass in how to make a Sci-fi movie and, in the case of this franchise, something that would never be repeated again. In my humble opinion, this is how the Terminator movies should have ended. All the rest is just commercial fodder."

"ollywill-08723","10","1","4","25 March 2019"," Perfect Ending...
","With Terminator 2, James Cameron provides the perfect & most satisfying conclusion to the original feature film of his which launched his career...
Unsurprisingly one of the greatest sequels of all time, this legendary director ensures Judgement Day is a character driven, heartfelt story about family, exploring the strained & complex relationship between a mother & her son first, always maintaining the film's focus on the progression between the two as a priority, despite it also being a groundbreaking action flick; the set pieces never come at the expense of true character moments & he strikes a masterful balance between them both.
What's clear is these movies (Terminator 1 & 2) should've been left untouched with no further installments that could taint the franchise's impact or the beautifully written narrative.
Embarrassingly, until today, I'd never actually seen Terminator 2 & still haven't watched the third in the original trilogy, despite having viewed Genisys & Salvation... All I can say now after watching is: why are they continuing to make any more & mess with what was such perfection?
Studios need to leave the hell alone."
"stevenrotherforth","10","1","4","10 March 2019"," 4K Remaster. Too many chefs have spoiled the broth!
","Terminator 2: Judgement Day. UHD Edition<br/><br/>Ok so this review is going to be a little different from the usual reviews posted on IMDB.
I'm not going to go into too much depth about the actual movie.
Any fan of the action/Sci-Fi genre will know that this movie is a classic.
A game changer in terms of visual effects and a rare sequel that is better than the original.
What I want to talk about is how this latest remastered edition of the film looks and sounds.
Should you good people spend your hard earned cash on this upgrade or are you better off dusting down that old DVD copy and saving yourself a few pennies?
I actually purchased the digital copy of the movie from Prime Video when it was on offer.
The film is remastered in 4K HDR and comes with a Dolby Digital Plus sound mix.
If you shell out for the UHD disc sound is superior.
The sound mix on the disc is DTS 5.1 Master audio.
The disc should provide a crisper image too.
However I believe the added clarity from the disc will only accentuate the issues I found.
I find it disappointing that the disc doesn't offer Dolby Atmos sound but I digress.
The digital copy still sounded good even with the more basic sound mix.
Arnie's shout gun had real kick. A nice deep thud whenever he opened fire on the T1000.
Explosions have real low end rumble and even the subtlety of a closing car door had aural impact.
Surround effects were also very immersive.
The motorbike chase sounded fantastic with all speakers put to good use.
A particular highlight was when the Terminators bike smashed through a metal gate.
The chains could be clearly heared from the rear.
However sometimes I did get a sense of reverb.
A false echo effect that was a little distracting.
For a basic cinema sound format this digital stream was very impressive.
Sound never gave the impression that it was compressed. Dialogue is always clear even when all channels are pumping out high levels of sound.
A shame then that the implementation of height speakers was never put to use. This would have resulted in a far more enveloping audio experience.<br/><br/>What about image quality I hear you ask?
Well this is where things get tricky.
On one hand the use of HDR has been put to good effect and image quality is much crisper than what I have seen before.
There's an abundance of colours bursting from the screen.
The scene with the children in the playground just before the apocalypse has colours popping.
The children's clothing being very vibrant. Unfortunately sometimes things get a little over saturated.
Skin for one thing looks really fake.
Everyone seems to have a waxy appearance. Almost as if all the actors came straight from Madame Tussaud's.
Detail is sometimes stunning. Take Dr Silvermans jacket when he's interviewing Sarah Connor.
Every weave and fibre is visable with immense clarity.
Each strand of Sarah's hair is finely presented.
The scene when John and the Terminator break Sarah out of the hospital has some impressive detail. The wire fence at the entrance is very sharp and clear.
For a movie that is over twenty five years old.
Image quality is pretty decent. There's little to no grain now. I believe it is the noise reduction that causes some questionable flaws.
Skin tones are a overly processed mess.
Shame then that Arnie looks like a wax dummy!
This edition is a upgade over the standard DVD for sure. Is it better than the Blu-ray? Well the digital copy was good for the small price I paid but if I was buying a hard copy I would have been disappointed with the 4K Blu-ray.
From reviews I have read elsewhere it seems the disc suffers the same problems as the 4K stream.
Only the flaws are more apparent on the 4K Blu-ray due to the added clarity of the superior format.
This remaster reminds me of when I'm cooking.
I just can't leave well enough alone.
A sprinkling of more salt here, a tad more pepper there. Ooh what's this exotic spice I've found in the back of the cupboard?
Let's stick that in too!
Before you know it I've ruined a perfectly good Shepherd's pie.
That's what the 4K remaster of this film is.
Too many chefs have meddled and spoiled the broth.<br/><br/>Film 10/10. Remaster 6.5/10"

","A good sequel should do everything the original did and build upon it, with that in mind Terminator 2 is not a good sequel, it is a great one. The concept of taking the villain from the original and making them the hero of the second is an unprecedented creative choice in the action genre and it allows for a myriad of opportunities, all of which the film capitalizes on in every way. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a showcase of action set pieces that have become legend in film, the bike chase, the assault on Cyberdyne Systems HQ, the final showdown with the menacing T-1000 (Robert Patrick) and countless more. But beyond this it harbours a deep and meaningful theme throughout all the carnage, that if a machine can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."

","Now, when it comes to me and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, I never saw it as a kid due to my age and it's subject matter never practically interesting me, but as I grew older, the movie certainly peaked my interest so last year, I decided it was time for me to watch it and once the end credits rolled, I was in utter shock at what I had watched and I absolutely loved it, from it's action and character moments to it's themes and acting, T2 is truly a gem of a sequel.<br/><br/>The film starts with a bleak scene set in the future following a nuclear holocaust known as Judgment Day with some narration explaining how Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to the 90s to kill John Conner before he can become the savoir of the human race, but a reprogrammed Terminator is also sent back to protect John The two land in the present and obtain clothing and weapons and begin looking for Conner. After locating John at a video game arcade, both the Terminators find him and the T-800 engages the T-1000 and a chase commences. John and the T-800 escape and proceed to rescue John's mother, Sarah, from a mental hospital. Now, the trio just stop the T-1000 from carrying out his mission, destroy Cyberdyne and stop Judgment Day from happening.<br/><br/>In the annals of sequels, there are only a few that have been able to take what made the first one so memorable and amplifies it to such a degree that it's able to be every bit great if not better than it's predecessor, Terminator 2 is one such film. Much like what Nicolas Meyers did with Wrath of Khan or what Denis Villeneuve did with Blade Runner 2049, James Cameron gives to us a true marvel of a movie that easily seems to outdo the first film where much like what he did with Aliens, Cameron simply takes the story from the first Terminator and makes it much more grander, multifaceted and thorough that it makes it damn near impossible for the following films in the series to even be what T2 has been able to do and they have mostly pale in comparison to what this movie has done. <br/><br/>From start to finish, the movie is a masterstroke of film arrangement, with a series of scenes and sequences that seem to roll of one another like a domino set where every scene and every moment is put into motion and the story is always moving like a well-maintained car while Cameron beautifully handles everything without trying to cram too much stuff into the movie and slowing it down. While watching the movie, it becomes clear that James, being the genius filmmaker he is, was given a larger budget for the film and it really does show by contrasting the depressing opening scene in T2 with the first film's opening. James does the job effortlessly by showing the viewer a grim and desolate depiction of the future with such a intense level of skill that the whole scene has been craved into the mindset of a generation of movie-goers and it never fails to send a chill running down your spine. While the first Terminator was a straight-out sci-fi horror movie with a love story added in, T2 focuses on the importance and the difficulties of being a family as shown with Sarah being in a metal hospital and is unable to be there for her son and John searching for a father figure and finding one in the Terminator along with John teaching the T-800 how to be more human which remains the heart of the movie, in fact I wouldn't be surprised that The Iron Giant and Big Hero 6 drew inspiration from T2 in that respect. With that aspect of the movie in mind, a theme that flows though both Terminator movies is humans vs. technology as shown in the scene where Sarah Conner attempts to kill Miles Dyson as she doesn't bring into question ethics or morals showing how she is becoming more like a terminator but before she kills him, she comes to her senses and she sees what she's becoming. There's a moral tapestry that flows throughout the movie practically when John tells the T-800 that he just can't go around murdering people or when he's explaining why humans cry and curiously, it is John's teachings and the rebooting of his CPU that makes the Terminator more human and in the end, he realizes part of his humanity when he sees John crying and it makes his sacrifice all the more impactful and heartbreaking. A truly great hero in a movie is one who gives his life for a greater cause, something larger than his own life and while the T-800 could have lived, he decided to sacrifice himself for the future of human kind making him a true hero. Cameron chose to use this powerful moralistic issue in the film because he didn't want the Terminator murdering everybody and everything in his way, but rather weave this message into the story which many who watch the movie seem to overlook and it proves to be a very mystical feature of the movie and it makes the message of the movie all the more powerful. <br/><br/>Of course, it wouldn't an action movie without action and Terminator 2: Judgment Day certainly delivers that in spades. Right from the moment the T-800 enters the bar and straight up hurls a man onto a hot stove, it's clear that the action isn't toned down like Die Hard 4 nor is it over-the top like Army of Darkness, rather it's the kind of action that always keeps you glued to the edge of your seat as you never know what will happen next and the movie has so many memorable action scenes from the wonderfully shot shoot-out in the hallway between the two terminators and the ensuing truck chase to the exhilarating and emotional climatic battle in a steel mill that few other action movies can even compete with it in terms of fast-paced action. While not all directors might be on James Cameron's level when it comes to filmmaking, that's a given, but any filmmaker who are looking at making action movies should take a careful look at the various other positives found in the filmmaking of Terminator 2: first off, not every action scene needs to be filmed with shaky cam or done in slow-motion in order to tell the viewer that the scene is impressive or critical as it can distracting for the viewer and takes them out of the moment. The cinematography in the film feels fresh and in depth where the viewer is able to see everything perfectly right down to the tiniest, most insignificant details, kudos to Adam Greenberg for that. The action scenes are cut to perfection with no jump cuts or messy editing to seems to be a trend in most action movies now a days. The visual effects are absolutely fantastic and still look just as revolutionary as they were back in '91 given how T2 was one of the big budget movies to use CGI, it just looks flawless as opposed to a lot of later big budget movies that have tired to used it but have mostly failed. The shots of the T-1000 changing are northing short of dazzling, masterful, and brilliant, particularly the moment of the T-1000 coming out of the ground or when the T-800 blasts the T-1000 to bits are the stand out moments in terms of visual effects mastery at work. Simply put, if Terminator 2 had never been made, we wouldn't have had the effects in Jurassic Park, The Matrix or Lord of The Rings. As for the musical score, it's truly a masterpiece of film composing as Brad Fiedel is able to outdo the score from the first movie The score for T2 is astonishing, conflicting and grim all at the same time with a ceaseless bass line that keeps the movie going with a relentless and pulsating drive that never seems to stop, even during the quiet moments plus the music at the opening of the movie is truly awesome in every single possible way as it gets kicks the film off on a musically high note. Not surprisingly, the film also a substantial amount of humor added in which does make the movie a bit more lighthearted than the first movie practically the scene where the T-800 is in a bar and takes a pair of sunglasses while Bad to the Bone is playing in the background, it's classic James Cameron humor at it's best.<br/><br/>As for the cast of T2, they are all amazing in their roles and under Cameron's guiding hand, they give it their all. Linda Hamilton once again completely rocks it as Sarah Conner, going from a scared and naÃ¯ve heroine to a battled-hardened bad-ass with zero effect, but also willing to protect her son and even a bit crazy as seen when she attacks Miles Dyson and almost kills him but realizes the error of her ways which makes for some superb character development, something rarely seen these days in major action movies, but also maintains a surprising amount of defenselessness that makes Sarah such a captivating character and it's truly a shame that Hamilton hasn't been in other big character roles after T2, but at the very least, her performance as Sarah Conner demonstrates a strong woman hero who grows as a character and has an impact on the story at hand. Edward Furlong is down-right fantastic as John Conner playing a rebellious teen with ease but he's also capable of showing great emotional range as shown in the final scene as well as a fair amount of vulnerability, lovability, and intelligence while displaying sighs of the leader he will someday become. Easily one of the best child actor performances I've ever seen in a big budget movie which is rare. Robert Patrick as the T-1000 is the embodiment of what a truly great villain can be, he's restrained, stealthy, icy and determined with a cold dead look of anger on his face which always instills a sense of dread whenever he's on screen but his personality is also simple and effective in his motivations and seems natural when talking to people rather than a full-on robot which makes him all the more threateni, intimidating and such a great villain, but out of all the actors in the movie, none are as awesome as Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T-800 and was born to play this role and while some may say that he isn't the best actor out there, the role seems tailor made for him, but with Cameron's directing, Schwarzenegger is able to give a truly wonderful performance by coming across"

","When Terminator 2 came out in the summer of 1991...i was way too young to see it with my dad; instead I saw The Rocketeer with my late nana and liked that movie so much i even bought a 3d comic book that came with an audio cassette. I finally saw T2 in the late 90s after seeing the first terminator on VHS and liked that one. Now this one is a step above the first in terms of special effects, originality, and action and scope. The inclusion of Guns and Roses in the soundtrack is pretty good. This movie was the first DVD-18 I bought, which contains multiple versions of the film. The ultimate director's cut is highly recommended, as it contains scenes not seen in the theatrical version. I'll probably not see it in 4k 3d since I'll get it on bluray soon."

","I just watched this film again last night - right after I watched the last 20 minutes of ""The Blues Brothers."" I could have sworn I was watching the same movie- a chase movie. Lots of chasing and crashing and so on. Yes, the original has that component to it, but the heart and soul of the first film is the love story which is totally lacking from this film. There are moments in the first film that are terrifying. Nothing about this second installment impacted me in the same way. The suspense just wasn't there. It's also hard for me to care about any of the characters. Furlong's debut performance is two-dimensional: cocky and arrogant or screaming and whining. Arnold is much better as the cold-hearted villain- a element of the story that Robert Patrick's character, the T1000 falls short of delivering; and a twisted Sarah Connor that has little or no resemblance of the original character from ""The Terminator."" The dialog throughout the movie is corny. Trying to humanize the Terminator machine is ridiculous. (""Now I know why you cry."" ugh.) There is no denying that the movie has amazing special effects- though dated now- and that the chase/action scenes are ground-breaking. But to me, the things that make a movie great are well-developed characters and a story I care about. I own this film, and think it's a fair sequel. But it is hardly the masterpiece that many make it out to be."
"GavAnderson","6","1","4","30 June 2005"," Cameron's masterpiece!
","Well what can I say? Good action, fun car chases, lot of explosions, good acting, and great music. All in all it's a very good film but threes no way I could ever say its better than the original. T2 takes all the elements that made the first Terminator a great film and enhances them with amazing special effects and out of this world action. However, it lacks the dark quality that filled the first, which is a bit of a let down but one that's easily forgotten. If you're an action fan you cant find much better, it really has set the standard for all action films to follow, it is a genuinely enjoyable experience. Cameron has done a great job in bringing the story back to life for the sequel, and I especially liked the fact that he kept the original cast. However, I can never forgive that ending, it was horrible! They really did drag it out for everything it was worth and it just seem cheesy to me. Even despite this, it is still a great movie and one of the greatest action films out there. The special effects still look just as brilliant and ground breaking today as they did in 1991, and the cast is simply amazing (Edward Furlong especially). It may not be better then the original but it sure doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

"ShootingShark","6","2","13","20 January 2008"," Eye-Popping But Frustrating And Annoying Spectacular Sci-Fi Adventure Sequel
","In the early 1990's, John Connor is a streetwise kid who will grow up to be a great military leader. Two cyborgs from the future are sent back in time; one to kill him, and one to protect him. Will he survive, and can he somehow avert the nuclear Armageddon which gives rise to an endless war between man and machines ?<br/><br/>Most movies I either love or hate; this one I find incredibly frustrating because I love parts of it and hate others. It has some fantastic action scenes - particularly in the first half-hour and last half-hour - amazing visual effects (which set the benchmark for CGI work and were incalculably influential) and lots of good ideas. However, it has two connected major liabilities which succeed in almost completely ruining it. The first is the Sarah Connor character, who (unlike the first movie) is loathsome, moronic, superfluous and appallingly badly played by Hamilton. She's the example par excellence of the Idiot Plot - we find out about twenty minutes in that shooting the T-1000 doesn't do any good but over the next two hours she fires about a million more bullets at him. Good plan Einstein - the one thing that definitely doesn't work, she does. Why not try playing Barry Manilow music at him, or using incisive satire ? At least those techniques haven't been ruled out ! Also, her great idea to stop the apocalypse is to shoot the pivotal microchip designer (which ultimately she's too chicken to do, despite all her macho bravado). Here's an idea - why not just ask him not to build it ? She's an unnecessary waste of space in this movie - the T-1000 isn't interested in her, it's after John - and it's saying something when two actors playing robots give more subtle and interesting performances than the leading lady. I can forgive a movie credibility gaps (e.g. John should really be less than ten years old) but not stupid, offensive and redundant characters who slow up the plot. The second problem is the whole mid-section of the film, which is slow and boring - the T-1000 is the essence of the story (and Patrick is sensational in the part) and he disappears for an unforgivable forty minutes. At least half of this material could be dumped. I guess my main gripe with this movie is lame sequelitis. Whilst the original The Terminator had a limited scope and budget, everything else about it is better, particularly Big Arnie as the Ultimate Bad Man. Here he's a namby-pamby do-gooder who isn't even allowed to kill people, although he still gives a very effective performance. Everything is overinflated just for the sake of it, which adds spectacle but detracts from character, suspense and atmosphere - all the things the first film did so well. I also find the moral tone of this film pretty tasteless; it purports to be about finding the humanity needed to avoid self-destruction, but its idea of a funny moment is having people get shot in the kneecaps. Its pretensions are amateurish at best. Oh, and it also doesn't know how to spell the word judgement. Whilst it may not sound like it, I really do admire this film and rate it better than average - it just could have been so much more than it is. I put the blame for this squarely on Cameron; he made three great movies but the last one flopped (The Abyss) and ever since then he's retreated into boring, formulaic, overlong, ludicrously overindulgent blockbuster fluff. There is still much to enjoy here however, most notably Patrick's spellbinding physical performance, and the extraordinarily imaginative Oscar-winning visual effects by Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Robert Skotak and Gene Warren Jr. It's a good film; it just makes me annoyed how stupid it is. Followed by an ill-advised sequel, Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines, in 2003."

Movies like this add no value.<br/><br/>There's still something more to say about this film, however. Again, this film, like the first one in the series, in 1984, was directed by James Cameron. Not surprisingly, it received critical acclaim, making this review within the minority of those whom disliked this film. Perhaps what I dislike about this film is the grotesque, unrelenting violence by the protagonist, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

","In director James Cameron's blockbusting sequel to his popular 1984 hit the indestructible killer from the 21st century returns to 1990 Los Angeles, this time to protect a future revolutionary leader against an even more deadly assassin, able to change shape at will. Arnold Schwarzenegger has the advantage of superior firepower, but the script wants to present him as a surrogate, cybernetic father figure, softening a role already ideally suited to his limited talents (poor Arnold can't even portray a convincing robot without effort).<br/><br/>The liquid metal computer effects are impressive, and the spectacular action sequences are staged with cold, mechanical precision, turning what could have been a thrill-a-minute adventure into the big-screen equivalent of an arcade video game. In the end the film amounts to little more than a marathon of furious destruction, undermined by some pretentious moralizing and by an absurd streak of pacifism: Arnold's terminator is ordered not to kill anyone, so instead he simply (yuk, yuk) maims half the armed forces of the Free World."
"generationofswine","10","1","6","6 August 2019"," An Honest Review
","So, it is time to review the last good Terminator movie.<br/><br/>When T3 came out, I swear that people forgot it was even released... but at least it felt like it belonged in the Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>When Salvation dropped, it felt like it fit as well, but it was an MCG film, so it also felt like Terminator meets Mickey Mouse.<br/><br/>And when Terminator Typo was released, it kind of did it's best to completely alienate all the fans that the franchise had developed over the years.<br/><br/>But this one, well, this one actually was great. The Robert Patrick T-1000 liquid metal thing looked amazing, Patrick acted ominous and frightening, and seemed like a legit threat despite the size difference between he and Arnold.<br/><br/>And in the process the T-1000 managed to produce some truly creepy visuals.<br/><br/>And this John Connor, Edward Furlong, was absolutely amazing. You really got the sense from him that he could be the man that leads the rebellion in the future.<br/><br/>And, Sarah Connor was buff, and upped her game as the heroine that could do, well, actually do the action she was required to preform. And not only that she was creepy and obsessed as well. She looked and acted like the kind of survivalist that would train the future savior of the world.<br/><br/>It all came together as a brilliant move with old Arnold playing the good guy this time, and, though it was an obvious bank on his star power, they pulled it off so no one would care. Right down to the first meeting where John didn't know if he could be trusted or not.<br/><br/>It was a fantastic story with fantastic visuals, and it all made of a stellar and entertaining watch."
"fedor8","Null","1","6","10 December 2014"," The future maker of ""Avatard"" goes back in time to add some new scenes.
","James Cameron is no intellectual; that much we know. He is great with action scenes and special effects, but when it comes to character, plot, casting, and logic – forget about it. So when someone accuses him of treating his audiences as imbeciles, one must be careful. He isn't necessarily treating them any different than he'd treat himself. To him, dumb plots = intelligent plots; he doesn't differentiate. A plot is a plot, and an actor is an actor. He is quite autistic that way.<br/><br/>T2 is a very entertaining movie, but its plot is full of logic holes and stupid little plot-devices. It swims in cameronian nonsense. I guess this was just a warm-up for the REAL nonsense to come: ""Titanic"" and especially ""Avatard"".<br/><br/>First, let's pick on the most obvious target: the time-travel. Any movie whose central premise revolves around time-travel is going to run into heavy complications, by default. If Schwarzenegger chose to go back to, let's say, September 1991, why didn't the evil robots send their assassin to August 1991? Or even better: to 1989? And that's just a snippet of the logic-problems that arise whenever time-travel is thrown into the mix. I won't go into the rest; I would exceed my 1000-word limit on that topic alone. Suffice it to say that if there is one point in the past that one can visit, then there must be gazillions of them, an infinity of past points; all these worlds co-existing in the same universe – which is why time-travel (into the past at least) isn't physically possible (despite what fame-starved astrophysicists such as Michio Kaku claim).<br/><br/>Before I go on to the other nonsense, let me just point out to the incredibly stupid time-travel-related paradox of the 1st Terminator robot (1984) providing the knowledge (with his severed robotic arm) to Cyberdyne Corporation that lead them to eventually destroy the world – which in turn leads to a series of events that get the 1st Terminator sent in the first place! It's self-contradictory, illogical and insane.<br/><br/>As for characterization, startlingly dumb is Sarah Connor's behavior and her empty-headed decision-making process. Instead of playing it smart – by pretending that the story about annihilation and robots is nonsense – she acts out like a bona-fide mad-woman, ensuring a permanent stay in the maximum-security loony-bin. Dumber yet, when she finally gets a chance to be released, i.e. when the cops show up to interrogate her regarding Schwarzenegger's renewed appearance, she decides to not co-operate at all. Later on (only in the Director's Cut) she actually wants to SMASH Arnie's tiny brain with a hammer, in spite of the fact that this act would be tantamount to shooting yourself in the foot, the other foot, both arms and the neck; after all, don't they need him as defense against Melty? In other words, the mother of mankind's savour is an imbecile. Gives us all hope, huh? The fact that Cameron actually added this scene to his Director's Cut – i.e. amplified Sarah's idiocy – speaks of Cameron's own tiny intellect. <br/><br/>Linda Hamilton's unfortunate casting is yet another example of why directors shouldn't cast their wives – and why most actresses marry directors. Eastwood casting Locke: big mistake. Tim Burton casting Helena Bonham Carter: dumb dumb dumb.<br/><br/>As flawed as this Sarah Connor character is (and so unattractive, with that damn masculine face, a lack of curvature and boobs, and those disgusting wiry Madonna arms), her son is far worse. Here we have a juvenile delinquent, totally amoral and reckless – yet this is supposed to be THE savior of mankind? There is a particularly ""disturbing"" scene (in the sense that it is so stupid it's almost smirk-worthy) in which the kid screams for help when Arnold holds him by the arm. Later, when help does arrive – by which time the kid feels no longer threatened by Arnie – he tells the two good Samaritans: ""take a hike, bozos"" and calls one of them ""a dumb jock"". <br/><br/>THIS is the savior of mankind? Really, James? The only conclusions I can draw from this scene are: 1) a confirmation of Cameron's stupidity (and perhaps even a skewered sense of morality; fancy that in a libtard?), and 2) a rising suspicion that Cameron was a nerd often bullied at school by ""jocks"" (i.e. alpha males that nerds detest, partly out of jealousy), and that this scene was his way of ""getting back at them"". There is nothing more embarrassing than a scorned, scarred-for-life ex-nerd trying to sort out his adolescent mental frustrations on the big screen. Connor Junior also wears a Public Enemy T-shirt; a well-known shmip-shmop group that wrote racist lyrics aimed against Jews, Koreans and Caucasians. But that's Cameron for you; he is a libtard, so obviously his ethics will be a ""little"" out there.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the abysmal casting of this ""child savior"". Has anyone ever heard of a hermaphroditic alpha male who leads millions of men into battle? I haven't. There are no historical records that support any such case. Leaders of men (and often even female leaders of men) have an excess of testosterone, not estrogen. And yet Cameron, in his infinite lack of wisdom, taste, and common sense cast an effeminate boy-girl to portray Connor. Furlong is so girly in every manner that he makes Di Crapio look like the neighbourhood butcher. Was Leo unavailable to play a Saviour of mysterious gender? Many people complained about Furlong being supremely annoying and they're mostly correct. <br/><br/>To be fair, Furlong isn't a bad actor at all. He is just badly miscast. Acting ""talent"" isn't the issue here. After all, Al Pacino would also know exactly how to play this kid – but who would believe that a 50 year-old Pacino is an 11 year-old kid?"
"RyanEberhart","7","1","6","27 September 2013"," Could have been better
","Though I love the Terminator series, this is my least favorite of the four movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes place about twelve years after the first movie. In this movie we find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents because Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in an asylum for trying to blow up a computer company.<br/><br/>The graphics for this movie were far better than what the graphics for the first Terminator movie were. They ought to be, the budget was just over $100,000,000 compared to $6,500,000. That is quite a lot of difference.<br/><br/>Anyway, even though this is my least favorite of all four movies I do have some favorite parts. But, before I list them I want to say that I could have gone a lot longer in my life with out seeing the naked asses of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. That said I think I can list my favorite scenes without ever having to reference those scenes again.<br/><br/>My first favorite scene is when The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) walks into the road house to get clothes (oops, I'm referring to Arnold being naked). The Terminator takes out five or six bikers. One of the bikers pulls a knife and the Terminator disarms him and stabs the biker through the shoulder and pins him to the pool table. After the Terminator gets clothes and takes a motorcycle, the bartender come out to stop him with a shotgun. The Terminator disarms the bartender and takes his sunglasses, but leaves without further harm to anymore humans.<br/><br/>My next favorite scene has to deal with when The Terminator and the T- 1000 and when they first find John Connor. The fight between the two terminators is pretty good. However, I like the chase scene through the storm canals better.<br/><br/>The last scene I like is the scene when the T-1000 is defeated. It's a pretty drawn out elaborate fight scene that sees him fall into a vat of molten metal. Unfortunately for the Terminator, and John, that isn't the end of the movie. The Terminator must be destroyed, so he is lowered into the same vat of molten metal.<br/><br/>I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. I didn't like how Sarah Connor was extremely butch and gung-ho, I understand it, but I didn't like it."
"The_Movie_Cat","6","1","6","17 April 2000"," ""Even machines need love too""
","So speaks 'Ginger' from the original Terminator. 2001 will see both the tenth anniversary of the sequel, and, supposedly, the third film in the series. As a result I decided to dig out T2 and see how well it stands up nearly a decade later; watched in a straight run after the original. The 1984 film was made on a meagre budget of $6.4 million and made somewhere around the $50 million mark. This sequel had a $100 million budget and has so far earnt over $620 million.  So it's clear where Hollywood would stand on the issue.<br/><br/>Disappointingly, the two don't complement each other at all. Somewhere between the two James Cameron had lost all sense of film-making in a flurry of allocated budgets, and Arnhuld had graduated to ad-libbing ""I need a vacashun"", with a hand-shaking, high-fiving Terminator that learns all about ""family values"". When the original was conceived, Arnold hadn't yet had his first big hit, (Predator), being nearer to Hercules Goes Bananas than True Lies. What happened to the egos of both in between is played out on screen, particularly the portentous monologues by Hamilton that are meant to be worthy and meaningful, but are more often unintentionally hilarious. This is a film, lest we forget, that climaxes with a ""moral of the story"". Did we all really like this kind of stuff at the beginning of the last decade?<br/><br/>The original is a vibrant, moody, psychological piece, where the ironically named night club ""tech noir"" acts as a telling counterpoint to the minimalist art nouveau. A film for adults, it featured healthy, but not gratuitous, sexual tone, and occasional usage of the f-word. The sequel is for teenage popcorn munchers. Swearing is toned down and sex is absent, forging a film that, in England at least, became a box-office friendly ""15"", as opposed to a restrictive ""18"" certificate. John Connor sports the t-shirt of a black rap group throughout the picture (Public Enemy), yet the music he plays on his scooter and the incidentals are there purely to capture the lucrative ""white rock"" audience. So this is a Terminator that emerges leather-clad to the ""ironic"" strains of ""Bad to the Bone"", while moronic action sequences are feebly contrasted with Dwight Yoakam and Guns n' Roses.<br/><br/>Was it always so bad? I certainly used to enjoy the overblown, overlong and overbearing ""Judgement Day"" a whole lot more. Yet where the original had night, this one has day, in full-blown comicbook Technicolor. While the first movie had some of Cameron's trademark contrivance and overstated imagery (particularly the constant ""machines in everyday life"" allusions), it was someway from the boo-hiss English villainy and Oirish jig-dancing of Titanic. In fact, the low budget gives it its feel. Very much a product of the mid-80s, music by obscure-but-dated group ""Tryanglz"" plays, while mullet haircuts, frizzy bouffants and thin white ties can regularly be seen. The special effects may have dated (notably the back projections, Arnie's false head and the stop-motion exoskeleton), but the whole film is calculated for optimum-noir feel, so it doesn't really matter. Of course Arnold can't act, but that's irrelevant as he plays an expressionless cyborg. In the second film the cyborg gets feelings, and that does cause problems.<br/><br/>Formulaic, the second is basically a rehash of the first, complete with ""bad Terminator commandeers a vehicle by saying 'get out' to the driver"", HGV chase on a motorway and showdown in a machinery factory.  That bad Terminator is Robert Patrick, a slight man who doesn't really stand a chance against the twin might of a pumped-up Sarah Connor and the T-800 (weightlifter model). The fact that the main protagonist is wholly absent for a middle section lasting 37 minutes also dissipates any growing sense of threat, something which was constant in the first movie. Just as well he's aided by those magnificent FX, probably the major reason to watch the film, but also the least credible segment. Mind you, the expensive FX can't hide the rather obvious dummy that hangs off the back of Arnie's car, then abruptly cuts to a Patrick close-up. Reminded me of Benny Hill. Even less effective is a (cut, thankfully) scene where his hand turns stripy, as it uncontrollably emulates his environment. This was, of course, the other big selling point of the film, where, two years later, a ""director's cut"" of reinstated cut scenes was released. Some moments, such as a morality debate over whether to smash the T-800's chip add nice touches to the plot. Others, like Arnie learning to smile, or a tritely-written dream sequence with Kyle, detract, and the film is stronger without their inclusion.<br/><br/>Moreover, the intellectual properties of the franchise are changed. The first was a warning against machinery, this one a far-less-subtle take on war. Rather hypocritical given the amount of screentime taken up by firepower. Dialogue is naive at best, banal at worst. Take this line from Furlong: ""We have feelings, we hurt, we're afraid. You've gotta learn this stuff, I'm not kidding, it's important"". Furlong, in fact, like all the actors in the movie, is encouraged to deliberately overplay his role, with a high-pitched characterisation that can be quite abrasive.<br/><br/>
The Terminator is the work of a man-woman team. The testosterone-led Terminator 2 was written by two males. It shows. It lacks depth, clarity, subtlety, and any kind of genuine relationship or characterisation. Aliens to Terminator's Alien, the only sore point here is that Cameron is responsible for both and should have known better. But he didn't, and neither did we, and so we bought a silly film about a sinking ship upon ourselves. And Arnie as the Terminator? No-one bothers to tell the dumb shmoe that if he succeeds in their mission  to destroy all Cyberdyne chips, including his own, to stop the great machine war  that John Connor will never have needed to send his own father back in time and will consequently never exist..."

","The Terminator was brilliant. A slasher film featuring not a mask-wearing maniac, but a killing machine from the future. I still remember how shocked everyone was in 84 at the end when the metal skeleton stands up from the fire and resumes his pursuit of Sarah Connor! The movie was tight, well written, brilliant set up.<br/><br/>Fast forward 7 years and tons of millions of dollars in budget latter and you get this, a mess of a script covered by CGI that, while ground breaking in its day, now looks like terrible PS1 cut scenes. You know the film will suck as soon as Arnold arrives, repeats the same clothes stealing scene from the first one, but exits on riffs from ""Bad to the bone""... cringe. Then, the unbearable kid is introduced and the real weakness of the script is exacerbated. While the original worked perfectly as a love story unfolding between the victim and her hero protector, under the constant looming shadow of the relentless killer in pursuit, this one waste time between uninteresting scenes with Sarah in a mental institution, idiotic ""funny"" scenes with her whinny sons, and scenes with Arnold who does little but stand still in a trance or shoot a gun here or there. There is at least one character too many. The mom and her kid together, or the kid and the machine together would have worked a lot better.
I remember falling asleep the first time I rented the VHS in 92 or 93. Now on blu-ray, I just stopped it watched in in 3 sessions and found it tedious to finish. You can put as many explosions and special effects as you want, this is not even 1/10th as good as the first one."

","The sequel is slicker, but not noticeably smarter than the original.  At least Cameron found a co-screenwriter who writes slightly less torturing dialogue than the first one; that's a relief.  And I can't deny that the ending provides an emotional high.<br/><br/>The bizarre mix of sentimentality and brutality is even more evident than in Part 1.  The one interesting idea is Hamilton's supposed conversion to non-violence, but this, like every other idea in the movie, is not thought through to its consequences. Indeed, there is a wholehearted enjoyment of explosive, slamming special effects which flatly contradicts this claim of turning away from violence, and makes the insistence that no humans be hurt seem, if not hypocritical, at least delusional.  Certainly this movie will not prevent its many fans from gleefully watching other action films where humans are blown apart and chopped to pieces.<br/><br/>Probably the scariest aspect of the whole movie is that Terminator 2 is actually one of the best action blockbusters of the last couple of decades."

"Rendanlovell","7","0","1","16 March 2020"," The original is better
","Watched the Extended Special Edition cut for the first time and definitely prefer the Theatrical over this. That said, this review is for the Extended Special Edition cut.
Unfortunately for T2 there is little in the way of story that's very fresh. It's essentially the same movie as the first movie. It hits the same beats in the same places and has incredibly similar action set pieces. There are some new things in here like them going and blowing up Skynet. There a few new places they visit but at the core of it, it's very similar. Plus, the humor and one liners go little bit too far. There's great moments with the Terminator learning human emotion like when he attempts to smile but, there's a bit much of it. Speaking of elements that are a bit much, the product placement is EXCESSIVE. The amount of Pepsi and Subway in this movie is insane. Drinking, eating, and turning products towards the camera are only the start of it. While I'm complaining I may as well address the bizarre structure choices. The first hour or so is the Terminator sequel we would expect. A Terminator trying to get a guy and a guy protecting that guy. Pretty simple stuff but then it shifts into being about the creation of Skynet. Where our characters confront the creator and blow up the cyberdine building. It almost completely abandons the T-1000, barely mentioning it and showing it even less. When the T-1000 forces its way back into the movie it feels like the Skynet creation movie ends and the Terminator sequel begins again. It's jarring and only works thanks to pretty good writing but it's still an odd choice to make.
But this movie still rules. The characters are far more interesting then they are in the first movie and the themes presented far outdo the original. Even though there are a lot of similar action sequences, they absolutely RIP in this movie. The camera work is far slicker and more fluent thanks to the big budget making each sequence more engaging. There's a great blend of old school effects (rear screen projection, puppeteering, matte paintings, stop motion) and new school effects. It's also one of the last big budget action movies I can think of that meldes a ton of genres together seemlessly. You got The Thing type body horror, big action set pieces, comedic moments, character drama, and of course sci-fi. The Terminator is cooler, the action hits harder, the characters are more dynamic, and the filmmaking is top notch. Still one of the coolest sequels to a classic movie ever."
"Aylmer","7","0","1","31 October 2019"," Excellent effects and performances but the script has some issues that haven't aged well
","When this movie came out, it was a watershed moment, especially among us 11-year-olds who were just now able to see R-rated movies here and there. At the time, we weren't thinking critically about whether things made much sense and we weren't comparing it to the first movie (which most of us saw later). The film changed the game of what a big-budget R-rated action movie could be, with top notch effects and plenty of scenes that will stay with you many years later.<br/><br/>As a jaded middle-aged adult who has studied and attempted my share script writing and film making, I can certainly appreciate the original film as a mini-masterpiece of mood, atmosphere, and a lean, mean film all around. It's got a few underwhelming effects shots but overall a miraculous production considering its relatively low budget.<br/><br/>Here with the sequel, they upped the budget 15 times, Arnold was already a major movie star, they threw in a spunky kid to be his sidekick, and so they had to up the threat level in terms of a new invulnerable foe. With the T-1000, I would say they were 100% successful in creating an interesting and relentless threat via the groundbreaking effects and Robert Patrick's genius performance. However, in the script, the machine would have been a lot scarier more tense had it behaved a little smarter.<br/><br/>For instance - I don't understand why it has to keep reverting to the same form as Robert Patrick even later in the film when everyone knows who he is. One of its main assets is that it can copy other people and infiltrate. Think how easy it would have been to get closer to John in the factory if it just took the form of Arnold or anyone else who would seem more trustworthy. Another issue is that it doesn't just obliterate Arnold when it gets the chance on at least two occasions. I think since it's a more advanced model, it'd be aware of Arnold's power core and CPU location and could easily have just punctured those things and walked away. Why didn't it do this? Well, because we wouldn't have had a movie otherwise.<br/><br/>After the amazing T-1000 morphing effects and a few heartless, dehumanizing kills, I still have to say that I'm a bit let down that this film just doesn't have the dark edginess and grit that the original had. It's not a small movie about a pursuit but a more muddled epic affair where the main characters go off on a bit of a tangent to change history later in the film which robs it of a lot of its energy. While it boasts bigger chase scenes with impressive choreography, the film had a lot less fatalities in an effort to give it more mass audience appeal.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate the terminator doesn't get to terminate anyone, even prior to receiving his new orders, especially as it later comes to the detriment of the main characters as the officers he merely wounds are still capable of disrupting their plans. The film itself lacks daring to give the characters a hard choice; what if killing a few people could prevent the end of the world? Could you still do it? It would have been so much more interesting to see characters just go with a bold choice instead of playing it both ways in such a wishy-washy manner.<br/><br/>Cameron just kept making bigger and bigger films as the years went on, with TITANIC and AVATAR both decent films but way more lavish and expensive than the scripts really dictated. Also an unfortunately byproduct of the success of this film would be the solidification of a repetitive formula that would haunt the franchise this spawned. The concept of a future war between humans and machines has so much that could be done with it. Why is every film in this series just another time travel plot about protecting some future savior of mankind and a bunch of chase scenes? Oh yeah, because this film made so much money, and the studios just think that all we will ever want is more of the same."

","Terminator 2: Judgement Day, just the name brings goosebumps to me. This is without any speculation the best movie ever made. I never get tired watching this amazing film time after time. This is one of my most favourite films. Schwarzenegger made the character,'terminator' one of the most memorable characters in film history. His action timing and the quote-'Astala Vistala baby' will haunt u for years.Furlong and Hamilton also did a fairly good job but still Arnold was undoubtedly the main attraction. Robert Patrick's character may even be called the greatest villain of all time because T-1000 was as deadly as an atom bomb. And last of all James Cameron took the terminator franchise to a milestone after the fairly good part 1(The Terminator in 1984).

"josephrygaard","8","0","1","14 September 2019"," Before Watching: Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (1991)
","""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day"" (1991) is the continuation of Terminator (1984) and takes time about ten years after the prequel's events. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Where Terminator explored the emotional and human spectra of a confrontation with a murder robot from the future, Terminator 2 instead ramps up the action and take it to a whole different level. It has more - more explosion and guns, more police skirmishes and more Terminators. It is a visual feast of spectacular special effects and some great sceneries that want a big screen to deliver the impact. The score with the famous theme hits home as well. Terminator 2 could easily have been released a few years back and still competed with movies of this decade, and it's crazy to think it is approaching 30 years since its release.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the focus on the action makes the emotional weight shrink. Terminator 2 doesn't come off as close or cozy as the first, so depending on if one prefers the emotional or spectacular side of the premise, one will also claim either the first or second Terminator movie as their favorite.<br/><br/>A final word also about the violence - it is surprisingly brutal at times. Some scenes can be quite hard to watch, but beyond that, the movie is not more shocking or disturbing that the first. Remember to see the first Terminator movie before this one, as you will benefit greatly in terms of narrative details and appreciation of the characters.<br/><br/>One more thing - in terms of franchise consistency, this is where the Terminator saga ends. Future installments consistency fails to deliver at this height, or doesn't follow the established canon. They can be watched as movies that explores the Terminator concept, but Terminator as a franchise ends here.<br/><br/>My personal grade: an explosive 8/10.

"minhquanphamkt","10","0","3","16 February 2019"," Schwarzenegger is a genius!
","Schwarzenegger's genius as a movie star is to find roles that build on, rather than undermine, his physical and vocal characteristics. Here he becomes the straight man in a human drama - and in a human comedy, too, as the kid tells him to lighten up and stop talking like a computer. After the kid's mother is freed from the mental home, the threesome work together to defeat T-1000, while at the same time creating an unlikely but effective family unit. While that's happening on the story level, the movie surpasses itself with special effects. There are the usual car chases, explosions and fight scenes, of course, all well done, but what people will remember is the way the movie envisions T-1000. This cyborg is made out of a newly invented liquid metal that makes him all but invincible. Shoot a hole in him, and you can see right through him, but the sides of the hole run together again, and he's repaired and ready for action. These scenes involve ingenious creative work by Industrial Light & Magic, the George Lucas special effects shop. The basic idea for T-1000 was first tried out by ILM in ""Abyss"" (1990), in which an undersea station was invaded by a creature with a body made entirely of water. The trick is to create a computer simulation of the movement desired and then use a computer paintbox program to give it surface color and texture - in this case, the appearance of liquid mercury. The computer images are then combined with the live action; T-1000 turns from shiny liquid into a human being through a dissolve from the effect to the actor. All of that work would simply be an exercise if the character itself were not effective, but T1000, as played by Patrick, is a splendid villain, with compact good lucks and a bland expression. His most fearsome quality is his implacability; no matter what you do to him, he doesn't get disturbed and he doesn't get discouraged. He just pulls himself together and keeps on coming."

","Terminator 2 (1991) Review<br/><br/>Set ten years after the 1984 classic Arnold Schwarzenegger returns but this time his muscular cyborg is reprogrammed to protect the young John Connor. Meanwhile his mother Sarah Connor is doing time in a psychiatric prison because people think she is insane. John Connor is a troubled juvenile living with foster parents who he hates. He can hack into cash machines due to his mother preparing him for the future which even he doesn't believe. This time the robot on their trail is an unstoppable liquid metal cyborg played brilliantly by Robert Patrick who can morph his arms into knives, run really fast and change into anybody he touches<br/><br/>A few tiny nitpicks so say about it is retreads a few things from the original and the pacing sometimes feels slow. However the film never really stops for breath and the action has been amped up considerably since the last one. From an opening future war battle, two truck chases, a prison breakout and a few epic shootout scenes it's nothing short of breathtaking. They really focus on Sarah Connors journey here and Linda Hamilton plays her as a bad-ass who is always combat ready, doesn't trust anyone and can really defend herself. With all the action spectacle going on the film tackles a lot of themes like family, morals, friendship, war and even parenthood which is a testament to James Cameron's great writing. <br/><br/>From impressive sound effects, editing, music and cinematography Terminator 2 is one of the best action sci-fi films ever made, it's one of the most adored films of the 90s and easily the best sequel ever made. It was clear from the start that Cameron wanted to make a franchise from his original material. It has a much bigger budget than the last film leaving them to splash out on all the resources at hand to create the T-1000. Using state of the art CGI they pull it off with incredible results. Seamlessly mixing practical effects with CG animations the effects still look marvellous to this day. From a haunting vision of a nuclear bomb to the make-up effects it all just looks perfect."

Unlike the stupid TX from T3, which could create all kinds of weapons, the T1000 is a weapon. As long as it can stab or grab. It's grounded in physics of reality.

","Yes, that's my problem with all of the Terminator sequels. The first one was a perfect, time travel story. The machines sent a terminator back in time to kill John Connor before his birth, by killing his mother. So the humans sent Kyle Reese back to save her. Ironically, if the machines hadn't done that, John Connor would never have been born. It's a similar theme as the Film 12 Monkeys: you can't change the past. If you go back in time, you always had. 
But then, The Terminator is a massive hit so now you can change the past. This is a good action flick but they ruined the message of the first."

","This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CG. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.<br/><br/>But, a little bit of background is due. This is the sequel to the Terminator (1984), whose premise was that a near-indestructible cyborg is sent by evil self-aware machines from the near future to destroy the mother-to-be of the military commander who would lead the humans to a victory over the machines. Oh, and this terminator machine would come from a time of war between men and machines which followed a nuclear exchange that left billions of people dead, first. In Terminator 2, John Connor (the commander-to-be) is about 12 years old, and his mother (Sarah) is feverishly trying to prepare him for his fate, even as she tries to stop the factors that will lead to the nuclear war and the entire terrible future that made all this necessary. The machines now send a superior, more intelligent, shape-shifting cyborg (T1000) into the past, to kill John himself. Meanwhile, future-John reprograms the ex-evil Terminator (T101) from the original film, and sends him into the past to PROTECT John against the T1000."

","Honestly Scharwzie left me cold (I prefer Sly) but his two terminator movies are really great: this one is more action than science- fiction and if the chases are a bit repetitive, the movie is really enhanced by its cast: Hamilton the human mother is hard as a killing cyborg, T1 is a cyborg becoming human, Patrick is sensational as a deadly silent focused new cyborg and Furlong is awesome as the teen geek! Now for sure, some scenes seems a bit old-fashioned (the future) but at least, all the stunts were real and have this density factor! For me this movie is also an amazing game for Gameboy and expected articles from magazines! In fact, i understand that this 80s past has 2 major time paradox: John Connors father comes from the future and also T1 hand/Bio-chip as the foundation of Skynet! So it's a pity that the final is too much like the first one because i would do it more BTTF way: in front of this deadly and unbeatable T1000, i would have T1 plunge into this fire with the hand/Bio-chip and so T1000 would have been erased by this new continuum!! So it's indeed a fun movie that grips you but i would have put a bit less action for a bit more time paradox, great Scott :)"

"thewillt08","10","0","2","12 July 2013"," They Say Sequels Can't Be Better Than Thor Original, They're Wrong
","The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather Part Two are two sequels that many could argue are better than the originals. I think you can add Terminator 2 Judgment Day to that list. The Terminator was a blockbuster film and a sequel needed to be made. The story was too deep and detailed not to be made. The first movie mentioned John Connor a lot but obviously he wasn't born yet. This movie we see him as a kid and one of the most intense villains in movie history is out to kill him. Another version of the original Terminator also goes back in time to protect John Connor. We got an indestructible cyborg fighting another indestructible cyborg, yes please.<br/><br/>Once again the movie starts out with Arnold and the T-1000 going back in time, getting clothes and going after John Connor. The movie followed the same formula but Arnold is now the good guy, which I think is great. Arnold is given more material to work with and in the first one I said he was great as an emotionless robot and that was perfect because there was only one. Now there are two and his relationship with the kid is great. John's father is obviously dead and the Terminator plays the role as his father. Great, it worked, and I love how they even addressed is. I was a little worried about the kid because child actors can destroy a movie. I'm sorry but it's almost a proved fact but this kid worked. I didn't want to jump through the screen and kill him myself so there is a plus. The way he tried to make the cyborg ""human"" and gave him some personality was great because that is probably what would have done. He gives Arnold the idea of another memorable line that millions of people around the globe impersonate. ""Hasta la vista, baby.""<br/><br/>The T-1000, this guy is awesome. The first time he kills somebody with his metallic arm sword I almost pooped my pants, really. This guy knows how to kill somebody and he is stronger than Arnold was in the first movie, and more deadly. The only reason I think he wasn't as good s because he basically acted the exact same as the first one. He played the emotionless bad guy and is the heartless robot, cool, but it's been done. I'm glad he was the way he was but I like the original better. <br/><br/>When we first see John he lives with his foster parents making the audience ask the big question, where is Sarah Connor? Well, she is in a mental institution and her character has been completely transformed into a crazy killing machine. She is crazy. Perfect. I did not expect that but the road they went down worked perfectly. The end of the world and the fact that her son is the only hope of the human race gets to her and she lost it. Props to the actress too for bringing this character to life. She is delusional with her seeing Reece and her dreams of the actual end of the world. The scene where she is at the park behind the fence and the bombs go off is actually scary. The first time I saw it I was scared. One of the best moments in the movie she tries to escape, the lights go out, Arnold walks through the door in slow motion, and Sarah flips out. That entire scene was suspenseful and turned into an action packed car chase with guns blazing. I really liked Sarah in this movie and is my favorite character. I really liked the kid, Arnold was a lot better, but Sarah takes the cake. Her relationship with John is a little weak and is lacking but it's understandable because she is off her rocker. There are great characters and the action is better than ever but how is the story? Hmmmm, better than ever. The story in the first one was so good because of the back story and learning what happens in the future so how can they top that? How about preventing the future? Yes! In T2 we learn all more about Skynet and how the end of the world happens so the whole point of the movie is to prevent Judgment Day. The idea alone is hard to wrap my brain around. I am a sucker for a mind blow and nothing blows my mind more than time and time travel. Finally, we come to the action. The first movie had great action and special effects for the 80s and this tops that by a lot. The T-1000 takes a shotgun shell and looks like a soda can that got shot and he morphs back together like a jellyfish. I can imagine the 1991 audience with their jaws dropped, mine almost did. The Terminator is in its skin a lot more, meaning Arnold gets more screen time and the cyborg skeleton isn't fully shown. I liked that that and seeing one real eye any the creepy red eye is really cool. The car chases are better than ever and the explosions are great to. I understand John didn't want Arnold to kill people but there is one scene where Arnold is blowing up cars and using a minigun and there is no way he didn't kill anybody. Overall, Terminator 2 Judgment Day is a goldmine. Almost everything worked and it is one of my favorite movies. James Cameron is one of those directors who can mesh action and story really well. In most, if not all of his movies he can have great characters and special effects to back it up. It is very rare a sequel can be better than the original movie but there is no question about T2 and there is no question that Terminator 2 gets the WillyT Seal of Approval."

","Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's an outstanding sequel that I think, unlike most, manages to improve upon the original, it's more action packed, the story is more intense and James Cameron once again does a very impressive job of making us feel for these characters. It's very slow for a long period of the movie, which I have to admit was an issue, it keeps you waiting for lengthy periods and you'll simply begin to crave excitement, although it isn't a huge flaw as it does gives time to develop the characters. Arnold Schwarzenegger is given a bigger and better role this time around, he is still the Terminator, but is he quite different from the original, he is now protecting the Connor family, and despite the lifeless robot personality that Schwarzenegger does so well, we begin to feel real a genuine affection for this character, it was amazing that they managed to do this and it is one of the movies strongest high points. Action packed, emotional and intense, fans will definitely be happy with Terminator 2: Judgement Day and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or sci-fi film.<br/><br/>The Terminator is now programmed to protect John Connor from being killed by the deadly T-1000, a robot programmed to kill him several years before the war against the machines.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Arnold Schwarzenegger"
"classicsoncall","8","0","1","6 January 2012"," ""You can't just go around killing people!""
","I recall seeing this film when it first came out and remember my reaction thinking how cool it was to have Arnold turn the tables on his Terminator character by coming back as a good guy and the protector of Sarah Connor and her son. I haven't seen the picture since then until tonight, and even though it's twenty years later I'm still blown away by the special effects of the picture. The liquid metal alloy concept of Robert Patrick's T-1000 makes for a lot of clever mutations, with each one outdoing the one that went before. The one that really got me was when he rose out of the black and white tile floor of the hospital corridor. Very cool.<br/><br/>Story wise, I always have a little trouble with these time travel gimmicks. It seems to me that Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) understood the unintended consequences of his work with Cyberdyne, and the science that came out of the remnants of the 1984 Terminator were handily disposed of at the finale. So Arnold and Company effectively saved the present day AND the future, except that the future happened anyway. I may be missing something here, but I'm not going to dwell on it.<br/><br/>What I probably like most about the story is the relentless nature of the T-1000 to complete his mission, and the equal resolve that the Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 (that would be Arnie) has to stop him. Schwarzenegger once again parlayed his ability to deliver just a single line that has since become iconic - ""Hasta la vista, Baby"", getting by the rest of the way with his huge physique and a singular scowl. To her credit, Linda Hamilton literally got in shape for this picture by getting totally buffed, making her action sequences that much more believable. I'd probably be remiss if I didn't mention Edward Furlong for his portrayal as the young John Connor. I didn't really care for him at the start of the picture, but he grew into the role as the story progressed, becoming a sympathetic character by the time it was over."

The dialogue between him and John when the kid tries to learn him how to speak ""cool"" is simply hilarious. And even better; when he tries to smile at John's command. I laughed like I haven't in a long time. If not for anything else, just that scene alone makes this movie worth watching.<br/><br/>So all in all it's a good movie as what it aspires to be; an action movie.

"ametaphysicalshark","Null","0","2","6 February 2009"," A satisfying sequel
","""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a bigger, dumber, louder movie than the first, which on its own hardly a very intelligent film in the first place, but just a great action thriller with a fantastic atmosphere and interesting mythology. This sequel boasts better action scenes, better effects (or at least newer effects) and a better musical score, but is inferior in every other way: the characterization is trite, the acting mediocre, especially from Linda Hamilton (although the child actor who plays John Connor is surprisingly decent), and James Cameron more liberally uses his trademark corny dialogue about love and friendship, and adds a lot of humor. The humor actually worked for me, a lot of it did anyway, particularly when it was one-on-one stuff between the Terminator and John Connor.<br/><br/>More importantly, although it is very different and also inferior as far as I'm concerned, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a satisfying sequel. Not the one I would've made, but I can only dream of being in James Cameron's place, and this is most definitely not the misfire it could've been. Like ""Aliens"", this takes some aspects of the first film and puts them in a vastly different context of a non-stop action thrill ride. My preference is with the originals, both of which I feel have significantly better screenplays and better atmosphere, but this pretty much appears to be what Cameron wants to do with sequels: do it bigger, do it louder, do it with more explosions. At least in this case he is making a sequel to his own film and not someone else's. In any case this movie adds some significant details to the Terminator mythology and works as a good, albeit different follow-up to the original film.<br/><br/>Ahnuld's actually pretty good in this one in his own extremely limited sort of way, and as I said before I have few problems with the humor, although it gets a little messy when you have the worst of Cameron's sentimentality, the cheesiest of his humor, AND a big explosion in the same scene. Robert Patrick is easily the best actor in the movie, though, even if he's playing a similarly limited role. Again, it's the screenplay that's the big problem here: it's too intentionally mainstream, too for-the-masses. I have less of a problem with even ""Titanic"". There's almost no need to comment on the technical aspects of the film, which are all excellent of course and Cameron is one of the best action directors in cinema history, even if I have some issues with his sensibilities during the portions of the film in which explosions don't occur."
"Gore_Won","7","0","3","14 January 2008"," It held such big promise. Where did it go all wrong?
","I thought the first movie was perfect. It had bent the rules of the genre, but this second installment of the series, after a twist-filled beginning, fell back on Hollywood clichÃ©s. Like the machine that knew not human emotions. How original. Why didn't they run Shortcut instead - No. 5 was much cuter! Then there's the misogynist streak, where the boy puts the mother in her place. Reminds you of Jesus, doesn't it? Then, you get the ""scientists are the problems"" speech. We all know that the H-bomb wasn't used, so why bring it into the picture? Why not discuss the fact that the only time nuclear weapons were used, it was used by America to intimidate the commis (not the Japanese) in a war started by a nation that revered their king as God (yes, the Japanese). In other words, religion, not science, started the Asian theater of combat. Why not talk about that? A statistic to be thankful for: 70% of scientists in America and 90% of the most brilliant ones are atheists. I'd assume it's higher in other countries."
"mastermind123","10","0","1","18 July 2005"," Much deeper and more satisfying than the first
","Don't get me wrong, the original was a classic, but Terminator 2: Judgement Day is superior in just about every way. The first was essentially just a sci-fi action flick, and while it did what it did very well, it didn't really make you think about it after you saw it (Heroes run from Terminator. Terminator kills anywhere from 4 to 35 people. Terminator finds them. Heroes start running again. Rinse and repeat). While T2 may also be considered an action flick, it actually asks philosophical questions in the process, such as: is the murder of one justified if it prevents the murder of billions? <br/><br/>Philosophy aside, I enjoyed the action and fights in T2 more than the original. The special effects were obviously better than the first (one word: budget), and the acting as a whole was well above average (I even liked the kid who played John, though he could be a little annoying at times), and if I have any problems with the movie, it's that Michael Biehn (Reese) from the original wasn't in it. But given how flawless the rest of the movie is, I can let that slide. <br/><br/>Another thing I liked about T2 was its ending. I think it left a positive message, and wrapped the story up nicely (both terminators burnt to a crisp, all futuristic technology destroyed, stuff like that). I still can't figure out why they thought the series needed another installment (or how they managed to fit it into the plot), but that's money-hungry Hollywood for ya. <br/><br/>All in all, a spectacular movie by itself and a more than worthy sequel to the original. Ten stars out of ten."
"trapezus","8","0","1","10 May 2005"," Update now! Terminator v2.00 released!
","WARNING: This comment does not contain spoilers for Terminator 2, but it assumes that you have seen Terminator 1, so if you haven't seen it, be warned that the comment contains spoilers for Terminator 1.<br/><br/>Being interviewed about the Terminator 1, Swartzenegger has said: ""When we finished the movie, I told to Cameron: This movie should be REMADE as a sequel.""<br/><br/>And I think that this is the main point. This movie could be perceived as an improved version of terminator 1. Now, with: -An even more invulnerable terminator. -An even more self-sacrificial protector. -An addition of some awesome sci-fi effects and action scenes. -Improved the magnitude of the heroic and touching scenes. -Less bleak music(Terminator 1 music wasn't really bad, but it was giving the movie a great part of it's darkness). -Removed much of the predictability bugs. -Removed almost all of the darkness and brutality bugs. -Removed the horrible ""It's your destiny"" bug. -A transformation of the dreadful, scary and evil phrases of the first Terminator to the comic relief of the movie(e.g.""I'll be back""). -A general change of the style.<br/><br/>In terminator 1, a man was sent to protect a woman from an indestructible terminator. The style, however, of the whole thing, could make the viewer understand that the whole Terminator story is just the sci-fi effects. If you look it from a point of view, the ""subliminal"", let's say, story is either: 1)The terminator is Sarah Connor's cruel husband who seeks to kill her because she run away with her lover, Reese.(This the worst-case scenario) 2)Reese is Sarah Connor's husband and is determined to save her from a psychopath who wants to kill her for no reason.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think that Reese missed something as a protector. He came to die to save the woman he loved, which is one of the most closest things in the history of cinema. He is a noble soldier, but he doesn't inspire much respect.<br/><br/>In terminator 2, I think that the ""subliminal"" story was that the protector was John Connor's father, who came back in time determined to save his son from an evil killer, even if this is going to cost him his life.<br/><br/>Overall, I think that Terminator 2 was a very good movie, although it lacked slightly in smartness at it's whole spirit. <br/><br/>That's what I think. I could be absolutely wrong, so I advice you to read more comments for this movie if you want a better picture of the movie."

","John Connor (Edward Furlong), son of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) lives with his foster parents, while Sarah spends time in a mental hospital. John spends his time doing petty crimes with his friends, but then something happens: a liquid shape shifting android (Robert Patrcik) from the future starts to hunt him and another, older model (Arnold Schwarzengger) tries to protect him. It is now apparent to John, that his mother has always been right and so, he must bust his mom out and try to kill the liquid man, before it kills him.<br/><br/>Plot it self doesn't actually have any other surprises besides Arnold, who now plays a good guy opposite of his portrayal of evil Terminator in the first film. Rest of the movie flows in safe routes to the predictable, yet still greatly directed and thrilling ending.<br/><br/>Special edition, which is 20 or so minutes longer than the original gives some funny additional scenes, which won't move the story itself in a way or an another, but luckily they don't effect in the overall flow of the story<br/><br/>As for sequels go Terminator 2 is from the better end, still not as good as the first one, even tough it did bring lots and lots of cash.<br/><br/>Visually movie doesn't show any weaknesses, even tough it's made in 1991, when digital CGI effects where in their early ages. It shows, that T2 had biggest budget of it's era.<br/><br/>Not the most original Sci-fi flick out there, but still pretty good one, with lots of solid acting from everyone involved, mixed up with neat specials and action scenes."
"agmoldham","6","0","3","10 April 2004"," Arnie's back
","I always tend to avoid reviews prior to watching films and this really payed off with T2. The opening sequence is very much more dramatic when you have only seen the first film and don't know anything at all about the second film.<br/><br/>It's about 10 years after the first film and John Connor (Furlong) is a young boy living with foster parents. Sarah (Hamilton) is in a mental institution as she struggles to come to terms with her knowledge of the future. This time we have two terminators sent back in time representing the machines and the resistance. Technology has moved on and whilst this was groundbreaking in it's time it now looks slightly dated. The directors cut special edition doesn't really add too much to the thatrical release and makes it seem slightly slow at times. <br/><br/>Hamilton takes the acting awards with a good performance as Sarah. 8/10"
"dave-658","6","0","7","4 December 2002"," A hundred times smarter than its closest competitors
","This film has brains, an unusal occurance in action movies. Many of our greatest ""genre"" films often look like they are following that genre style, but incorporate a twist to give extra meaning. The ""extra meaning"" behind this movie is that those who have the power to kill others, should exericse restraint and choose not to. <br/><br/>In Terminator 2, you'll notice the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenneger) doesn't kill a single person (he uses scaring/maiming tactics), yet the only people who kill humans are ironically, other humans. This idea is summed up at the end when Sarah Connor proclaims that if a robot (the T-800) can learn the value of human life, perhaps we can too. The whole plot follows the theme of ""save humanity from itself"", implying we are our own worst enemy. We also see Sarah Connor deciding to not kill Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) when she sees him up-close and surrounded by his young son and wife even though she had resolved to kill him earlier. <br/><br/>The best parts of the movie is first and foremost the action, but the little details go a long way towards helping as well. One of my favorite small details were the physical brilliance behind both Terminator's actions. When Arnold had to drive the truck past the SWAT team into the building to pull out Sarah and and John, he swerved the car so the rear end would pull perfectly into the back allowing them to escape unharmed by the SWAT. This is just one example among many indicating the amount of work gone into writing the physical direction of both Terminators, and the logic involved really is just taken for granted but can be appreciated.<br/><br/>
This is a definite action classic because its incredibly smarter, on many more levels than other leading edge action films, such as John Woo's Hard Boiled. This film has brains because James Cameron is one our great cinematic geniuses. Get this on DVD!"
"Bob-45","8","0","2","14 July 1999"," Weak Premise, Great Movie
","Terminator 2 depends upon a premise contradictory to the original.  Since, according to THE TERMINATOR, only living things can travel through time, how could the completely liquid metal T1000 travel through time?  The theatrically released version also has one other very weak point.  How does John Connor (Edward Furlong) recognize the T1000 copy of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from his mother?  The Special Edition clarifies this, showing the T1000 malfunctioning.  This crucial scene should never have been deleted from the theatrical release.  Also, the only fakey sequences in the film are two shots using Stan Winston's Oscar-winning special effects.  Other than the T1000 malfunction sequence, the additional material in the Special Edition gives the film a sluggish middle.  Still, this an extremely powerful film, with fine acting from everyone, especially Robert Patrick, who is chilling as the T1000."
"harry-77","Null","0","3","27 February 1999"," Technically awesome but revoltingly violent
","Caught this on TV today for the first time and stayed with it but eventually was totally turned off by the excessive violence and blood-letting. And to have a small boy involved in all this was more than despicable. Sure, the film is amazingly well done and audiences have lapped it up, but I'm getting more than weary of contemporary stress on blowing up buildings, killing, trash-type characters and all those things that offend rather than entertain.  Yes, yes, I know I'm in the minority but frankly was so appalled by this film that I had to vent my spleen! I wish Hollywood would realize there are thousands of movie-goers who yearn for less disturbing stories on film."

"lotus_chief","6","0","1","2 October 2001"," Not as good as the original....
","Terminator 2, overall, is a good film. For its time (1991) the special effects is simply amazing. The whole story is excellent for a sci-fi film. But, the original is a better film on the whole. John Connor for example....is simply horrible in this film. I can't remember ever having to hear a voice more annoying than his in a movie. Because he is one of the main characters...we're forced to see him a lot, and unfortunately HEAR him a lot. There are certain scenes that are a bit corny or cheesy if you will... but I kinda expect that from James Cameron. Robert Patrick made himself pretty much here...I don't think anyone else could've played the T-1000 the way he did. The original Terminator was much more colder and darker....which I prefer for such a heavy story. I feel the story was more concrete in the original as well. Overall I enjoyed the film...despite the amazing special effects...I'm not sure if it surpasses ""The Predator"", done 4 years earlier. I give it a 6/10...but the original was better. And now that I hear Cameron will not do Terminator 3, I highly doubt if I will even bother with that sequel."

","O.K it has some bad moments, some plot holes, but even Star Wars had plot whole, basically the whole trilogy was a swiss cheese! Who cares, i love the Star Wars trilogy, ofcourse Star Wars had the force, mmm..., but it doesn't cover it's wholes does it? T2 has a story just like the first part, what does it make it unique? It has great effects, it is very well directed and appart from the story it brings out the problem of people understanding their selves, people killing their selves and the funny thing is that if a robot can understand human beings, why can't we understand ourselves? That's a good one but Cameron's intention was to make a big-bucks film. The whole ""philosophy"" really is there but it is covered by tons of bullets and loads of Shwargeneger! Cool result, *** out of *****. 6.9/10(the 0.1 is not there because this sequel, sequels suck!)"

","The T-1000 acts stupid at the end of the movie. Earlier in the film the T-1000 uses its ability to copy and kill another person at the same time on John's foster parents. It would be perfectly logical to use this ability once again, on John's mother, Sarah, at the end, instead of just stabbing her in the shoulder."

","I've heard people say that this is Cameron's best film. Please do not make me gag. Yes, it is a fantastic action film, it's technically flawless and I do love it, but it is NOT the best film he has made.<br/><br/>The whole thing is over-sentimentalised; Arnie's supposed to be a heartless, brutally efficient killing machine, not the oversized action figure John Connor turns him into.<br/><br/>Also, many of the elements are borrowed from Cameron's other films (e.g. see if you can spot the difference between T1000 opening lift and Alien sticking it's head in the APC).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it is a great film, and the T1000 edition is even better, but it's by no means Cameron's best work."
