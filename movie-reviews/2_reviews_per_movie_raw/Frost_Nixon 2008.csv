","A remarkable performance by Frank Langella as Richard Nixon transforms this unexpected Ron Howard film into a gripping and unforgettable experience. The behind the scenes of the famous David Frost, Richard Nixon interviews pale in comparison to the compelling sight of Nixon/Langella thinking. It was difficult to forget that Michael Sheen was not Tony Blair but David Frost. Sheen's Frost is an entertaining foil to Langella's somber,sad, desolate portrait of the former president. Ron Howard finds a winning pace giving the true tale a fictional slant. Unfortunately I never saw the stage production and the film never betrays its theatrical origins. In a bizarre sort of way this is Ron Howard's most cinematic film. I highly recommend it."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","127","159","15 December 2008"," Great cast, excellent screenplay
","The Frost/Nixon interviews are fascinating. Not every second of them, especially not when Nixon rambles on and on, avoiding questions by offering anecdotes in place of answers. Yet, they are an invaluable historical document, which allow us the rare privilege of seeing a major politician as a human being and nothing else. As interesting as the interviews themselves is the lead-up to them, the circumstances surrounding them, and the characters involved, particularly Frost and Nixon, of course. One could say that you only need to watch the actual footage, but there's ample room for a great dramatization, but it needed an even-handed approach, and certainly needed no political preaching.<br/><br/>I have a personal dislike for Ron Howard as a director, a result of my sensibilities mainly, I suspect. Howard strikes me as a particularly heavy-handed, didactic director who has wasted many great concepts on mediocre films (out of 18 films I've seen by him, I only genuinely liked ""Apollo 13"". I was expecting the worst with ""Frost/Nixon"", but instead was met with one of the most entertaining films in a while, and a remarkably well-acted, even-handed, quality character study. I suppose I should have been prepared for a quality screenplay given the success of this Peter Morgan play in New York and London, but I was hardly expecting something this good. It's glib, funny, well-paced, expertly-structured, clever, observant, and intelligent. It creates a fascinating Nixon, played brilliantly by the great Frank Langella, though this is not quite up there with the likes of Oliver Stone's sadly under-appreciated ""Nixon"" or Robert Altman's endlessly fascinating ""Secret Honor"". The film is almost surprisingly well-directed, although there is a bit of the old TV trick of shaking the camera a bit, panning too often, to give the illusion of motion and energy when there's really just people in a room talking. The conversation's interesting enough, there's no need for that. Oh well, I suppose I am nitpicking.<br/><br/>As far as Nixon movies go this is lightweight entertainment with plenty of comic moments largely leading up to two or three scenes of real human vulnerability. Aside from these scenes (which are truly, truly excellent), Peter Morgan conceives the meeting as something of a chess match with the unpredictability of a boxing match. To use J. Hoberman's words 'a prize fight between two comeback-hungry veterans, only one of whom could win'. On paper this could have been very heavy on amateur psychoanalysis and low on entertainment value but Morgan and I suppose Howard as well are clever enough to have some fun with the idea. This is not a criticism at all, the film has moments of surprisingly real depth and intellectualism, but overall the nature of the script works in its favor, makes those scenes more interesting, more ultimately rewarding.<br/><br/>""Frost/Nixon"" is an entertaining, exciting film, around as populist as I expected but in a very different way. This is the sort of writing we don't see enough of, particularly not in today's films. It's vaguely reminiscent of a particularly good BBC television drama. The cast is certainly good enough for that. Langella and Michael Sheen are outstanding, both manage to accurately portray the real-life men they are portraying while still adding some characterization and mannerisms of their own. Langella's Tony-award winning performance might be up for Oscar consideration soon, but Sheen's Frost almost upstages him at times. No heavy-handedness, no political 'messages', just a fun, clever script and a great cast in a well-made film."
"IMDb-627","9","90","113","16 October 2008"," Not to be missed! Vey rewarding
","I had the pleasure of watching this gripping movie at the opening night of the British Film festival. Ron Howard's direction and story telling ability are in top form with this effort. From the very first scene a carefully crafted and very credible 70s's atmosphere sets a solid stage for the superbly cast film and quickly transports the viewer into the political jungle that was ""Tricky Dickey's"" playground.<br/><br/>The acting duo of Frank Langella & Micheal Sheen (Nixon & Frost) are set on a collision course that finds two deeply passionate personalities at the mercy of their insatiable desires. Both actor's portrayals are a study of affectation and body language, pleasurably accurate and yet not simply an impersonation. Indeed, the film never strays from the distinct Howard format that breathes so much life (read intimacy) into this familiar and yet mysterious relationship that exists for so many people who lived through the exceptional event.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is by no means a two man show, quite the contrary. In fact, the wealth of supporting roles is perhaps the finest feature of this production. Bacon's devoted and stalwart marine practically glints of gun metal and polished shoe leather. The trio of Gould, Platt and Rockwell portray effortlessly the roles of the men who, brick by brick, constructed the platform from which Frost so successfully and serendipitously elicited one of the greatest unspoken confessions of all time. Rebecca Hall is delicious and demure, constantly filling scenes with her elegant presence.<br/><br/>Perhaps the richest praise should be reserved for Peter Morgan, who has, without question, penned a truly captivating and insightful story that delivers not only a satisfying comprehension of a complex time in US history, but captures a generation's struggle to come to terms with the frailty of leadership that still echoes today.<br/><br/>Not to be missed, this film can be enjoyed on multiple levels and will undoubtedly be regarded as seminal for it's engrossing insight and expert depiction."

","Frost/Nixon is one of the best film of the year, and certainly a strong contender for best picture. Langella's marvelous performance as the bedazzled Richard Nixon and Michael Sheen's terrific portrayal of the rigorous David Frost combined with Ron Howard's magnificent direction make the movie a memorable one. Not only that but the supporting cast- including Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Matthew MacFayden and Olvier Platt- was also phenomenal. Frost/Nixon is an epic, an epic that involves not guns and human sacrifices but words and tense emotions. It's also a historically significant film, for all who crave to know what really happened and whether or not Nixon didn't ""obstruct any laws."" In short Frost/Nixon is an amazing film filled with sharp dialogues, amazing performances and tense and provocative sentiments as well as an explosive yet subtle ending.<br/><br/>10/10 Go see it!"

"WriterDave","8","66","86","18 December 2008"," Mr. Nixon, It's Time for Your Close-up
","Ron Howard's competent film adaptation of Peter Morgan's play (who also scripted and co-produced here) dramatizes the famous Frost/Nixon interviews from 1977. At one point in the film, Kevin Bacon's character explains to Frank Langella's Nixon that a portion of the interview will focus on ""Nixon the man"". To which Nixon retorted, ""As opposed to what? Nixon the horse?"" Of course what was on everyone's mind at the time was Watergate and how American was never able to give Nixon the trial they so desperately wanted. Through the unlikely Frost interviews, the American people finally heard the truth behind the scandal--straight from the horse's mouth.<br/><br/>Morgan's source material translates smoothly onto film. Much as he did with ""The Queen"", he mixes a behind the scenes look at the immediate time period leading up to the historical event and closes with an almost word-for-word dramatization of said event. Also, like ""The Queen"", we have the excellent Michael Sheen on board, who after playing Tony Blair now takes on the mannerisms of the legendary British talk-show host and man-about-town David Frost. Director Ron Howard nicely interweaves archival news footage, faux-post interviews with the secondary players, and the dramatic reenactments of the actual Frost/Nixon interviews. Howard's studied but pedestrian style of direction lends itself well to this type of docudrama as he allows the actual events to speak for themselves and the fine performances to shine on their own. Though it takes quite awhile to get where it's going, the final interview where Frost takes Nixon head-on about the Watergate cover-up is a payoff well worth the wait.<br/><br/>Of course the most fascinating aspect of the film is Frank Langella's portrayal of a shamed and swollen Richard Nixon. He plays him as a fallen man desperate for an act of contrition but still in too deep with his old trickery and slick ways. His performance, and the way it connects with the audience, is wonderfully layered. On one level, we have an aged actor thought to be well past his prime firing back on all cylinders in a renaissance role that will likely lead to a showering of award nominations. The way the film reduces his performance to that one lingering close-up after being steamrolled by Frost on the last day of the interview leaves a lasting impression. But it also works on another level as it is meant to represent the reduction of Nixon's political life to that one lingering close-up on the television monitor when he realized it's all over for him. The audience members who remember watching the interviews and can picture the actual close-up they saw on their TV screens are now allowed to share a communion with the audience members who weren't even born yet and now only have a memory of Langella's face on the silver screen. In that sense, Langella truly became Nixon, and his performance will not soon be forgotten."
"Chris Knipp","8","119","162","10 November 2008"," Howard does not disgrace himself, and the play works better as a film.
","It didn't seem so in the run-up to the event, but British talk show host/interviewer David Frost's 1977 series of four on screen encounters with the disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon was great, historic television. This movie directed by Ron Howard successfully transfers the Peter Morgan play about the event to the big screen. Arguably, the story belonged here all along. The paraphernalia of a Hollywood production enables Howard to gussy up this claustrophobic event with such acoutrements as the luxury suite of a 747, Nixon's ""smart"" seaside villa La Casa Pacifica at San Clemente, and the impressive, downright menacing sight of a presidential motorcade. As the train of glittering, dark limos approach the Nixon friend's house where the interviews were shot it feels like a battalion of tanks; and Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall), the British socialite Frost chats up on the plane and makes his consort for the duration of the exploit seems the more slinky and glamorous for emerging from a posh airplane rather than a bare stage. Lighting tricks and artful camera angles help make Frank Langella morph more successfully into Nixon than his physicality would otherwise permit. Michael Sheen as Frost already seems to look and sound like his character, and the ""monkey suit"" blue blazer outfits add the final touch. His task is easier; we don't know so well or care so much what Frost was like. In the film version, both performances take on more nuance. Langella's performance on camera brims of with dyspeptic melancholy, aggression, and self-pity; Michael Sheen's as frost glitters with a muted, hysterical cheer mixing infantilism and fear. The extra visuals of a film also help to show Nixon's comfort and loneliness and Frost's sleazy playboy side.<br/><br/>It's important that the fakery should work well, because the movie must provide lots of closeups that those in the balcony didn't see. So long as it works, the feeling of TV interviews is better achieved in the film, and the actors don't have to yell. The camera, sometimes annoyingly jerky, but in the best moments simply direct and relentless, does their yelling for them.<br/><br/>So I'm saying this is a winner. Peter Morgan after all did the screenplay, and he's no stranger to such efforts--notable examples of his film writing are in The Last King of Scotland and The Queen; a rather less notable one is The Other Boleyn Girl. The flaws are simply in the events. For three of the interview parts, till it gets to Watergate in the fourth, Nixon seems to be winning. Despite a dramatic intervention by Nixon support staffer Col Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) to prevent an abject breakdown, Nixon does buckle under in part four. But his admissions still remain in the realm of generality, and there is the question: does anything said on TV really matter? The audience for a West End or Broadway play is a bit different from the popcorn crowd and how appealing this film will be to the mainstream is uncertain. Needless to say it's all talk and minimal action. For students of contemporary American history nonetheless the topic is thrilling. Frost used his own money for down payments. In need of cash and highly mercenary, Nixon used the celebrity agent Swiftie Lazar (Toby Jones) to get $600,000 for the interviews. Frost lost sponsors and the US networks refused to come aboard. He made down payments from his own funds and borrowed. He hired two journalists, Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston (Sam Rockwell), to do support research. Reston was a firebrand opponent of Nixon. He refused to participate unless there was a commitment to shame Nixon and get him to admit he did wrong in Watergate and betrayed the country's trust.<br/><br/>The issue was whether Frost had the depth to tackle a job like this. He wanted a Watergate confession too, but he let Nicon play him with small talk (despite the man's claim that he was no good at it) and temporize with lengthy self-serving reminiscences that blunted most of Frost's pointed questions. This is where Zelick and especially Reston come in to give a sense of urgency. Again the film excels where the play couldn't in showing Nixon's walk out to his car after each encounter, jubilant at first, pathetic at the end.<br/><br/>Ultimately both in the play and the film, Frost's victory seems a hollow one, of little significance to morality or history. This is above all a story about television. In that arena, this was a coup. and there is great drama in how close Frost's project came to failing. As the encounters got under way, he was losing every sponsor, and later he lost his Australian show, having some time earlier lost his American one. The film tells us they all came back, and then some. Frost never really seems to have reentered the world of American television, but he has had many projects in England and is said now to be ""worth £20 million,"" with a live weekly current affairs program on Al Jazeera English. Nixon is dead, and though he may have won three rounds out of four in the Frost interviews, his legacy is tainted.<br/><br/>The show belongs to Sheen and Langella, but Bacon is excellent as the stiff, loyal Col. Brennan, and Sam Rockwell strong in an unusually serious role for him. As Nixon's somewhat lost wife Pat, the child star of The Bad Seed Patty McCormack is touching. There are lots of other actors, far more than in the stage production, and the best thing is they don't get in the way. San Clemente also plays a significant role. The brightness and beauty of Nixon's ocean-side estate helps dramatize his depression by contrast. There were doubts about putting Howard in charge of the screen version, but they were groundless."
"motta80-2","9","101","146","16 October 2008"," Howard redeems himself with a truly compelling film that leaves its theatrical roots behind
","It is a testament to Peter Morgan's humility and skill as a writer and Ron Howard's ability to take a based on real events story to which the outcome is widely known and create a compelling ""what will happen"" drama (as he did with Apollo 13) that Frost/Nixon succeeds as a film.<br/><br/>This is a film based on a play that neither felt trapped in staginess nor weakly expanded with just the stage dialogue delivered exactly but in a variety of outdoor locales. I have to give Peter Morgan a lot of credit here. I saw the play in London and wondered throughout production of the film how they would escape its theatricality. Many recent films from plays like Proof, Closer, The Producers, have failed to throw off the shackles of stage feel. Not that all bad films, many served as a good way to see the play if you hadn't had the chance, but they weren't necessarily compelling films in their own right. What is so impressive about Morgan's work here is that in adapting his own play he has not been precious, he has not tried to enforce his already successful stage-play onto a film director  he has wholly reworked it from beginning to end and yet retained all the gravity and drama that the play elicited. If you saw the play everything key is here and yet you can feel the difference  the pacing is changed, the power achieved in different ways.<br/><br/>For this Howard also deserves credit. To have filmed the play as it was would have been disastrous on film  one long two-hander scene after another, duelling narrators. And given the reverence the play has enjoyed a less experienced director could have fallen into this trap or that of simply changing the settings, but Howard knows when we need quick cuts, when a long drawn out piece that worked on stage needs to be reduced to a couple of lines and a post-scene reaction, and when he needs to hold with a scene and let it play between the two leads. This happens in several impressive moments in the latter half of the film.<br/><br/>For some this might constitute the films biggest flaw however. Morgan and Howard can't escape the fact that in the final stages of the film it is the head-to-head scenes of Frost and Nixon that are key and they must stay with them more. This is necessary, but it sadly means that the supporting players, so well established and broadened out to expand the scope in the first half, fall be the wayside. A superb Toby Jones as Irving 'Swifty' Lazar, Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt and always reliable Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick all but disappear and only Kevin Bacon and Sam Rockwell play any significant role beyond the two leads in the final stages. This is a shame. It may best serve the story creating the sense of claustrophobia necessary to keep you gripped but it does feel like a film of two halves because of it and it noticeable.<br/><br/>Frank Langella and Michael Sheen are superb, as they were on stage, and Langella will take a lot of beating for the Oscar this year. There are many moments here when I was so involved I forgot I wasn't watching the real Nixon. It's not that he looks that like Nixon but he is so real you believe it completely and have to remind yourself you're watching an actor.<br/><br/>Platt is reliably Platt. Bacon is also his typically understated solid presence doing a lot with little. Toby Jones is fantastic in a small role  instantly memorable; and Rebecca Hall builds on a series of strong performances. But in the supporting cast it is Rockwell that stands out. Sure, he has the most to do but he is completely in this role, he manages to sink into the role which is something he rarely does. He matches the skill he showed in Lawn Dogs and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind here and it is great to see him back at his best.<br/><br/>I thoroughly recommend this film."
"janos451","Null","71","103","11 December 2008"," 'Frost/Nixon' - not what you think
","I almost skipped ""Frost/Nixon,"" and I am glad I didn't. It's eminently worthwhile, one of the year's few films that deserves to be seen.<br/><br/>My reluctance had to do with the expectation that it will offer nothing new to somebody who lived through the Watergate years and saw the Frost interviews (although remembering surprisingly little of them).<br/><br/>Ron Howard's film is anything but ho-hum - if anything it's a bit too gussied up to be exciting. There is an element of discernible manipulation of the audience, but mostly it works, and you don't long resist it.<br/><br/>The (relatively) unsung hero of the film besides Howard, Frank Langella's tremendous Nixon, and Michael Sheen's excellent Frost is the screenwriter: once again Peter Morgan (of ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""The Queen"") engages mind and heart, and doesn't let go. Sam Rockwell's James Reston, Jr. and Oliver Platt's Bob Zelnick (Frost's two collaborators) are outstanding, and Kevin Bacon's Nixon-worshipping Jack Brennan is the actor's best work in a long time.<br/><br/>Morgan and Howard manage to make the viewer think constantly of another criminal President without saying or showing anything overt - they just let history, past and present, speak.<br/><br/>I had a strange, uncomfortable thought watching ""Frost/Nixon"": even if some future film ""humanizes"" (not excuses) Bush the way Nixon comes through this one, W. would still remain a malevolent midget against Nixon's accomplishments and actual *brain*. How far we have fallen."
"tranquilbuddha","Null","67","98","2 December 2008"," An extraordinary film
","Frank Langella's performance as Nixon is truly moving in this remarkable film by Ron Howard, which gripped me for its entirety. As someone who grew up during the Watergate hearings, and who reviled Nixon as the embodiment not just of corruption but of the worst kind of interventionist, even genocidal, American politics, this film gives substance to a man who, in later years (especially the GW Bush years, which make Nixon look like a political and intellectual colossus), achieved something of a place in history beyond the scandal of Watergate.<br/><br/>But what Frost/Nixon - and in particular Langella - does is give humanity to the man. We see his arrogance, his love of power, his need to win (hinted at wonderfully in a moment when he is jogging in his San Clemente home to rousing music), but we also see his inner conflicts, his regrets, the fact that perhaps more than simply his crimes regarding Watergate haunted him - that the impact of his decisions on South East Asia were not entirely remote from him, either. And in a sequence that I will not reveal, to avoid spoiling the plot, we also see a hint of his madness, for it is that, I think, rather than senility. (You have to see it to understand this.)<br/><br/>Ron Howard and playwright/screenwriter Peter Morgan have achieved a remarkable feat in adapting the stage play, which sadly I did not see. Not for a moment does this feel stage bound; instead it is a compelling human portrait of two men - for Frost is fascinating, too, and Michael Sheen captures both his much criticized (at the time) surface gloss and also his deeper fears - but above all of the impact that each of our decisions, large and small, and not least if you are leader of the ""Free World,"" have on us all."
"MartinHafer","9","5","5","12 September 2011"," Exceptional--especially for Langella's dynamite performance.
","What I am about to say may sound a little mean. However, until recently I never took Frank Langella all that seriously as an actor. With film credits like ""And God Created Woman"" (1988), ""Masters of the Universe"" and ""The 12 Chairs"", I hadn't seen very much from him that was outstanding in any way. However, here in ""Frost/Nixon"" he demonstrates that my preconceptions was definitely wrong--he is a darn fine actor. His performance as Nixon was wonderful--especially when it COULD have come off as a parody--like Rich Little doing a Nixon impersonation. But, he was able to capture the man very well--and, provide a bit of insight into a very enigmatic man.<br/><br/>As for Michael Sheen, who co-starred and played David Frost, he was excellent as well--but he did not dominate the movie like Langella and really couldn't due to his character. Making Frost any different would have been unrealistic and the viewer is naturally drawn more to the Nixon character--even if they dislike him.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it's a film that is probably going to appeal to you more if you know a lot about the Watergate affair. This means that younger folks who didn't live through and remember the 1970s will get less out of it unless they know their history well. As for me, I'm a retired history teacher, so even if I was only a kid when Nixon resigned, I understand what had occurred and the figures involved. So, when names of the various people involved are mentioned or what exactly Nixon's involvement was in the cover-up are discussed, it would sure help to know the basics. If you are fuzzy on this, reading through Wikipedia or another website wouldn't hurt.<br/><br/>Looking at the film's box office receipts, I could assume that because Watergate is a rather distant memory is why the film made so little money. After all, the acting and writing certainly were not at issue--they were top-notch. And, I must also admit, the film was quite cerebral and there aren't a lot of things to appeal to teens or someone who likes explosions or raunchy comedies (you do get to see a gratuitous butt near the end, but this isn't enough to appeal to this crowd). An amazingly good film."
"alexkolokotronis","8","52","91","29 January 2009"," A Solid Film That Will Fade Into the Background
","Frost/Nixon was indeed a good movie but the question is ""will it stand the test of time?"". I seriously doubt it. The performances are admirable and the writing is very good but I was not overly impressed compared to other movies I have seen.<br/><br/>The acting was good throughout the cast. Frank Langella was good but not spectacular as Richard Nixon. In my mind I will have Anthony Hopkins as Nixon not Langella. In Nixon strange emotions were brought up towards the man himself, in here Nixon seems to be quite a very good man. This I had a problem with, I liked the approach of him not being shown as an evil man but I did not like the fact he appeared to better than he was. I felt that Michael Sheen stole the show from Langella and in fact played better than him. His performance was more diverse and versatile and of course the movie is about him interviewing Nixon not Nixon interviewing Frost.<br/><br/>The directing was solid as usual of Ron Howard. Yet with the character of Nixon he seemed to be pushing the idea of sympathy upon us for Richard Nixon. When it comes to feeling emotions such as sympathy, it should not be pushed upon you. Many scenes though were quite intense but this movie was carried by the writing of Peter Morgan. The nice quick dialog between the characters is what really set the tone of the film above all.<br/><br/>I liked Frost/Nixon but it is not a powerful movie. It sets a good tone at the beginning and stays with it throughout. Like other Ron Howard movies it doesn't take a giant leap of greatness. It does have moments of greatness and a few memorable scenes but not enough to really stand the test of time. I do not believe it deserves its best picture, best director or best actor nominations as other men and movies have had more powerful and affecting influence this year."
"ElMaruecan82","9","3","3","14 July 2015"," David Frost vs. Goliath Nixon ...
","There's a brief but memorable moment in ""Frost/Nixon"" where one of Nixon's most ardent haters, a researcher played by Sam Rockwell, is about to confront for the first time the man he holds responsible for the destruction of American ideals. This is his time to shine and honor his opinions by not shaking the 'Shakers' hand. Yet, despite a brief hesitation, he gives both hand and respect. That says it all, there's the politician, there's the man, and one of the greatest tricks a corrupt one ever pulls is to hide behind the mask of friendliness.<br/><br/>No one can resist it, much less a TV audience. In my student's essay about the power of media -which is the film's essential theme- I wrote that the camera not only changes perceptions but actions too. As long as there is an instance of mediation between two people, something will cease to be natural, and the talent of those who control the media is to make it imperceptible. So, when Frost (Michael Sheen) decides to interview Nixon, with his own money because no American channel will accept to pay a British interviewer, he gives the fallen President a golden opportunity to talk to American people. Nixon (Frank Langella) advised by Swifty Lazar (Toby Jones) accepts the challenge, a TV show will reach the people quicker and simpler than a memoirs book.<br/><br/>It all comes to this : either Nixon shows a new shining image three years after the Watergate and his disastrous resignation, the only one in History, or Frost confronts a man to his responsibilities and forces him to admit his guilt. That's what Frost's partner John Birt (Matthew McFayden), Bob Zelnick, a TV journalist (Oliver Platt) and James Reston, Jr. (Rockwell) expect from the interview, anything but making Nixon sympathetic. With these opposite challenges, the premises could be that of a boxing match. And ""Frost/Nixon"" is indeed a duel (the slash is relevant) with no holds barred between huge and flawed egos, starting with Frost, a cocky womanizer trying to forget that he was basically exiled in Australia to host forgettable entertainment shows, the refusals from TV studios to sponsor his project will finish to teach him lessons of humility.<br/><br/>But Nixon plays in another league, being the epitome of 'unpopular culture', a tragic figure who destroyed what were left of American dreams, including his own. In 1995, Oliver Stone offered a remarkable view on Nixon, with no concession. Still, we couldn't help but feeling sympathy for a man entrapped by both his ideals and demons. The movie was remarkably served by Anthony Hopkins' performance but now, I wonder if it doesn't have something to do with the personality of Nixon himself, ambivalent to the best, with this mix of fascination and repulsion only great men achieve to inspire. Maybe he was the last 'larger-than-life' President. Anyway, he's not an amateur and during the interview, he's like Goliath ready to frost David.<br/><br/>Goliath Nixon also has a redoubtable right-hand man (Kevin Bacon) who works as an adviser and he knows himself the traps of TV, he whose sweating under the upper lip cost him the Presidential campaign in 1960, so he wouldn't make the same mistakes. David Frost IS the rookie and when the first interview (we might as well call it a round) starts, Frost bluntly opens with the Watergate ""why didn't you burn the files?"" Nixon is startled first but uses the question to pose as a victim of a system supported by his predecessors. Trying an uppercut, Frost was literally knocked down, tasting the toughness of an opponent who meant business. And as viewers, we're satisfied to see Frost put in his place for a moment, before he could recover.<br/><br/>The measure of the thrills provided by the interviews is because both have everything to win, yet so much to lose. Nixon is in a dead-end and any attempt to gain his popularity back is welcome, and by throwing himself in that crazy project, Frost lost his show, 600 000 dollars and jeopardized his career, maybe more and I'm not sure his newly conquered girlfriend, Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) would've stayed longer with him. In her one shining moment that doesn't rely on her distractingly beautiful looks, she notices that Frost doesn't like being questioned. And that weakness shows with Nixon's offensive remarks before the interview, destabilizing him on his effeminate shoes or his 'masculine attitude' with Caroline. No holds barred indeed, the two men bet a lot in this interview, and it's like two destinies crossing one another.<br/><br/>The remarkable thing about Ron Howard's movie is that we all know it ended with a heartfelt confession from Nixon, one of the most memorable and defining TV moments of the 70's. But it's all in the process, on how Frost will finally take the edge over Nixon and find the vulnerable spots, or use his adversary's weapons against him, not through cynicism or aggressiveness but the true belief that his project is fair and for once, the variety show producer must act like a journalist. A man who failed as journalist must not interview the one who failed as a President. And this is why they were so close, yet so different from each other.<br/><br/>It is between the two men and the others are only spectators, filling the film with many interesting comments about the evolution of the match, and what lessons they learned from the confrontation. A man should feel important enough to believe in his rightness but never such as he can escape from his responsibilities. The lessons served both men, and the ending is twice happy as each one seemed to have triumphed over his demons. Sometimes, truth hurts, but how relieving it can also be!"

","Peter Morgan adapted his wonderful stage play Frost/Nixon for film with tremendous success. Directed by Ron Howard and starring Michael Sheen as David Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon, it tells the behind-the-scenes story of the famous series of interviews.<br/><br/>For all many of us who lived through the Nixon presidency and Watergate, this is not the stuff of nostalgia or happy reminiscence. And when the Nixon tapes were published and his bigotry against just about everyone was revealed in explicit ""expletive deleted"" language, it was time to get disgusted all over again.<br/><br/>Here, portrayed by Frank Langella, we see Nixon as a lonely, vulnerable, angry, and bitter human being, a man who's made a bed he must sleep in for the next twenty years. We also see a manipulative and highly intelligent individual who, despite a great deal of success, had no self-worth. It's the feeling of being an outsider, of never being good enough, that led him to some atrocious decisions.<br/><br/>It's Langella's performance and Michael Sheen's wonderful performance as David Frost -- playboy, comedian, talk show host, and party-giver turned investigative journalist -- that anchor ""Frost/Nixon."" They are given great support by Kevin Bacon as Nixon's protective assistant, Jack Brennan, Sam Rockwell as James Reston, determined that Nixon pay for Watergate, as well as Oliver Platt, Matthew Mcfadyen, and Toby Jones.<br/><br/>I found the determination of Frost as he attempted to raise financing for the interviews and get networks interested -- with no luck -- very admirable and inspiring. And his gut instinct paid off for him big time.<br/><br/>I transcribed an interview with Nixon that took place in his home in the 1980s, as well as a speech he made during one of the Presidential election periods. He was a brilliant speaker, and as an interviewee, when the interview was over, he engaged the reporter in a very friendly personal conversation. In the end, both those listening experiences made me sad, as did this film. For everything he achieved, Richard Nixon had undeveloped gifts and potential. He robbed the world of a lot more than the ability to trust government. But in the end, as the film shows, he robbed himself the most."

","Nixon might had lied countless times but this film doesn't, except for some artistic license or other that is necessary to make the story more spicy or to fill a drama and tension that might have never existed during the famous Frost/Nixon interview. <br/><br/>Ron Howard directs ""Frost/Nixon"" a thrilling story with the behind the scenes of one of the most famous broadcasts ever presented in television, and that is the meeting between Former President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) and English TV host David Frost (Michael Sheen) after the President's impeachment. This meeting will be just like a long awaited boxing match between two heavyweights and it will take all of their power, intelligence and courage to make of this event something memorable and it will be memorable. Behind these two fearless men there's a great team assisting, played by Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Matthew McFayden, Rebecca Hall, Oliver Platt and Toby Jones.<br/><br/>Transforming a play of success into a film is a very difficult job but writer Peter Morgan adapted it perfectly, with wonderful dialogs exchange between Sheen and Langella and all the actors, balancing drama, comedy, heated discussions, and of course, using quotes of the real interview, one of the most successful events ever presented on TV, very historical. <br/><br/>Allied with a magnificent screenplay there's a highest quality of the performances. Langella might sound and look like a Nixon caricature but he manages to portray the President in his emotional and darker sides, a figure that needs to be doing something useful other than just be a retired politician, always in the arena even if that arena is a TV show where he might get trapped with his demons, face to face with the American public. Sheen makes of his Frost a entertaining man who gives a leap into a whole new field (a serious interview with a former president) where he needs to find a way to survive or win what could be the battle for his career, his reputation, but more than that he wants to be a star in America making the interview of the Century. Two men without their masks in front of a whole audience trying to win a battle where the winners are us the viewers delighted with such incredible moments. The supporting cast is top-notch and is amazing to see all of them together in such a brilliant project.<br/><br/>Explosive in its content, thrilling in its presentations without losing the rhythm and the movement, ""Frost/Nixon"" comes as one of the most absorbing films ever made. It was everything I expected and more! Brilliant! 10/10"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","3","3","13 May 2010"," Marvelous
","The sole reason I did not watch this in the cinema two years ago was that I could not find a theater near me that played it, and I was, as I am now, a busy student. That caused me to have to take breaks in my viewing of it, and I have to say, it was not easy to do so. It is, simply put, immensely gripping, and the ending is pitch perfect. I haven't seen the play, but I understand that this expands upon the people around the two who were engaged in the verbal boxing match, especially Cushing. The two leads are the same, and I can get behind getting them to do both versions. They are immensely talented(they had the material so committed to memory that they only flubbed once each), and Sheen is an absolute chameleon, disappearing entirely into what he portrays(I can just barely believe that he played Lucian in the Underworld trilogy... great job in those, by the way). The cast is fantastic, and everyone really delves into their credible and swiftly developed characters. This manages to not paint anyone as a one-note good or bad guy, and I have to admit, I did not feel any sympathy for the former president before this film. The acting is amazing. Dialog is excellent. A little of it was improvised; so was most of the camera-work, and it helps make it feel dynamic and natural. This builds tension rather well. The drama is compelling. There is a short sequence of disturbing content, infrequent strong language and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track by Howard, a well-done 23 minute behind-the-scenes production, 22 and a half minutes of deleted scenes, and two well-made featurettes of 7 and a half minutes(about the real interview) and six minutes(about the Nixon library), respectively. I recommend this to anyone interested in the subject. 8/10"
"Vondaz","5","12","19","24 February 2011"," Enjoyable as a story - flawed as a representation of the truth
","I had never seen the real interview between Frost and Nixon and so came into this movie totally fresh. The story is engaging, the script enjoyable and the acting fine. At the end though, I didn't get what all the fuss was about. I didn't get a ""he said it!!"" moment.<br/><br/>The film implied that Frost had gotten Nixon to admit to something no-one else could (i.e. something illegal), thereby condemning himself to political wilderness. However, instead I was left feeling that Nixon was an OK guy - an intelligent, quick witted, sincere and strong guy who did what it took to get things done. Whereas Frost came across as a chancer, who was a bit lucky. At the end I wondered what the purpose of the movie was.<br/><br/>I have now seen the actual footage of the interviews and can only conclude that the movie's purpose was to show Nixon in a much more favourable light than he would've come across in the real interviews - because in the real interviews, he stinks. In the real interviews you can see the panic in his face, you can see the often painfully contrived shows of friendliness in his mannerisms and you can hear the uncoordinated logic of his answers. Whereas in the movie he's smooth with his answers and his mannerisms.<br/><br/>Any Brits out there should liken Nixon to our very own Gordon Brown - a man as bereft of any social attractiveness as Nixon. By getting Langella to play Nixon, it's like getting Alec Guiness to play Brown. I.e. a brilliant actor, but a million miles away from the truth.<br/><br/>And THAT'S the problem with these recent ""real life"" movies that focus on people in high offices of state - The Queen, The Special Relationship and now Frost/Nixon. The films make the people in high office appear to be totally articulate, very quick witted, sincere, at times funny and always strong in character and determination. Whereas the truth is anything but that. We've seen footage of a supposedly eloquent Clinton and he is anything but. We've seen the Queen deliver her speeches and ""sincerity"" is never a word you'd associate with her.<br/><br/>I know the counter argument is that it is only a movie and we shouldn't take it literally. But that's just it, by giving the film ""real"" characters and ""real story"" lines, the film makers are implying it is real. In fact, it is the very suggestion that it might be factual that draws the audiences in. Otherwise where would the attraction be of seeing a film about a fictional President's relationship with a fictional Prime Minster? Or a fictional queen's reaction to the death of a fictional daughter in law? There would be no attraction. So the makers have lured us paying public to part with our hard earned cash to see something that promises fact but instead delivers fiction.<br/><br/>So yes, I enjoyed the ""story"", but ended up resenting its total fiction."
"Simon_Says_Movies","9","13","23","15 January 2009"," Entertaining and Rich, Howard's Best
","Movies centered on politics are often interesting on an intellectual level, but never has a film of such an ilk been so thoroughly entertaining. Director Ron Howard's adaptation of the stage play of the same name, manages to both stay loyal to the true events that served as inspiration, yet infuses it with life and achieves the utmost level of satisfaction without compromising the rich and weighty subject matter. Infused with sensational performances throughout, Howard has delivered what I think is his best film yet.<br/><br/>Beginning with President Richard Nixon's (Frank Langella reprising his role from the play) resignation following the Watergate scandal, the movie jumps to a few years later where the ex-president has been demoted to giving talks at luncheons, and interviews for money. Meanwhile down under in Australia, a wildly popular talk show host named David Frost (Michael Sheen) comes up with the ultimate publicity stunt; winch out the confession the American people never got from their former president. Nixon has other plans however, seeing only easy money for answering some fluff questions over a four day period. Frost assembles a team of researchers and experts including Sam Rockwell as James Reston Jr., Mathew McFayden as John Burt and Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick to ensure his suave defeat of his opponent and secure their place in infamy.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon succeeds in overcoming a number of hurdles. It flourishes, even if you have no knowledge of the events of Watergate, or have no interest in American politics, but will thrill those who do. From what I understand, certain liberties were taken with the facts surrounding the endlessly notorious interviews, but more often then not, Frost/Nixon is less of a political film, then it is a sword and shield bout to the death; an intense duel between these two intellectuals, and how their confidence and overconfidence sways the interviews in both their favours before the gripping final outcome<br/><br/>Frank Langella is sure to get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the infamous president, but Michael Sheen should by no means be overlooked. He is equally solid, and to some extent has the more difficult role; in keeping his own against the veteran stage actors larger then life embodiment of the president. We also get fantastic supporting work from Kevin Bacon as Nixon's aid who's two-fold admiration and quiet pity and embarrassment is tragic and very affecting. From a visual standpoint, Howard's film is glossy and superbly shot without feeling to large in its scope. It is intimate and immediate with a keen sense of the times. <br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest achievement of the movie is the handling of the Nixon character. Howard manages to capture both his corruptness and smug pompousness while showing him as a true human; with some sympathy but mostly just not as a faceless monster and without a blunt bias. So don't be turned away simply because of the films 'political' backbone, because Frost/Nixon is some of the most simultaneously intelligent and entertaining film-making of the decade. <br/><br/>9.5 / 10.0 <br/><br/>Read all my reviews at : http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
"dataconflossmoor-1","10","8","13","12 June 2009"," Frost Nixon, When Finished, Serve With Ice Cream!!
","This film focused on the infamous Watergate break in of the Democratic National Committee during the summer of 1972!! As it turned out, the whole Watergate fiasco wound up being, much to the revelation of the American people, something which the Nixon administration was peccant for. When the Watergate incident hit the media, the principle bone of contention was that television was after showmanship, and that the major deception with T.V. was that the news anchors merely simplified disaster. When an onslaught of scandalous theatrics occurred with the Nixon White House, such culpability on the Nixon Administration's behalf was labeled as illicit and nefarious! These actions that the Nixon Administration engaged in were a total exploitation of executive power. Nixon and his cabinet were initially nonchalant about Watergate, eventually, as trouble with the Watergate break-in began to escalate, the Nixon Administration responded accordingly. At best, Richard Nixon and key aids of his expected no higher than a grade of a D- for political containment. When the final verdict of a resounding red F was issued to the Nixon White House for their reprehensible breach of trust with the American people, impeachment proceedings began immediately. The intransigence with the U.S. voters about the Watergate break in resulted in Nixon having to resign from his post as President of the United States. This is something no other President was ever forced to do in the history of our nation. As a result, Richard Nixon acquired a peptic ulcer. The resonating aftermath with the American people was one whereby they wound up delving in dirges of shame and self righteous indignation for a protracted period of time, and the rest, as they say, is history!!. For David Frost, however, this was merely the beginning of his bloodthirsty agenda!! The Watergate scandal was perceived as an instance of espionage, and political corruption that the United States citizens were totally ashamed of. The Watergate affair was perceived by David Frost as a potential for a pique in publicity and soaring ratings for his talk show career. What was identified as pejorative for the American public's codes of decency, became an auspicious endeavor for nationwide television notoriety!! Complications with the Richard Nixon interview were dealt with in an insidiously successful manner. These were the ground rules, simply circumvent the BBC, and, as far as sponsors were concerned; SO WHAT!! Oldsmobile and Honeywell will not sponsor this event, but Alpo Dog Food will!! Bottom line: The show must,and will go on!! Once the interview with David Frost and Richard Nixon commenced, Nixon enjoyed a preliminary advantage. Richard Nixon was very elusive, as a result, he was perpetually caricatured as well as extremely underestimated in terms of his knowledge of the prevailing political arena!! Both Frost and Nixon shared the unnerving proclivity of being afflicted by compulsive behavior. It was the final interview which opened up an ideological metamorphosis pertaining to the purpose of this entire string of interviews. David Frost's intrepid disposition during this interview now made Richard Nixon (the private citizen) capitulate to a heinous admission of guilt yet another time, thus making Nixon the fall guy once again!! The entire string of Frost/Nixon interviews was initially perceived as an ersatz replacement for other ideas such as a banal discussion about male menopause with some Columbia chancellors. Ultimately, these Frost/ Nixon interviews became transformed into a harsh exposure of the myriad of character discrepancies which lurked in the Oval Office while Richard Nixon was President!! This final interview with Nixon was the pinnacle of David Frost's days as a talk show host. This long dissertation about this entire affair was what the movie ""Frost/Nixon"" centered around. So, how was such a disgraceful event in American history depicted by the producers, writers, directors, and actresses and actors in the movie? The answer is; brilliantly!! The visceral portrayal of the seventies went into relentless detail, particularly with regard to the abhorrent facade in fashion which the seventies possessed!! The accentuated diamonds on Richard Nixon's ties was conspicuously deliberate. The Neanderthal mops, which the seventies referred to as hair styles, were unfortunately realistic!! As far as the suits are concerned!! Put it this way ""I can't hear you with that sport jacket you're wearing!!"" Surprisingly enough, the film ""Frost/Nixon"" was directed by Ronny Howard. This is surprising because Ronny Howard (via his role as Oppie Taylor) comes across as the twentieth century version of Hucleberry Finn. The screen writing of William Perry was excellent! As far as the acting goes, Michael Sheen was so believable as David Frost that he got the part of Frost in less than ten minutes. Oliver Platt did a remarkable job in this movie!! Kevin Bacon was excellent as Jack Brennan. the shunned general, I always thought that having disdain for soldiers who fought in Vietnam was a very convoluted line of logic anyway!! Frank Langella (Who was brilliant as William Paley in ""Good Night and Good Luck"") was simply spectacular as Richard Nixon in this film!! Frank Langella seemed to have a very cogent recognition of Nixon's dubiously painful plight!! Langella's agitated responses invoked a very genuine temerity and insolence, this is a very authentic rendition of Richard Nixon's attitudes!! Movies such as these cannot be noted for original dialog, as they are merely paraphrasing the actual events which occurred. It is about how powerful the delivery on these events is. I feel that this film delivered these ominous events with the Nixon Presidency in an absolutely flawless manner. The challenging approach with the film ""Frost/Nixon"" puts this movie in a category by itself. The itemization concerning the Nixon Cabinet's penchant for volatility was graphically prolific. The correlation to dire circumstances involving doom and despair with the movie ""Frost/Nixon"" were extremely gripping!! The directing, screenplay writing, and acting in this movie is emphatically first rate, I definitely recommend seeing this film!! Tremendous films such as ""Frost/Nixon"" raise the bar on an intensified intellectual awareness in the cinema today!! FIVE STARS! NO QUESTION ABOUT IT!"
"classicalsteve","10","8","13","8 January 2009"," Most Politically Relevant Film with Some of the Best Performances of 2008--Howard's Best Film Since ""A Beautiful Mind""
","The relevance of this film today may be sadly overlooked. As the current President of the United States (George W. Bush) ends his tenure with his country disillusioned, in debt, at war, and in disarray, one cannot help but compare him to the late Richard Nixon. Strangely, the older politician, now dead and buried for over a decade, seems much more the intellectual statesman. Nixon has always seemed the darker man, the loner in the Oval Office, as compared to Bush, the happy-go-lucky Texan. While the former suffered from the same malady of self-importance, at least he would ponder positive foreign affairs decisions before creating his political enemy's list. The latter would rather snap celebrity photos with endearing fans than answer tough questions about foreign policy. Leave that to Cheney. Both Nixon and Bush seemed to suffer from the same kind of self-aggrandizement that put the country and the world at tremendous risk. One lost the presidency for his flaws, the other lost nothing personally, except the well-being and respect of his nation.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon, filmed in semi-documentary style by Ron Howard, is about the elder statesman Nixon revealing himself and his enigmatic heart of hearts to his country and the world via a relatively lightweight British interviewer, David Frost. Overnight, Frost has to remake himself from a chatty interviewer like Jay Leno into a tough interrogator like Mike Wallace. Both men have a lot at stake. According to the film, Frost's career has stagnated and he desperately needs a large breakthrough in media to be taken seriously. And he has shoved most of his personal capital into the project. Nixon was never tried for Watergate and therefore never had a platform from which his case was heard. The Frost interviews becomes Nixon's witness stand, and the television his courtroom.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is some of the finest of all the Oscar contenders of 2008, probably because Sheen and Langella re-prised their roles from the Broadway and London stage-play of the same name. For well over 30 years, Frank Langella has been quietly forging an acting career that has had sparse recognition for the quality of his work. In short, he is one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated talents in Hollywood films, until now. This film has allowed Langella's acting range and versatility to glow into THE performance of 2008. Langella literally becomes Nixon, shaping his subtle mannerisms and guttural tone. And yet, Langella does even one better. He somehow shapes Nixon's attitudes as if he understood who Nixon was on the inside as well as the outside. Good actors can mimic facial expressions. It takes a superb acting of uncommon ability to portray the inner qualities of his/her subject. Langella brings forth the inner Nixon in the same way that the real David Frost did 30 years ago.<br/><br/>Equally superb is the portrayal of David Frost by Michael Sheen. Similar to Langella, Sheen also brings forth the inner Frost, the sort of sexy rock star interviewer who must turn into something he has never been: a tough journalist probing the inner meat of his interviewee. The film very slowly shows us the transition of Frost into the kind of journalist he had to become in order to face Richard Nixon. No American president is easily knocked down and left bare by the likes of a journalist, and Nixon was no exception. Frost had to have an arsenal of not just tough questions but tough responses if he was going to be able to bring out the inner soul of Nixon. Frost had to discard the chatty sensibility of a Jay Leno or David Letterman and transform himself into the passionate journalist of a Mike Wallace or Christiane Amanpour. <br/><br/>A superb film and relevant to the current state of American politics. Nixon had to come clean and Frost was both his judge and his confessor, partially because the former president had resigned. The current president (as of 1/07/09), despite eight years of abuse of power, leaves the office without the stain of impeachment. He will probably never have to answer to a David Frost or a Mike Wallace. What a pity."
"J_Trex","10","8","13","16 December 2008"," Hugely Entertaining Drama
","I enjoyed Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" and Anthony Hopkins' Oscar nominated portrayal was very good, yet the role was a largely negative version of the man. It was all deep paranoia and dark conspiracy, without any hint as to why Nixon was twice elected to the the highest office in the land, the 2nd time by one of the largest landslides in U.S. history.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's ""Frost/Nixon"" is a fascinating view of Nixon through the perspective of the David Frost interviews. Langella's portrayal captures the insecurity and paranoia of Nixon, but also reveals a more intelligent and engaging aspect of him during his post Watergate years. I suppose this will automatically disqualify Langella from any chance of an Oscar nomination. I hope this isn't the case, because Langella's performance is on par with Helen Mirren's in ""The Queen"", maybe even better. <br/><br/>Ron Howard deserves kudos for directing this excellent movie. He's become one of Hollywood's best Directors of historical dramas. The supporting cast was great, Michael Sheen as David Frost was outstanding, and everyone else was excellent.<br/><br/>A truly outstanding film and for anyone with an interest in recent American history, not to be missed."

All the cast was really scored-up. But, specially, Langella and Sheen were superb. It contains a really carefully-and-well-crafted realistic 70's scenario. Both, editing and photography were great. One of the could-be contenders of 2009 Academy Awards. The reason is that, this ""stylistic game"" very carefully made with a very solid structure, with its amazing photography, excellent artwork, brilliant screenplay, superb performances, very good music and a fantastic direction by Ron Howard, and, let me say that this is one of the most exigent movies that he's ever done, it'll get more that one Academy Award nomination. It's one of those bare movies that after seeing it, it leaves you shaking, ice-cold and that you cannot get it out of your head. <br/><br/>Verdict: In the style of Oliver Stone's classic ""JFK"", Howard accomplishes a true work of art. With a little bit of luck, this'll get into the Top 250. A film that advantageously accomplishes, with an extremely visionary ""politic"" argument, arriving to the land of its narrative searches. A film with an impeccable production and impeccable performances. A movie that talks to us about how we respond to truth and lie. Perfect. A film that will transcend through time. A brilliant pick for the season. A Great Movie."

","Before seeing Frost/Nixon, I didn't think much of Ron Howard as a director (both A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13 struck me as no more than mediocre commercial jobs). Despite my long admiration for Frank Langella's work on stage and for Kevin Bacon's work on screen, I expected no more than a moderately OK movie). Underwhelmed by most of the new 2008 movies (f'rinstance, except for Cate Blanchett, Benjamin Button disappointed in every aspect), the best 2 new 2008 movies I saw were Edge of Heaven and Stop-Loss (OK, I'm quirky, so what?). Until Frost/Nixon, that is. Its excellence in every area astonished me. Best movie of the year, best directing, best acting by the male lead, best adaptation. The supporting actors were admirable, especially Kevin Bacon, which came as no surprise (though if I were a voter, my vote for supporting actor would go to Robert Downey). I cannot praise Ron Howard enough for using his commercial skills as solid building blocks for a film partly about people selling entertainment and themselves in a mass medium. Nor can I give enough praise to Langella, whose decades of acting experience paid off in what may be his most challenging role--of a man whose decades of performing for his own audience was, in a way, his own most challenging role."

","It wasn't exactly a meeting of minds, nor was it motivated by a need to get to the truth, but the set of interviews that brought disgraced President Richard Nixon into a room with David Frost, is a fascinating historical tit bit  an act of opportunism on both sides that lead to one of the most sensational disclosures in the history of television political journalism. Nixon had broken the law and this unlikely confessional took place in the company of a light entertainment presenter. Imagine Tony Blair confessing he lied about the reasons for going to war in Iraq to Des O Connor and you realise how amazing this actually was.<br/><br/>Howard's film is fairly dispassionate in its treatment of both men. Frost, played with delicious smarm and just the right amount of arrogance by Michael Sheen, is constituted as a fledgling but highly libidinous talk show host, who in Nixon sees an opportunity to reinvigorate his celebrity and gain credibility in the US. Nixon on the other hand is in denial about his role in the Watergate scandal, fired up with a sense of self-righteousness and indignation at the liberal 'sons of bitches' that brought him down and is determined to use the encounter to rewrite history to his own advantage. Both men, it's suggested, have something to prove to themselves and their peers but mercifully the shadowy reflection angle isn't laboured en route to the tense exchanges. The climax, when it comes, manages to be both mesmerising and moving, not least because both actors meet the requirement of transcending mere impersonation and inhabit their characters. When you're told that Nixon's face betrayed, better than any trial, the personal regret, hubristic folly and watershed breakdown in the relationship between the American electorate and its government, thanks to Frank Langella, you believe it."
"alexmail-2","10","6","10","10 January 2009"," What a movie...
","I thought that Ron Howard had lost his touch after Da Vinci Code's lack of chemistry between the actors. Frost/Nixon is a whole other story.<br/><br/>Frank Langella will most certainly be nominated for an Academy Award for his absolutely brilliant performance as Richard M. Nixon the Thirty Seventh President of the United States, and he would've won if it wasn't for Clint Eastwood's performance in Gran Torino being his last. Langela becomes Nixon in the same way that Heath Ledger became the Joker. I think that Langella's accomplishment is even greater, because people knew what Nixon sounded like, people knew what Nixon was like, and Langella nails Nixon from the walk, the hunched over back, the accent, the speech pattern...everything.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen is excellent as David Frost, a British Talk Show host, who takes the huge leap, to interview the greatest Political Criminal in American History. Sheen does an incredible job of showing the stress that Frost was under when he underwent this strenuous interview. Sheen won't win an Academy award, but he matched Langella perfectly.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon is very reliable again as the faithful Jack Brennan. Bacon does an excellent job of showing Brennan's loyalty to Nixon. The rest of the cast does a stellar job as well.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is a masterful director. He makes a very conventional movie, with very basic, but brilliant shots. He does a great job of flashing ahead, and showing the ""Post Interview"" interviews. The music is very well incorporated, due to Hans Zimmers incredible score. Zimmer will get nominated for most likely his second Oscar of 2008 for this incredible score.<br/><br/>The movie just captures the whole mood of Nixon's ""Post Watergate Life"" so well. It is almost like a biography of everything Nixon went through after he resigned the Presidency.<br/><br/>This movie is very...very good. You might just want to see it, because of Frank Langella's chilling performance as Richard Nixon, but it also is very interesting, and extremely detailed. 10/10"
"Chris_Docker","10","6","10","5 January 2009"," Watch out for the Nixon in all of us - and pray your lucky stars there's a Frost
","I'm old enough vaguely to remember the televised Frost/Nixon interviews. Even the presidency. And the U.S./Vietnam war. I shared the popular sense of moral outrage. But I'm not an American citizen, and I couldn't get worked up about, 'giving Nixon the trial he never had.' What difference did that make to me?<br/><br/>Something halfway through this movie changed my mind. Mid-interview, attempting to get a reaction from Nixon, Frost's team run footage of carnage in Cambodia caused by American carpet-bombing. I guess perhaps because I was in Cambodia only a few months ago. It made more of an impact. For all my intellectual appreciation of events, I hadn't been prepared for such devastation of a nation's psyche. An NGO worker looked into my eyes one day at a truck stop. She said, ""And when I got here, I just cried every day for weeks."" I think she knew, as our eyes met, that I, a grown man, had been crying in helplessness towards these people trying to hide my tears for days. Visiting the ancient temples and aid workers, but meeting villagers too, it was hard not to cry. I have never seen a people so psychologically annihilated. The first thing that had struck me was, here is a nation for whom the very idea of hope has been long ago discarded. I wanted Nixon to pay.<br/><br/>The horrific footage doesn't move Mr President, the way it moves me. I want him to have that trial. But Nixon is a heavyweight in every way, just as the actor portraying him. Frost, on the other hand, is almost a bit of a joke. Hardly a man to bet on. Yet from that moment I was rooting for him. The only person with a chance of bringing light into Nixon's disingenuous stonewalling. From that moment, I was emotionally hooked. I would happily overlook all but the most egregious of flaws.<br/><br/>Fortunately, like the real interview series, the film only gets better. As if it has been playing with us for an eternity before packing its punches.<br/><br/>I've never been much taken with Martin Sheen (Frost). I kept thinking of his performance as Tony Blair in The Queen and how, here as in The Queen, it seems too much like an impersonation. Rory Bremner on a good day. But it is almost Sheen's fallibility that allows the rest of the film to shine. Taking us off guard, just as Nixon was taken off guard. A cheap punk on the street who you walk past disparagingly, only to realise he's the mafia boss and you're surrounded. Then there's Kevin Bacon. Haven't I seen that suit in one too many movies? So when he hits me with real emotion towards the end (he's a very good actor) it has a profound shock. Both these men know how to play supporting actor in the true sense, supporting the lead role and the whole production  rather than constantly making us notice their own lapels. But it's Frank Langella's towering interpretation of Nixon that eventually makes every other character real. Low-angle camera shots emphasise his power and he looms over us. The most powerful man in the world. And once we buy into that, everything we see in his 'world,' by definition, has to be 'real.'<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is about as watertight as you get. Adapted by the man who wrote the play (and also wrote The Queen and Last King of Scotland); then an Oscar-winning director who only agrees to do it if he can have the two lead actors from his polished stage version. Remember how Ron Howard pulled it out of the bag with the equally dry-seeming, A Beautiful Mind? Well, he's done it again.<br/><br/>But for all the triumphant battle cries as Frost walks him into a trap, in the end it is Nixon that gets my sympathies. Even more than Frost gets my admiration. As I watch Nixon face his inner hell, I recall every speck of darkness in my own soul. How I never managed to make my father proud before he died. How I risked my career once when I stole a long international phone call in the office. How I cheated on the one woman I loved more than any woman in my whole life. Some sins just don't go away. Nixon becomes the Nemesis within Everyman.<br/><br/>Nixon, like a Judas Iscariot or Lady Macbeth, has no way of ever coming completely clean. But, through the ironic good fortune of an interviewer who outwits him, Nixon receives the gift of being able to say sorry. Sorry to the Americans he betrayed. His legacy, the symbol of ultimate duplicity  the ""-gate"" tagged on to any word so to indicate scandal. See him fall  is it then possible (for some perhaps) to open hearts and forgive?<br/><br/>The second biggest thing that is striking about Cambodians is their lack of ill-will. To the one who destroyed their country. Having never hated, they have no thing to forgive. A senior monk instructed me, while I was there, on a Buddhist method of mindfulness. One of the results of this mediation is that one focuses everything back on one's own action, and hence one's own moment-to-moment responsibility. It strikes me that for Nixon, Frost was like the senior monk. The guy who showed him how to face who and what he was. His catharsis. Not that anyone will ever say thank you (to Nixon, that is.)<br/><br/>And coming full circle, that's what cinema can do. It can take something that is intellectually discernible and make it real  through an emotional investment. And it does it by means of fiction."

","As a teenager in Australia when Nixon resigned, I didn't really understand the impact of his actions at the time. It's only later that I've come to believe in his betrayal not just of American politics but of all democracies that have the same fundamental beliefs.<br/><br/>So I went to see this film with some anticipation and was not disappointed. If Ron Howard was not considered a great director before, then surely he must be after this. The greatest problem with filming stage plays is overcoming the sense of ""staticness"". But Howard's superb use of different camera techniques which allow both a sense of movement but do not distract from the stunning acting performances.<br/><br/>Whilst Frank Langella is quite rightly getting a lot of attention for his remarkable performance (he manages to humanise Nixon, a feat I would have thought impossible), do not dismiss Michael Sheen's mesmerising effort as David Frost. Both men inhabit their characters, not just play them.<br/><br/>The support cast is excellent; Kevin Bacon reminds me of Eastwood at times and they are the best roles Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell have had in a while.<br/><br/>A masterpiece."

","This is, without a doubt, the best made film of the year. I will see this at least one more time before DVD. I know, with that comment, some people are going to say ""No, it was The Dark Knight!"" So take into account that I said that it was the best MADE film of the year. TDK's one flaw was Maggie Gylenhaal. But, hey! This isn't a Dark Knight review! This is Frost/Nixon.<br/><br/>Let's get going.<br/><br/>The Good: Flawless performances by everyone from the extras to the actors that are only in this movie for like two minutes. Despite the fact that it is all about an interview, it never gets boring because of how tense it becomes. I've heard people compare this interview to a boxing match. Hell yeah! This is so close to being a boxing match, that I half expected them to parody the ending scene of Rocky using Frost and Nixon. You like all of the characters for one reason or another- I actually felt sorry for Nixon at times. Like in a scene where he's giving a speech and you can see that the people aren't interested in what he's saying. Then comes this dialog between Nixon and Kevin Baken's character:<br/><br/>""I can't stand it, Jack! Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes! I feel like a circus animal doing tricks! AND I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR, I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON WATERGATE! DAMN IT! As soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate. It's as if all my other achievements cease to exist.""<br/><br/>Some of dialog from the supporting characters is even funny at times, mostly coming from Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell. I felt Frost's frustration with trying to get money and sponsors as the sweat poured down his face. I was as frustrated as he was when nobody believed he would go anywhere. Jesus! In addition, the pacing is perfect. Being 2 hours long, and being about an interview, I expected this to drag like the When a Stranger Calls remake. I need to, last of all, give a lot of credit to Frank Langella. He may not look exactly like Nixon, but he's a damn good actor and I actually saw Nixon's face on his the entire time. Give him best actor.<br/><br/>Bad: Umm... jeez. Nothing."

","In an age of movies which are mostly eye candy this movie is a rare and special treat.<br/><br/>Based upon a successful stage play, this movie outlines a battle of wills, and a contest of minds in a way that attains high dramatic tension. Both the hero (Frost) and the anti-hero (Nixon) are made fully human, so the viewer becomes emotionally involved with both, each in different ways. Frost is the light-weight underdog, using words and strategy to trap the more experienced, cagey, but tragic character of Richard Nixon, a man who aspired to greatness, and actually did many great things, but was brought low by his own acts of conceit and arrogance. He is shown, despite his having attained the highest office in the US, as a tragic everyman, a person from the ordinary world of semi-poverty and a nondescript background who tried to enter the world of the elite, but never felt fully accepted.<br/><br/>But this movie is not just a wordy talk-a-thon. It is high drama of a cerebral kind. What will happen? Who will win? Will Tricky Dick slip out of the net cast by a light weight entertainer who is no reporter or interviewer? Will David Frost rise from low-level entertainer/moderator who interviews the Bee-Gees to become the man who got from Richard Nixon what no one else could get, an admission of culpability? Knowing history's final outcome does not detract from the drama of the events as they unfold.<br/><br/>If you love the art of cinema, then you will truly appreciate this film. It is a masterpiece, and a fine example of all that makes Hollywood great, and not just box office."

","Throughout the history of the Presidency, there is but one man who was dishonorably forced to resign his job; Richard M. Nixon.

In this film called "" David Frost Interviews Richard Nixon "" English Talk-show Host, David Frost, seizes a great opportunity to boost his ratings and secure several new TV shows, by arranging to interview the former Man in the White House. David Frost (Michael Sheen) plays Himself and is less convincing than his flaunted screen image. For this movie, Richard Nixon is played by exceptional actor Frank Langella, who does a remarkable job of playing the self-centered, egotistical and politically conniving ex-Congressman from California. The interview itself is fraught with planned attacks and defenses on both sides, each seeking to score points with the T.V. audiences watching across the country. Frost and Nixon hope their real motives for the Interview displays more style, than substance. Yet, after watching the entire movie, one believes there could have been more secured than ethereal coronets and self pity. The highlight of the film leans towards Langella when emotion, not confrontation becomes the final victory.

","The world does not always see the American people is a flattering light. They may be too distracted at times, allowing for their governments to do whatever they want while they aren't looking but one thing is for certain, they don't like being lied to. Be forewarned all future American presidents, if you're going to lie, don't get caught doing so. Former President, Richard Nixon, will forever be remembered for his lies but will always be despised for his inability to admit his guilt in the Watergate scandals or apologize for his betrayal of the people's trust. Ron Howard's film adaptation of the Tony winning stage play, FROST/NIXON does nothing to exonerate Nixon but rather puts forth the importance and necessity for remorse and forgiveness. In doing so, he has crafted his most cerebral film without overcomplicating the issues and more importantly, his film will serve as a challenge to the American people to demand the respect they deserve from their elected officials.<br/><br/>FROST/NIXON is not just about the bigger issues but also the people directly involved. David Frost (Michael Sheen) is a struggling, British television personality. He has tried his hand at American success and failed but sees securing the first television interview with Richard Nixon after he shamefully left office as his ticket. Anyone, of course, would but Nixon (Frank Langella) wasn't making anything easy. He wanted an exorbitant amount of money for the interview and Frost was having extreme difficulty finding financing backers and advertisers because people did not believe he could pull off what was necessary in order for the interview to be considered a success. Nixon, on the other hand, needed Frost to serve as a bridge to the people, to remind them of his humanity and regain their trust through simply being himself. They each had much at stake and they each had teams of people in their corners making sure their best interest were being served at all times. Somewhere beneath all smoke and mirrors was the truth of it all, just hoping to make itself known.<br/><br/>Langella and Sheen are the perfect team. They play off each other with great respect, both in their character and as actors who originated these roles on Broadway when the play first began. In fact, Howard refused to adapt the film if it meant doing it with other actors in the parts. Langella won the Tony for his stage performance and his Nixon is bold, determined, naïve while still commanding and at the most vulnerable of moments, he is frightened that he can never go back. His part is naturally more showy but that does not mean there is nothing left for Sheen to work with. His Frost is nervous, ambitious and also just as naïve and frightened as his counterpart. Watching the two of them face off in interview is engaging and suspenseful as you wait impatiently for one to make a mistake. Documenting an interview runs the risk of being fairly static but Howard's direction ensures that there is movement and momentum even when the two are just sitting across from each other. In fact, despite the palpable tension he creates on screen, Howard seems more relaxed than I'm accustomed to him being.<br/><br/>While Howard helms with a comfortable control, it is Peter Morgan's adaptation of his own stage play that serves as the film's true substance. He succeeds again, as he did with THE QUEEN, in bridging the gap between the public and the intensely private, only this time the castle gates that separated the people from their Queen have been replaced by another barrier, television. FROST/NIXON takes the notion of spin and slows it down until it becomes perspective, allowing for the distance between a president and the people to be narrowed as much as is possible.. And while the close-up can be terribly unforgiving, it is also the one shot we're all waiting for in order to attain the understanding needed in order to heal."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","6","11","4 June 2009"," Rocky Balboa has nothing on Richard Nixon
","Richard Nixon, one of the most controversial men of political history, loved by few, hated by many. This is the movie that finally depicted Nixon not just a man who screwed up the country or cheated his way and abused his power, we see him as a human being. We also see David Frost who despite just wanted a boost in his career went in with courage to take on Richard Nixon and didn't expect to get into the fight of the century. Ron Howard added the perfect charisma that this movie needed and had the perfect cast to make the story unbiased. Frank Langella, I love this man, ever since I was a little girl and saw him as Dracula, I was so enchanted with him. He's a terrific actor that was just due to get an Oscar nomination and this is the role that won him that honor of being noticed. Frost/Nixon is the actor's movie that deserved much more attention from audiences who truly need a lesson in American history.<br/><br/>A series of news reports documents Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, prior to his resignation speech. Meanwhile, David Frost has finished recording an episode of his talk show and watches on television as Nixon leaves the White House. A few weeks later Frost discusses with his producer and friend, John Birt, the possibility of an interview. When Frost mentions Nixon as the subject, Birt doubts the likelihood that Nixon would be willing to talk to Frost. Nixon discusses his memoirs with literary agent Irving Lazar, who tells the former president of a request by Frost to conduct an interview with an offer of $600,000. Lazar contacts Frost to inform him that Nixon is interested, so Frost and Birt fly to California to meet with Nixon. Frost hires two investigators, Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. to dig for information along with Birt, mainly on the Watergate scandal and the interviews begin, making Frost realize that they don't call Nixon ""Tricky Dick"" for nothing in the ultimate battle interview of the decade.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is one of the finest movies that came out of 2008, we had a lot of terrific movies that year, that's why I feel that this movie was somewhat over shadowed. But I have a feeling that this movie will be considered an American classic down the line. Frank and Michael had great chemistry and you could cut the tension in that interview with a gardening sheerer, it was so thick. Ron Howard did a terrific job on the style of the movie, it really captured the feel of the 1970's and the time where America's number one enemy was a man they had elected themselves to run the country. I do highly recommend this movie, especially over a film like Nixon, while that was a good movie, it was over done and Frank raised the bar on performances when it comes to portraying Richard Nixon, he had him down and I felt like I was staring right at Tricky Dick. This is a fantastic movie, I recommend you watch it if you get the chance.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tedg","Null","8","16","1 January 2009"," Rehabilitation of the Dead
","I am always happy to be proved wrong when I am negative. I did not believe it possible that Ron Howard could make a film that is remotely watchable, especially since he figuratively married Brian Grazer. The two together have such an insipid work view that even with potentially weighty material what they give us seems to be from a world made up on a schoolbus.<br/><br/>But this is very effective at what it attempts. Its a very simple dynamic, but it has significant resonance for someone my age. He manages to hold the tension all the way to the end, and that's no simple task. I think that the way he has done this is to put himself into the Frost character: a thin intellect struggling publicly with difficult ideas and complex situations. I can easily imagine that the struggles he had with trying to guide Langella into complexities.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Langella has already done this part  without the hulking posture  in the superior ""Starting Out in the Evening."" Even more luckily, the Watergate situation is one of the best stories in politics, newly reborn as the US struggles with how to handle the crimes of its 43rd president.<br/><br/>And more luck: the situation is inherently cinematic because its a story about a similar goal: how to reveal a complex truth for the camera. <br/><br/>So generally, Howard is able to keep himself focused. But there is one element where Howard/Grazer just cannot help themselves. They have to add a pretty girl who appears only for this story (she is met on the plane on his introductory trip). She them provides the domestic support that seems to be at the foundation of every Howard story. <br/><br/>She is pretty. I last saw her in a story about a college quiz, where she was ""the appealing one."" But here she is a distraction that doesn't fit, a long answer to a simple question. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

Micheal sheen, had a hard job playing David Frost because there was a real danger of slipping into a 'Hello, Good evening and Welcome' caricature of Mr Frost which he just manages to steer clear of.<br/><br/>For me as a Brit, the film never worked, American viewers will look at it differently perhaps.

"Philby-3","8","7","14","5 January 2009"," Gripping entertainment, not history
","Although this film is the adaptation of a stage play (by Peter Morgan) about the making of a series of television interviews in 1977 between hotshot but lightweight British interviewer David Frost and Richard Milhous Nixon, disgraced ex-President of the United States, the stage origins do not show. Good use is made of close-ups and the naturalistic settings. However the minor characters remain minor and what we have in essence is a duel. Frost, prodded by his researchers is trying to get Nixon to confess to his Watergate misdemeanours (some might say felonies), and Nixon is fighting while he still can to salvage his shredded reputation. It is a tense and exciting battle.<br/><br/>David Frost himself, although appreciative of the attention, apparently thinks that he was incorrectly portrayed as inexperienced  he had already interviewed Ronald Reagan, Robert Kennedy, Harold Wilson and Ted Heath  but Michael Sheen, a noted Tony Blair impersonator as Frost, has got him down pat. Frost is youthful, eager, determined, and at times desperate, as the whole enterprise, which he has largely funded (none of the American TV networks would participate in the production), seems to be heading towards the rocks. His researchers, particularly the dislikeable James Reston Jr are keen to nail Nixon, but the ""smoking gun"", a taped conversation with an aide, does not emerge until late in the piece.<br/><br/>Some license has been taken with the facts, for example the revealing telephone conversation between the two the night before the final interview session is entirely fictitious, but it reveals a great deal about what the two men thought of each other. The emphasis on Frost's social life and girlfriends is exaggerated, but there is a point to it  Nixon's obvious envy and social ineptitude. Frank Langdell's Nixon, heavy in defeat, is finely drawn and he evokes some sympathy. In the actual interview Nixon avoided being pathetic and was a good deal more chipper.<br/><br/>As entertainment, Ron Howard's film succeeds very well, but it does not add much to what we know about the Nixon presidency, or Watergate. I continue to be amazed how people with such obvious personal shortcomings can be elected to high office, but it has to be admitted that some Richard Nixon's foreign policies (eg China) were better than some of his successors, even if he was lying when he said ""I am not a crook""."
"XFLRWF","10","6","12","11 December 2008"," What makes life worth living is purpose
","Historical characters and events are often tricky to put on film. The audience must distinguish if the story and characters are accurate portrayals or biased ones based on the director's opinion. In ""Frost/Nixon"" (adapted from Peter Morgan's play of the same name), director Ron Howard delivers a brilliant account of the infamous interview between former United States President Richard Nixon and television host David Frost. This could not have been done without the marvelous performances by Frank Langella and Michael Sheen. This combination of talent draws in the audience to feel every aspect of this historical account.<br/><br/>On August 9, 1974, Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) resigned as President of the United States of America. On the other side of the world in Australia, television host David Frost (Michael Sheen) watches as the President makes his dramatic exit from the White House. Ever ambitious, Frost decides to interview Nixon as he feels it will be a huge ratings grabber. Nixon sees it as a chance to redeem himself in the public spotlight. But when these two gladiators of the debate collide, in the end there can be only one winner.<br/><br/>In a subject matter such as this, it is easy to paint Nixon as an evil villain. Instead, Ron Howard does a great job of producing screenwriter Peter Morgan's unbiased telling of this time in history. Howard and Morgan create a witty game of cat and mouse between Frost and Nixon. Both figures think they can best the other in order to increase their own gain. Howard shows the trials and struggles of both sides as they plan their attack and feel the pressure of making the interview a success. Morgan creates an intellectual no hold barred fight to the death between the two men and shows they are more alike than they realize. Frost and Nixon simply want what any forgotten celebrity wants: another chance at the spotlight.<br/><br/>Frank Langella and Michael Sheen reprise their roles as Nixon and Frost respectively from their London play. Langella is wonderful as the ex-president. He does not play the role comically or outrageously. In his performance, Langella brings out the fighting, never-say-die aura out of Nixon that is almost admirable. He loves challenges, loves to fight, and is quite a skilled debater. Conversely, Langella also shows Nixon as a man beaten down by the sting of Watergate. And yet, he still thinks he can redeem himself. He carries himself in a slouchy posture and is slow moving. Langella shows that this is a man clearly burdened by guilt but cannot bring himself to admit he was wrong about anything. Michael Sheen is equally talented as David Frost. Sheen also shows Frost's longing for a return to American success. The opposite of Nixon, Frost hides his problems with charming smile and attitude that Sheen captures perfectly. He never lets on how bad things may with the production and is always eager to reassure his co-workers of the success. Sheen's best work is his reactions to whatever Nixon throws at him. The sheer look of disbelief and terror in what he has gotten himself into as he delves deeper into the project is remarkable.<br/><br/>In a movie such as this, there are no heroes and villains in the traditional sense. Howard and Morgan show that these are simply two men fighting for what could be the death of their careers. They simply want their success back and will do whatever they feel is necessary to attain it. Langella and Frost deliver gifted performances and are joined by the supporting talents of Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, and Toby Keith. ""Frost/Nixon"" is not about clearing anyone's name or getting the truth. It is simply about the question: ""What would you do to get your spotlight back?"" <br/><br/>FROST/NIXON Grade: A"

"slokes","7","4","7","18 April 2010"," Solid Drama, Simplistic History
","History-based movies often make a deeper impression when playing fast and loose with the facts. Think ""Casablanca"", ""Patton"", or ""Richard III."" ""Frost/Nixon"" isn't quite up there, but it's an entertaining ride with deep resonances - even if it doesn't stick to the facts.<br/><br/>In the mid-1970s, disgraced ex-President of the United States Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) is searching for a way out from the shadows of his near-impeachment. Enter David Frost (Michael Sheen), jet-setting British interviewer who sees in Nixon his own way back into the big time, provided he can acquire elusive commercial backing. But is Frost up to the deeper challenge of pinning down one of history's most morally compromised men?<br/><br/>""I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees,"" says Frost's skeptical producer John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen).<br/><br/>""Weren't they terrific!"" replies Frost with characteristic misplaced ebullience.<br/><br/>While much of the drama of the movie rests on Frost's efforts to take the initiative away from Nixon with tough, unexpected questions, the film itself is entirely Langella's. He's a sad creature of darkness, seen glimpsing Frost for the first time in half-shadow like Dracula, not the one Langella was playing on Broadway when Frost/Nixon was actually going down, but Bela's Dracula. Yet he craves the light, and the possibility is held out that he may even see this interview, ""no holds barred"", as a way of making restitution for his failure.<br/><br/>That's one interpretation of where the film takes the actual story, with made-up events including Nixon's unfamiliarity with Frost (in life, the two had sat on-camera before, in 1969), Frost's frustration over landing a punch, and, most luridly but effectively, Nixon making a late-night phone call to Frost that never occurred. You can't help wishing it did, though.<br/><br/>Credit Peter Morgan's screenplay, based on his stage work, with getting one to not only accept but welcome this imaginative interpretation - to a point. It's not exactly like the Frost interviews changed anything regarding Nixon or his legacy. It didn't even get Frost back his American television series, contrary to the end notes of this movie. Seeing Nixon portrayed as a flawed human being, with warmth and humor, can be gratifying to those of us disposed to cut Dick some slack and resent the show-trial impulses of James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell), but how believable is it for him to joke about sending some Cubans to spy on Frost's research team?<br/><br/>In the end, I found my queasiness with the storyline and its direction more than compensated for by Morgan's artful blend of suspense and humor, the lead acting (Sheen is actually more convincing as Frost, and does more to sell the dramatic tension of his scenes with Nixon, but I could never take my eyes off Langella), and a game supporting cast. Ron Howard directs with surprising restraint that suggests a more mature direction in his fine if flashy career; it's not as good overall as his ""Apollo 13"" but this time Howard proves a better director.<br/><br/>It doesn't surprise me that ""Frost/Nixon"" is one movie both Reston and the faithful few at the Nixon Library both seem to bless; it's about hating the crime but not the criminal. Perhaps this is posterity's way of simultaneously catching up with Nixon's wrongdoings and Gerald Ford's controversial pardon. Complicated, affecting, even if it feels somewhat half-chewed; Watergate felt like that then, too."

","Howard shows some growth as a director and he finally proves that he is willing to take risks. Usually I know what kind of entertainment to expect from a Ron Howard movie. That is not to say that I don't appreciate them (I personally loved 'Cinderella Man' and 'Far and Away') but I just did not expect him to take a real concept and make something raw and honest of it. Perhaps 'Apollo 13' is an exception but I found that film to be very boring.<br/><br/>Unlike Ron Howard's other directorial ventures, 'Frost/Nixon' is far grittier and much less dramatized, polished and syrupy. 'Frost/Nixon' works as an intriguing character study and it supports the actual historical documentation. It stays true to the facts. The solid screenplay, witty dialogues, subtle sense of humour and rich characterization make this a compelling piece. The cat-and-mouse interaction between Nixon and Frost is both amusing and intriguing.<br/><br/>Frank Langella is terrific as Nixon. It is simply amazing how he has mastered even the smallest detail of the body language of the former president. Even the voicework is remarkable. Michael Sheen is equally convincing as David Frost. His performance looks very natural and the actor deserves just as much praise as Langella. The supporting cast that includes Oliver Platt, Matthew Macfayden, Toby Jones, Sam Rockwell and Kevin Bacon leave a strong impression too. Rebecca Hall is sensual without having to take off her clothes but she does not get in the way of the film.<br/><br/>'Frost/Nixon' was a pleasant surprise. It kept me glued to the screen during its entire two hours. It works both as a detailed character study and engaging drama. Howard deserves credit for staying true to its source and the facts in order to make such an enthrolling piece."
"smallbob","9","4","7","24 January 2009"," Stunning
","A brilliant showing of the Frost Nixon interviews. Great acting all around and a stunning case study of Nixon at his finest. Controlling everything till confronted with the simple truth. Frost a ""talk show host"" confronting what was, for those of us on the left, the boogey man of politics. The man who pulled no punches against his opponents even when those punches were sent below the belt and seemed to be the most distanced and arrogant of men. An Interview for the ages that leaves one almost feeling sorry for Nixon as he spends his remaining years despised by the world for actions that he, it seems, honestly felt were for the greater good.<br/><br/>This is not a Nixon pardon, far from it, it's a call to realize that Presidents need to be held accountable for their actions regardless if they are done for the greater good, when those actions result in the greater evil as it were. The final scenes of these interviews are stunning and powerful, the looks and the feeling that went in are what pushed this film from good to great in my opinion. Definitely one of the top must see movies of this year."
"saarvardi","9","4","7","22 January 2009"," Intelligent AND entertaining. Why can't all films be like this?
","Director Ron Howard's Frost/Nixon chronicles the true story of British/Australian talk show host David Frost, who decided to interview former U.S. President Richard Nixon after his 1974 resignation in the shadow of the Watergate accusations. The film follows Frost's decision to self-finance the interview, his complex relationship with Nixon and the now-famous interviews he conducted with the former President during 1977.<br/><br/>At the very heart of it, Frost/Nixon is a very moving and emotional film. I was satisfied and pleasantly surprised to see it got what it deserved by the Academy - at least nominee wise, that is (for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Frank Langella's excellent take on Nixon's controversial figure, among others) . Walking into the theater, I have to admit I was expecting a talky snooze-fest like 2005's Good Night and Good Luck. Instead, I found a true and unique movie that really tried to see what made both Nixon and Frost tick, and show that above all, it wasn't the politics - but first and foremost the dynamic relationship between the journalist and the ex-president, which led to Nixon's confession regarding his involvement in the Watergate fiasco.<br/><br/>Personally speaking, I thought the film excelled in not trying to portray Nixon as an evil president, but as someone who truly believed he was working for a greater good, and that the end's thereby justified the means. Langella gave a stunning performance in that category, and made me want to visit the film again when it arrives on DVD - in hope of learning more about that turbulent time in American history and in hope of preventing a second Watergate from occurring.<br/><br/>I gave it 9 points out of 10."

","What a sleeper of a movie; who would have ever thought that a movie about an interview would ever sustain interest for as long as this gem. Diane and I lived through all of these events but they happened in the months of our migration to Australia so those events come through history's washer a little more soiled than I would like. This wonderful movie passes through those amazing events easily and renders their complexity clearer. As I commented earlier, watching a reasonably long movie about a TV interview does not, superficially, sound as something that would fly. However, in the hands of superb actors, an excellent script and director and you will be present at a great viewing experience.I thought the movie focused brilliantly on the complexity of Nixon.  The depth of feelings enunciated by Nixon in the telephone call to Frost before their explosive final interview showed a man who felt so strongly about the society that surrounded him that he allowed those feelings to cloud the decisions he made during his presidency. The movie touches only briefly on those actions because the script examines the drama between Nixon and Frost and that drama certainly provides the viewers with substance enough. Given the depth of his feelings one can only draw parallels with the new American president Barak Obama who,although a graduate of Harvard law school, journeyed to the presidency from a modest background so similarities are present. This is a history film but it is so much more complex than that. It is an examination of a complex man who dealt, obviously incorrectly, with a weight of personally historical demons."

","When Ron Howard helms a film that is based on actual events, you can bet your sweet ass it's gonna be a corker... ""Apollo 13"", ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Cinderella Man"".. and now ""Frost/Nixon"".<br/><br/>""Frost/Nixon"" retells the events surrounding the historic face-off between disgraced American President Richard Nixon and women-chasing TV personality David Frost. Three silent and hermitic years after the Watergate scandal, Richard Nixon finally approves of an interview, to face once and for all the lingering questions that have plagued him and his legacy. To the tune of a $600,000 fee, the former president finally agrees to be interviewed by David Frost-- a rather naive and silly guy who is better known as an entertainment interviewer as supposed to a political one. Clearly, the former president is planning to manhandle Frost, turn him dizzy about his wit during the interviews and through verbal magnificence make himself look all the more heroic instead of treasonous for his clear infringement of the public trust when he ordered a cover up of the Watergate Scandal.<br/><br/>Initially bowing and ineffective against the evasive tactics and pointless monologues of the president during the first interview, Frost's producer and handlers are beginning to doubt his ability to evoke an apology or an admission from the president. Frost feels the pressure. They haven't even raised the required 600k fee for the president, which is supposed to come from the proceeds of the interview, but a confession-less interview wouldn't sell and this particular interview will either make or break them for life. In the third and final interview, a poignant and energetic confrontation between the two will happen in front of the camera.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>With this film, im willing to forget that ron howard actually directed the dismal ""Da Vinci Code"". I guess that ought to tell him to stick to movies based on factual events and leave the fiction to other directors.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","4","7","12 January 2009"," A perfect film for the historical and intellectual taste buds of movie-goers
","In a time where independent films are quickly growing in the favor of not only the public but in the eyes of critics, the Academy and other motion picture associations, it can almost be said that ""Frost/Nixon,"" a historical drama in the purest sense, is a breath of fresh air. In a difficult time such as the state of the U.S. at the moment, independent films are much more appealing as they relate to people on a more universal level. This is something ""Frost/Nixon"" can't pretend to be--it's political, highly intellectual, grounded in historical fact, and deals with themes of power and fame. That's why ""Frost/Nixon"" is likely to walk away empty- handed through much of award season, because despite being a compelling drama worthy of praise on nearly every end of its production, a drama that works your left brain is not what people are looking to see right now. For that same reason, however, many viewers, especially the very frequent moviegoers, are likely to find the change of pace that ""Frost/Nixon"" brings quite welcome.<br/><br/>The film, based on the 1976 interviews between President Richard M. Nixon and British TV personality David Frost, really fires on all cylinders. It is written by England's Peter Morgan, who also wrote the Tony-award winning play it's based on, which is its first right move. Morgan, who penned ""The Queen"" and ""The Last King of Scotland"" clearly has the strength to make a film out of his script, likely why he produced it in the first place. So many plays fail to find a home on the screen that actually breathes new life into it, but ""Frost/Nixon"" does. Secondly, it is directed by American favorite Ron Howard, who despite seeming like a name more than anything else lately, absolutely has done some of his best work here. Considering the film is about preparing for and conducting an interview, it's amazing how compelling and well-paced he tells this story. His camera angles, close-ups, changing of focus keep this from ever approaching boring.<br/><br/>What really brings this film together to be so interesting, ultimately, is the cast. Frank Langella, who originated as Nixon on Broadway, is simply marvelous. The mannerisms, the array of facial expressions--he is quite the screen presence and his performance is without question Oscar-worthy. We develop a liking, loathing and pity for Nixon all in one film because of Langella. His performance makes you think more about the film more than anything else in the movie. His counterpart is also well-played by Michael Sheen, who has collaborated with Morgan on his other films. Sheen's greatest strength is conveying Frost's conflicting role as both big shot personality and hard-hitting journalist. Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell round out the cast with strong performances as does rising star Rebecca Hall (""Vicki Cristina Barcelona"") as Frost's love interest.<br/><br/>What culminates in ""Frost/Nixon"" is a drama that is surprisingly compelling. All the elements of performance and direction and writing converge to put you in a place where you feel the struggle that Frost (and many journalists, for that matter) deal with regularly--trying to not let someone with an agenda walk all over you as you interview them. The interview is sort of an unacknowledged verbal war, especially when it involves something so incredible as corruption at the highest level of government. Not only does this pump up the film's pace, but you truly can see how similar Frost and Nixon really are despite their conflicting interests and the film takes you to greater understanding of power and public image.<br/><br/>""Frost/Nixon"" might in fact be a film for the more intellectual tastes of movie-goers and not reach the broad appeal of its award season competitors, but it is an excellent example of how dialog and debate can become powerful elements of storytelling and of course how history can continue to be relevant today, especially in a time where corruption is not any less of a problem as it was then."
"JimSDCal","10","4","7","12 January 2009"," An Oscar worthy movie
","Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) was the most corrupt President in US history and was forced to resign before he was tossed out of office by the US Congress. Because he resigned and was pardoned for any possible criminal offense by President Ford, Nixon was never officially questioned for any of his possible crimes. David Frost (Michael Sheen) noted there was a hunger in the US to have Nixon question about his improprieties and convinced the disgraced former President to agree to a 4-part interview, 1/4 of which would be questioning about the Watergate scandal. The best scene in this film occurs not during Frost's questioning but when a drunk Nixon calls Frost in the night before his Watergate interview. Nixon delivers a drunken rant which reveals the type of personality he truly had. He rails at the elite institutions of the nation which never fully accepted him as an equal and informs Frost that he sees their interviews as a battle between two men, only one of which could be the winner. This is one of Ron Howard's best movies, it is the equal of ""Apollo 13"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" and should be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. It gets a grade of ""A"" and a very strong recommendation."

","Frank Langhella and Martin Sheen are two actors of the absolute highest caliber and here under Ron Howard's direction they triumph.<br/><br/>For my money this is an outstanding film of the 2008 awards season - not showy or full of effects it is simply what great cinema is all about: absolutely mesmerizing and very entertaining.<br/><br/>Given that we know how the plot goes it's the fine detailing here - with some excellent political insights - that makes this even better.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is just simply devastating - for those of us who remember the events this rings true (even in all the details like the ads and the planes etc;). Many say Ron Howard's films are too different for him to make great films, that he lacks his own style. Can I disagee? Thinking about Willow, Truman, Apollo 13, even the Da Vinci Code, Frost / Nixon does what Ron Howard does best, it reminds us of how film can inspire us and move us by telling the story clearly yet with force. <br/><br/>I hadn't expected it to be so beyond nostalgia and emotional sentimentality and rather a real call to values.<br/><br/>Great stuff and a surprisingly devastating watch."
"Quinoa1984","9","4","7","27 December 2008"," see it for the craftsmanship, sure, but the title fight is the real kicker- and a towering performance
","Ron Howard, at his best, can be a very good director in the Hollywood tradition. He's not the kind of artist one might rank Scorsese or Altman or more recently an Aronofsky, but when he's on top of the subject matter he's dependable throughout to deliver on the story. With Frost/Nixon, probably one of his best films (if perhaps by default due to the nature and power of the subject matter and original play), he re-tells in docu-drama form the interview with David Frost and his most challenging ""opponent"", Richard M. Nixon, 37th President, only one to resign in our Nation's history.<br/><br/>We see all of the prep work undertaken (or, at times, forgone to do other things like seeking out sponsors or Frost's other projects), the pressure simmering under, and then suddenly reeling from the s***storm that Frost may have gotten himself into. This kind of story, unto itself, is nothing very new, and some of the rise-and-fall aspects make it out to be like a sports movie: a boxing match of words and attitude and persistence where one side has an obvious advantage and the other has to combat with facts and the like that can undercut Mr. ""Tricky-Dick"" himself.<br/><br/>What *does* however make Howard's film a must-see this season are the performances from its cast, primarily Michael Sheen and Frank Langella. Come to think of it, more-so Langella than Sheen; while the Brit does a terrific job as the grinning and ambitious and/or terrified talk show ""performer"", it's somewhat of a two-dimensional character in the scope of the actual story. Frost wants the big ratings at first, and that's really the priority with the facts and research coming in second for his team (with Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt as good supporting players), who want to give Nixon the grilling that he and by proxy the American public deserve to lay bare to hear and, more importantly, to see in close-up on TV. He's a sturdy presence, but by himself merely very good but not great.<br/><br/>No, the big contender here is Langella, both for the film and, without having to knock on much wood, as best actor in countless award ceremonies. His work here is to the point of immersion completely in the presence, not even so much the character, of Richard Nixon, to the point that it's a little scary, which is dead on for such a larger-than-life presence as him. He's lightly (or hugely) condescending, subtle, menacing, charming, devious, everything that Nixon the public or in private was, and then some, and Langella captures it in every gesture, every flinch. In a sense it's akin to Streep's latest performance in Doubt in that at first and from time to time it almost seems amusing, though this may be just the obviousness of the character in and of itself (i.e. strict nun and Nixon). But it's the great gift of the actor to go deep into these people- Daniel Day Lewis last year is another prime example- and make us forget what we're seeing, that's real power and skill.<br/><br/>Take simply, if nothing else, maybe my personal favorite scene of the film, when Frost, on edge with the possibility he may lose his regular talk show programs in Australia and England, receives a very late-night call from the ex-President. He's drunk, he's got the tape machine going (of course), and he dominates the conversation. What starts off as an innocent bit about cheeseburgers turns into half-rambling and half monolithic monologue regarding these men's places in life. I was almost kind of smiling at how good Langela is in this scene - this is such bravura work just in these five minutes that one sees both the nature of the complexity that was Nixon on display and how much the actor is willing to let go for the scene. Frost/Nixon may not be a very great movie, but it does contain a very great performance, one that hopefully will be talked about and re watched for years to come."
"virek213","10","4","7","27 December 2008"," Battle Of Two Giants In The Political Media Arena
","It may not have seemed too much like it back in the spring of 1977, but the lengthy interview between British talk show host David Frost and former president Richard Nixon from Nixon's San Clemente home base is now considered one of the defining moments where politics and the media came together for compelling and dramatic results. Peter Morgan capitalized on the event in his play ""Frost/Nixon""; and now, that play, expanded into a feature-length film by Morgan himself, has succeeded well on the big screen as well, under the aegis of director Ron Howard (BACKDRAFT; APOLLO 13).<br/><br/>Michael Sheen and Frank Langella recreate the roles they created onstage (which was done at Howard's insistence) as, respectively, the erudite British talk show host and the brooding ex-president. What could have been a talking-heads kind of show is instead turned into a riveting and, on more than one occasion, somewhat satirical look at the shallowness of the media. That last aspect is quite brilliantly looked at, as Frost was largely the British equivalent of Johnny Carson back in the day, and was thus not deemed worthy by American television to interview the disgraced former commander-in-chief. On the other side of the coin, of course, there's Nixon, of whom millions upon millions of words continue to be written and spoken about. By the time he was interviewed by Frost, he was resigned to a life of continuous brooding and still unwilling to repent for the sins he did in office. With this true-life setup in place, Sheen and Langella engage in a very taut verbal duel that reaches a chilling climax when Langella's Nixon explains to Frost, ""When the president does something, that means it's NOT illegal!"" Under Frost's rather withering cross-examination, Nixon was finally forced to admit that he had let the country down; and while there was no admission of remorse, no ""I'm sorry"" ever spoken by the man, it was clear he needed to make some kind of repentance if he ever wanted to be seen by future historians in a better light.<br/><br/>As was the case with Anthony Hopkins' performance of the 37th president in Oliver Stone's 1995 film NIXON, Langella's performance in FROST/NIXON is a performance of incredible darkness and complexity, much like the real Richard Nixon himself. The toughness that Nixon displayed also revealed the demons that drove him to order the crimes that got committed under that all-encompassing Watergate umbrella. Frost, meanwhile, was heretofore taken far more seriously in America for taking on the challenge of getting Nixon to come out with the admission of personal failure, if not with an out-and-out apology. Howard's direction is as effective as it had been in APOLLO 13; and Sheen and Langella are incredible, as are supporting players like Kevin Bacon, Patty McCormack, Oliver Platt, and Sam Rockwell.<br/><br/>In the end, I found FROST/NIXON to be an incredible piece. David Frost came out as a TV personality who fought against enormous odds and won, while Richard Nixon came across as being quite sympathetic, given the magnitude of the kinds of crimes he committed as President. This is a film that should be seen for anyone interested in how politics and the American media have intersected throughout modern history."
"samkan","5","7","15","18 March 2009"," Not Effective
","Instead of concentrating on the era, Nixon the man or the Watergate affair, F/N decides to be a boxing match featuring David vs. Goliath, with traditional training tactics and theatrics, encounters serving as ""weigh-ins"", pre-match jitters, nose-to-nose introduction, cronies in each corner with between round advice, etc. When the action finally starts, our underdog suffers the expected falls to the mat before miraculously delivering a knock-out punch.<br/><br/>I must commend the producers for taking on a subject so unusual for a feature length film. What an opportunity to examine Richard Nixon and/or the mood and media of the 70's. Instead the maker's of F/N toss opportunity out the window and present the Frost/Nixon interviews as a prizefight. The result is silly.<br/><br/>Our tendency to manufacture ""winners"" and ""losers"" in political confrontations often buries -if not ignores- the importance and substance of the issues involved. I can appreciate the psychic need to pick a good guy and a bad. Certainly Hollywood has a vested interest in heroes, villains, conflict, etc. But F/N embraces this superficial take to the absolute exclusion of all else. Despite necessary lip service, the characterizations of Dave and Dick are hack jobs and the 70's looks prehistoric.<br/><br/>I found the debate scenes dull and the fretting of the sidelines guys laughable. I went home and watched the actual debates from YouTube, which were far more interesting."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","9","5","10","3 February 2009"," A Powerhouse Political Drama
","As I walked into the cinema to watch ""Frost/Nixon"", one dominant question was in my mind; Is this the great duel that both the critics and trailers have been making it out to be, or is it as tired as Gordon Brown on a Monday morning? The film's recent five Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, would suggest the former, but the Oscars are starting to lose credibility. After all, many people believe that they snubbed ""The Dark Knight"" this year when it came to the major nomination categories, me included. Still, several critics and audience members were praising the film, so I thought that I would have a look.<br/><br/>I am happy to say that the positive word surrounding the film is justified. ""Frost/Nixon"" is a smart, powerful and surprisingly funny movie. But most importantly, it is a compelling character study of two men who have everything to lose.<br/><br/>The film's events take place from late 1976 to the summer of 1977. David Frost (Michael Sheen) is a red-hot British talk-show host. He has fame, fortune and charm, and is known by many people. After seeing Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) resigning from the White House, Frost has an idea for an interview with the shamed former leader of the United States. After much struggling and conflict, Frost finally gets the chance to interview Nixon on four topics, one of which is the infamous Watergate scandal. However, Frost discovers that Nixon isn't going to admit his guilt over the Watergate scandal without a fight. With the backing of his other three team members (Matthew Macfadyen, Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell) and his girlfriend (Rebecca Hall), Frost enters into a dramatic battle of wits and nerve with Nixon. The major question is; who will come out on top? <br/><br/>The main success of ""Frost/Nixon"" is in the focused portrayals of Frost and Nixon by Michael Sheen and Frank Langella respectively. The supporting cast, most notably Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan, one of Nixon's chief advisers, and Sam Rockwell as James Reston Jr., who just can't wait to see Nixon acknowledge his guilt concerning the Watergate scandal, is top-notch. But David Frost and Richard Nixon are the two central characters in this story, and also the most interesting. As Frost, Sheen creates a charming and likable individual. However, as the movie progresses, Sheen starts to thaw the character's ""frosty"" exterior in order to reveal Frost's uncertainty and desperation. Both he and Nixon have everything to win or to lose depending on which way these interviews go, but, as Frost tells Nixon, ""only one of us can win"".<br/><br/>However, every other cast member is out-done by Frank Langella's sensational portrayal of Richard Nixon. Fully devoting himself to the character, Langella's performance, much like Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight"", isn't so much a performance as a total embodiment of the character. Langella is heartfelt and humane in the role, and he never makes Nixon out to be an idiot. He is an intelligent man who understands the rules of the game that he's playing with Frost. But, most interestingly, Langella brings elements of tragedy to the disgraced man. Here is a man who can't fit into society because of the mistakes that he's made, and also because of his personal faults. There is an almost Shakespearean quality to Nixon's plight. He is a former hero who has fallen from grace, and who is trying desperately to claw his way back to the top. All in all, the Oscar nomination that Langella received for his performance was well-deserved, and I personally wouldn't be surprised if he won.<br/><br/>With his disappointing adaptation of ""The Da Vinci Code"", Ron Howard seemed to have fallen from his career high point, which was his Oscar-winning direction of ""A Beautiful Mind"". However, his direction here is skillful and assured enough to ensure that he is back on track. His greatest achievement is evident in the interview scenes, when he transforms scenes which could have so easily dragged into tense, uncertain sequences of verbal sparring between Frost and Nixon, whilst their two teams watch nervously in the background. However, there are other moments where Howard's brilliance as a director shines through. One sequence, in which Frost receives an unexpected call from a drunk Nixon, is poignant and reveals further layers in the personalities of the two men.<br/><br/>The script also crackles with tension and wit when it could have been as dry and as lacking of life as a desert. The dialogue between Frost and Nixon exquisitely reveals both the growing intensity and respect between the two men. However, the moments of humour are placed in the film at just the right moments so that they don't disrupt the natural flow of the story or the characters. One particular sequence, in which James Reston Jr. is forced to shake hands with Nixon, is very funny, yet it doesn't affect the suspense of the situation. The writer, Peter Morgan, should be given a big pat on the back.<br/><br/>""Frost/Nixon"" may be flawed. Ther are times where it can seem like an expensive TV movie, and it may not be to everyone's taste. But, for anyone who wants to be entertained and learn a little bit about history at the same time, I would heartily recommend ""Frost/Nixon"". It's well-crafted by a director at the top of his game, brilliantly written, exceptionally acted (particularly by Langella, who will have a hard time topping this performance) and, most importantly, it is respectable towards its topic."
"bob the moo","Null","5","10","21 December 2008"," As enjoyable as it is informative
","David Frost is a light entertainment chat show host with reasonable global fame. Richard Nixon is a disgraced President, stepping down from office in light of allegations of his involvement in the Watergate Scandal. For career reasons, Frost decides to set up a series of interviews, at great cost and increasing personal risk. With both men playing a game to get what they want (for Frost, a career boost and some revelations, for Nixon, his chance to put the record straight as he sees it), the interviews begin recording while the mainstream media fail to show an interest.<br/><br/>The interviews in question have always been known to me, but this is not the same as me knowing about them in any meaningful way  which I did not. I had always wanted to see the play when I saw the adverts for it in the paper but never got myself to London to do so  nor did I ever think of it long enough to buy the original interviews themselves. However as a result of seeing the film I will be getting the original interviews as a Christmas gift to myself. The reason for this is that the film version did a great job of presenting the event as culturally important, without overlooking the rather ""insignificant"" manner in which it all started out originally  with the whole project being a bit of a laughing stock. It also makes me want to see the play because the script has done such a good job of capturing the characters and the time  especially useful when a large section of the audience will not know a lot about this period and the people other than the names and that we use ""gate"" to describe anything dodgy in politics. This script is the basis for the drama but Howard does well as director to convey what is going on at key points while he otherwise delivers a typically professional film in all other regards. At first I wasn't totally sure of the structuring device of having talking heads looking back but it never became spoon feeding so much as it was a useful way of telling the story and providing insight.<br/><br/>The cast are very good. Sheen has already shown that he can do impressions without losing his performance and he does it again here  giving us enough of Frost to be instantly recognisable but not to the detriment of his performance. It is Langella that dominates the film with his Nixon  a great character that is hard to do and be compelling but yet he manages it here. The support cast are just that but they are also solidly good with turns from Bacon, Rockwell, Macfadyen, Platt and others. Frost/Nixon is not a fast or thrilling film and I'm sure that the message board will have people complaining ""is that it"", but let them carry on demonstrating their failings and just enjoy the film because, even without the cultural importance of the events, it is still a professionally crafted and engaging drama that is as enjoyable as it is informative."
"natasha-bishop","8","5","10","15 December 2008"," An Intellectual Boxing Match
","Ron Howard successfully adapts Peter Morgan's play about the Frost/Nixon interviews to celluloid. This film does not fall flat, it keeps pace and keeps the audience enthralled in the story line. Frost/Nixon is not a rehashing of the Watergate scandal nor is it a history lesson given by Ron Howard. Frost/Nixon is an intellectual boxing match between two men where the stakes are high; the winner takes it all, the loser falls into anonymity.<br/><br/>Frank Langella had been living with Richard Nixon inside him for almost two years, he starred in the stage production of Frost/Nixon on Broadway and then went right into shooting the film with Ron Howard. What resulted was an intoxicating performance by Langella. Every eyebrow raise, every dart of the eyes, every gesture was as if Langella had created Nixon in himself and was intuitively reacting to every situation as Nixon would. What was so compelling about his performance was the emotion and humor we saw in Nixon. This certainly was never Nixon's public persona, to see the emotion gave me great compassion for the pain he held inside and his longing for acceptance.<br/><br/>The film's highlight, a midnight phone call between an intoxicated Nixon and exhausted Frost, is one of the most intriguing and darkest moments of Langella's impeccable portrayal of Nixon. This is the moment Nixon is opened up and we see all of his inner demons fly out. Frost/Nixon is a complex character study set in a distinct time in American History. I think Langella has a deep respect for Nixon the man, he understands that Nixon was a great human, but still, only a human.<br/><br/>A film worth watching."

","It's still probably worth seeing, I like 20th century American history stuff a lot, so I had a great interest in the topic. I'll give it a 6 because the subject is worthwhile, and it's not pure junk like a lot of movies out there. But it was a really flat one dimensional portrayal of what is in fact, a fascinating subject - a duel between a British interviewer and one of the USA's most fascinating presidents.<br/><br/>The best acting was the Frost character. And the movie dos do a good job of portraying what he put on the line, as well as the 'winner take all' nature of the duel. His underlings were very unlikable characters, although one of them did convey the single minded 'get Nixon' negativity that many people had at the time, and a lot of people were happy to move on from.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is really pretty boring. It was a completely missed opportunity to better portray who Nixon was, and what he had on the line. Love him, hate him, despise or respect him, he was a fascinating character. A lot of people seeing this movie are too young to remember him, and those older still have things they can learn. Just looking on hulu last night, I found stuff on Nixon I'd never seen before<br/><br/>hulu.com nbc-news-time-capsule-richard-m-nixon-in-his-own-words<br/><br/>does anyone think that some of this material wouldn't have given this movie more depth in the first half, and could have replaced some of the 'fluff'? The whole movie can be pretty much summed up by 'does Frost get Nixon, or not?', which may have been the primary issue in the interviews, but certainly not all of it. Most people, including myself, already thought he was guilty - what difference does it really make whether he admits it or not? The acting of Nixon is mixed - I thought it was very weak in the beginning, but did come together more at the end, as did the movie - the movie does at least, improve and come together at the end.<br/><br/>But there was more to those interviews than 'slipping up and confessing Watergate'. These interviews, like Nixon himself, had more than the one dimension of Watergate.

","When actors are asked to play real people in films, the results can be mixed. In this case however, Michael Sheen and Frank Langella produce two of the best performances as real historical characters that I have ever seen on film.<br/><br/>Langella's Nixon is brilliant - I had been concerned that he didn't look enough like him, or that he was too tall etc. but all that becomes secondary as he breathes such compelling life into this controversial character. And I found Sheen's Frost to be absolutely pitch perfect, so much so that I was never distracted by thoughts of a misplaced vocal quirk or gesture. His performance as Tony Blair in 'The Queen' was similarly accurate and I await his portrayal of Brian Clough in 'The Damned United' with baited breath.<br/><br/>But aside from the performances, the massive strength of the film is its ability to find balance and harmony with the characters, and the marvellous way in which a film simply about a political interview is made gripping for two hours (and could easily have been longer). Both men are presented at times as troubled, careless and flawed but also funny, generous and steeped in integrity in equal measure. There are times when we see Nixon as a money-obsessed bigot, and other times when he is a contrite and courageous soul. Similarly, we see Frost both as a happy-go-lucky playboy and as a feckless, unreliable showbiz type. Our minds are not made up for us as to which of these is the more accurate portrayal of each character.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is largely excellent with the glamorous Rebecca Hall well-cast as Caroline Cushing, and Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell as Frost's colleagues. I found the only slight mis-step to be Matthew Macfadyen's John Birt, whose stuffy English producer role was rather unlikeable and tended to add little to the scenes he featured in. However, Kevin Bacon's loyal-as-a-dog aide to Nixon is always interesting.<br/><br/>Even if you are familiar with the story and the interview, the film is always tense. The interview scenes are unbelievably so, even at the times when you are only seeing the expressions on the faces of the protagonists. As it reaches its climax, it is impossible not to feel a heady mix of emotions toward both men, not to mention feel somewhat drained at its climax.<br/><br/>Whilst I would say an interest in politics would help in watching this film, I would also say that anyone who simply appreciates brilliant acting and wonderfully scripted exchanges should make an effort to see Frost/Nixon. You are not likely to be disappointed."

","Film version of what happened when David Frost decided to try to interview Richard Nixon. Based upon the play that played London and Broadway last year this is a top example at how to adapt a play for the screen and get something that exists on its own. Its also contains two of the best performances of the year in Michael Sheen as Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon.<br/><br/>I saw the play twice on Broadway and there was something about seeing the sparring there, right in front of you that made it a magical night at the theater. The Langella won a Tony as Nixon in a performance that was scary to see in person because he disappeared so deeply in the role it was like Nixon on stage. It's probably one of the best things I've seen Give points to Ron Howard and his crew to taking the play and turning it into a film. To be certain there are similarities but at the same time its entirely its own animal. This is the the story of Frost and Nixon and their battle to tell the story of what happened in the Nixon White House. Sheen is amazing and even more affecting then he was on stage as Frost. We see the pain and uncertainty of a man who has thrown every little bit of himself and his fortune (and the fortunes of friends and relatives) in a gamble to become a hit once more in America. In its way its a thankless role compared to Nixon since he often seems to be just a party guy asking questions, however Sheen pulls it off making him into a person you really care about.<br/><br/>The real story of the film is Langella. Minutes after seeing him on screen he ceases to be anything other than Nixon. (How could they have even considered Warren Beatty in the role?) Its an amazing transformation, and in some ways better then it was on Broadway where you couldn't see the details of his face. Its amazing. If you don't like Langella in the role at first wait until the end, wait until the final confrontation, watch Langella's face- watch it and I dare you to see anything other than a broken man. Watch the face in the monitors, its all there. Even watch the final shots of Nixon alone looking at the sea, its masterful physical performance.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful film it really is. Its a film that anyone interested in a good movies should see. I don't know if its a truly great film, but it is a really good one. Certainly its one of the best of 2008."

","When you take on the role of someone so identifiable in the public mind as Richard M. Nixon you'd better have the acting chops for the job. Nixon is so easy to caricature whether gently or acidly. After the Watergate scandal broke, the caricatures became more and more acid indeed. <br/><br/>That was the challenge that Frank Langella met and overcame. In his performance he never once slipped into a David Frye like imitation, though honestly I kept expecting him to throughout the film as I watched it. He was Nixon right down to the dark recesses of his troubled soul. A terribly private man who chose the most public of all professions to engage in. A man of poor background who could not forget the snubs of adolescence. A brilliant man capable of initiatives in governance like the opening of Communist China. A cynical man because he advocated policies that kept China closed for years to America. <br/><br/>The other half of Frost/Nixon is the charming British talk show host David Frost who bet his whole career on getting an interview with one of the most despised figures in the world and getting him to open up on television. In retrospect it was obvious that Frost was the guy for the job. Someone in the hard news field like Mike Wallace would never have gotten in the door to see Nixon.<br/><br/>Unlike Nixon, David Frost is still with us and apparently voiced no complaints about Michael Sheen, not of the Sheen/Estevez acting clan of the USA, playing him. Sheen also responds with a good characterization and captures David Frost as I remember him from the Seventies and Eighties.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon ran for 137 performances last year on Broadway and director Ron Howard had the good sense to cast Langella and Sheen in the roles they originated there. Langella got a Tony Award and will probably get an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Best scene in the film is an inebriated Richard Nixon calling David Frost one night and revealing one nasty side to Frost. Sheen's facial expressions as Langella raves on the phone tell everything.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon is in the cast as Nixon's chief aide in retirement Jack Brennan. There's a bit of Oliver North in Bacon's portrayal, the loyal former Marine who can't forget who was his commander-in-chief during Vietnam and appreciates him if no others do. Brennan also can't forget he felt a stranger in his own country with people despising him for his service. In the recent election, surviving Nixon people supported former POW John McCain against Republican rivals for the nomination. In my state of New York, McCain's campaign was headed by Nixon's son-in-law Edward Cox. <br/><br/>Bacon's loyal Brennan is ironic also because it was Nixon's aides, aides mostly acquired in his eight years between his defeat by John F. Kennedy in 1960 and his election in 1968 that were the ones that did Nixon in. I've often wondered if Nixon had been elected in 1960 would we have seen a Watergate because all the names associated with that scandal were people who would have never been in a Nixon presidency then.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is a fascinating look at a tortured soul who wound up in the most powerful position in the world. There may be some Academy gold for this film and you can also believe that Nixon will continue to fascinate people for years."

","Exuding class and almost effortless direction, Frost/Nixon is Ron Howard's best film in a while. But before giving him all the credit, what's worth mentioning is that the film succeeds so well mainly because Peter Morgan had already given the director a brilliant, juicy script to work with. Without it, cries of boredom may well have been heard, as let's face it, this is a film merely about a few interviews between two men. So its success definitely has more to do with the writing and the performances than the direction, but Howard does create a sleek and perfectly paced two hours - no mean feat in itself when you have such a dialog driven setup. To make it compelling, almost edge of your seat material as well, is even more of an accomplishment. Ultimately, the combination of Morgan's muscular writing and Howard's increasingly developing flair behind the camera has proved a real winner.<br/><br/>Within that combination is a fantastic cast from the ground up, and all you can really do when the film settles in is just sit back and be thankful. The performances after all are what makes this film so damn engrossing. Playing the titular characters, the transition from stage to screen for Michael Sheen and Frank Langella is smooth and without a doubt, performing such intense work together for so long has benefited the film adaptation. They are both outstanding, but one can't go past singling out Langella as Nixon. He inhabits the man to jaw dropping effect and by the end, the actor has all but vanished inside the former disgraced president, right down to the slouch and mumbling, gruff speech. A strong supporting cast of Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt amongst others gives weight around the two leads and everybody is on top form.<br/><br/>The decision to inter-cut after the fact reflections from those side players was a good move by Howard and it gives the whole thing more of a sense of an event - a historical one at that, and definitely adds to the cinematic feel Frost/Nixon has. It was a little off putting the first couple of times but overall breaking up the flow of the story like this helped tell it and fittingly gives us the point of view of everybody involved as opposed to just our two prize fighters.<br/><br/>In the end, the films exploration of the power of television in an era when a lot of people still probably didn't realize it the way Frost did, to Nixon's deflated arrogance towards the end when Frost lands his 'confession' and the close up - the one you can't hide from - showing a man full of self-loathing and that moment's potential impact on 45 million viewers, is drama at it's best. The scene is the crux from which the whole film and indeed, the interviews themselves, were built around and if Langella didn't pull it off, the film would have been deflated unimaginatively. Of course he does, and even though he'd had the stage play to perfect it, it's still one of the most bravura performances in a long time."
"DarthVoorhees","7","4","8","17 March 2010"," Interesting, but not a masterpiece by any means
","The Frost/Nixon interviews were a television milestone, but director Ron Howard sees them as more than they were. Historically were they that important? Sure some people found it satisfying to see Richard Nixon put under pressure. The film is structured around Richard Nixon being put under pressure, but in the end I just asked myself ""Does this really matter?"" I certainly don't think David Frost is some sort of hero. I think David Frost at best is a historical Trivial Pursuit footnote. In the end Richard Nixon didn't get punished for his deeds, and he did achieve a certain dignity before his death. The movie isn't about Frost and Nixon. It's about Frost being some cultural warrior for a society that hates Richard Nixon. It takes a pretentious viewpoint to think of Frost as that. I kept thinking of Tom Hanks in Mike Nichol's ""Charlie Wilson's War"". Howard is revising history to bend to his own ends. Frost/Nixon isn't a political thriller, at best it's an uneven drama. I think the film would have been far more effective as a character study about these two flawed men.<br/><br/>Richard Nixon is made to be some sort of villain here. This is a lazy characterization and even the strongest performance by Frank Langella couldn't have saved the lens of this Nixon character. It's boring to see Nixon as some sort of villain. Howard having grown up in that Watergate generation wants to demonize him I suppose. Nixon was by far the more interesting character in the film. What appealed to me about him was the psychological motives of the character. Either Nixon was truly a devil, or he truly believed what he was doing was in the best interests of the country. Historically Nixon is an interesting conundrum. Had Watergate never been discovered one might have viewed him as a decent president. Langella is good in portraying Nixon as someone who believes what he was doing was right, but there are moments when the lens is just far too skewed. What is the audience supposed to think when they see Toby Jones, and Kevin Bacon as Nixon's handlers? They are creepy people working for a creepy man. Frost is the good to Nixon's evil. This is a far less compelling approach than the ripe character study these men provide.<br/><br/>Frost is a moral crusader, and that is a hard pill to swallow. ""Why didn't you burn the tapes"" he wants to ask Nixon as his big opening. What's the motive behind his interview? I think it would be far more interesting for Frost to be what he was, a comedian turned into an awkward interviewer. I mean what does Frost have to gain from his interviewing Nixon? Howard suggests that Frost had sound goals all the way from the beginning, that he saw himself as the man to heal America. This Capra-esquire approach is stupid and boring. Ratings, money, and prestige were obviously a big portion of why David Frost sought out to get Nixon in his chair.<br/><br/>For a film entitled Frost/Nixon this picture seems awfully crowded. It's a match between two men. We get to know the sidekicks a little more than I would have personally preferred. Sam Rockwell plays dialogue that is forced and inorganic and he is the focus of more scenes than are necessary. Rockwell plays a caricature of a liberal scholar who felt personally betrayed by Nixon. Ironically the film's greatest failure though is it's inability to truly delve deep into the feelings of Watergate. To truly understand why these interviews were an important cultural moment we need to understand the culture of this time. We don't get to view into the culture.<br/><br/>The idea of cameras never lying is brought up at the end of the film. Television is a business made of lies and false realities. It's a business befitting of immoral men. We have a film about ideas rather than a film about men. The intended effect is not present."

","Both characters in real life (Frost and Nixon) might be described as slime-balls. You'd therefore think a film with them both as lead characters would be a real no-no. Actually, this is a very well constructed depiction of a real life set of events. It doesn't matter whether there are non-factual links, it all makes perfect sense. Frank Langella is absolutely perfect in his role as Nixon. I was almost convinced into liking the old rogue - you see, perfect tricky Dickie for you! I've never liked Frost the person and knew that Sheen would be able to pull off this character just as he has tackled other real life characters that are equally shifty. Brilliant. I do recall in fact seeing some of the real life television coverage of Nixon and was reminded of this during the screening. It fitted perfectly. A must go and see, it's a cracking story."

","Say what you want about Ron Howard, but he does manage to create engaging dramas within the confines of the Hollywood system. His strike rate for quality is solid. Even his box office flop, ""The Missing"", is one of recent memory's most underrated gems. With ""Frost/Nixon"", he takes a potentially boring subject for cinematic reconstruction (a stage play about David Frost interviewing Richard Nixon) and builds a dramatic powerhouse. How does he do it? He starts with a great script by Peter Morgan (the man who wrote the terrific ""The Queen"", another subject that could have turned over and died) and he casts the same people who were in the stage play, Frank Langella (Nixon) and Michael Sheen (David Frost). He adds a bunch of none-too-shabby supporting players such as Toby Jones, Oliver Platt, and Kevin Bacon, and he blends everything with a professionalism that doesn't feel forced or look too polished. Howard's no-style style always works in favor of his material because it allows the material to lead. Frost was just a journalistic lightweight when he approached Nixon for an interview. Nixon knew it. That's exactly why Nixon agreed to be interviewed. He was confident that he'd be able to walk all over Frost in front of millions of Americans and convince them that he wasn't the bad guy they all thought he was. With the interviews taking place over several days, Nixon gets the upper hand early on and looks destined to achieve his goals. What he didn't count on was Frost getting better and smarter. By the time the last interview was scheduled, Frost, working with his cohorts, had gathered so much obscure intel on the ex-Prez that he only had to throw Dicky the right length of rope. As history recorded, the man took it and hung himself (figuratively speaking). As you would expect, the performances are superb and the film's pacing is swift. Howard gives us fascinating details and fascinating character moments that amount to something much bigger and much better than a filmed stage play. This is engrossing cinema."

","David Frost: Are you really saying the President can do something illegal? Richard Nixon: I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's *not* illegal! David Frost: ... I'm sorry?<br/><br/>Finally a legitimate Oscar candidate for best picture and actor. Believe me I was determined not to like the hollywoodization of Frost/Nixon after I had been thrilled by the London stage production with Michael Sheen and Frank Langella in the titular roles. It turns out that Ron Howard's film is the perfect film complement to the stage production as it moves to offices and locations the stage couldn't and as it gives more time to supporting roles.<br/><br/>Most of all the close-ups are the distinguishing film contribution to this historical 1977 event in which unremarkable TV host David Frost gave former president Richard Nixon 4 interviews, the final one devoted to Watergate. For the last 30 years many of us have been relieved by Nixon's admitting in the fourth interview that he erred in the cover up leading to his resignation, the only president in history to do so. The film is not as prosaic as my synopsis, for its drama is distributed slowly by flashback and talking heads in an unobtrusive documentary style that efficiently gives facts but relies on the drama to make a compelling story.<br/><br/>For most of the film, Ron Howard focuses on the boyish Frost as his impending tragedy is that he can't find enough funding for the project. Coupled with his playboy image and perception of him as a lightweight (although he graduated from Oxford, for goodness sake), the first half of the film is agonizing for sympathizers.<br/><br/>Director Howard uses the camera like a scalpel dissecting every puff and pain on Langella's Nixonian visage. He plays the Nixon characteristics with subtlety; on the stage, he didn't overplay either, in fact underplayed them all. The film Nixon more closely reflects his real-life identifiers such as jowls, stoop, and hairline; the stage relied less so even with Langella in the role.<br/><br/>Both productions carry the fascination with a tricky president who still had artifice about him long after his boys had stormed Watergate."
"lists-9","5","5","11","31 August 2009"," Mediocre
","While this is not a bad film, and is no doubt enjoyed by people with a keener interest in politics than me, it seems to fall flat in a number of areas. <br/><br/>Firstly, it's hard to care about either participant: in the film, Nixon is a mean-spirited man thrown out of the top job for criminal activity, but long unwilling to acknowledge that it was his own fault. Frost is shown as a rather lazy playboy who only ""does his homework"" in the nick of time.<br/><br/>Secondly, can we believe in what we're seeing? Michael Sheen as usual does a very good impersonation of Frost, as well as convincing us that he understands the character. Frank Langella is less successful as Nixon: while his performance is generally competent, he only bears a passing resemblance to the ex-President, and clearly gets Nixon's accent wrong. If this is obvious to me even as a ""Brit"", then there must be quite a few Americans who find his voice grating. I realise that actors are about more than just impersonation, but convincing the audience that they could be watching the real life characters is part of the essence of this kind of film and, for me, this aspect didn't work.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the whole thing is just a bit over-dramatised: necessary, perhaps, just to keep us watching, but at times it becomes rather silly. I agree absolutely with the other poster here who says ""the Frost/Nixon interviews were merely a relatively inconsequential event here being treated as if they were life-and-death"".<br/><br/>Overall, a moderately entertaining film, but only worth watching if you have nothing better to do, or are a keen student of 20th century US history."

Nixon's effort at rehabilitation largely succeeded, as both the Washington Post, and Newsweek acknowledged.<br/><br/>While his record was tarnished, he finished his life as a successful author, and elder statesman.<br/><br/>If your a liberal, all of the above is sauce for the goose, but if you're a conservative you're left with a slow moving film that for the sake of drama isn't always as honest as it ought to be."

","Quite honestly, Frost/Nixon is a movie that, based on the trailers and other promos, looked somewhat tedious. I should have known better. Thanks to the skilled direction of Ron Howard and the extraordinary acting of both Frank Langella and Michael Sheen, this is the best exploration of the workings and motivations of a U.S. President that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The story follows David Frost, a comedic television host whose career is on thin ice, as he attempts to setup a televised interview of then ex- President Richard Nixon. His initial motivation is clearly anchored in the projected ratings/financial gain that would come from the four part series, but, with aid received from a pair of academics, one of whom is played by Sam Rockwell (who has recently had two great roles, including his stint in Moon), Frost begins to see the achievement that could be obtained if he's able to break down some figurative walls and broach the topic of Watergate as no one else had been able to do. People are skeptical of Frost's ability to effectively interview the troubled, often evasive Nixon, and, to add insult to injury, the funding for the project–which is acquired through the solicitation of various sponsors– begins to dissolve mid-interview.<br/><br/>Howard approaches Frost/Nixon, taken from a stage play bearing the same name, as if it is a documentary. The story is clearly told from the various perspectives of the major players involved in the process of making the interview a reality, and, as boring as that may sound, it works incredibly well here. The show-stopper, however (as you've probably guessed), is Langella's portrayal of Nixon.<br/><br/>Through his facial expressions, the depiction of Nixon's characteristic tendency to sweat when agitated, and the delivery of his dialogue, we learn a a great deal about a fascinating historical figure. There's an especially hair-raising scene when Nixon, who had been decimating Frost in the interviews, calls his adversary the day before their final interview session. Nixon had been drinking, and he goes on a tirade in which he discloses his motivations, his fears, and his thoughts on life. For me, this, more than any other scene (except, perhaps, the final interview) is where Langella is really able to flex his acting ""chops"" and show us what he's got. He paints a portrait of Nixon as a deeply troubled individual who wants nothing more than to show those who said he wouldn't be able to ascend to the top that they're wrong. Here, Langella injects Nixon with a an almost tangible lust for power and scarily reveals his intolerance for any sort of resistance. Earlier in the film, we also witness the greed stewing in the former President, when his PR/marketing assistant, Swifty Lazar, expertly depicted by Toby Jones, mentions the amount of monetary compensation he'll receive if he decides to participate in the interviews. Nixon interestedly raises one eyebrow and quickly recants his desire to abstain from participation in interviews. Oddly, though, Nixon is humanized at the film's conclusion– we get a clear sense of the loneliness associated with one person's determined ascent to power. This is a move that some may find disconcerting, but it feels completely natural, so Howard won't get any complaints from me.<br/><br/>If you haven't already done so, add this to your Netflix queue. You won't regret it."

","There he is, former President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella), at the end of his political life. It has been a few months since Watergate and his resignation and he has been reduced to being a guest speaker at low-profile conferences. Cue David Frost (Michael Sheen): The British talk show host is known for interviewing the crème de la crème of Hollywood and pop music and hosting shows about escape artists. With virtually no credentials in political journalism, he still decides to take on what could be considered the most important interview of the time. It's Richard Nixon's first big post-Watergate talk. Because money talks and also because Frost seems to be a safe bet as a soft-hitting interviewer to Nixon's team, he gets the job. Frost ends up ""giving Richard Nixon the trial he never had,"" as Sam Rockwell's character puts it.<br/><br/>""Trial"" is definitely the operative word here. ""Frost/Nixon,"" which re-tells the story of one of the most memorable interviews in American history, plays like a cross between a boxing match and the best courtroom drama you have ever seen. It centers, of course, on the interviews themselves but also allows a glance backstage. You get to see how both parties prepare for the interviews, which is actually a bit like preparing for a boxing match, and what strain they are under. Nixon wants to rehabilitate himself. Frost needs the interviews to be spectacular, mostly because he has problems selling them to TV stations.<br/><br/>Above all, ""Frost/Nixon"" has the feel of a highly enjoyable play which after all, is where it originated. Still, it transforms seamlessly to the screen, mostly because of the excellent performances by Langella and Sheen. Even though Langella has been accused of ""overdoing"" his Nixon, he succeeds in capturing the spirit of the 37th U.S. president and has rightfully earned an Oscar nomination. The difficulty of accuracy versus artistic interpretation of the material is the same here as with all biopics and ""true stories,"" or even more so, seeing as everyone can go back and look at the real Frost/Nixon interviews. Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan, whose work includes ""The Queen,"" succeed in finding a balance between realism and Hollywood-esquire appeal to audiences."
"freemantle_uk","9","2","3","4 January 2009"," An Excellent Actor's Film
","Frost/Nixon is clearly a film that was designed to get awards and recognition for its actors and writer Peter Morgan.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is based on the stage play written by Peter Morgan, which was about the British TV interviewer David Frost (Michael Sheen) who interviews degraded ex-American President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella). Frost in the mid 70s was a successful talk show host in Britain and Australia, but was famous for interviewing celebrities and light entertainment segments. When Nixon resigns Frost has the brainwave of having a series of interviews with the ex-President. To do this Frost had to offer an unprecedented amount of money, $600,000. Richard Nixon sees this as an opportunity to rebuild his reputation and at the same time get interviewed what he sees as a lightweight. Frost struggles to sell the idea to the American networks because of the cost and he was fairly unknown to the American audience. He has to risk his own reputation and money to make such the project could be done. As well Frost hired two researchers, Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell). Reston has a big chip on his shoulder, disliking Nixon because of his abuse of power and role during the Vietnam War, and he wanted Frost to be as touch as possible against Nixon. When the interviews start Nixon was able to run rings around Frost, using his friendship to play mind games and Frost's inexperience with interviewing major political figures, but slowly gains his strength and starts to challenge Nixon.<br/><br/>As I have started it is an actor's film. Michael Sheen is an excellent British actor, famous for playing Tony Blair twice and is likely to more weighty projects. Frank Langella also offered the best performance of Richard Nixon since Anthony Hopkins. Both men starred in the stage play and so were were obvious choices for the film, and I personally think both men are likely to get nominated for Oscar. Unfortunately I doubt whoever gets nominated for best Supporting Actors (most likely Langella), they won't get the awards because of the pressure for Heath Leadger to get the award. Other supporting actors in the film also offered excellent performers. I personal hope Matthew Macfadyen has a good career ahead of him and I hope he becomes James Bond after Daniel Craig's run. Rockwell and Platt were also passionate during their performances. The writing was sharp and at times witty. It is deep with the ideas of politics, power, the media and the seventies, and I favour Peter Morgan is a strong contender for the Oscar best Adapted Screenplay. The film does show Nixon in a negative light at first, making him out to have a sense of grandeur about himself and belief that he was in the right. He was also greedy, wanting money and wanting to security his legacy. But at the end Nixon is shown to be human and that he does have a friendship with David Frost. However I did not like the documentary talking head style that was used, feeling it was a little lazy and the film does take a little artistic license. Ron Howard got the character of the seventies right, offered a balance film and was a good hand behind the camera. I would like to see more films like this from him, but I doubt he would get an Oscar nod this time round. As well this film is also likely to get an Oscar nomination for Best Film, but this awards season has offered some strong films. Hopefully Frost/Nixon should win one or two awards.<br/><br/>A strong recommendation from me."

","After the Watergate event that precipitated the demise of President Nixon, the nation anxiously waited for the interview that would very likely define the Nixon legacy. ""Frost/Nixon"" chronicles the process behind (and during) that very interview.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, the film looks at two primary areas: the creation of the interview, which includes the odd choice of David Frost (Michael Sheen), and then the actual interview of Nixon (Frank Langella) itself, depicted as a battle of intellectual wits between both camps.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie stand out is the incredible tension that director Ron Howard creates. Because of the deceit that Watergate perpetuated, as well as the pardon of Nixon by Gerald Ford that left much of the nation feeling that justice had not been served, this interview felt more important than just a few hours of airtime. Howard really captures that intensity, especially towards the end during the part of the interview that is now so well-known.<br/><br/>On a quick note, Langella is as good of a ""Nixon"" as is humanly possible. At times, when the camera angle and his posture is right, you'll think that the former President is actually on screen himself.<br/><br/>If you lived through that time period and remember it well, this film will likely flood you with a wave of nostalgia (both good and bad). However, I was born in 1985 and was STILL entranced by this film, knowing hardly anything going in about the interview.<br/><br/>Thus, for all fans of political/cultural dramas, this is a worthwhile watch. It could have done a few things better, but overall it accomplishes its mission nicely: to re-create the importance and cultural relevance of those Frost/Nixon interviews."
"Mr-Fusion","7","1","1","20 October 2016"," Who knows how accurate it is, but entertaining all the same
","""Frost/Nixon"" was a curiosity for me; for one, I wanted to see Frank Langella as Richard Nixon, and the other reason is just to see how they'd distilled so many hours of interviews into a two-hour running time. I've never seen the original footage, so I can't speak to the film's accuracy, but it makes for great Hollywood dramatization nonetheless. Ron Howard frames it as a boxing match; an inexperienced journalist facing a veteran who knows how to run rungs around his opponent. Langella comes alive when he taps into Nixon's ferocity, and the movie really gets interesting when Michael Sheen stops soft-balling and goes on the attack. If you're going into this for two great performances, it excels on that basis alone.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Frost / Nixon (2008): Dir: Ron Howard / Cast: Michael Sheen, Frank Langella, Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Oliver Platt: Another triumph by director Ron Howard whose range of films go from Apollo 13 to The Paper. Here he presents a film that examines the relationship between ex-President Richard Nixon and talk show host David Frost. It examines how the series of interviews saved Frost's career and all but exposed Nixon's Watergate ordeal. Frank Langella does a superb impression of Nixon who is seen here as someone continuing on with life while still yearning to be heard and respected. Michael Sheen shines as Frost who not only accepts the opportunity to revamp his career, he also gains an in depth relationship with an ex- President that has been the subject of more speculation and curiosity than most. Is the film seen as a confession, or just a reminder that he is merely human? Kevin Bacon appears as one of Nixon's advisers, and Sam Rockwell appears as part of Frost's research team who hates Nixon and feels that the interviews should be the trial he never received. This is a great film with insight for the scholars and the curios alike, and succeeds in being one of the best films of the year. For another great film on the subject I recommend strongly All the President's Men, otherwise this is a provocative film gives insight into a failed Presidency. Score: 10 / 10"

","So after years of only hearing or reading about this, I finally got to see this on Netflix disc with my mom who was also enthralled by this dramatized account of the behind-the-scenes saga of TV talk show host David Frost's interview of former president Richard Nixon. Michael Sheen as Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon-both reprising their stage roles-are very compelling as these real-life people. Frost is quite successful doing shows in England and Australia and thinks an interview with the disgraced president would lead to big numbers. Nixon just wants a chance to redeem himself when agreeing to this interview. Director Ron Howard really does a fine job of opening Peter Morgan's play cinematically with Morgan himself adapting it. Along with Sheen and Langella, Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell, and Kevin Bacon also do well in supporting roles. And when that interview reaches the climax, well, it's quite a revelation seeing both the president make that statement he does and his and Frost's reaction to it. In summary, Frost/Nixon is quite an entertaining take on such a historical event."
"Hey_Sweden","8","1","1","23 November 2015"," A riveting story.
","Director Ron Howard brings an appreciable cinematic flair to Peter Morgans' adaptation of his own stage play. It tells the true story of the disgraced former U.S. president Richard M. Nixon (Frank Langella), who is courted for a series of interviews by upbeat, likable British TV host David Frost (Michael Sheen). Nixon and his loyalists see this as an opportunity for him to repair the damage done to his reputation. Frost, on the other hand, is looking to gain some credibility from the venture. He's humiliated by the smooth, experienced politician at first due to not quite taking his own opportunity seriously enough. Obviously, the segment that will make or break the experience for Frost will be how the two men handle the topic of Watergate.<br/><br/>This is fascinating, interesting stuff, especially for a viewer such as this who is not terribly informed on the subject. It's a good look into the machinations of both politics and TV journalism. A great film it is not, but it's solidly entertaining for just over two hours. One of the best things that it does is to put a human face on Mr. Nixon, who could, to some people, be written off as a mere cartoon sleaze ball. Even in the face of his misdeeds, it is possible to take some sympathy on this man whom many in the nation simply want to see confess and apologize.<br/><br/>""Frost/Nixon"" is one of those films for this viewer where any slickness on the part of the filmmakers takes a back seat - and rightly so - to the power of the material. It's brought to life by a superb cast. Langella and Sheen anchor the story with two very convincing portrayals, and Kevin Bacon, Matthew Macfadyen, Oliver Platt, Toby Jones, Patty McCormack (as Pat Nixon), Rons' brother & father (and frequent repertory players) Clint and Rance Howard, and Eloy Casadaos offer indelible support. Rebecca Hall is lovely and appealing as Caroline, a gal who catches Frosts' eye, but the character isn't really important in the developing plot of this film.<br/><br/>A worthy viewing for some people, but surely it would have even more resonance for people who lived through this tale and remember the key players.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

After years of hounding, Nixon does the interview in summer 1977 to set the record straight and collect the $600k.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard has created a fascinating movie about what on the surface should be a very static drama. He injects great energy and excitement for what could have been a very dry movie. Michael Sheen does a great job as the charming TV personality. Frank Langella doesn't have the look of Nixon, but his terrific acting chops is put to full use to infused his character with Nixon's persona.

"saytosandeep","8","1","1","2 November 2013"," MY REVIEW: It's Just You and Nixon
","Well, the plot suggests it is a drama of capturing a wrong doer politician off guard by a brave talk show host but what it turns out to be how the wrong doer chose not to escape the controversy. In fact our hero the interviewer David Frost has very few moments of heroism. From start to finish, it is the terrific performance of Frank Langella as the controversial president Richard Nixon, delicious dialogs and a neat and engaging screenplay. Other supporting characters are also well developed and provide the ample support on the base of strong acting to the overall drama. Being based on true incidents, the plot and story can't be commented on. All that can be said is that it is very well dramatized for a movie experience."
"jboothmillard","7","1","1","5 February 2013"," Frost/Nixon
","From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Ron Howard (The Paper, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind), I knew that this film would be focusing on the time of the biggest political and financial possibly in the whole of American history, and I was up for seeing a reconstruction of one the major events in the aftermath. Basically, based on the stage play, set in 1970's, the Watergate scandal breaks in in 1972 and President of the United States, Richard Nixon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Frank Langella), may have been directly involved, and in 1974 he resigned from office without admitting any guilt and without any apology to the nation. A few weeks later British talk show host (Sir) David Frost (Michael Sheen) is in discussion with the heads at LWT (London Weekend Television) with high interest in interviewing the former President, but they do not believe many people will watch and that he would be willing to talk to anyone, but Frost persuades them, telling them that the live resignation speech was watched by 400 million. After Nixon has recovered from phlebitis in hospital, a deal is made after securing the figure of $600,000 (originally $500,000) for a series of interviews, paying an advance, but Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) doubts he can pay the entire sum, and Frost is being turned by all U.S. broadcast networks because of his lightweight approach during interviews. Deciding to finance the project privately he prepares his research and questions with his friend and producer John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen), and investigators James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) and Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt), he also turns down the offer of lead involving a Federal Courthouse in Washington. Frost does get to meet Nixon before the interviews process will begin, and he is warned about his approach by the former President's people, but even these things don't make him fully realise the antagonistic nature the talks could bring between the two men, and certainly he cannot comprehend how important they could be in the careers of them both. The first three sessions of recording, each lasting two and a half hours, Nixon is allowed to talk and talk almost uninterrupted and answers rather vague and unimportant questions that tread carefully, these long monologues he gives, such as swift brush through of Vietnam and his achievements in foreign policy stop Frost from challenging him with the pressing questions, so his editorial team express their frustrations and doubt his ability as an interviewer. The final session is the one that will focus on the Watergate scandal, and four days before Frost gets a phone call in his hotel room from an inebriated Nixon, and mistaking him for his new partner Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) he answered the phone with a mention of a cheeseburger, this gets their conversation flowing, but of course Nixon gets serious in saying that the final talk will make or break both of them, he sees it as some kind of psychological battle, where if he wins he will revive his political career, he is sure he will be the victor. Following the phone call Frost goes into action researching all night through to the morning, and having sold the interviews to interested networks and gaining advertising sponsors he accepts the offer from Reston about the lead he has, the next three days he spends preparing, and he is ready for the final recorded conversation with the information he has gathered, including about Charles Colson involved in the scandal. The editors are gripped by Frost's more confident and badgering technique to take on Nixon, even causing him to say the shocking words ""When the President does it, that means it's not illegal"", essentially concluding he covered up his wrongdoing, and when asked to confirm this Brennan bursts in to stop the recording and take the President out to stop he can incriminate himself more. Nixon thanks Brennan for his concern, but he wants to continue, and when recording resumes Nixon admits participating in a cover-up and in an emotional moment opens up and says that ""he let the American people down"" and that he regrets it deeply, this was the point of the interview that became momentous, he is congratulated by his crew for creating a must see piece of television. Before returning to England, Frost and Nixon meet at his villa, where the interviewer presents the former President with a pair of shoes, Nixon graciously accepts defeat from the psychological battle, and Frost confirms his question about calling him at his hotel and that they talked about cheeseburgers, the final text tells that the word ""gate"" has become common in reported scandals, Frost continues to interview, and that Nixon wrote his memoirs, but never escaped controversy, so stayed out of the limelight until he died. Also starring Toby Jones as Irving 'Swifty' Lazar, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Lloyd Davis, Patty McCormack as Pat Nixon and Rance Howard (Ron's father) as Ollie. Both Langhella and Sheen give marvellously strong performances as they try to outwit each other psychologically using the power of their words to get and out of each other's heads, the script really relies on strong words, some obviously based on the real interviews, so it feels just as compelling as the real thing, and the story is played out well, even if you don't know much about politics this is a worthwhile watch, a terrific historical drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film, Best Editing, Best Make Up & Hair and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Original Score for Hans Zimmer and Best Screenplay. Very good!"
"Hawkensian","8","1","1","1 December 2012"," Frost/Nixon is a taut, entertaining dramatisation with strong performances and an accomplished period aura
","When watching films based on true events, my propensity for doubting what I see on screen is instantly heightened. The main thing that I found suspect was the extent to which Nixon was constructed as a villain. During the film he is shown to be deceptive, racist, lecherous and a man unashamedly motivated by money. The film does add favourable depth to the character in places, making the viewer pity him in some respects, but generally Nixon doesn't fare well at all. I don't know enough about the man to accurately comment on the film's portrayal of him, but I did find the characterisation somewhat dubious.<br/><br/>Furthermore, upon researching the interviews, I read that David Frost's experience was different to what's seen in the film. According to his partner Caroline Cushing, he didn't fret endlessly over his performances with Nixon, he was quite content with each of the interviews. <br/><br/>So, like many films 'inspired by true events', the film takes liberties with the facts. However, this doesn't matter to the viewer, for the artistic licence makes for a great piece of dramatisation. The film is quite a gruelling experience; the pressure in and out of the interviews is intense. For a film that concerns conversations, it is quite remarkable how compelling and uncomfortable it is. The wars of words and mind games are more engrossing than any boxing match in 'Raging Bull' or 'The Fighter'. <br/><br/>The film's chief merit lies in its performances. Martin Sheen sounds and even looks exactly like David Frost, it is quite uncanny. And whilst not meeting the likeness achieved by Sheen, Frank Langella is equally as captivating as Nixon. Also, Kevin Bacon gives a good, typical Kevin Bacon performance as Jack Brennan, the officious aide to the President.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is a taut, entertaining dramatisation with strong performances and an accomplished period aura.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

"DICK STEEL","10","1","1","9 August 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Frost/Nixon
","Frost/Nixon is a stage play by Peter Morgan, which is based on the series of televised interviews involving US President Richard Nixon and television presenter David Frost back in 1977. Ron Howard adapts from the stage version with Peter Morgan writing the screenplay, so there's this authenticity that comes along with it, and of course the principal titular characters of Frost and Nixon played by their stage incarnations Michael Sheen and Frank Langella.<br/><br/>This film though didn't manage to garner a theatrical release here, because distributors are probably of the opinion that nobody in Singapore would be interested to watch a dramatized piece of history involving an ex-President and a flamboyant presenter, but I suppose they had probably missed the point why this film was made, as Ron Howard had mentioned, bear some close resemblance to history repeating itself during the Bush Administration and the parallels of abuses of power. Even if not so, then Ron Howard should be pedigree enough since he had crafted an engaging and engrossing film based upon the successful Broadway run.<br/><br/>It's very much an examination into the two gladiators' minds, in their preparation and research before the big fight. And of course they don't go into it alone, each having assembled a team to prepare dossiers on the other, as well as the assembly of facts, figures and the pre-empting of what questions can be asked, and how best to deflect them or diffuse their intent and meaning. This we see expertly delivered by the Nixon camp led by Kevin Bacon's Chief of Staff Jack Brennan, in advice such as rambling to time-waste, much to the frustration of the Frost camp, with Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell and Rebecca Hall all providing top notch performances as real life characters.<br/><br/>Besides the obvious political jabs during the interviews, what's interesting is to note what goes on behind the making of a high risk show, without the confirmation of revenue streams since no networks want to touch it. You can imagine the immense pressure David Frost is under, and Michael Sheen performed admirably in this role, and frankly I think Sheen is fast becoming one of my favourite actors with his uncanny ability to embody each role that his plays with aplomb, with historical characters even being nothing impossible to tackle. His Frost has a very vulnerable side to it and Ron Howard dwells on this a lot, to bring us the challenges that he faced with the multiple roles he has to play, in addition to secure funding.<br/><br/>For Nixon, it's an opportunity to get himself back into popular spotlight and telling things from his perspective, which the general public is finding it difficult to accept, if at all. Ron Howard had to focus on the differences in personalities between the two men, and Frank Langella rings through a performance that is not a conscious impersonation, but close enough to be convinced it's Nixon on screen. That deep baritone voice also brings about a very stately persona, and like one of the characters quipped, brings about a certain sex appeal (!)<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is a top notch film with top notch performances, with qualities that at times resemble a documentary especially with its interviews with the support characters about the entire episode. For interviewers wannabe, this is a film that you'll probably want to have a look at, in understanding the necessity in formulating a water-tight yet flexible strategy about wrestling and releasing control with the interviewee, the study of body languages, and the importance of the informalities and the back channels in communication which is crucial for the interviewer, or subject even, especially with how off the cuff remarks can just disarm the most prepared."
"headly66","4","9","25","5 January 2009"," This is not Nixon.
","As a film it's just OK, a bit trite and under-explored but the bottom line is that Langella's performance is just not Nixon. I thought that Hopkins did a bad version in Nixon (1992), but this makes him look spot on. I understand that actors can take things as they will and sometimes it works (in the 80's I saw David Bowie do Elephant Man on Broadway with no makeup and he pulled it off) but I don't believe at any time or place that this is Richard Nixon. His voice, mannerisms, look, etc, are all wrong or just vague characterizations of the ex President. If your going to do somebody who's as well know for the way he acted it needs to be better than this. Worst impression since Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison. At an early point it becomes a distraction and colors my opinion all the way through. OK film, bad Nixon."

","You could be forgiven for having been completely unaware of the interviews between talk- show host David Frost and disgraced ex-US President Richard Nixon before the publicity blitz of this film. However, director Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan would want you to think that it was one of the most important moments for politics, journalism and basically American culture in modern history, and are willing to spend two hours to convince you of just that. Whether or not you end up believing them is one thing, but you can't doubt their tenacity and the fact that they very nearly succeed is thanks in no small part to the committed cast, particularly (and unsurprisingly) Michael Sheen and Frank Langella, who serve as the titular acting duet.<br/><br/>Langella may be the one getting all the attention for his stooping, roaring performance as the proud, dying lion that is Richard Nixon, and it is easy to see why. Mimicry being what mimicry is, he naturally and effectively disappears inside the role, and the entire film seems built to serve his performance (even pointing it out as Frost is criticized by his team for allowing Nixon to dominate the early interviews). However, it is Michael Sheen who quietly steals the film away from him, not only bringing the much needed pathos to a film that could otherwise have just been two arrogant men talking to one-another, but also imbuing the film with a surprising lightness of touch. In particular, the early scenes establishing Frost's character  the loud suits, the self-assured flirting, the ridiculous celebrity embellishments  are very funny in Sheen's capable grasp. It seems at first that he may just be doing his Tony Blair again, the role that made him famous in both The Deal and The Queen, but so sleight is Sheen's hand that you won't notice as the cocky smile weakens and the shifty eyes deepen that he has turned the character completely inside-out.<br/><br/>While the film is all about Frost and Nixon, however, with a cast featuring such heavyweight character actors as Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt, there is some great acting from the sidelines as well, and it all serves as a welcome distraction from the weight of Peter Morgan's screenplay, which is almost as self-aggrandizing as David Frost himself. Morgan is a fine writer, and as he has proved with The Queen and The Last King Of Scotland, he is extremely adept at making engrossing stories and compelling characters out of episodes of history that wouldn't immediately seem to lend themselves to theatricalising. Along with Ron Howard, himself a consistently strong, adept filmmaker, he has created an absorbing, well-paced tale (apart from the misjudged documentary structure it has given itself), successfully finding character arcs in what is a very talky piece as the publicity-hungry Frost soon begins to realise that his selfish reasons for wanting to conduct the interviews  fame and fortune in America  pale in comparison to what his team, and the entire American public, expect of them  the trial Nixon never had to face over the Watergate Scandal.<br/><br/>However, Morgan is ultimately unable to escape from the inherent problems that the story itself brings with it. The film obviously fancies itself a call for the necessities of journalism on this age of Fox News, or a topical parable about a despised ex-President marred in scandal being brought to justice (how many Americans must wish that someone like David Frost was around nowadays?) but there is no ignoring the fact that the Frost/Nixon interviews were merely a relatively inconsequential event here being treated as if they were life-and-death.<br/><br/>For more of this review, or reviews like it, visit:<br/><br/>jacksfilmblog at blogspot.com"

","I was extremely surprised by this gem of a political film. I didn't expect much going into to it and was thoroughly delighted when i came out of the theater. Who would have thought, after so many failed attempts at politically based films, that Frost/Nixon would be one of the best pictures this year. The film portrays the interviews between David Frost, a popular talk show host, and Richard Nixon, the only president ever to resign as the commander in chief. Both Michael Sheen and Frank Langella are positively brilliant in bringing the story to life and their chemistry is that of subtle brilliance. Ron Howard has truly done some prolific work in making sure that every bit of tension, excitement, and awe are evident throughout the film. The excellent script, previously as a theatrical one, by Peter Morgan makes ""Tricky Dick"" a truly lively character. Besides the film's other fine qualities, the thing that stands out the most is the fact that at points you sympathize with the tyrannous and manipulative Nixon. So rare is the villain an example of resentment in films nowadays. As a contender for the Golden Globe, I felt this was a worthy adversary to rival my favorite movie of the year, ""The Wrestler"" and definitely better than the winner, Slumdog Millionaire. Kudos to Ron Howard and Peter Morgan for making this a political thrill ride you will not want to miss.<br/><br/>9/10"
"yxo-1","9","4","9","14 December 2008"," Balls vs. soul
","I hope it will not spoil your experience. It might though.<br/><br/>In this Howard's excellent film Frost jumps to the opportunity to interview Nixon as a vehicle to move from semi-tabloid journalism to a life time challenge. Va Banque... The supporters/collaborators in this hoped by them to be an ambush/last ditch attempt to try Nixon had a chance to bring the man they considered to be a disgrace to the country to some justice. Again, in this film, as it is supposed to be in the best creative products, Integration defeats the Splitting. Frost and his crew are making their best effort to defeat Nixon and to put him on trial. They succeed - only to produce so much sought by them admission by Nixon of his fallibility and insight he lacked before. His experience during the interviews (especially the last one) brings him to the realization of his faults and seem to generate regret. Bingo! ... Yet - triumphant Frost and his team succeed glamorously and financially, but Nixon seems to retrieve his conscience and awakened his soul. His initial triumph of suppressing Frost's spirit by slamming him down and castrating him focusing on his effeminate shoes turns around and leaves him on the receiving end of his own creation. Yet - as it is supposed to be - an acquired feminine essence seemingly imposed on him brings about greater humanness and spiritual maturation he achieves as a result of a defeat - as it supposed to be. <br/><br/>There is a very significant theme of Jack Brennan (played by Kevin Bacon) and homo-emotional relationship between him and Nixon. Loyalty/devotion/admiration and support curled into a pretzel of serving the idol withstands the confrontation, but at the end he is not present. Disappeared. Dissolved by the defeat of the idol? We don't know. Nixon is alone. No one of significance is around. Just effeminate Italian shoes... The circle is completed. Castration ricochets back and slashes the balls of the castrator whose action has produced the sequence.<br/><br/>Only to make the castrated one more human and real...effeminate...as it supposed to be."
"sddavis63","5","3","6","27 December 2009"," It Reminded Me Of A Heavyweight Boxing Match
","In a way this reminded me of a significant heavyweight boxing match. It's not full of excitement. In fact a good 75% of the movie is basically David Frost and Richard Nixon ""feeling each other out"" and searching for weaknesses in each other. Frost, of course (played by Michael Sheen) is the British journalist who scored a coup by being granted a series of interviews with former US President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) and it truly did remind me of boxing. Nixon was the champ (even though he had resigned) and Frost wanted to beat him. Frost had to call him out; negotiate a chance to take him on (and a price for doing so). Then came the first few interviews, dealing with Nixon's personal life, Vietnam, etc. They danced around each other and developed a certain comfort level with the battle they knew was coming: the interview dealing with Watergate, and whether Frost would get Nixon to confess to any wrongdoing. To that point, the movie truly wasn't especially exciting. It provided a bit of background into the mindsets of the two protagonists: Frost desperately wanting to be taken seriously as a journalist in the US, Nixon seeking to vindicate himself after feeling unfairly pushed out of office. Aside from the background, though, it wasn't overly interesting and the ""talking heads"" interviews were hard to take seriously. ""Talking heads"" interviews work best (and I really don't like them at the best of times) when you're at least listening to the real ""talking heads."" Listening to Oliver Platt or Kevin Bacon pretending to be people who are ""talking heads"" meant that it was hard to take what they said seriously, even if it was accurate. The whole thing did finally lead up to that last showdown, though, which was quite well done. To go back to the boxing metaphor, these guys had been testing each other for maybe 10 rounds, and it was now coming down to the end - it was time to start swinging and to see who would come out on top. That last interview was dramatic and Langella I thought handled Nixon's persona well.<br/><br/>No - it's not exciting. Nor is it especially historically enlightening. It goes over mostly well trod ground. It is interesting, though - mostly for those who are political junkies, or who have an interest in Watergate or US history. If you don't have those interests, you won't be interested in this. The very slow buildup drags this down somewhat, and in the end I'd say it was OK. It rates about a 5/10."
"Buddy-51","9","3","6","3 May 2009"," an epic battle of wills
","Never having seen Peter Morgan's ""Frost/Nixon"" on stage, I can't speak to how much it may have gained or lost on its way to the big screen. I can, however, state that, in its latest incarnation, this is one humdinger of a political drama, as poignant as it is suspenseful, as intimate as it is wide-ranging. <br/><br/>The story centers around the famous series of interviews that David Frost conducted with Richard Nixon in the spring of 1977, nearly three years after Nixon had been forced to resign in disgrace from the office of President of the United States. This is the encounter in which Nixon famously declared, ""When the President does it, that means it's not illegal"" - as clear-cut and unabashed an acknowledgement of the corrupting influence of power as one could possibly expect from a politician. <br/><br/>Morgan and director Ron Howard have taken full advantage of the new medium, giving the material room to breathe by opening it out beyond the restricted confines of the interview setting to the world at large. We go back and forth between London and Los Angeles, visiting key points of interest - The Beverly Hills Hotel, Nixon's home in California, etc. - along the way. This also means that more time can be devoted to the earlier stages of the story, including Frost's often desperate attempts to secure financing for the project, and the efforts both sides expend on brainstorming and strategizing for the final showdown.<br/><br/>And what a showdown it turns out to be, for at its heart ""Frost/Nixon"" is really an account of a fascinating, take-no-prisoners duel between two evenly matched opponents with diametrically contradictory goals. For Frost - a British entertainer who had, up to that point, made his name as a variety/talk show host in England and Australia and who was known primarily for his international-playboy antics off the set - these interviews would be his big chance to definitively establish, before a worldwide audience, his bona fides as a serious journalist, hopefully by making a disgraced ex-President wither under the glare of hardball questioning. For Richard Nixon, this seemed the golden opportunity to finally begin what would be a long and grueling process of rehabilitating his reputation and his legacy in the eyes of the public and of burnishing his place in history.<br/><br/>Thus, with so much at stake, both men are seen throughout the movie trying their best to manipulate the interviews and indeed each other to their own advantage. Keenly aware that only one of them can ultimately emerge the ""victor"" from their encounter, these two intellectual prizefighters jockey for position and power, sniffing out their opponent's weaknesses and vulnerabilities while playing intricately developed mind games on one another in the hopes of gaining the upper hand. Yet, oddly, as is usually the case in such situations, these two opponents actually discover that they have more in common with one another than they have differences that separate them.<br/><br/>For all its excellences of cinematography, editing and direction, ""Frost/Nixon"" is still, at its core and in deference to its theatrical roots, an ""actors' picture,"" with Michael Sheen and Frank Langella brilliantly reprising the roles they created on stage. Langella never falls into the trap of relying solely on mimicry to capture the essence of a well-known and easily caricatured public figure. Instead, he allows us to see the subtle machinations of a man long adept at pulling the levers of power by manipulating events and individuals to his own advantage. Yet, at the same time, he shows us the gentler, more human side of a man wracked by loneliness and an innate lack of likability, who certainly didn't set out in life to become a tragic figure but who, through a lack of a clear moral compass, ended up that way anyway. Sheen more than fulfills the promise he demonstrated playing Tony Blair in ""The Queen,"" making of Frost a good-natured but shrewd creature of the limelight who learns right quick that he needs to be wary of how a trapped beast will react when he's pushed into a corner with no way out. The beauty of the film is that, for all its emphasis on competitiveness and antagonism, it still manages to convey the mutual respect and even camaraderie that eventually came to define the relationship between the two men.<br/><br/>These two towering performers are complemented by similarly impressive work from Kevin Bacon as Nixon's loyal aide, Rebecca Hall as Frost's latest girlfriend, and Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt as anti-Nixon zealots brought in to help Frost craft the questions he's going to ask.<br/><br/>Of course, as with most docudramas, it's often hard to tell which events are strictly factual (i.e. docu) and which have been made up or distorted for the sake of the drama. There is one glaring anachronism, for instance, when the filmmakers show Frost heading off to the premiere of ""The Slipper and the Rose"" - a movie he helped finance - on the eve of the first interview in March 1977 when the movie was actually released in late 1976. And I'm sure there are plenty more, much less innocuous fabrications that those closer to the subject could easily point out. Yet, no matter how much liberty it may take with the facts, ""Frost/Nixon"" turns relatively recent history into a riveting drama that has many pertinent things to say to the world today."

(The mere thought that there's a plaque on the Moon bearing this man's name is all the reason I need to hope and pray that some other country makes it there soon and brings that piece of junk back here where it belongs.) But this isn't propaganda: it's Cinema, and the Actor's Art at its highest level. Langella and director Ron Howard rise above the man and give him what in Life he most lacked: a Heart, and a Soul. Langella's performance is unforgettably moving and Howard's direction is at its sharpest ever (well, close: I still think that Cinderella MAN is one of the greatest movies ever lensed; even better, overall, than this one- and that's saying a lot). See this one because Langella and Howard are actually able to make one of the 20th century's vilest political leaders sympathetic through consummate cinematic sleight of hand."

The way their presidency ended was also quite on bad note. Anyway on the movie front however.it was showed a good level of detailFrost was also well played but Frank (Nixon) takes it to a totally different level of acting in the final moments of the interview.

","The engaging power of Frost/Nixon comes from the wonderful performances of Michael Sheen and Frank Langella. Both actors in their own right are outstanding. The film is based on the interviews by Frost with Nixon, which would turn out to be a worldwide success and spectacle.<br/><br/>The screenplay is taut, and energetic, and through the interviews enables a reasonable documentation of the Nixon presidency. The film is somewhat hampered by its licence to embellish and create scenes to maintain allure. I am a little disappointed that it swayed somewhat from the truth.<br/><br/>The scene where Richard Nixon has been having a drink, and calls Frost in the middle of the night, is a complete fabrication (as stated by Frost himself), why did the writers feel the need for such spin? The very nature of Nixon himself and the prevailing interview would of been more than sufficient to engage the viewer rather than such a concoction.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are excellent in particular Rockwell and Bacon, and the documentary like feel gives Frost/Nixon credence, and helps convey the magnitude of the scandal of 'Watergate' which some may find difficult to envisage now.<br/><br/>Although blotted by its inaccuracies in order to seek suspense this is a well-paced film that delivers on the entertainment front. Langella and Sheen are so engaging that the film can only charm and captivate in equal measure."
"MaxBorg89","9","3","6","3 March 2009"," ""Are you saying the President can do something illegal?""
","Apparently, Frost/Nixon was a bit of a plan B for Ron Howard, who shot the movie while waiting for the WGA strike (November 2007-February 2008) to end, since it affected the production start of the Da Vinci Code sequel Angels & Demons (Frost/Nixon was unaffected, given that British writers, such as Peter Morgan, aren't WGA members). Ironically, what was an afterthought has turned out to be his best movie to date, or at least on par with Apollo 13 (and this comes from one of the many who think A Beautiful Mind shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar in 2002).<br/><br/>Based on Morgan's own play, which has been widely acclaimed both in London's West End and on Broadway, Frost/Nixon is a fictionalized account of a very real event: the interviews Richard Nixon granted British journalist David Frost. It all starts in 1974, when the Watergate scandal becomes public knowledge and Nixon (Frank Langella) is forced to resign, despite being subsequently acquitted of all charges in a trial. Frost (Michael Sheen), a talk show host, is in Australia when this happens, and once he returns to London he tells his producer John Birt (Matthew MacFadyen) he has a brilliant idea for an interview: the disgraced ex-President. He takes it very lightly at first, thinking it will be nothing more than a chance to achieve greater fame, but after meeting his key researchers, Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston (Sam Rockwell), he realizes he's been given the opportunity to stage the trial Nixon never had. However, as Zelnick promptly points out, ""there's a reason they call him Tricky Dick"", and so the former President, who's in it only for the money, works up a plan with his assistant, Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon), so that Frost will be metaphorically crushed when the interviews begin. Thus, what will later be remembered as a TV event is set in motion.<br/><br/>A film based on a play about television isn't a pitch you hear every day, and in fact the idea would be terrible with the wrong material. It just so happens, then, that Frost/Nixon works a lot better as a movie than a play: whereas the stage version will inevitably favor the remarkable acting (more on that later) over the story's specific context and setting, the film transition allows the director to explore the medium of television, using archive news footage and samples of real Nixon appearances to emphasize the role of the small screen in the picture. In that sense, Howard is the perfect choice - not only has he dealt with the subject before, albeit less successfully (that would be EdTV), his background is in television (Happy Days), therefore he knows his tools better than most of the other directors that were considered for the job (the only reasonable alternative would have been George Clooney). This is openly acknowledged within the film itself, when Rockwell's character comments on ""the reductive power of the close-up"", an instrument that can make or break any screen production, whether it's film or TV.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Howard is also deserving of credit for insisting that the two leads from the play reprise their roles in the film, or else he would have turned down the job. The gamble pays off exquisitely, as both Sheen and Langella have a long-lasting silver screen experience (they have even played other iconic figures like Tony Blair and Dracula respectively) and are allowed to build on their stage work surrounded by a typically (for Howard, that is) spot-on supporting cast. Sheen, ostensibly the hero of the tale, has the diffic ult task of portraying an ambitious entertainer without making him look like a buffoon, much like he did with his role as Blair in The Queen, and succeeds in delivering a layered, multi-dimensional performance that lets us see Frost the man, not the TV personality. Langella has the more challenging job, namely handling a part that, movie-wise, everyone still associates with Anthony Hopkins. As it turns out, his Nixon is a towering but flawed presence, a charismatic leader whose weaknesses and arrogance ultimately led him to a very public downfall. In short, it's a more interesting version than what we saw in Oliver Stone's more straightforward biopic.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Frost/Nixon is a compelling portrait of one of the most important televised events of the entire 20th century, a brilliant examination of television as a medium and an extraordinary piece of material for actors. And that's without mentioning the greatest irony of all: Ron Howard voted for Nixon back in 1972..."
"KUAlum26","9","3","6","2 February 2009"," The Interview...as a boxing ring
","I'm actually old enough to JUST vaguely recall when this interview happened and the publicity surrounding it. I was a small kid at the time,and I seem to recall that David Frost had returned to American television with some sort of comedy/variety series that was set to run as a summer replacement. I even recall seeing some clips of the interview,seeing former President Nixon break down into tears when being asked if he was sorry for mistakes made. <br/><br/>Of course,at the time I wondered 'Whoa.I wonder what's making that grown-up cry? It must've been bad.' Keep in mind,I was starting Kindergarten that fall.<br/><br/>As I grew up and learned steadily more about President Nixon,the significance of this interview became much clearer. By the time the play,then the movie(both penned by Peter Morgan)came out,I was very intrigued to check this out,both as a one-time student of Politics and of Film.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard takes pains to round out the story,giving both main characters a sort of ""How they got here"" prompting. Nixon(Frank LAngella,in a career ""rocket fuel"" performance that is DEFINITELY award-worthy),by 1977,had been so roundly disgraced and vilified that a ""Family Feud"" survey question taken circa 1975 had listed the top ten most hated and feared people. Hitler,Benedict Arnold,Stalin,Fidel Castro and Satan actually came in BEHIND Nixon,who was the number one answer. Yet,somehow,in the nearly three years since resigning the office of President,""Tricky Dick"" was almost able to put WAtergate behind him and--as strange as this may sound to some--actually had designs on resurrecting his political career. About to write his memoirs and somewhat reclusive, The 37th President actually seemed to be in position to make yet another recovery.<br/><br/>Meanwhile,accomplished playboy TV host and one-time journalist David Frost(Michael Sheen,in a word:Excellent!)seems to be in a slump. Unable to establish shows in two continents and struggling to hold on to one in a third,his lavish,'Devil may care' lifestyle is possibly behind the eight ball,given that the money for said lifestyle is bound to run out some time. At some point after Nixon's leaving the White House,Frost gets the gutsy idea to do a sit down interview with the disgraced former President. The idea is met with cool skepticism by Frost's long-time producer and erstwhile friend(MAtthew McFayden),but Frost's determination eventually draws him a deal to get the interview. From there,he teams with a TV veteran producer(Oliver PLatt)and a vested academic(Sam Rockwell) to develop the heft and setting for this ""meeting of minds"". <br/><br/>At the onset,it would seem a mismatch:Accomplished,well-studied and masterful Nixon versus the perceived lightweight television impresario Frost. But that,needless to say,is where the story picks up.<br/><br/>With some nice,if perhaps easily overlooked,supporting efforts from Kevin Bacon(as Nixon's loyal,Post-Presidency aide),Rebecca HAll(as Frost's love interest at the time who would eventually be his wife)and Toby Jones(as eccentric literary agent Irving ""Swifty"" Lazar),the assemblage of actors all hit their notes more than adequately(if perhaps somewhat ham-fisted at points). The movie's principle strength is in the verbal jousting between the two main figures:crisp and humored,yet always bristling with some element of attack or defense. Fortunately,the movie leaves the meat of the story in this very element.<br/><br/>I've read some thread posters on this sight use such dismissive language of this film as ""Who cares about Nixon?"" and ""Why does this matter?"". Some years ago(pre-G.W.Bush,mostly),I would've been more inclined to jump in proclaim something to the tune of ""THe President isn't above the law and Nixon should be an example of why"",with more enthusiasm and passion. Lately,I've come to believe that a play/movie like Frost/Nixon serves more of two things: a study in how arrogance,from anyone,can be one's downfall and that even something as seemingly mannered and civilized as an interview can actually be as savage and brutal as any brawl or type of hand-to-hand combat. Anything more is probably subjective."

","If I was a voting member of the academy, I would vote for Frank Langella as Best Actor for his performance as the disgraced president Richard Nixon. I also think Michael Sheen OBE should have been nominated as well but he would easily won in the supporting actor category playing Sir David Frost OBE. Both Frost and his producer, John Birt, were knighted by the Queen. I didn't like the Reston character very much and I have read one of his books on Rev. Jim Jones. Langella and Sheen performed the same roles on Broadway and the West End in London. They did a brilliant job and were both equally brilliant in their roles. I never thought that I would have sympathies for the former disgraced president but I did. I felt Langella brought the role of Nixon from a caricature into a full-fledged multi-dimensional human being. Of course, the President is a human being although they were elected to the highest office in the country. This film is one of the best that I have seen but I would have liked to have seen Nixon's interaction with underused Patty McCormack who plays his devoted and dedicated wife, Patricia."
"isabelle1955","Null","3","6","25 January 2009"," Unexpectedly Spellbinding and Full of Tension
","On the face of it, a movie about a TV interview doesn't sound that exciting does it? But Frost/Nixon is utterly absorbing, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It's the second movie I've seen this week based on a stage play - the other was Doubt - and while such films rarely include much in the way of action or special effects, they do give actors something to really get their teeth into and often offer some of the year's best acting performances. And that's true of both Frost/Nixon and Doubt. I go to the movies (often) for lots of different reasons, sometimes for a bit of escapist fun, sometimes because I want to see a favorite actor, and sometimes to see great performances (getting all three at once is the Holy Grail of movie watching for me!) and Frost/Nixon definitely gave me some great performances to watch.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen plays David Frost, British TV personality, talk show host and public man about town. He may be new to the younger American audience, but as I'm a Brit (transplanted to the USA in middle age) he's been on the radar since my youth, famed for satirical TV shows That Was The Week That Was, The Frost Report, and a trademark ""Hello, Good Evening and Welcome!"" line. (My brother does a rather good impersonation of him.) In 1977 Frost  who was considered a journalistic lightweight- rather audaciously gained an interview with disgraced ex president Richard Nixon (Frank Langella), who had resigned after the Watergate scandal in 1974 rather than face impeachment. Nixon's successor Gerald Ford pardoned him of any wrongdoing that he might have committed so Nixon was never brought to trial, much to the regret of many Americans. Frost and his team of researchers wanted to give Nixon the trial on TV that he never had in court, while Nixon and his team of minders thought Frost would be a pushover, and that this might be a way for Tricky Dicky to reinvent himself and get back onto the political scene.<br/><br/>And Frost almost was a pushover according to this view, (which I think Frost himself has indicated is about 90% accurate.) He struggled to raise the money for the enterprise after the US networks refused to pony up to pay Nixon for the interviews (citing an aversion to check book journalism), and he allowed Nixon to dominate the early meetings. Nixon rambles on about less pressing issues, reciting tired anecdotes about Kissinger and Mao, evading the hard questions, while Frost's researchers and producer gnash their teeth and chew their knuckles with anxiety, the dollar signs burning before their eyes. <br/><br/>Frost had staked his personal wealth as well as his reputation on this encounter, and everything was pinned on the last interview session, where, finally, Nixon got as close as he ever got to an admission of guilt and made the classic statement that a crime isn't a crime if committed by the president. When finally shown on US TV, the interviews got huge audiences, the networks ate some humble pie and David Frost's reputation was made (and his bank account saved!) Director Ron Howard masterfully brings out the tension of that last bout, after which Nixon emerged semi bewildered to disappear back into the political wilderness until his death. <br/><br/>Brit Peter Morgan wrote the stage play and the screenplay. A great screenwriter, he also wrote The Queen, The Last King of Scotland and Longford, and I suspect he's one of the best writers around just now for nailing a character study. The cast includes Sam Rockwell (whom I last saw in the rather strange Choke), Kevin Bacon, Matthew Macfadyen (Mr Darcy opposite Keira Knightley in Pride and Prejudice), Oliver Platt, Toby Jones and a very decorative Rebecca Hall (seen to more effect in Vicky Christina Barcelona) as Caroline Cushing, Frost's girlfriend at the time. <br/><br/>Frank Langella has deservedly been Oscar nominated for his work in Frost/Nixon, and Michael Sheen is excellent too (although he's forever imprinted on this cynical Brit's mind as the ingratiating young Tony Blair in The Queen.) <br/><br/>A thoroughly worthy Oscar nominee. I'd love to see the stage play."

I truly, sincerely 100% hate politics. I pay my taxes and that's it, my only valid brush with politics. So when I find out that a politically-charged drama is in the runnings for the Oscar season, my first reaction was to skip it. But then, in the immortal words of Will Smith (or is it that Lawrence guy?), the sh8t just got real. It was turning into something. The critics gave it favorable reviews and the audience even. So with that in mind, I decided to give it a try. Ron Howard needed to come back out strong after a disappointing The Da Vinci Code. Its all or nothing for him.<br/><br/>Well, after all the hullaballu, only one thing can be said after watching Frost/Nixon: a masterpiece. Simply astounding. Compelling and powerful. Langella gives the performance of a lifetime as President Nixon. There is no doubt in mind that he'll be nominated for Best Actor in every Award ceremonies out there, including the Oscars. Langella turned Nixon into a well thought out and complex character and he even adapted the President's deep blue voice. There's some steep competition this year in the Best Actor category with Sean Penn, Brad Pitt and Mickey Rourke also in the runnings. No one really knows who's coming out on top, they're all great, but one thing is for sure, its gonna be one hell of a race.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen on the other hand also did a magnificent job as David Frost, the fearless and ambitious journalist who defied all odds and pinned down a mighty giant. He was indeed a worthy adversary to Langella's Nixon and he is as intense as Langella in his own kind of way. Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt plays Frost's top researchers and they were quite exceptional as well. Sam Rockwell in yet another character role supports the film with intensity and although his performance will be overlooked because of Langella and Sheen, he's still one of my favorites and his time will come soon. A talent like that, that's pretty hard to be missed. Kevin Bacon also, great showcase of talent as the right hand man to Nixon. Like Rockwell, he delivers a fine performance that cannot be missed. With a solid and gripping screenplay from Peter Morgan and a top notch directing from Howard and everybody else in between, Frost/Nixon is a film you can't afford to miss. One of 2008's finest."

","It is hard to believe that a movie climaxing in a mere TV interview and with a title ""Frost/Nixon"" can be one of the most exciting movies of the year. But Nixon's and Frost's character are so well created by the script, the actors and the director that we become so drawn in and connected to them.<br/><br/>It begins with Frost's (a TV personality) off handed interest in Nixon. Then his ambitious plan to interview him, followed by four subsequent interviews, all in the hopes of a clear victory, which is gaining that in which no one else is able to get, an admission of guilt and wrongdoing.<br/><br/>It is easy to create Nixon as though he is a monster, someone inherently evil, as the perpetrator and sneak behind Watergate, as the epitome of political corruption as the bully and over dog expected to come out of the interviews, which he labels ""a duel"", unscathed, but the director gave him a real personal touch. Not only is he flawed, has a heavy chip on his shoulder, intensely competitive, wildly ambitious, greedy and slightly mad but he also has refinement, kind manners, compassion and even his own brand of raw, rough humor. He is his own person, idiosyncratic and despite being a former supremely controversial president, whom people are in awe of, don't know how to react to, he is a very real person. It is left open as to whether you hate him or sympathize with him for his self induced misfortune. Hate him for his corrupt misdeeds and the person who he seems to be but explored as a cause is a fascinating deep seated psychological daemon that attacks his soul thereby making this arguably evil, corrupt, leader of the free world all so human.<br/><br/>Frost too, although a bit of a dichotomy to Nixon, with his over eager perhaps a bit phony smile, a bright, light air and flamboyant persona, was realistically created and an interesting personality.<br/><br/>The vastly different personalities were an interesting aspect of the interview and were captured by the creators. The lead up to the interview and the tit for tat before the interviews was the build up. The actual interviews were so well done especially after the build up that it left you on the edge of your seat, hanging by every word. Upon YouTubing the actual interview you will be wowed as to how close the makers came to recreating history.<br/><br/>Despite the intensity there were some funny lighthearted moments. <br/><br/>You can't judge a book by its cover or a movie by its name."

","Gripping account of Richard Nixon's first television interview after resigning from the Presidency. It was conducted by a man who was strictly an entertainer, Englishman David Frost, who believed it would be a great way to become famous in America. At the beginning, he has no real convictions, but the researchers he has hired (Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell) motivate him to attempt to give Nixon the conviction he never received from the American justice system. When the interviews begin, it turns out to be a David and Goliath story, with Frost unable to compete with Nixon. The strongest point of the film are the performances. Langella in particular hits a homerun, giving perhaps the best fictional performance of Richard Nixon yet in cinema. Much like in The Queen, which was also written by playwright Peter Morgan, Michael Sheen holds his own against a powerhouse performer. Also great are Kevin Bacon, playing Nixon's former Chief of Staff, now a defeated, hurt man desperately trying to redeem his boss, and Sam Rockwell, as Frost's most passionate researcher. Though based on a play, Frost/Nixon almost never betrays that origin. It's intimate, but open. I don't know how much you can credit director Ron Howard with the film's success  I imagine that its success belongs more to the actors and Morgan  but it is by quite a distance the best movie he's ever directed."
"jdkraus","10","3","7","3 January 2009"," Brilliantly executed
","I did not grow up during the Nixon era, so I only know what the history books say. I know about the Watergate ""break-in"" and that President Nixon resigned himself from his position due to a ""cover-up"" rather than face an impeachment. In a sense, history views him as a crooked politician. The movie ""Frost/Nixon"" to my surprise shows almost an unbiased view towards Nixon.<br/><br/>The film, as the previews reveal, is about the duel interview between David Frost and Richard Nixon. The movie presents both men as two individuals who seek this interview as an opportunity to broaden their career and credibility. Both have a team of people, made up of brilliant characters who support them and want the one to conquer the other.<br/><br/>The duel itself, is very interesting, particularly with the up-close shots that Ron Howard captures wonderfully, as the actors convey their emotions. As I read from reports, the film accurately portrays it for Nixon gives very long answers, trying to dodge the questions while Frost tries to pry and make him say something foolish. In the end, as everyone knows, Frost proves the victor. But it's not the kind of victory where you want to open a bottle of champagne and celebrate. <br/><br/>Nixon is flawed, no doubt about it, but he did what he thought was right with both the Vietnam War and the political activism at home. No one knows what went through Nixon's head, as he was president. The film presents him as almost a tragic hero, who tried hard to keep a nation afloat but failed miserably. <br/><br/>I personally enjoyed the performances by Sam Rockwell as James Reston Jr. and Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan because both of them portrayed characters on opposite ends of the spectrum on their view of Nixon and they are willing to go the limits into their political beliefs. Bacon is a stark Republican while Rockwell is a liberal who thinks Nixon should pay for his sins but neither get satisfaction from the interview's result. <br/><br/>As for Langella and Sheen both give excellent performances. Langella may very well have given the performance of his life as Nixon. He may not necessarily look like Richard Nixon, but he fills in the role magnificently. I think he is a front row contender for the Oscars. Sheen may also very well earn at least a nomination for actor in supporting. <br/><br/>Adding to the film's brilliance, Ron Howard, not a favorite director of mine, captures this film wonderfully whether it is the intense facial up-close shots or even the hand-held camera work during the scenes of tension. Salvatore Totino's photography and Hans Zimmer's score add depth and drama to the film. I also give congratulations to Peter Morgan for his brilliant script. <br/><br/>I am disappointed that this had to be rated R. If they took the four f-bombs out as well as the unneeded scene of a naked guy running into the ocean, it would have had a better rating so more people can see this great film."

Amazingly gripping and paced so well that 2 hours goes by leaving you wanting more.<br/><br/>The cast? Absolutely perfect. If Langella doesn't at least garner an Oscar nomination, it will be a travesty. I recall reading that when Hopkins did his Nixon in the self-titled movie, he chose not to do the voice impression that is so well known. As such, he still conveyed the character very well. Langella by contrast, does in fact inflect Nixon's deep, dark tones which he pulls off perfectly. Within seconds, he transforms into the former President and you see and hear no one else for the film's entirety.<br/><br/>There is no one in this film that should go unmentioned. Everyone was astounding and they deserve any and all accolades that come their way. Please see this movie.

","Frost Nixon Frank Langella Michael Sheen I must confess that ordinarily this is not a film I would have watched. However, seeing Michael Sheen interviewed on Top Gear where Clarkson said what a great performance it was I thought I'd watch it for myself.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard takes us to a time when the US were involved in a war they couldn't win, occupying a country they shouldn't be in and their President was caught lying. Sound familiar? It's an engrossing narrative and Howard does an excellent job of taking you back to the 60's by using subtle things such as a close up of Frost's Italian shoes, cleverly reminding us that few people traveled by plane and excellent overall set and costume design.<br/><br/>The film begins when David Frost is in Australia and not yet having found the infamy of 'through the keyhole' he decides that he's going to spend his own money, and borrow other peoples to pay Nixon heavily and get the one and only interview with the disgraced ex president.<br/><br/>There's a real risk with a film like this for it to become a narcissistic ramble but it's not slow nor does it drag on, instead it's a well told story, enough factual information to give the feeling you're watching History channel without the dumbing down, but equally enough drama to keep you engrossed in the film. Despite already knowing the outcome, ( if you don't know what happened, look away now) your rooting for Frost to succeed, and in all it's a thoroughly enjoyable and watch able film. Michael Sheen plays Frost, and Frank Langella plays Nixon as the two come together for what would later become an epic interview. There are some other important roles and given the flood of information in this film there is no time for character development so all of whom have to be strong out of the blocks, and fortunately they all are.<br/><br/>Here's my problem with the film. Michael Sheen is brilliant as Frost, capturing just enough of his character ( as he did with Tony Blair in 'The Queen' ) to make it believable without being distracting, where as Frank Langella's performance as Nixon is more like something from Saturday Night Live or some other comedy show. You feel that Sheen is playing a character, bringing subtle aspects of the real Frost to the screen and you don't feel your watching him 'trying' to be Frost, where as Langella is trying to impersonate Nixon and it doesn't work. Additionally, films about Nixon have been done a thousand times, this film is about how Frost against all odds got the old codger to agree to an interview and then against all expectations got an on screen admission of guilt. It is, as much if not more about Frost's efforts as it is about Nixon's guilt. Why then, if the film is called Frost Nixon, and Sheen is masterful while Langella struggles, is Frank Langella given top billing? It's a rhetorical question, we know exactly why.<br/><br/>So, to confirm Clarkson was right, gripping, interesting, enthralling.<br/><br/>8/10"
"teemupietilainen","10","2","4","30 April 2009"," Historically remarkable
","First thought in my mind was that this movie was going to be a boring political look at the Nixon case. However the first 30 minutes made me change my mind and the movie just got better and better towards the end. I never thought I could feel sympathy against Nixon after what he did but this movie definitely changed my mind.<br/><br/>The ""counter-pitying"" between Frost and Nixon gives interesting aspects to the interview and because of that the interviews are the most interesting parts of the movie. The movie made Nixon really look like a lonely man in which I can't agree more. However the celebration of the media crew in the end made me feel really sorry for Nixon. He really looked miserable. Frank Langella did a extraordinary work as Nixon and the whole movie should've received more publicity as both historically precise and entertaining movie.<br/><br/>This is a movie every American should see during their lifetime and it's a great film for everyone to watch. No doubt the best movies of this millennium."

","FROST/NIXON is one of the most successful screen adaptations of a play yet made. Perhaps that is due in part to the fact that the popular stage play by Peter Morgan was revised for the screen by the playwright, but it is also to the credit of director Ron Howard who managed to suffuse the 'play as movie' with such atmosphere and feeling of spontaneity that the rather long movie seems to whisk by more rapidly than history! <br/><br/>Everyone knows of the infamous David Frost interview with Richard Nixon after Nixon had resigned office and was living in semi-seclusion in San Clemente, California, a bitter man struggling with the demons not only form the recent past but also form his childhood. Frost took on the challenge to bring the perpetrator of the Watergate scandal to his knees to satisfy the American public's need for retribution, and in conducting these interviews he did indeed achieve that. The story is as much a character study of Frost as it is of Nixon and the parallels writer Morgan uncovers makes the film far more than a quasi-documentary. This is real drama played for all it's worth. <br/><br/>Frank Langella is unforgettable in his portrayal of Nixon as is Michael Sheen as Frost, each actor having played the roles on Broadway and transferring that depth of understanding to the screen. The surprise in this film is the use of the peripheral cast of characters - Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell, Matthew Macfadyen, and Toby Jones - a group of actors who light the darker corners of the story with aplomb. <br/><br/>FROST/NIXON should be required viewing for every Political Science major in our schools - and hopefully will urge the nation to find a similar manner to bring closure to the strangely coincidental machinations of the recent Bush administration crimes.

"jackharding89-1","10","2","4","27 February 2009"," Where were the Oscars/BAFTAS?
","Skilfully adapted by Peter Morgan from his own hit stage play, Frost/Nixon is an expertly balanced film that sees the playwright's screen tailored script combine memorably with two unfamiliar yet exceptional actors to give us one of the best and most gripping Hollywood dramas in years.<br/><br/>Child actor-cum-director Ron Howard has an Oscar winning flair for historical U.S bio-dramas and Frost/Nixon could well be his masterpiece. Predictable? Perhaps, but without a doubt his most charismatic and intelligent picture to date that uses a truly historical event to comment on current affairs.<br/><br/>If you want a modern-day sense of both the scale and importance of this 1970's political drama, then imagine Richard Hammond set loose on George Bush over a string of televised interviews and wringing out a confession over those wretched weapons of mass destruction. This, in essence, is what happened back in 1977 when chirpy British TV presenter David (Breakfast with) Frost (Michael Sheen) sealed a series of damning face-to-face interviews with fiery ex Prez Richard Nixon (Frank Langella). For three years after being forced from his presidential post over his involvement in the notorious Watergate scandals, Nixon remained silent. Officially pardoned yet publicly despised: unquestioned yet yearning for his chance to set the record ""straight"" and win back the hearts of the American people. So when fluffy TV funny man Frost comes along with a wad of cash and a team of 'crack investigators', baying for the ex-premier's blood, time and apology, Nixon sees his chance for a public-relations comeback. What follows is a compelling battle of wits and words between a budding TV talent trying to further his career and a shamed politician trying to justify his.<br/><br/>Peppered with actual footage and recordings and staged documentary-like interviews with the side characters, Frost/Nixon offers a dramatised yet authentic looking insight into the events surrounding the now legendary interviews, showing us the mentality, morals and interlocking back stories of both Frost and Nixon in the months and weeks leading up to their final showdown. The result is a dynamic duel to the death. A heavy yet light and ultimately moving affair chock full of high-quality movie moments that chill us to the bone; make us gasp, laugh and sometimes gape. A certain close-up of a rattled and wounded Nixon, eyes welled, head tilted- frozen, is up there with some of the finest and most potent pieces of cinema I've seen all year. It's a telling climax: time seems to stand still, there is complete silence, no words or score are needed- just damn good acting.<br/><br/>Reprising their roles from Morgan's prized play, then, are the quite brilliant Michael Sheen and Frank Langella. The latter, undoubtedly the film's crowning glory. The 71 year old plays the part of Nixon to shocking perfection. Each individual mannerism, tone and tick that set the slouched and slack cheeked politician apart come to quite excellent pass in a performance of great presence and great effort. As the forlorn yet droll Nixon, Langella gives one of the great leading performances of modern movie history but to say he outshines young Michael Sheen would be wrong. The unsung Brit sparkles as the beaming, coming-of-age underdog Frost in a buoyant, breakthrough turn that has to be regarded as a step up from his lifelike portrayal of a certain Tony Blair in Stephen Frear's The Queen. Both Sheen and Langella do more than hold their own against a subtle yet star studied supporting cast comprised by the likes of Kevin Bacon, Rebecca Hall, Oliver Platt and the priceless Sam Rockwell. Frost/Nixon is a very well acted film, a very well made film and, dare I say, a modern Hollywood classic in the making. See it.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Ron Howard has crafted an inspired, thoroughly engaging political drama of rare value and class, time, place and intelligence. It would've been interesting to see what director Oliver Stone had in mind for a project seemingly destined for him but Howard's charm and knack for getting the best out of his cast comes up trumps in a way few could've foreseen. Langella and Sheen are dynamite. Where were the Oscars/BAFTAS?"
"daveygandthekeyboard","8","2","4","1 February 2009"," David Frost takes on a heavyweight.
","Frost/Nixon.<br/><br/>This movie is about the series of interviews by David Frost of disgraced President Richard Nixon, which are presented as ""the trial Nixon never had."" After Watergate, people were very angry at Gerald Ford for pardoning Nixon, in effect making sure that he would never pay for his crimes in the cover-up. The main conflict at the heart of this story: is David Frost (seen here as basically a puff-piece lightweight with no particular interest in politics) the right man to serve as de facto prosecutor of Nixon? The struggle he goes through just to get the interview is a conflict springing from his reputation as a lightweight interviewer, a TV ""performer, "" while Nixon is seen as an intellectual heavyweight not easily brought down. Can he get the interview, and more importantly, Will Frost be up to the task of giving Nixon that trial? The interview sequences are shown and compared to a boxing match, and the metaphor works well. Frost is initially outclassed by Nixon, the masterful stone-waller, who is able to monopolize the time and set the pace of his answers, while Frost is desperately out of his league. After a poor start, how will Frost come back? Can he prevail? This film is very performance-driven. Frank Langella as Nixon is buried in the part, as is Michael Sheen as Frost. The obvious comparison is ""All the President's Men."" Both are well-done films, and Frost/Nixon seems especially relevant in the wake of the Bush administration."
"Otoboke","Null","2","4","27 January 2009"," Resonates long after the credits have rolled.
","First of all, let's just clear the elephant out of the room; I, being far too young to have even glimpsed at a TV set to catch the original airings of the Frost/Nixon interviews, have no real knowledge on either the Watergate scandal or the presidency of Richard Nixon. Or at least, I didn't before viewing this feature. Indeed, politics or political history isn't anywhere near my forte of special interests; I make no pretence to enjoy either and so met this very movie with a little bit of reservation.<br/><br/>Yet, such as so many recent examples (Charlie Wilson's War, W., Che) have in the end won me over despite their political background, Frost/Nixon too manages to overcome its somewhat esoteric history-lesson documentation to move onto a much more compelling drama and character study. The result is a feature which makes an impact on both the intellect and heart- crafting characters that are discernible as human beings and yet not to the point where all factual backing is lost. Historians as far as I can gather, may be ill at ease at the extent to which such facts are toyed with here, yet upon this shift of focus to dramatization, Frost/Nixon transcends beyond mere document and offers a much more personal and human side to perhaps one of the biggest political scandals in the history of the United States.<br/><br/>Most importantly however especially for those sharing my ignorant disposition- no real knowledge is required or even expected from audiences in order to enjoy what is on offer here. Sure enough, a little debrief before hand can't hurt, yet the movie is layered in such a manner that both those deeply interested in the scandal and those less knowledgeable can take something from the experience. For what it's worth, Peter Morgan's screenplay (which is based on his play) gives enough of a history lesson, and hands out the necessary facts to make Frost/Nixon as little in the way of perplexing or polarising as he can whilst maintaining historical integrity to his story.<br/><br/>The key factor to entirety of the screenplay's ability to move beyond mere banal retelling of facts however exists in its nuances of character and drama that as the script plainly points out towards its conclusion- moves beyond the usual snapshot glimpse that TV and film usually offer. Instead, Frost/Nixon offers viewers a glimpse into both men, who sat opposite one another, with an ostensibly opposing set of convictions as to why they were engaging in conversations soon to be seen all over the world. Yet, more interesting is that at the same time, both found themselves sharing a strange dualism that in the end accommodated and afforded one of history's most important political revelations in the form of a confession. That confession, as obvious and warranted as it was to most of the county's inhabitants, wasn't easy going however, and it was a long ride to get there.<br/><br/>Opening with a series of faux-interview's with the movie's actors who are in character as their personas, Morgan's script outlines the reasons as to why Frost, and not anybody else eventually got the job done. The reasoning? Simple; Frost knew TV. He didn't know very much politics and he had never sat opposite such a figure as Nixon in his entire career, yet despite a blundering start, at least managed to engage the former president in a dual of wits which in the end provided American with its long awaited moment of catharsis. These scenes, which are wonderfully constructed by Morgan and loosely based upon actual source material, provide what are essentially the movie's centrepieces alongside a stark, attention grabbing conversation between the two men over a phone line.<br/><br/>Both actors, Frank Langella and Michael Sheen who play Nixon and Frost respectively, embody their personas with conviction shaded with emotive human qualities often lost within the average political-aligned feature. Indeed, this shift from mere caricature bio-play to much more rounded, human performances ties in with the feature's main focus upon story rather than fact; crafting a character study that draws upon the heart more so than the intellect, and as a dramatized account rather than documentary, certainly plays out all the better for it.<br/><br/>The most important element to which many of the best bio-fics adhere to is that of almost complete, objective neutrality. Of course, when presenting such a feature revolving around a figure as deeply controversial as Richard Nixon, such a balance, or healthy equilibrium is not easy to strike without disgruntling audiences. Yet, much like the interviews themselves, Frost/Nixon does well to present the facts, retrieve the required information from such questioning, whilst all the while staying true to the heart of why such a discussion is taking place in the first place.<br/><br/>In the end, Frost/Nixon strikes its firmest parallel to the source material, not from the straight cut facts (such a degree of loyalty would certainly take a lot more hours to deliver) but through its essence, or, reasoning. Through this shift in focus, the movie paints an intellectually rewarding experience coupled with a surprisingly human portrayal of a man endlessly demonised for his faults. This fate, which has been used for many a tragedy inevitably gives Frost/Nixon its biggest punch, and it resonates long after the credits have rolled; it's the moment that gave America what it wanted and it's the same moment here that gives Frost/Nixon is picture perfect climax.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

With Frost/Nixon, Howard has joined the ranks of the great directors. He has made a film that is truly superb. While I still tend to prefer The Reader over this film, it is definitely worthy of many awards.<br/><br/>As to the acting Oscar, it will be extremely hard to find someone more worthy that Frank Langella. He WAS Richard Nixon in this film, and his performance is what will make it memorable. I want to see it again just to see him.<br/><br/>Oliver Platt is always enjoyable, and was so here. Kevin Bacon was magnificent, too. He was certainly more deserving of a nomination than anyone from Tropic Thunder.<br/><br/>Despite the fine acting performance, I found myself walking out thinking about Rebecca Hall.

","We want so badly to understand Richard Nixon, especially those of us who lived in his time. Did David Frost give us our best chance? Probably. In this Ron Howard film, Michael Sheen and Frank Langella give us possibly the only chance we ever had to understand the man. From Broadway to screen to living room to book, it seems we are guaranteed to never understand Richard Nixon. Even David Frost becomes entrapped in Nixon's elastic web, escaping at the last minute snapping back to himself again. And yet--and yet--as the screen fades to black we see Nixon against the ocean pondering....what? I wonder did he ever ponder for us? It is a wonderful film, Langella is superb, Sheen as well. Nixon's grandfather fought at Gettysburg, his beloved mother was a Quaker and yet his entire domestic policy gave lie to what had been sacrificed for his sake. Was he bad, was he so thoughtless, I think not--and that is the engima. See the film as you may never see something quite like it again."

","Ron Howard who always does such good work in film for the fact that he's such a film student and loves history. Really does fine here it's no wonder his latest work ""Frost/Nixon"" is such an acclaimed and worthy film for the fact that it's historically significant. Adapted from Peter Morgan's screenplay it does such a good of retelling of the 1977 actual interviews between British Comic and newsman the liberal and sharp David Frost(Michael Sheen) and ex president Richard Nixon(Frank Langella). As for once as many may not have seen the interviews the film does it's best to search for answers and the truth about the Watergate scandal. It's a great connection to show how politics and journalism changed forever. Thanks to Ron Howard for bringing the Watergate topic back to many Americans it shows that they could be educated about it.<br/><br/>As you see during the film the interviews Frost even though a comic is as sharp as ever as he pressured ""Trickey Dick"" into the tough questions about Watergate and Richard is as cunning as ever. I'm glad one human being had the guts to search for answers that man unexpectedly was David Frost. The film is good to watch for historical reasons even though it may not have brought closure at least it explores for the answers in a witty and fresh challenging way as all Americans deserved a right for the truth and Ron really puts good effort into showing how the behind the scenes candid truth searching would put us more at ease. See it ""Frost/Nixon"" is a great historical film that had the guts to question the Watergate scandal and at least it tried to hold the powerful accountable(Richard Nixon) in some form by facing tough questions. And Langella's performance of Nixon is wonderful as no one could have done it better from the accent, the motions, and actions and the walk he captured Richard so well. Watch it for the performance of Frank Langella if nothing else."
"darkteam_manu","9","2","4","29 December 2008"," Quite the history lesson
","""Im saying that when the president does it, that means its NOT illegal!"" That sentence lingered in the minds of the audience and David Frost himself I'm sure. Director Ron Howard creates an epic by elaborating on a controversial historic moment -the Frost/Nixon interviews that were taken a little while after President Nixon was impeached. Frank Langella and Martin Sheen were excellently cast as Richard Nixon and David Frost respectively.<br/><br/>The movie starts off as we hear excerpts from Nixon's actual Watergate tapes as the credits are rolling; We then see Langellas's Nixon announcing on live television that he will resign the presidency. The story goes from there, as British talk show host David Frost is looking for a big break in his career- something that will make him big bucks, and President Nixon is enjoying ""unemployment"" in his home with his financial adviser Swifty Lazar. Frost then has this crazy idea to interview Richard Nixon. After a long while of arguing and mini-conflicts arising, Frost finally gets the interview, and both parties do extensive research on each other, in order to outsmart the other on television- which takes up the bulk of the movie. Thats all I can really say without spoiling anything.<br/><br/>An excellently crafted piece, which gives us a ton of information we might not have known on Nixon, whether you are the political fanatic or not. Ron Howard was always good at making his movies entertaining, and he merged fact with fiction to help keep the audience on the edge of their seats throughout most of the movie. With witty humor, and a truly emotional ending, Frost/Nixon has it all. All that mixed with a free history lesson is a pretty good deal for $10."
"E-Z-Rider","9","2","4","26 December 2008"," Frank Langella IS Nixon
","Frank Langella delivers a stunning performance. For those of us who remember Richard Nixon as President, he comes to life on the screen. The face, the stoop, the mannerisms--they're all there. This is not an actor playing a role; it is as if Nixon himself is on screen. And it's not a wholly unsympathetic portrayal. Nixon does not come off as a monster or as deranged, more as someone to be pitied than despised.<br/><br/>The other performances, including Michael Sheen's, are very solid, but Langella has done something truly extraordinary by removing the impression of an actor playing a part. I'll be very surprised if he doesn't earn an Oscar nomination, or even and Oscar as best actor for this performance. Langella has certainly come a long ways from his excellent performance in the underrated 1970 Mel Brooks film, The Twelve Chairs.<br/><br/>Forst/Nixon as a whole is riveting. Given that it's a fairly simple story with a known ending, this is quite an achievement. You don't have to be a Watergate junkie to enjoy this film; even a passing familiarity with those momentous events in our history is sufficient. Not a moment of the 122-minute running time is wasted--or dull."
"LoneWolfAndCub","9","2","4","26 December 2008"," I never realised a film with just dialogue could be so tense and riveting
","I have heard wonders of Peter Morgan's play, Frost/Nixon, and I am glad Ron Howard and Peter Morgan have teamed up to make a movie out of it for those of us who could never see the production. Frost/Nixon works incredibly well as a film as a result of many talents behind it. First off, Frank Langella and Martin Sheen are particularly amazing in their roles as Richard Nixon and David Frost, respectively. It is as if (especially in Langella's case) they really are their characters, and that you are seeing the interviews for real. This aspect is helped further by Morgan's outstanding screenplay, both entertaining and a great character study. It is great to see a Hollywood production not demonize any of the characters, all are human and all are sympathetic, which to me is a marvelous achievement.<br/><br/>I have never been a huge follower of Ron Howard, it's not a personal thing, I just don't flock to his films. Of the few I have seen I have enjoyed all of them (yes, even The Da Vinci Code). But this here is his landmark achievement, directing a film that is funny, thrilling, interesting, observant and well-paced. Not only does the film show us the interviews, but the lead up to them from Frost and Nixon's sides. Throughout the first half the film is relatively light and at times rather amusing, and it is not until the last half we get some real human drama. This is where the film shines in all departments, including Hans Zimmer's soft but suitable score. The supporting cast also need to be mentioned, as they are all outstanding. Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Oliver Platt and Matthew Macfadyen all give career high performances, although their screen time is rather limited.<br/><br/>All in all, if you want to see something with depth, substance and two Oscar-worthy performances, Howard's Frost/Nixon is definitely the way to go.<br/><br/>4½/5"

From the start of the movie everyone knows what to expect for the ending and the suspense of getting there and the emotions put into Nixon's character make the conclusion much better then anyone could go in expecting even if they know the outcome of the interviews already.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't really see anyone whose not actually interested in the Watergate scandal or the Frost/Nixon interviews finding this movie as phenomenal as I do.

","FROST/NIXON brought back the time of Nixon's demise with a strong story and remembrance of the Watergate cover-up and the downfall of Richard M. Nixon with a tremendous cast and strong writing.

Nixon will be remembered for Vietnam, and Bush the disaster of Iraq. When I watched Frank Langella's brilliant performance as President Nixon, I could only think also about Bush, and how destructive both these Republican Presidents have been to the reputation of the American Presidency.<br/><br/>FROST/NIXON is a very important film with a story that is so relevant to today in our country.

I look forward to the film winning many awards in January/Februray 2009."
"Monotreme02","8","2","4","12 December 2008"," Excellent, entertaining, engrossing - the story speaks for itself
","The subject matter of the film pretty much carries itself. The filmmakers have selected an historic event so effortlessly fascinating that a subtle, restrained docudrama approach works very effectively. I haven't seen the original stage play on which the film is based, but I can only assume that it focuses more on the stage-friendly interviews sequence and less on the depiction of the whirlwind events leading up to the interviews, which occur over extended periods of time and in many locations which the film jumps from very rapidly. In order to bring order to the chaos, screenwriter Peter Morgan, also the playwright of the original stage version, employs a very effective technique of splicing within the film interviews with the characters in the film, taking place some time after the Frost/Nixon interviews but, unlike those ones, are not based on real interviews which occurred in real life but rather are the fruit of Morgan's imagination. It's certainly far more original and interesting a way to portray characters' inner thoughts, to deliver important information quickly and to arrange all the events in the audience members' heads than to use voice-over narration, for example. The film's structure altogether allows for an almost constant drama; the second half focuses on the actual interviews, which are of course naturally dramatic, but the first half depicts the equally interesting behind-the-scenes events, providing us with fantastic character development of both David Frost and Richard Nixon and also with the inherent dramas of Frost's being ridiculed, claims he wouldn't be up to the challenge, his difficulty in securing funds and his descent into an obsession with the interviews while still managing to keep his cool and never lose his focus or stability.<br/><br/>Howard and Brian Grazer's production value is second to none; all the elements in this film come together wonderfully, including excellent cinematography from Howard regular (since Cinderella Man) Salvatore Totino and an extremely effective musical score by Hans Zimmer. But it's undeniable, perhaps because of its roots on the stage, that the centerpiece of the film is the acting. Aided by a stellar supporting cast including familiar faces such as Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Toby Jones and Rebecca Hall, the two pillars of acting, the tent poles of the film, are Michael Sheen and Frank Langella, each of whom delivers an outstanding, truly striking performance, with one ever-so-slightly overshadowing the other. Frank Langella absolutely dominates the role as Richard Nixon. I haven't seen many other films depicting the former president, the most famous of which is probably Oliver Stone's Nixon which features Anthony Hopkins in an interesting, heart-felt and yet slightly off performance, and yet I say with confidence that Langella's performance is the greatest and most convincing cinematic depiction of ""Tricky Dick"" yet. Langella nails two very important aspects of depicting a real-life, public individual: the first is perfecting his mannerisms, physical look and voice, which he does outstandingly well. But what differentiates between an imitation and a performance is when you take those mannerisms and that accent and apply them to any dramatic setting. Langella does this so expertly that it's simply a treat just to watch him getting angry and emotional as Nixon. And yet, Langella, Morgan and Howard take special care not to portray Nixon as a total monster; they manage, very carefully, to craft a very full-bodied, rounded character with immense depth and personal drama; the storm brewing behind Langella's eyes, the inner turmoil of Nixon, is utterly spellbinding.<br/><br/>Delivering an equally solid performance but perhaps overshadowed by Langella's towering turn is Michael Sheen as David Frost. Like Langella, Sheen is in the position of portraying a real-life public figure, speaking with an accent, perfecting mannerisms and applying the imitation to drama, but perhaps because Nixon is such a more instantly recognizable and even legendary figure to audiences than David Frost is, Langella seems to be taking all the critics' attention away from the equally deserving Sheen. This is the second time in as many years that Sheen has delivered an excellent performance portraying a real-life figure in a film only to be overshadowed by the other lead role: In 2006's The Queen, incidentally also written by Peter Morgan, Sheen played an expertly rounded, deep, fascinating version of Tony Blair only to be completely overshadowed by Helen Mirren's towering performance as Queen Elizabeth II come awards season. Even though it may not win any Oscars or even be nominated for one, I only hope that Sheen will take solace in knowing that his work is appreciated by many, and his performance in Frost/Nixon in particular is a great achievement.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is an excellent, entertaining, engrossing film that works on so many levels and features so many facets that all come together in an excellent example of film-making. Howard, Morgan and crew managed to take a subject that many would consider heavy-handed or irrelevant, and still make it irresistibly entertaining and fascinating to watch. The dramas of the behind-the-scenes build-up to the interviews is as dramatic and captivating as the interviews themselves, and Howard manages to avoid his previous pitfall off an overly melodramatic finale by ending the film on a subtler, more realistic but still powerful conclusion. Morgan and actors Langella and Sheen manage to take two very public figures and craft multi-faceted, deep, three-dimensional characters with very well developed personalities and qualities, with Sheen and especially Langella delivering absolutely riveting performances. And throughout it all is director Ron Howard, conducting the orchestra, stepping back and letting every element of the film  the talented technical crew, absorbing story and interesting characters  speak for itself."

","""Frost/Nixon"" was originally a 2006 British theatre play, directed by Michael Grandage and written by Peter Morgan, that moved to Broadway in 2007 for 137 performances. The two main protagonists, David Frost and Richard Nixon were played by Michael Sheen and Frank Langella respectively and their performances were so good that the film director, Ron Howard (""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Apollo 13"") demanded the same actors otherwise he would quit the project altogether. His extraordinary insistence was vindicated as Langella is perfect in the role of the sulky President Richard Nixon who never managed to make anything else than enemies throughout his political career that ended ingloriously due to the infamous Watergate scandal. Nixon was forced to resign after the scandal broke out and Americans were enraged with Nixon's reluctance to assume responsibility for major wrongdoings such as obstruction of justice and shady deals with other politicians leading to the exoneration of blatant crimes.<br/><br/>The movie begins right after the Watergate scandal and Nixon's resignation from the Presidency, the audience watching a quick montage of news bulletins that rapidly recapitulates the pivotal events that followed. After that, we are introduced to the other protagonist of the movie, David Frost, an Australian talk-show host widely known to the audience for his comical side rather than his political thought and investigation. We see Frost as he hatches the plan to interview Nixon for the first time and the first half of the movie revolves around the obstacles that Frost and his production team had to tackle in order to succeed in their goal. The most urgent problem, of course, was the money that Nixon asked for the interview, a total sum that exceeded half a million USD. Frost searched frantically for sponsors, only to be let down by the mainstream American media that didn't trust him for holding an intriguing conversation with such a controversial political figure. Frost's past as an entertainer television persona made things difficult for him in this project but finally, he managed to cut a deal with Nixon's team. The ""Nixon Interviews"" were recorded and broadcast on television and radio in four programs in 1977 and the twelve -in total- interviews began on March 23, 1977, with three interviews per week over four weeks.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is concentrating on the actual conversations between Frost and Nixon and the bizarre relationship dynamics between the two protagonists. Frost is desperate to prove to himself and the others that he is a serious journalist who can follow through this challenging task and can look the ex-President in the eye even when directly accusing him of breaking the law. Nixon, on the other hand, wishes to preserve his legacy alive and armor himself against the -many- accusations thrown to him by the American media. I wasn't aware of this debate so the film had a rather interesting historical dimension for me and ""Frost/Nixon"" is a movie that will appeal to those who want to know more about the American political history of the twentieth century. It should be noted that Nixon was the first American President to resign from his position, an unprecedented phenomenon for the U.S. Another reason to watch this film is the quality of the performances by both the protagonists and the actors in the supporting roles, including, inter alia, Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwel and Oliver Platt."

","Somehow Ron Howard makes ever project work. It's as if his direction skills would literally be a part of his DNA. I'd venture to say everything h touches turns to gold and this film is no exception. His choice of Frank Langella to play Nixon might not have been an obvious one but bad boy Frank pulls it off and leaves one convinced Nixon I s really in the room. In fact the whole cast from on down through Kevin Bacon to Sam Rockwell to Oliver Platt had me really wondering if it would flow. And by golly it did. His choice of Michaeli Sheen to play Frost was also spot on. He delivered a meticulously on target replica of the dapper David Frost which was almost uncanny. Great show. In fact jolly good!"

","Great performances from Langella as Nixon, and Sheen as David Frost. For fans of 1970's movies or political lore/ history, after viewing this you might enjoy All The President's Men with Hoffman and Redford. Really a pleasure to watch the performances of Sheen and Langella; it's amazing how convincing Langella is as Nixon because he doesn't really favor him physically (Langella is very handsome), but the voice and delivery are done so well one suspends any disbelief. Of course Michael Sheen looks like everyone he's ever portrayed, most notably Tony Blair.<br/><br/>This film, say unlike ""The Final Days"" overall, shows context and footage of the damage done to civilians and their lives and land in Vietnam and Cambodia."

","Some movies are worth seeing in their totality because they are overall just excellent films encompassing great storylines, breathtaking cinematography, deft direction and fine acting. Some may find the pacing of this film too slow, the cinematography uninspiring and the direction unexceptional ( I am not of any of these opinions by the way ) but the one aspect of this film that is indisputable, is the incredible acting performance by Frank Langella as Richard M Nixon. When an actor is able to make you feel sympathy for a politician of Nixon's obvously dubious moral character, you indeed have something very special. Nominated and robbed in my opinion for a best actor Oscar, Langella is absolutely riveting in displaying a full canvas of human emotions ranging from egotistical, arrogant and insensitive to loving, caring and pathetic. Even if you don't like the film overall, Langella's performance is worth the price of admission alone."
"classicsoncall","8","0","0","10 February 2019"," ""I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish."" - Richard Nixon to David Frost
","I was never compelled to see this movie when it first came out. If you lived through the Watergate era, the newspaper and TV coverage was ubiquitous and you couldn't get away from it. So not only did a rehash of the events seem unnecessary for me some three decades later, but I was never even tempted to tune in to the original interviews themselves. But now I am. The film was an interesting chronicle of events and decisions made to bring the disgraced former President into a formal setting and get his perspective on the Watergate break-in and subsequent cover up of those actions. The most surprising aspect of the picture was the way in which it humanized Richard Nixon by virtue of those first two interviews. Nixon's rambling personal recollections in the preliminary program, and the confidence he expressed for his Cambodian strategy in the second interview went a long way to balance out one's preconceived notions that he might have been the devil incarnate. Had David Frost (Michael Sheen) not done his homework coming out of the second show, he might never have 'gotten the goods' on Nixon in a way to demonstrate the President's vulnerability and personal torment for his role in the cover up. As good as narrative was though, I was distracted somewhat by the actors portraying Frost and Nixon. Perhaps it's my personal recall, but Michael Sheen looked a bit too young in the role of Frost, and Frank Langella seemed to me to be a little too old as Nixon, at least from my memory of those two figures in the Seventies. But not to worry, those misgivings will gain clarity just as soon as I get a look at the actual interviews themselves."

","I watched this movie for the first time in 2019, so I'm a bit late to the party.<br/><br/>I've loved Ron Howard's ""Rush"" from 2013 ever since its release and by now I've concluded that Howard really brings out rivalries in a most captivating of ways.<br/><br/>The way this movie was represented made it incredibly entertaining and informative. As somehow who wasn't alive when the Watergate scandal occurred, this interview between Frost and Nixon wasn't something I'd heard of before. But after watching this movie, I immediately set out to listen to the whole interview.
This movie is told in a very palpable way and you feel for both characters throughout to end up satisfied with the result of the interview. It becomes evident early on that Nixon was despised by a large number of the people, but Frank Langella's incredible portrayal of Nixon actually made it easy to sympathize with him. Langella was rightfully nominated for an Oscar for this movie and in my honest opinion, even more compelling than the winner, Sean Penn.<br/><br/>The stand-out positives of this film are acting performances all around, the very interesting story-line, a phenomenal script filled with great dialogue and a truly captivating rivalry shown on screen with solid editing to enhance it!<br/><br/>I'd urge anyone to take a look at this movie, the script will most likely ensure that you become hooked into the story!"
"timdalton007","10","0","0","3 February 2019"," Howard's Best Film Since A Beautiful Mind
","Real life has proven time and again to be a fertile ground for the creative. The career of filmmaker Ron Howard is no exception with such films as Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind being among the most successful and acclaimed of his career. There's also Frost/Nixon, his 2008 film based on Peter Morgan's successful stage play. While not as financially successful as those earlier works, it is every bit a choice piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>That it is so is something owed, in large part, to the pedigree of its script. Morgan not only scripted the original stage play but its screen counterpart and it is something that shows. Comparing his original text with the film, it becomes even more clear how faithful of an adaptation Howard gives viewers. The dialogue is all there, expanded upon in places, and the director isn't afraid to ""open up the play,"" that is to broaden it for what the screen is capable of presenting versus the stage. It can sometimes be the kiss of death to do so, but Frost/Nixon stands as an example of how to do it and do it right.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is down to Howard and his production team understanding what the story they're telling is. The director described the film in special features on its home video release as ""a thinking person's Rocky,"" and that is a solid description of it. Frost/Nixon is ultimately a power struggle between its two titular characters, both men down and out in their way and trying to clamber back up their respective ladders. It's interesting that in the ""documentary"" segments of the film, where the chorus aspects of the original play are utilized and expanded upon, don't feature either of the leads. The film is an intellectual boxing match between those men, the four interview sessions becoming rounds in the sport between them, that final session where Frost can ask questions about Watergate becoming the all-important moment. Along the way, the film raises questions about the intersection of politics, celebrity, media, and our perceptions of reality, something which makes the film perhaps even more relevant a decade after its initial release.<br/><br/>The film has another Howard trademark: the ensemble cast. Leading it in the eponymous roles are the two actors who created the characters on stage: Frank Langella as Richard Nixon and Michael Sheen as David Frost. Nixon has been portrayed on screen many times and in many different ways but Langella's take on the still controversial 37th American President ranks with Anthony Hopkins as among the best screen presentations of him. Langella captures, despite being considerably taller and broader than the real man, the sense of Nixon the introvert. That here is a shy, sweaty, insecure man who has thrust himself into the public eye and is doing so once more because he knows not what else to do with himself. Further, Langella's Nixon is a man who would prefer not to be looking back into his past but who is forced to do so, perhaps subconsciously driving himself to face his demons in front of a massive television audience. It's an immensely watchable, engaging performance and it remains a shame Langella did not win the Oscar for it.<br/><br/>That is not to diminish Michael Sheen in the role of David Frost, the oft-overlooked half of the titular duo. Sheen as Frost is everything that Langella's Nixon is not: handsome, well dressed, a ladies man, and pushing himself into the public eye because it's what he does. Frost is an entertainer whose drug is adulation and ratings with him seeing the Nixon interviews as a chance to try and make it big in America. In doing so, like any gambler, he is putting a lot on the line to the point of risking outright failure. But while he may not have started on this path with the noblest of intentions, Sheen's performance makes it clear that Frost realizes he's placed himself on a mission that he must succeed at and not just for his own sake. Sheen's performance is every bit as gripping as his co-star's and one of the best of his career to date.<br/><br/>Backing the pair is the rest of an ensemble cast assembled by Howard. Keeping up the boxing analogy, they can almost be divided up into teams for the lead characters. On the Frost side, there's Matthew Macfadyen as British producer John Birt in an understated role with Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell as the researchers brought in with Rockwell Jim Reston being almost a voice of conscience for Frost. An extension of Frost's team is Rebecca Hall in the role of Caroline Cushing, the charming British socialite who gets drawn into events and manages to about charm everyone she meets. On the Nixon side, Kevin Bacon plays Nixon's chief of staff Jack Brennan in a part that sees the actor slide into solid character actor territory and the ever dependable Toby Jones as Nixon's agent Swifty Lazar. Add on Howard regulars such as his brother Clint in addition to cameos from Googy Gress, Marc McClure, and Joe Spano and the result is as steadfast a cast as you're likely to get in one of his films. One which brings the events the film depicts to life superbly.<br/><br/>Ably backing both Howard and his cast is his behind the scenes team. The challenges of a film like Frost/Nixon is to recreate the past both faithfully but also in a cinematic fashion. All involved do so nicely with particular attention to detail played to the house used in the actual interview. Elsewhere, production designer Michael Corenblith and costume designer Daniel Orlandi create a vision of the 1970s that is at once believable but also cinematically pleasing to the eye. The latter down in part to the excellent cinematography of Salvatore Totino with an almost fly on the wall approach to much of the proceedings. The sparse but effective score from Hans Zimmer is the icing on the cake, with all of these elements helping bring the film to life beautifully.<br/><br/>The result? Howard's best film since A Beautiful Mind at the start of the decade and one he still has not topped. More that, it stands as a superb example of how to take a successful stage play and bring it to life on film. It also tells a story that remains, perhaps surprisingly given its subject matter is more than four decades in the past, relevant to the here and now. That speaks to the power of both Morgan's script and Howard's skills as a filmmaker."

","15 January 2009. What's powerful about this movie is the story of how this momentous interview even came about and Nixon's purportedly insightful and extended response to Frost's question about President Nixon's involvement in a crime and the consequences of his actions on the public. Unlike the trailers, the movie is more about the immense difficulties that led up to the actual interview and the powerful and emotional look at the former President, the human face. Nevertheless, there were areas of the movie that appeared to detract from the full impact of this amazing journalist event. Earlier on, there were a number of humorous bits of funny scenes and then they suddenly disappeared from the rest of the movie, the pseudo-documentary format, particularly in the beginning was jarring and strangely appeared to lend less credibility to the movie (more like a docudrama than either a documentary or drama), the Frank Langella's gait, posture appeared at times to be sort of an aped, artificial caricature of the President than the real thing, and finally there were some confusing ambiguous timelines and editing selections that appeared to interfere the pacing and understanding of what was happening in the movie midway through the movie. Overall, this movie was a strikingly informative, revealing look at the precarious nature of this important news event and the human face behind it. Eight out of Ten Stars."

","We've had this DVD resting on the shelf for years, but somehow never got around to watching it together. While my wife was away recently, I took the opportunity to give it a good viewing with a few whiskies and snacks.
Wow, am I glad I did. Superb performances from everyone, not a wooden showing from any of the actors. Michael Sheen looks the part and, although his 'Frost voice' is variable from scene to scene, at its best it could pass for the man himself, a very accurate impression.
(spoilers follow) The ending is thrilling. Nixon, egged on by clever questioning from Frost, makes a kind of resigned confession and seems glad to get it out. From that point, Nixon realises he is no longer the political figure he was and Frost cements his reputation. The final scenes are quite affecting and I found myself a little misty-eyed. Given a decent interval, I could easily watch this again."

","Frost/Nixon is a film that really impresses upon the audience how important the events portrayed are, as well as strangely but compellingly humanising former President Nixon - showing just how much of the weight of the world is (or at least, was) on his shoulders.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is fantastic and I had a great time watching it. However, I had a few issues with it that brought down the rating somewhat.<br/><br/>As stated in the title of this review, Frost/Nixon, in some scenes, has some serious lighting issues where it feels like it's way too harsh on the characters' faces - particularly, in a hotel room scene where the light feels like it's blaring through the open windows and honestly, it looks kinda ugly. <br/><br/>Also early on in the film, the ""villainisation"" of Nixon felt a bit cartoony with some musical stings coming in once or twice to let the audience know, ""OOO, he's the bad guy!""; It just feels a bit too on-the-nose. Although, it has to be said that, like I said earlier, the film does make you sympathetic towards Nixon and his side later on (...or maybe just Nixon himself). <br/><br/>However, apart from the lighting in some scenes and the early over-the-top villainisation, Frost/Nixon is still a great film that's well acted and expertly brings to life one of the biggest landmark interview series in television history."

"DKosty123","8","0","0","16 December 2017"," Dramatic Triumph For Viewers
","Frank Langellas Tour De Force Performance of Richard Nixon carries this film very well. While the woman playing Pat Nixon look too young, Frank really brings the resigned Nixon to life in this one. In a way, this is better than the original Frost Interviews because the script can focus more on the dramatic moments that have meaning, intead of the meaningless blather of the majority of them. Sheen's Frost while not great is quite satisfactory here.<br/><br/>Nixon could afford to say anything in these interviews because of Fords ""Full & Complete Pardon"" of Nixon years earlier. The only reason Nixon was cautious was because of that worry about his legacy. The fact is Nixon would have done what he did again, because he did not realize how wrong it is to try too destroy for his own personal gain. He was not the only one to do that in this era. In the 1972 Primary Election, George McGovern got the Democratic Nomination by creating Super Delegates, changing the party rules so that he ran second in votes in the Democratic Primaries yet got nominated. Then he lost that Election to Nixon in a land slide - and had created rules Hillary Clinton used later to get the nomination over Bernie Sanders. Both times these rules cost the Democrats the chance of winning the election so just recently they finally changed the party rules on Super Delegates. I am not sure these rule changes will help, though it does cover up and protect from arrest Clinton, Wasserman Schultz, and the party from being charged with the same crime as Nixon - conspiring to destroy the 2 party system and rig the election. <br/><br/>Ironically, Nixon did not need to rig the system in 1972. McGovern lost the election (Hubert Humphrey got more votes than McGovern in the Democrats Primary in 1972). In both these times, the voters in the booth decided they were not going to do what the media wanted. Here in this film, Nixon states for the record he did not believe he had committed a crime even though he did otherwise. Clinton still does not believe she has committed any crime either, though a whole lot of people know she did, and her tainted nominated over Sanders has possibly caused more damage to the Democratic Party than McGovern did, as there appears no way a Jimmy Carter will rise up and bring the Democrats back into power in 2020 so far. The Democrats do need an outsider like a Carter, maybe a Scientist, to run against Trump. Will they wake up?<br/><br/>At any rate, the history of Nixon colliding with the celebrity of Frost is very well defined in a top notch script that brings life to these debates, and Ron Howards Direction make this film a solid triumph all the way. While a lot of young folks do not even recall Watergate, the issues here will ring a bell with any voters who read the emails on WikiLeaks that the Democrats wrote last year. Even though these memos prove a blatant attempt to rig the US Election by Democrats (who are still using a Russian Conspiracy that there is no proof of changing the election) there ha still been no charges filed against any Democrat, who have admitted the memos are true. <br/><br/>Nixon admits his guilt in this movie, and it is stunning to hear it, especially for those of us who truly remember Watergate."

","If you're going to this movie thinking you are just going to see another movie about Watergate, you will have to quickly adjust your thinking. I know, because that is what happened to me. This is a riveting and gut- wrenching movie about two men locked in a personal battle to use each other in order to change their public images. Neither is totally prepared for the contest that will be played out on the world TV stage. To be sure, this is a ""no holds barred"" showdown. But both Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) and David Frost (Michael Sheen who played Tony Blair in The Queen (2006) underestimate each other's public skills. <br/><br/>To Nixon, David Frost is seen as just a second-rate British talk show host. To David Frost, the Nixon interviews are his ticket to do something that no other TV talk show host or reporter had managed to do: to get Nixon on record admitting something about himself that he had not heretofore publicly done. <br/><br/>Frost, pushed by his fellow producers, wants Nixon to publicly take responsibility for the Watergate cover-up and for his own personal complicity in the final aspects of the Viet Nam War. As you watch this movie, you find yourself, at first, empathizing with David Frost who is in something big--but WAY over his head. Later, as you see the preparation for the interviews (on both sides), you feel empathyâ€”yes, empathy--for Richard Nixon!! <br/><br/>Both Oliver Stone, in Nixon (1995), and Ron Howard, in this movie, seem to have taped Richard Nixon as a figure of the high tragedy akin to a figure from a Greek tragedy or one of the ""big four tragedies"" of Shakespeare: Hamlet, Macbeth, Lear, and Othello. In each of these Shakespearian tragedies, the title character has an innate tragic flaw in their character that brings them down from great and powerful heights. While it may have been JEALOUSY with Othello or LUST FOR POWER with Macbeth, with Nixon it seems to always be the need for REVENGE on his enemies (real or imagined): those people that look down on him as socially or intellectually unworthy to hold power. <br/><br/>With this movie, Ron Howard has expertly introduced us to a new type of ""courtroom drama."" But, this ""courtroom"" takes the form of a series of TV interviews. The parties present their own arguments, and we are the jury. <br/><br/>Howard effectively uses extreme close up shots to tighten the space and heighten the interpersonal drama. With his skill, Howard draws us into the drama and barely gives time to blink. Both my wife and I left the movie emotionally drained but dramatically fulfilled."

I thought this film was fantastic with two excellent lead performances. Frank Langella gives the performance of his life in this film he's truly amazing at portraying a fragile and fearful man trying to regain some humanity that he lost to his presidency. Michael Sheen was also really good in this movies you could tell just how badly he wanted this interview and how desperate he was to get it done right. The actual interviews themselves were very well executed, the tactics that went into both their sides leaves you riveted and intrigued and makes Nixon eventual apology feel earned and all the more satisfying, I wasn't alive to watch the actual interviews but I can imagine they felt the same way they do in the movie. Ron Howard did such a good job at directing this movie he makes sure that your always engaged and riveted by what your seeing and turned what could have been a boring and melodramatic drama into something much better than that. The chemistry between Nixon and Frost is great the tension between them and some of their more personal scenes made the film all the better. However I do have a few flaws for one I didn't like the documentary style flash forwards with the characters it just felt weird and out of place and ultimately just unnecessary. The film also does suffer from it taking some time to find it's footing but eventually does. I really like Rebecca Hall and she was really good in this movie but I didn't really get her character I don't know if her character was a part of the real life events but even if that's the case I still didn't think she fit her relationship with Frost just comes out of nowhere and is mostly skipped over. <br/><br/>Overall Frost/Nixon is a fantastic film with a great main conflict and performances and is by far one of Ron Howard's greatest achievements. <br/><br/>85%/A-"

","Admired by lot but hated by the mass there is no denying that Richard Nixon solidly stamped his reputation as a powerful leader and though he made major errors that ruined the man and virtually killed his reputation, we can't all help but show a small fragment of humanity and unleash some sympathy while many others don't even after his death in 1994. Even after his resignation from the office, Tricky Dick can still germinate power just by stepping through a door. When coming to an interview, Nixon can manipulate his responses through his commanding voice and his subliminal charm. In ""Frost/Nixon"", director Ron Howard casts Frank Langella to play the part of Nixon we examine the fragile personification of just how insecure Richard truly is. Even though he's graced the screen long before I was born, this is truly one of Langella's best performance in in is illustrious career. Once his presence is on-screen, you just sit there at his attention and you're glued to him. Langella was nominated for an Oscar in his performance and his nomination was well justified. <br/><br/>The other supporting cast were also impressive in their respected roles. The other strong leading performance comes from Michael Sheen as the downtrodden interviewer David Frost and Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell were equally poignant as the two investigators on assignment to help Frost prepare for this very important interview that could either make him or break him. Even though Langella was carrying the heavy cargo, the supporting cast is just as important and are not being treated like glorified insignificant cameos. The real standout in terms of supporting characters was Kevin Bacon in his performance as Nixon's Chief of Staff Jack Brennan. Sure he understands that Nixon is not the most honest person ever lived but still has fondness for him. Even though he's shamed everyone including himself, Brennan still admires the man and will look up him though all damnation. Sure Bacon has always been a wonderful performer and he delivers well though I think he's undermined here. <br/><br/>The direction from Ron Howard is one of the beat he's done in his career. The interview displayed here was both very insightful and interesting. The whole idea of a British journalist interviewing a former President may not hold everyone's interests, but the character arcs and the storyline leading to the exhilarating interview carries the film along in an immaculate perspective. Sure during this interview you can't help but feel sympathy for Frost as he's placed in precarious situation against a very intimidating man like Nixon. But you get that moment of relief when Frost retorts back at Nixon as the ex-President is beside himself knowing that Frost pulled a fast one at him. <br/><br/>The only thing that was missing from ""Frost/Nixon"" was that near the end I was hoping that a defeated Nixon would gingerly walk back into his limo. The movie displayed a corrupt leader who's action will never be forgiving no matter what. But there's still that little ounce of pity we have for the man. He made a very big mistake and in the end he's still a human being who'll live this mistake long after his death. The final ending just needed something that needed an ending that needed a powerful disclosure instead of a semi-faded whisper. <br/><br/>The year 2008 had some really good films and ""Frost/Nixon"" certainly tops the list. Frank Langella really shine brilliantly and the film will keep you interested for the next two hours. It might not have the impact like I anticipated, this movie is essentially important for all moviegoers to see. Nixon was a giant in the political spectrum and Frank Langella captured the character very splendidly."

He embodied his character quite perfectly, and I think he should have at least received an Oscar nomination for such a performance. <br/><br/>The story itself is presented in an interesting way that never really gets boring. It shows the audience enough of the interviews to show the highlights of them and progress the story, but not so much that it gets old or boring. <br/><br/>The last act was definitely the best part of the movie. The climax itself actually got pretty intense, despite the fact that this is a movie about someone being interviewed. <br/><br/>The characters were well-written and interesting, as were their relationships. Michael Sheen and Rebecca Hall in particular had really good chemistry together. <br/><br/>Overall Frost/Nixon is a pretty great movie. The characters are great, as is the writing, the performances are fantastic, the story is well-presented, and the last act is pretty intense. In the end I'd definitely recommend this movie."

","About President Nixon there are several good films. It was indeed a man that marked American politics. But this film does not focus on the figure of the president but the former president, a man devoured by power. The series of interviews that the film recreates really existed and may not be wrong to consider that it was a great work of journalism at the time. The film will certainly please those who know well the issues that marked Nixon's presidency, in particular the Watergate scandal. Otherwise, its difficult for a viewer to understand what they are talking about, mainly because the film does not give further details.<br/><br/>Despite this note of caution to the public, this film remains interesting from two points of view: firstly, because it makes a good recreation of the ""making-off"" of those interviews and the people involved (Frost and Nixon, in particular). The likelihood is huge and the historical truth was quite respected. Second, because the film gives us probably the best cinematic interpretation of Nixon achieved to date, by the skillful hands of Frank Langella. This actor was in fact a total surprise. He has had a quiet career, but consistent and growing over the years. Michael Sheen, who played the journalist and presenter David Frost, did not surprise me much. He had already made good performances in other similar historical films such as ""The Queen"", which gave life to Tony Blair.<br/><br/>Finally, Langella reached stardom in a movie worthy of his participation and talent."

","Frost/Nixon was captivating the whole way through. It was a competition between two men, a political outsider and insider both looking to use the media to advance their careers.<br/><br/>The film does fawn Frost's legacy though. In real life, Nixon's admission to his crimes was a decision he had planned rather than one that Frost maneuvered out of him. Langella's portrayal of Nixon was uncannily accurate, except his Nixon was far more empathetic than the real one.<br/><br/>Some bits of fiction were questionable. The shoe scene was pure Hollywood. Nixon's drunk call never happened, but it shed light on the insecurities and motivations that the real life Nixon faced. Nixon got into politics because he was constantly bullied and stepped as a young adult. The line between education and entertainment was certainly crossed, but it's a really engrossing watch nonetheless."

A man has done something wrong and it's all up to few other people to make him accept the crime or make him guilty. Now, Nixon was the president of USA and he was the only president to have resigned in 1974 for being part of a Watergate scandal. <br/><br/>It's a beginning of a fall, and a fall of a president has to be interesting or at least there has to be substantial interest. Ron Howard creates that interest by making this film like a Network kind of film, where media and the impact of media plays a huge role in determining the character of a person. You are what you you say more than you are what you do, this seems to be an undercurrent theme in this media run movie. <br/><br/>Acted competently by Michael Sheen as David Frost, the man who interviewed the president Richard Nixon, played by Frank Langella. These two performances are enough to make it go and see it. Having said that, it's their dialogue that has lot many details that make us sit and observe and then they do not help us conclude but rather confuse us what is right and what is wrong. Maybe, the point was to show that we are grey and not black and white, fair enough and if that's the point surely it was well made. <br/><br/>Ron Howard as a director seems to be great at such Historical Dramas, be it Apollo 13 or Beautiful Mind or Cinderella Man. This one is no surprise and definitely it's a good film and indeed worth a watch for its screenplay and dialogue and acting more than anything else. <br/><br/>The production design was good, the editing could have been better for a near 2 hour film that is all about an interview where lot many details are revealed. It's not a film where we can relate to, it neither one that is entertaining and makes us sit and watch, it's one that is simply made for showing us the brain behind a deed or rather misdeed. <br/><br/>A 3/5 for definitely good film but I am sorry coz it did not work for me.

","Frost/Nixon is a great reenactment of the famous interview British talk-host David Frost had with recently-resigned former President Richard Nixon.

"semkowski-gloria69","6","0","0","13 March 2012"," Rewarding and interesting
","As far as Nixon movies go this is lightweight entertainment with plenty of comic moments largely leading up to two or three scenes of real human vulnerability. Aside from these scenes (which are truly, truly excellent), Peter Morgan conceives the meeting as something of a chess match with the unpredictability of a boxing match. To use J. Hoberman's words 'a prize fight between two comeback-hungry veterans, only one of whom could win'. On paper this could have been very heavy on amateur psychoanalysis and low on entertainment value but Morgan and I suppose Howard as well are clever enough to have some fun with the idea. This is not a criticism at all, the film has moments of surprisingly real depth and intellectualism, but overall the nature of the script works in its favor, makes those scenes more interesting, more ultimately rewarding.<br/><br/>""Frost/Nixon"" is an entertaining, exciting film, around as populist as I expected but in a very different way. This is the sort of writing we don't see enough of, particularly not in today's films. It's vaguely reminiscent of a particularly good BBC television drama. The cast is certainly good enough for that. Langella and Michael Sheen are outstanding, both manage to accurately portray the real-life men they are portraying while still adding some characterization and mannerisms of their own. Langella's Tony-award winning performance might be up for Oscar consideration soon, but Sheen's Frost almost upstages him at times. No heavy-handedness, no political 'messages', just a fun, clever script and a great cast in a well-made film."

","An interesting take on a subject we all know the outcome of but good to see the background. I wasn't aware of John Birt's role in the scheme as he later became better known as the Director General of the BBC. The film is a classic David (literally) and Goliath contest in which Nixon clearly underestimates his opponent who (if the film is to be believed) doesn't actually wake up to the fact that he is dealing with a consummate manipulator until it's nearly too late. Nixon, played superbly by Frank Langella is an interesting contrast to the portrayal of 'Tricky Dicky' by Anthony Hopkins in 'NIXON'. Langella gave a less credible impression of Nixon but I think gave us a more incisive view of his character. The most intriguing aspect was the boxing match analogy with the underdog most definitely coming out on top. However, you almost felt that by the end of the film Nixon was desperate to unburden his soul and came away from the process in a better frame of mind, as was depicted in the 'Italian Shoe scene'. Altogether a really well crafted film as we have come to expect from Ron Howard and full marks for the Casting Director as all the cast were excellent, especially the leads. Five Oscar Nominations but none in the bag is a pity, particularly for Langella but 2009 was a good year for leading men."

","In 1972, several staff members of Richard Nixon's campaign are arrested for breaking into the Democratic National Convention's headquarters at the Watergate Office Complex. In 1974, Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) resigned as president. In 1977, British journalist and TV personality David Frost (Michael Sheen) conducts a series of twelve interviews with Richard Nixon concerning his actions as president. Forced to self-finance the $2 million endeavor, Frost and staff members Bob Zelnick (Oiver Platt) and James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) seek to hold Nixon's feet to the fire and give him the trial that the American people were denied by President Ford's pardon.<br/><br/>""Frost/Nixon"" (2008) is an excellently acted character drama. Frank Langella gives what is easily one of the most convincing performances of the year, deserving of every accolade and scrap of praise that he has earned with it. He gives an exquisite portrayal of the former president, capturing his every nuance and intricacy. Michael Sheen, masked in a shroud of easy charisma, reenacts the personable man-about-town David Frost. While Sheen fails completely transform into Frost in the same way that Langella succeeded as Nixon, he delivers a nonetheless commendable performance.<br/><br/>The film takes the same excessive liberties with the facts surrounding the Frost/Nixon interviews that Richard Nixon took with the office of the presidency. In of itself this isn't anything peculiar. The problem arises, however, is Ron Howard's choice to juxtapose the progressing plot of the film with documentary-esque interviews of those involved in the Frost/Nixon interviews. This creates a heightened and unjustified sense of authenticity concerning the depicted events, especially alongside the ""documentation"" of the Frost/Nixon interviews themselves. While there is nothing wrong with taking creative license in order to heighten the dramatic qualities of a historical drama, what Ron Howard engages in through these Moore-esque techniques is borders on the unethical.<br/><br/>Despite these extreme discrepancies in historic fact, as well as the excessively long buildup to the final interview session (an hour and on half), ""Frost/Nixon"" is a well-executed, engaging and ultimately successful film. It grants a degree of closure to an unresolved American trauma. Fans of Nixon-era and post-Nixon era politics, as well as dialog-driven dramas, will enjoy this film."
"pruitt10","Null","0","0","12 September 2011"," A Review of the Film Frost/Nixon
","The Frost/Nixon film was created in 2008, and was directed by Ron Howard. The film is based on a Peter Morgan play, about the real life interviews between David Frost and Richard Nixon. The interviews took place in 1977. The major characters in the film include David Frost who was played by Micheal Sheen, President Richard Nixon who was played by Frank Langella, Nixon's post-Presidential Chief of Staff Jack Brennan who was portrayed by Kevin Bacon, and also two investigators who worked for Frost Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. The investigators were played by Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell.<br/><br/>The movie takes place five years after the Watergate Scandal, and three years after President Nixon's resignation speech. Frost realizes early in the film that an interview with Nixon, in which he admits his guilt, could mean big money. Nixon is in the middle of writing his memoirs, and he wants to leave a positive legacy behind. Frost pitches the interview idea to many broadcasting networks, to no avail. He decides to privately fund the interview, and sinks every penny he owns into the project.<br/><br/>Nixon agreed to a the interviews for a $600,000 fee. There were four interviews, which lasted two an a half hours apiece. During the first three interviews Nixon seems to be exonerating himself, as he had hoped. Frost then realizes he must step up his interviewing techniques if he wants this to pay off for him. Both men realize that the fourth and final interview will be the make or break interview for each mans career and legacy.<br/><br/>After Frost realizes this, instead of marketing the interviews like he has been, he decides to sink all his time an effort into researching for his final interview. He looks for something that will place blame on Nixon, and force Nixon to admit his wrong doings. His work pays off when he finds information linking Nixon directly to the scandal. The man linking Nixon to the scandal was Charles Colson. When Nixon was asked about this man he knew he was caught, and was forced to admit he did unethical things. President Nixon then makes matters worse on himself. Seeing his own career crumble before a video camera, he makes a career defining statement. He states ""When a president does it, that means its not illegal."" That was the nail in the coffin for former President Nixon's political career, and the defining interview that Frost had been looking for in his! The tension between Frost and Nixon was the theme of the movie, and also what I think made the film great. Whats so great about the film is the lighting and camera angles that are used. It made the film more intense, dramatic, and enhanced the theme. It left audiences almost rooting for Frost during the interviews. The lighting and camera angles enhanced an already dramatic story line. Another movie that comes to mind when I think of the emotional value that a film has is ""The Last King of Scotland"", which is another Peter King adaptation.<br/><br/>Needless to say Frost/Nixon is one of the best films of the new millennium, even though it is telling a story that happened forty years ago. The plot, lighting, and camera angles all tied together to make a great suspenseful film. It provokes audiences emotions, and captures their attention. I believe this film is destined to become a classic, and will be enjoyed by audiences for years to come."

","Well crafted film about a true story about a man seeking a big truth from the most powerful figure on the planet for it's time, the president of the United States over the Watergate scandal. Now I can tell why this film didn't do so well, although like I said, it's well crafted. Because some people are just not interested in American history and the truth isn't as fun or entertaining as fictional stuff. It's a involving film and everyone of the cast put on a good and some great performances, although I didn't particularly found Frank Langella to be playing Nixon, although his acting was pretty good. He did make it believable that the character he is playing is arrogant and loves his position of being in power and being in control and how his character would do and say almost anything to win. Michael Sheen is almost perfect with his performance playing David Frost. While starting off as a bit naive and friendly interviewer, turn into someone that starts using his wits and starts to play rough since his opponent who he is interviewing plays rough. This film shows power and money effects a lot of people, and how when a person holds a lot of power it leads to more greed and corruption. The only reason Richard Nixon decided to do the interview was because David Frost offers him $600,000 which is a big risk for Frost cause if the interview fails and isn't able to get the truth out of Nixon, his career will be in major jeopardy or even over. One of the most famous interview in history and all the work it had to get to certain points of that interview was interesting to watch. Now this isn't a film I would watch over and over again, but for the first time around it was actually quite intriguing. I especially like how it went in a direction where it's not about good against evil or anything along that line, but more about the fall of a man with feelings such as guilt that has went for the temptation instead of doing the right thing. Well done and compelling drama of a film, also somewhat entertaining. I also enjoyed Kevin Bacon's performance in this film playing the president's loyal lapdog.<br/><br/>7.2/10"

","Now, apart from the wobbly camera shouting, ""Documentary! Realistic!"" in a couple of scenes, this is a perfectly executed film, with the director sharply focused on the art of story-telling in a motion picture. Mr. Howard has found incredible focus, and uses his strength as an ""actor's director"" to full advantage - the performances of co-stars Frank Langella (Nixon) and Michael Sheen (Frost) are a tribute to themselves and the Howard's keen orchestration. And, there is a great ensemble around the leads, with Sam Rockwell and Kevin Bacon preaching to the ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" choirs.<br/><br/>Probably, the most extraordinary thing about ""Frost/Nixon"" can be witnessed in Mr. Langella's characterization.<br/><br/>Langella doesn't waste time trying to impersonate Nixon; instead, he finds a character very much like him, who happens to fit both the story being told and our impression of what Nixon could have been like, in this context. It's not Nixon, but an amazing facsimile. Less well known, but closer to the mark is Mr. Sheen's portrayal of a talk show host who could never mask the phoniness with which he proclaimed each guest's latest project as a ""Smashing!"" success. Frost would have preferred to compliment the ""simply marvelous"" furniture on the deck of the Titanic, which is why Nixon picked him.<br/><br/>A full pardon to conspiring writer Peter Morgan. ""The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King."" <br/><br/>""Frost/Nixon"" comes along when director Howard wielded a lot of power over the small pool of potential great film projects available, and a fine-looking production was assured - nevertheless, you expected the finished product to also maintain a sleek, almost regrettable safeness. And, this film, like it or not, elevates both of its character subjects - Richard M. Nixon and David Frost - along with their mutually beneficial ""mini-series"" of interviews to an undeserved legendary status. That it fails factually and may unfortunately blur historical perceptions is beside the point - it's still an excellent film.<br/><br/>********* Frost/Nixon (10/15/08) Ron Howard ~ Frank Langella, Michael Sheen, Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon"

","David Frost (Michael Sheen) is an up and coming British talk show host in 1977. He is very ambitious and he also has an eye for the ladies. One day, he hears that if he could get Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) on his show, it would boost his image and credibility, especially if he could trick ""Tricky Dick"" into admissions of error and guilt. John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen), a close friend of David's and a producer, thinks its a good idea but wonders how they will come up with the money to entice Nixon to commit to the interviews. Working on a shoestring and borrowed money, the two Brits succeed in getting the former president to agree to a series of four conversations. Soon after, Frost and Birt travel to San Clemente to meet the fallen leader and find a venue for their talks. Guarding the situation is Nixon's ally, Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon), who is hoping Nixon can redeem himself with his own explanations and turn the tables on the inexperienced Frost. So, the stage is set. Helping Frost in his preparations are two American journalists (Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell), each of them a Nixon-loather. Will Frost succeed in getting Nixon's to admit his law-breaking errors in judgment? This is a fine, fine film based on an equally fine stage play. For everyone who thinks they know enough about Nixon, don't believe it! Even the most die-hard Tricky Dick ""haters"" will have their eyes opened by Nixon's terrific mind and fighting spirit. As Nixon, Langella gives a tremendous performance, for although he does not physically resemble Nixon much, he MAKES the viewer believe he is, indeed, the former president. Sheen holds his own well against such a co-star, giving a great turn as the outwardly confident, inwardly insecure talk show personality. Of course, it is wonderful to see Macfadyen again (the whole world fell for him in Pride and Prejudice and loved him in Death at a Funeral) and he does not disappoint in his role as a sunny-haired, astute producer. Platt and Rockwell, too, deserve big applause for their wit and dogged determination in their roles as advisers who wish to slice Nixon into little pieces. Viewers will also love the rest of the cast, including Bacon, McCormack, and the rest of the players. Then, too, Nixon's mansion in San Clemente is so utterly gorgeous, everyone will be making plans to buy a winning lotto ticket and get an estate just like it. Costumes and hairstyles nicely show that 70's style while production values, script and direction are very, very fine, too. In brief, don't nix Frost/Nixon, whatever you do! It is a fine recreation of a the interviews that showed the world Nixon's strengths and his weaknesses and made a name out of the attention-seeking but talented Frost."

","Ironically and coincidentally I came to view this movie just days after finally watching ""All The President's Men"" - cause and effect, before and after, call it what you will, I have to say that ""Frost/Nixon"" made far less of an impression on me. Of course I appreciate the stylistic and narrative differences between the films, but as someone with an interest in recent ""current affairs"", I was disappointed by this latest Ron Howard movie.<br/><br/>Adapted from a critically successful play, I feel the movie never gets over the fact that it's a dramatisation of a series of television interviews - heaven help the upcoming film on the Bobby Fischer / Boris Spassky chess match from the early 70's I've been reading about in the upcoming schedules. While important in giving us insight into the final deconstruction of an already disgraced president, the movie has too great a conception of its own self-importance and I would argue that this examination of Tricky Dicky Nixon doesn't justify a two hour feature some 30 years on.<br/><br/>There are also, for me, some too obvious character-traits handed out to the Frost & Nixon characters, being Frost's playboy dilettantism and Nixon's money-grasping bent. I also was thrown slightly by the lack of physical resemblance of the two main characters (if anything, Frank Langhella looks more like Ronald Reagan) and the fact that neither actor quite nails the distinctive voices of their real-life counterparts. Then there's the much commented-on dubiously invented drunken telephone-call from Nixon to Frost before the final interview, highlighting too obviously his paranoia (he even tapes the call!).<br/><br/>Knowing pretty much the outcome also diluted the dramatic tension and the ""big"" moment when Frost finally pries out Nixon's confession to illegality is also skewered by the too-cinematic reactions of the interested parties looking on.<br/><br/>As to Howard's direction, I feel that the on-screen interview scenes could have been presented more tautly and that the framing device of post-event ""interviews"" with the actors playing the supporting characters was too clever for its own good. As for the acting, as stated I never really felt I was watching Frost and Nixon at all and was reminded of the Kevin Costner ""starrer"" ""11 Days"" which using similar cinematic devices got over far better the import of its subject matter - namely the Cuban Air Crisis of 1961. The action here is all in the dialogue, crippling the movie with a sense of stasis from which it never really elevates.<br/><br/>On the whole then, though a bold enterprise by the production team, I'm not sure that this particular play warranted the movie treatment. I'm now scurrying through You Tube and the like for the original footage of the interviews. Sometimes you don't need the background to the main event, sometimes the event itself is enough."

He was at his wits end until he decided to fund the project himself and then later syndicate it. <br/><br/>Nixon was lost because he did the unthinkable: resigned the presidency and that was tough to live with. Then comes this showman Frost who wants an interview and for Nixon to admit to wrongdoing and a cover-up. If he admits to that, he would compound his guilt and be forever lost. He was hoping the interview would get him some credibility, sympathy , and perhaps some understanding from the American people of why he acted the way he did. <br/><br/>What keeps this movie engaging are the behind the scenes deals going on before and during the interview. These are things the public is not privy to and when they involve a president of the United States the public stays tuned in.

I never saw the actual TV broadcast of the interviews and I don't think I need to. Langella captured Nixon perfectly and I came away with the feeling that others watching also didn't want to hit a man when he's down. So maybe Nixon did come away with some of that understanding mentioned above, but he would always be forever lost and he understood that. <br/><br/>Langella was nominated for Best Actor and should have gotten it. Ron Howard was nominated for Best Director. Didn't win. And, Frost Nixon was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. Also didn't win. The production was good, the acting and dialogue by all was also good, but it was Langella who makes all this work. <br/><br/>Most of us know the outcome but it's in the telling that people should see this.

","This is the 5th and final Oscar Best Picture nominee that I watched. Honestly, this is the prime reason why I watched this. But, I am glad I watched it because the movie really peaked my interest, and I actually enjoyed it. I totally think ""Frost/Nixon"" is worthy of its slot on the Best Picture shortlist.<br/><br/>This movie recounts an event in the history of American television broadcast, which was totally unknown to me before I watched this film. This was a celebrated interview of the infamous resigned US President Richard M. Nixon by British talk show host David Frost in 1977. However from this rather limited and shallow plot, British playwright Peter Morgan was able to develop a hit play, and from that this very vibrant screenplay.<br/><br/>This is another very potent acting showcase. All of the actors did so well. The two lead stars were the same two who originated these roles in the West End (2006) and on Broadway (2007), and their familiarity with their respective roles shows. All the awards attention is being showered on Frank Langella in his performance as the disgraced Nixon. In fact, he has the lone acting nomination of this film. However, the entire cast should really be recognized as an ensemble.<br/><br/>The supporting actors provide a very lively background for which the principal actors perform. I have to give special mention to Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell for playing Zelnick and Reston, the research staff of David Frost. I enjoyed ALL of their lines. So funny in their sarcasm. Pretty newcomer Rebecca Hall is the only female member of the cast, and she holds her own in her relatively decorative role as Frost's girlfriend Caroline. And who can forget fierce loyalty of Nixon aide Jack Brennan as played by none other than Kevin Bacon.<br/><br/>My favorite actor in all this was actually Michael Sheen who played the shallow show-biz oriented British talk show host, David Frost. Sheen, whom I only knew previously as Tony Blair in ""The Queen,"" played it light, charismatic and likable as Frost was. He very effectively provided the sharp contrast to the serious and manipulative Nixon, as the script needed to succeed. He should have also been nominated for Best Actor.<br/><br/>Frank Langella worked under the disadvantage that he doesn't look like the very recognizable Richard Nixon. He needed to focus our attention on the inner persona and sharp intellect that Nixon is also known for. Mr. Langella slowly won me over from my initial hesitation of accept him at first, and he had me believing in him in the end. The script had emphasized Nixon's apparent greed for money, his sharp strategic mind and also his monumental pride. Yet at the end, he was unexpectedly still able to project humility (something which may not sit well with a lot of anti-Nixon people).<br/><br/>Unlike ""Doubt"", ""Frost/Nixon"" does not betray its theater origin. It was as if it was originally written for the screen. The language of Peter Morgan's script is so alive, evoking both tragedy and humor. This extraordinary writing especially shone in scenes showcasing the British wit of Frost, the mind games of Nixon, and the sarcasm of Frost's advisers. I think the vitality of the script helped the potentially static nature of the plot along and made the directorial job of Ron Howard quite easy."

I have a sincere love for American Politics and have studied Richard Nixon to extent but I am only thirty so I missed the entire Watergate phenomenon and subsequent fallout. I eagerly awaited to see this film only having previous experience of a serious Richard Nixon performance from the legendary Anthony Hopkins. Frost/Nixon doesn't try to force itself into some sort of dramatic film but instead plays the situation real which is both impressive and discouraging because the entire film is riveting and yet doesn't have a deep plot. It's a surface film about an interview and a conceited, self important TV personality who nails the world's most desired Interview. Ultimately from this film (I have yet to see the actual interviews) Frost didn't really nail anything down until the final moments of the interview. Still the set up and the anticipation of the interview and the one truly mind blowing performance of the film make it the type of thing you can't take your eyes off of. The film still didn't really blow me away with the exception of that one performance.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen is a terrific actor. He can do some incredible performances but in all honesty I didn't see it in this one. I don't know how much he is given to work with as Australian TV personality David Frost but he is supposed to be very charismatic and I just don't get that from his performance. It's almost bordering on bland compared to his co-star. Now let's talk about that co-star. If this film scores an eight for me Frank Langella's performance is a perfect shining ten. Langella as Richard M. Nixon is breath taking. I didn't think he could come close to Hopkins' performance but he nails it and is brilliant. If the story is a little dull then Langella makes the film stone cold watchable. He is brilliant. You absolutely must see him pull off this performance!! He buries anyone else in the film. Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, and Oliver Platt also add some style and humor to the film as well. Platt in particular seems to be the comic relief which in some ways kind of feels out of place in the context of a very serious film.<br/><br/>It seems almost an understatement to say that Ron Howard is a brilliant director. He has done some amazing films and he knows how to tell a story. He has done every genre imaginable and he helps tell the story as well. His films tend to show an unprecedented feeling of intensity and Frost/Nixon proves that. Again the story for the film is simplistic enough but ultimately it is telling the story of the aftermath of Richard Nixon the man. When you watch the film watch it from the perspective of it being a story about Richard Nixon specifically and not the interviews. One of the most powerful movie scenes I have seen in ages is Nixon's late night phone call to Frost where he appears to be showing some of his rumored paranoia and break in psyche. Considering the award nominations, any movie fan should see this but if not for that reason then see if for the truly amazing performance by Frank Langella and a piece of American history from a different perspective. 8/10"
"Rogue-32","9","2","5","26 January 2009"," A seductive chess game of a film
","A lot of critics have been writing that so many films this year have been elevated above their material by the sheer power of the actors' performances; ""Frost/Nixon"" is most definitely in that category, for me.<br/><br/>Writer Peter Morgan and director Ron Howard do give us just the right balance of historical information and theatrical anticipation to make the film work. At the beginning, the stage is set very cleverly and economically, filling in the segment of the audience who was too young (or too drunk and/or too stoned) to know about what happened at Watergate in the early 70's with Richard Nixon and his cronies. From there, we have a very well-done build-up to the actual interviews, from their inception, showing how Frost gets the initial idea, through how Nixon, who clearly needed some sort of outlet for his anguish over the events that caused him to resign the Presidency, decides to take the bait.<br/><br/>If the set-up hadn't been dramatic and interesting, it would have somewhat diminished what follows, but it still could not have destroyed the power of Frank Langella's soulfully stunning turn as Nixon. It's his movie, he commands every second of his screen time, with a performance that evokes Tricky Dick from the inside out, deep from the inside; he's said in interviews that he wasn't trying to look like Nixon (although, from the back, the similarity is uncanny) - he was attempting to show the man's soul, and in this regard he succeeds beyond any expectations, hopefully including his own.<br/><br/>The fact that Langella manages to make Nixon understandable and sympathetic is amazing in itself, but it's the way he does it that makes it all the more of an achievement. He shows us the humanity of the man, but in a subtle way which goes far beyond the words he's given in the script; it is this characteristic which elevates the film, makes it more than the sum of its parts, gives it a transcendent quality that stays with you long after you leave the theatre.<br/><br/>I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of humor that found its way into the script; this isn't a dry lets-get-the-facts-straight-and-to-hell-with-everything-else sort of affair ~ it's entertaining, above all, it moves along at a brisk pace, and by the end of it you feel you've actually gotten to know both these people a little better, Nixon more than Frost: his character, I have to say, really didn't feel like the David Frost I've seen. Michael Sheen's portrayal was less arrogant and far more generous - by the last interview, you get the feeling he took no pleasure in his checkmate (Nixon's confession); I don't know how true this is to how it actually went down, and of course we'll never know, but the Frost I've seen appeared to have had a bit of a harder edge."
"blackburnj-1","9","2","5","25 January 2009"," An electric adaptation of a brilliant play
","Richard Nixon is a compelling figure. However, reduced to a two-dimensional demon by popular culture and perhaps best known to a new generation as a character from ""Futurama"", Nixon ""The man"" has been somewhat lost. One character in ""Frost/Nixon"" asks ""How can you possibly feel sympathy for Richard Nixon?"" In this film, set against the backdrop of his post-Watergate disgrace and his first post-Presidential interview, with British chat show host and journalist David Frost, Nixon is quietly but completely made into a sympathetic figure.<br/><br/>This is only half of the tale however. This film, adapted from Peter Morgan's electric stage play, is as much about the smaller figure of Frost, now a grandfather of modern British television and only recently retired from political interviewing. The Frost shown here (Morgan taking advantage of the interviewer's relative anonymity and using a bit of artistic licence) is struggling to shake off his chat show host background and risks everything for the interview of the century. No-one wants him and he seems doomed to fail.<br/><br/>It is a story of two men of ambition in a boxing duel: Nixon desperate to get back to the East coast and into public life once more and Frost equally determined to be successful and prove everyone wrong. As the contest slowly unfolds, the film becomes more gripping, interesting and electric to experience. At the heart of this success are the brilliant writing, subtle direction and outstanding acting.<br/><br/>Morgan's script is a masterpiece. The play came out in the same year as ""The Queen"", for which he received an Oscar nomination, but this was the superior piece and he transfers it to the screenplay format with panache. It is a brilliant portrait of two men locked in a quiet battle where their opponent is not necessarily an enemy, but only one of them can win, at the ultimate cost of the other. It cannot be as fluid a piece of storytelling as it is on stage and the attempt to frame the story with a documentary style series of interviews jars a little, but this is more than made up for by the quality of what is contained within and the careful direction of Ron Howard.<br/><br/>Howard has incredible respect for the play but realises that this is cinema and makes it fit the medium. The power of television, and the close up, becomes more apparent here as every flinch and twitch is caught on screen. Still, although this is a talky film (and a bit of a slow starter), there is a lot of motion. The camera flows through the world and circles around the characters capturing the film beautifully and giving it a necessary dynamism. Not that this is required to keep the audience's attention, as they are quickly sucked in by the quality of the performances.<br/><br/>Whilst the supporting cast includes wonderful little turns by the underestimated Kevin Bacon, Toby Jones and Oliver Platt, and another impressive performance by the increasingly good Sam Rockwell, they are thoroughly outshone by the superb leads. It is unfair on Michael Sheen that his co-star alone is attracting nominations like moths to a flame as he is brilliant. Having got the mannerisms of Frost down, he constructs a performance of subtlety, control and power. He is matched by Langella who's Nixon is a triumph. He is painted as the liar and fool he deserves to be, but also as a determined man, frustrated by his flaws. Langella is great at realising this. The voice is memorable and rings in the ears long after the film has ended, whilst the physicality of his ""tricky Dicky"" is carefully managed for maximum effect: sometimes big and imposing, sometimes smaller and more world-weary.<br/><br/>They reach their high point in an electric last forty-five minutes, including the (rightly) praised fictional phone call, where it is impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. The power of television and the close-up (and good cinema) is proved, the dust settles and the aftermath is left and, when the red mist clears, even the most hard-bitten, liberal hippie might find a surprise. You might feel a great deal of sympathy for Richard Nixon.<br/><br/>4 Stars out of 5"
"info-18405","8","2","5","11 January 2009"," Slow burn... But...
","I've sat through the 2 hour film, and it took me a while to get into it. I thought at the beginning, with the back story being so detailed in its approach to the character and David's transient life style that it would be a master piece of interviewing against the former president Nixon. But it was obvious that David didn't take the task of this monumental interview seriously, a fact lacking in the overall footnote in the history of the interview. Ron Howard did a sterling job, a lot of familiar faces, even in parts that probably adorned the editing suite floor, but familiar and comforting in its gravitas.<br/><br/>Great parts, Michael Sheen doing a fantastic job of the accent throughout, and Sam Rockwell was brilliant as the researcher James Reston Jr, I was even surprised at Matthew Macfadyen's performance (blonde wig aside), as it showed some depth lacking in his previous performances in the UK's TV show Spooks.<br/><br/>Overall its a historical view of an interview few will be interested in, but as a fan of David Frost, and those studying the Nixon years will find enjoyable in its slow pace, great direction and one that only historically minded people will relish. Outstanding acting throughout."
"frankenbenz","8","2","5","3 January 2009"," A Howard Movie w/o archetypes?!!
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>Perhaps the best American film of 2008, Ron Howard's Frost / Nixon is a fascinating pseudo- documentary recounting the infamous interviews David Frost (Michael Sheen) conducted with resigned President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) in 1977. Adapted from playwright Peter Morgain's play, the screenplay ingeniously co-opts the wholly satisfying formula of a Rocky- esquire sports melodrama, only this time, the boxing takes place on a figurative chess board. What makes this movie so utterly fascinating to watch is the constant mental maneuvering between the adversarial leads, where Nixon takes on the invincible air of a seasoned champion, and Frost the outclassed, long-shot newcomer.<br/><br/>For a number of reasons, this entire project was destined to be a success long before the cameras ever started to roll. Not only had the source material the good fortune of being polished to a brilliant sheen through its successful run in the theater, the two lead actors had the benefit of reprising the same roles they had been playing in the same play. Langella and Sheen deliver flawless and thoroughly convincing performances, both of them having mastered their roles long before the film was ever green-lit. Howard too has the upper hand on the material, much of it dealing with the inner workings of TV production, since his entire life has been spent either in front of the camera or behind it. It's unlikely any other director would be better suited to direct this material. The end result is unquestionably Howard's best work as helmer, thanks to a screenplay that is unlike anything else he's ever brought to the big screen; Frost / Nixon is a complex character study of two men, both equally compelling and both plagued by their own unique demons. There are no good guys or bad guys in Frost / Nixon and, despite his evil deeds, Nixon is given what feels like a fair shake...perhaps one he doesn't even deserve."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","5","29 December 2008"," Brilliant Performance by Langella
","Frost/Nixon (2008) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Intense and extremely well-acted account of the four interviews between British talk show host David Frost (Michael Sheen) and disgraced former President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella). This film doesn't seem to be ripping up at the box office, which is a real shame because Howard has created an incredibly well-made film that has plenty of wonderful drama as well as some of the best acting seen in recent years. I'm sure many will be familiar with the story being told but being 28 I wasn't. I knew of the interviews and I knew what happened to Nixon but all the behind the scenes stuff really grabbed me as did the actual interviews. I'm sure those who are familiar with the story will also be hooked into the movie just going by the reactions of some of the older folks walking out of the theater with me. The movie features some of the best acting in recent years but the performances by Langella is one of the ages. Whenever a figure like Nixon is shown you can't help but thing back to the actual person and I did that here but it only lasted a few seconds because after that I couldn't help but think I was actually seeing Nixon and not a performance. Langella takes ahold of Nixon's speech patterns, facial gestures and everything else so perfectly that you can't help but think you seeing the actual man. I'm not sure if it was Langella's plan or perhaps the film's plan but I started to feel a lot of sympathy for Nixon as the film moved along. Perhaps if I lived when this stuff took place I'd feel differently but the loneliness of Nixon's admissions and what he'd have to live with for the rest of his life was rather sad. His best moment, and perhaps the film's best moment, is a phone call the night before the big and final interview. Sheen also does a wonderful job and perfectly allows himself to be vulnerable during the first three interviews when Nixon is walking over him. How Sheen transforms in that fourth interview was great fun to watch. Kevin Bacon turns in some of his best work in years as does Oliver Platt and Rebecca Hall. Patty McCormack doesn't have too many scenes as Pat Nixon but she's terrific when she's on. Howard does a wonderful job at building up the suspense of the situation as we grow closer to the fourth and final interview with so much riding on the answers that Nixon will give. The interviews are directed in a wonderful fashion to where the viewer will be holding his breathe waiting for the answers to come. The intense performances, strong direction and smart screenplay makes for one of the better political dramas in many years. A real triumph of a film but Langella is the true masterpiece with his performance."
"dfw_txs","8","2","5","27 December 2008"," Refreshing and Candid
","While I am not an expert on Watergate, I have read quite a bit on Nixon and the performance by Frank Langella was absolutely stunning. While he does not quite look like Nixon, or quite sound like him, 10 minutes into the move you think it is Nixon. It is a masterful performance.<br/><br/>The movie itself was pretty good. It is not great, though the ending is great, if that makes sense. First let me say, the movie drags for about an hour mid way through. While the scenes with Nixon are riveting, the parts of David Frost are just not that interesting. Probably because he in real life, he is simply just not a guy you are dying to learn about.<br/><br/>While I have not seen the actual Front/Nixon interview tapes in their entirety, those that have concede they were painfully boring with the exception of the Watergate segment, which riveted the nation.<br/><br/>And that was the movie too. The movie was from David Frost's point of view, because it had to be. If it were from Nixon's point of view, nobody would have cared because in reality nobody really cares about David Frost. The movie does have some interesting moments, but nothing memorable....except the scenes with Nixon.<br/><br/>What made the movie was the final 20 minutes. While it was not Ron Howard's intent, you do feel sorry for Nixon in the end. Maybe it's because many years have passed. Maybe its because the last two guys we have had in the oval office have been so unpresidential, it's refreshing to see an larger than life figure.<br/><br/>Frank Langella carried this movie. Without him, it would have been a bust. But with him, its one of the year's best. Stick with the middle of the movie and be patient. The ending is powerful."
"dunmore_ego","8","2","5","26 December 2008"," ...and the Truth shall set you bleed...
","Peace/War. Life/Death. Truth/Lies. Frost/Nixon.<br/><br/>Based on Peter Morgan's stage play of the same name, from the stunning real life interviews that ex-president Richard M. Nixon granted British television host, David Frost in 1977, Ron Howard's compelling FROST/NIXON does what Oliver Stone's milky W. never could - it gets the job done.<br/><br/>What job is that? Putting Richard Milhous Satan's Vagina Nixon in his place, in that exclusive niche in history reserved for the lowest of felonious, unrepentant bottom-dwellers who were never tried and fried like the criminals they were. After the courts never did their job in convicting Nixon, after President Ford pardoned the son of a whore (with the public disapproving 2 to 1), after America thought he had slimed out of their grasp, it took a Brit TV talk show host to corner Nixon into a roundabout admission of guilt in the Watergate scandal.<br/><br/>FROST/NIXON opens in 1974 with Watergate all over the news. Author James Reston (exasperated Sam Rockwell) echoes American sentiment regarding Nixon's 1974 resignation, ""Instead of satisfaction, I got angrier! There was never any admission of guilt!"" Brought onboard the Frost team for his passion, this underlying theme fanned Reston's engines and gave the Frost interview team a goal.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen plays David Frost as a playboy television host by way of Austin Powers (""Yeh, baby!""); Frank Langella plays the marble-gargling Nixon by way of Satan's Vagina, though not without a touch of pity - which we should never succumb to after considering Nixon's laundry list of premeditated crimes. Both men reprise their roles from the stage production.<br/><br/>By this movie's account, Frost wanted to interview Nixon purely as a marketing ploy, seeing the sky high ratings Nixon's farewell address garnered and wanting to capitalize on that viewership. It sounded good enough on paper to accrue his ambitious, dedicated team, but Frost's profile at the time was that of a low-rent television host whose shows were flagging, so advertisers and sponsors were almost impossible to entice.<br/><br/>Nixon's agent (a smarmy Toby Jones) demands an unprecedented $600,000 for the interview, which Frost accedes to, paying Nixon the $200K deposit from his own money. <br/><br/>By the time of the actual Nixon interviews, Frost was still in the financial hole. And from the initial interview rounds of Nixon besting Frost, everyone believed they would die a gurgling death there.<br/><br/>At the time, Nixon was seeking a sympathetic forum (or at least an affable one) where he could re-render Watergate in a favorable light. Ironically, Nixon's agent accepted the Frost interview because everyone thought Frost would be a pushover (""easier than CBS, a big wet kiss, pitching puff balls"").<br/><br/>On March 23, 1977, the first Frost-Nixon interview was taped. Frost thought he nailed Nixon with the very first question, ""Why didn't you burn the tapes?"" Unfortunately, it was Frost who got burned as Nixon gave rambling, 20-minute answers and ""controlled the space."" So it went for three out of the four tapings, Nixon never letting Frost edge in, while Frost's team cringed in their green room and Nixon's team (including a stolid Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan, Chief of Staff) quietly sniggered in demonic contempt from theirs.<br/><br/>The interviews were conducted over the course of a month, the last taping on April 22, 1977.<br/><br/>For dramatic effect, movie portrays the final interview as the most damning for Nixon, as Frost wears him down with copious notes and repeated phrases ""cover-up"" and ""obstruction of justice""; pushing Nixon to admit the Watergate actions were not ""mistakes"" but ""crimes."" From righteously spewing ""There was no cover-up, it was political containment,"" Nixon eventually relents begrudgingly, ""I let down my friends. I let down the country. I let down our system of government and the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but think that it's all too corrupt,"" and ""I gave them a sword and they stuck it in with relish."" The killing stroke came for Frost when he badgered: ""Are you really saying that in certain situations the president can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?"" and elicited from Nixon, ""I'm saying that when the president does it, that means it's NOT illegal!"" <br/><br/>And the world stopped spinning...<br/><br/>What is the purpose of reviving Tricky Dick in our minds only to re-bury him? Why re-destroy the man who devalued the American presidency and simultaneously alerted America to the checks and balances that needed to be imposed on the ""imperial presidency""? Because it arrives at an apt point in history when the only other politician deserving of Nixon's exclusive criminal niche is doing exactly the same thing; you know him as The Oil Idiot of Texas, that moron cowboy coward with the skunk-weasel demeanor and non-functioning neocortex - George W. Bush.<br/><br/>With his December 2008 ""exit interviews"" to gutlessly compliant news-folk, Bush desperately seeks to salvage his diarrhetic legacy - almost identical to Satan's Vagina: devaluing the American presidency, mismanaging wars, criminally forging an imperial presidency - only wasting America's time. Those who know the truth are not listening.<br/><br/>Nixon's approval rating was in the low 20s when he resigned in disgrace in 1974. Bush's approval ratings at the end of his illegally-won two terms - exactly the same.<br/><br/>David Frost has interviewed seven American presidents, including George W. Bush. When interviewing Bush as ""president,"" Frost would have only been allowed puff balls. But Bush is no longer president...<br/><br/>It's been a long time since Frost commanded ratings like those for the Frost/Nixon interviews. He made his money back a thousandfold and gained a rep as a wrecking ball interviewer. To out-rocket those ratings, may we suggest, Sir David Frost, inking a deal for Frost/Bush?<br/><br/>Oh, what wonders of felonious, unrepentant bottom-dwelling truth could Frost dredge from THAT hellish vagina..."
"commandercool88","8","2","5","20 December 2008"," Phenomenal Performances, Thrilling Story
","If it's drama you want, it's drama you'll get. 'Frost/Nixon' is a fierce cat and mouse political game, one that gleams of tension and intellectual wit. While falling short of an unabashed masterpiece, Ron Howard has taken the popular play of the same name and given it the Hollywood treatment. An exceptional film filled with fine performances as far as the eye can see, it entertains as well as educates.<br/><br/>While mostly unnecessary, Howard's mockumentary approach to the story seems fitting enough as it does add some historical weight to 'Frost/Nixon'. It all becomes an absorbing experience, and at times it's easy to forget that thirty years have passed since David Frost and Richard Nixon set foot in the ring to duel. But if understanding history is a pivotal cornerstone, then 'Frost/Nixon' remains an important and powerful history lesson. Even if it's been spiced up for the silver screen in the process. And during a current administration whose dealings have been questionable at best, learning from our mistakes is the only way we'll ever learn.<br/><br/>'Frost/Nixon' plays out very much as if it were unfolding on stage. And that allows our cast to soak up a thrilling script and show off some serious acting chops. Michael Sheen's performance as David Frost, a sort of Ryan Seacrest of the '70s, is brilliant. An underdog opportunity to take on a man who would never stand trial for one of the greatest crimes committed in American history. It was an oddball moment in history for sure, which made the end result that much more surprising. And the man who steals the show is, of course, a stunning Frank Langella. His portrayal of Richard Nixon is nothing short of astonishing. It's more of an immersion into Nixon the man instead of a mere imitation.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, Nixon doesn't come off as the villain. Rather, a man who is finally forced to stand the trial he never had to endure in the court of law. The court of public opinion, however, can be just as damning. Nixon could no longer hide from the truth. He was a man haunted by his own grave mistakes that greatly hurt a nation, and it was time to stare them in the face. It's a notable and at times memorable film, even if it doesn't always jump off the screen. Offering up a finale so fascinating and thick with tension, it's difficult to deny the skill and finesse involved to give 'Frost/Nixon' the justice it deserved. It's an impressive showing, and one of the year's better films.<br/><br/>More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
"AudioFileZ","Null","2","5","11 December 2008"," A Portrait Of A Career Lost Provide 3 Landmark Career Turns...Excellent.
","This film is remarkable and it literally provides three career turns...First, late in his acting career Frank Langella gives such a tour de force performance that this is unequivocally his finest work. He simply becomes Richard Nixon in such an uncanny way that words fail to adequately describe it. I liken it to a seasoned immensely successful performer who luckily was chosen to do the work he was obviously made for. If there ever was a more tragic figure in American politics no one would believe it as Mr. Langella nails all the many juxtapositions that Nixon, the mortal man, possessed. Second, Michael Sheen, quite early in his career, reaches a pinnacle in his portrayal of David Frost which for the entirety of his future he will be hard pressed to surpass...He's that convincing. Frost, a kind of international playboy ""quasi-showhost"" would seem to be the most unlikely candidate for such a landmark interview series. He possessed just the right enigmatic charisma and polar-opposite personality from Richard Nixon that lured Nixon into doing something no one else, try as they did, could. The gravity of which simply cannot be understated and Sheen's performance gives realism and credibility as to how he was the right man at the right time in history to achieve such. Finally, Ron Howard, whose work has always been eminently bankable yet purely entertainment and somewhat trite in weight, rises to the top of the heap of all-time great directors. He has made his heavyweight masterpiece, a movie which will likely be discussed a hundred years from now. One senses he is moving into a new phase and while he may not eclipse this great statement I have great admiration and hope he may again equal it.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who even has a passing interest in politics, history, law, or human behavior. The importance of what happened to the American people and President Richard M. Nixon, against the period in American history in which it occurred, is simply impossible to understate. A movie derived on a play based on this seems as though it likely could not undertake such a monumental task and succeed, yet it does so with such clear authority and naked emotional power that I, for one, am awed by it. A must see. Excellent in every way."
"fablesofthereconstru-1","6","3","10","6 January 2009"," Put your hand inside the puppet head
","Living in exile, former President Richard Nixon, tanner but diminished under a western sun, sees opportunity in consenting to the proposed series of interviews with British talk show host David Frost(Michael Sheen); the opportunity being, a triumphant return to the east coast once he sets the record straight on his disgraced presidency. To Nixon's handlers, Frost's offer is perceived as a suitable vehicle for their rehabilitation campaign to vindicate Nixon from his role in the Watergate scandal. Since Frost, according to Jack Brennan(Kevin Bacon), an aide, can't match wits with the man he still respects unconditionally; since Frost's last interview happened to be with The Bee Gees, the four most dreaded words in the English language was definitely not, ""David Frost is here."" Nixon's misdeeds may have caused an ardent critic like James(Sam Rockwell) to throw a hissy fit about the man's legacy, but he was the president, at a time when being president meant you were the smartest man in the room. You don't throw your shoe at a smart man. Nixon was no amateur president. So despite his misgivings about this warmonger, this ""Dick"", James turns into jelly when he's up close and personal with the former leader of the free world. It's called having gravitas: something that our outgoing president lacks, hence the shoe incident. As a sad reflection of the world we live in, consider that Frost, a television personality, is, more than likely, not just an equivalent, but the intellectual superior of W. Maybe, just maybe, Presdient Bush might be able to go toe-to-toe with Carson Daly, in a no-holds-barred, sit-down interview about the economy, Guantanamo, Katrina, the Patriot Act, Dick, the other d**** in his cabinet, Iraq, ""My Pet Goat"", and his inability to pronounce the word ""subliminal"". In 1974, the standards in which to impeach a president by, was considerably less.<br/><br/>NBC. ABC. CBS. No. No. And no. They all passed on Frost's brain child, the Big 3, largely because the networks still asserted the antiquated notion that the entertainment and hard news sides of their programming be apportioned in separate isolation chambers with absolute demarcations. Cast as the underdog with something to prove, the talk show host inevitably triumphs over adversity, satisfying the sports movie paradigm it mimics, but his journalistic victory, in actuality, does more harm than good. Echoes of James Brooks' ""Broadcast News"" abound in ""Frost/Nixon"", as Frost, like Tom Grunick(William Hurt), is portrayed as the intellectual lightweight that Nixon's aide makes him out to be, a man who needs his girl Friday(Holly Hunter as Jane Craig), but gets ""Crack No. 2""(Oliver Platt) and ""Deep Crack""(Rockwell) instead, to help him overcompensate with their own expertise on the matter, as leverage against his own lack of credentials. While James and Bob Zelnick(Platt) do the work of yeomen, Frost attends the movie premiere of ""The Slipper and the Rose"", rather than join his team in the trenches, with the expressed goal of giving Nixon ""the trial he never had"". After the first three tapings go poorly, Frost is suddenly galvanized into action by a late night phone-call with the ex-president, inspiring him to pull an all-nighter, as if the Nixon interviews were a college final he wanted to ace. He's like Mallory(Justine Bateman) from the NBC sitcom ""Family Ties""; now he knows what SCUBA stands for. In ""Broadcast News"", after Tom's interview with a foreign dignitary goes well, the anchorman compares Jane's collaboration(Hunter whispers the questions in Hurt's ear) to ""great sex"". For Frost, his interview with Nixon is akin to an act of masturbation; he is much more interested in self-promotion than the need to inform the public.<br/><br/>So ""David Frost Interviews Richard Nixon"" went into syndication and became a rousing success, just like Jim Henson's ""The Muppet Show"". It's appropriate, this comparison between these seemingly disparate programs, since Frost was a muppet of sorts, with the two ""crack"" investigators putting words into his mouth, and informing his movements: Frost the entertainer, doing an imitation of a hard-hitting journalist, such as Mike Wallace. <br/><br/>If you put your hand inside the puppet head, he will sing, he will dance, he will answer the right questions, he will make you believe that a frog can ride a bicycle"
"natw","9","2","6","6 May 2009"," Howard was brilliant, Langella was robbed
","The premise of ""Frost/Nixon"" certainly doesn't elicit much excitement. A movie about one person interviewing another person, even if one of them is Richard Nixon, seems like it would be a yawner. But Ron Howard turns it into a captivating piece of cinema. My first reaction was that Frank Langella was robbed for not winning the Academy Award. After setting aside my initial reaction and contemplating the movie, I became even more convinced. His performance was one of the best I have seen in years. Langella did what even Nixon failed to do: He made him a seem like a three-dimensional human being. He should have won hands down. I spent the summer sitting in front of the television set watching the Watergate hearings (we didn't have many channels back then), so it was fascinating to see this movie. But for those who didn't, it should still be a must-see. Not only will you learn a little about an important piece of history, you will be imminently entertained. Frost/Nixon is a real winner."
"evanston_dad","7","2","6","5 January 2009"," A Consummate Ron Howard Film, Which Means It's Not Remotely Artistic
","Frank Langella is getting heaps of praise for his performance as Richard Nixon in this Ron Howard film, but it's Michael Sheen, who delivers a spunky performance as David Frost, the lightweight British talk-show host, who deserves the most acclaim.<br/><br/>The film chronicles the famous Frost/Nixon interview that occurred a few years after Nixon's resignation. Both sides went into the interview like it was a boxing match, the Nixon camp seeing a chance to exonerate the infamous political figure in the public's eye, the Frost camp seeing an opportunity to get Nixon to admit publicly that he broke the law. The showdown should have been exciting (and by all accounts was, though I was far too young at the time to know about any of it), but events in the film only reach a moderate simmer when they should boil. Both Langella and Sheen give excellent performances, and they're backed by able actors (like Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell and Kevin Bacon), but the film remains staunchly unexciting.<br/><br/>The film could have gone in any number of interesting directions. Frost, an Englishman, clearly doesn't understand the passion with which his American aides want retribution from the encounter with Nixon, and I was interested in the role this difference in cultural perspective played. Also, the screenplay early on mentions the impact of television on the proceedings, positing that Frost ultimately won because he knew the medium while Nixon didn't. But this is just told to us, not shown. Rather than develop either of these engaging ideas, director Ron Howard instead decides, typically, to charge straight down the middle and deliver a consummate Ron Howard film. Therefore, it's solid, professional, slick and not remotely artistic.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"GethinVanH","Null","2","6","14 December 2008"," Some fine acting in a movie that is at times uneven
","Not a very deep view of American politics but that's Ron Howard for you. I question his view of history sometimes especially after the liberties he took with A Beautiful Mind. Apparently the part with Nixon drunk dialing frost was fictional. The acting was good but not excellent. I liked the supporting cast of Rockwell and Platt. I didn't care much for Kevin Bacon who I thought was over-the-top in his Nixon foot soldier character who will defend the President to every end.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this kind of material is really suited to Ron Howard though. I don't think his direction always has the depth for this kind of political topic. One scene showed Nixon petting a dog just after he'd been pummeled in an interview by Frost. The scene practically cries out ""See, he *is* human"". This is what I don't like about Ron Howard.<br/><br/>Overall though the movie was good but nowhere near perfect. It may be better suited as a play. A lot of the scenes around the interviews themselves are drawn out and not fully necessary."

","Director Ron Howard took the Richard Nixon interviews with David Frost of the 1970s and made an interesting and entertaining film. I always knew that Nixon resigned from the Presidency, but before I saw this film I had no idea who David Frost was, or that he interviewed Nixon. <br/><br/>When David Frost, a talk show host, decides to interview Richard Nixon, the entire nation thinks it is a joke. A man named Jim Reston (in the film, who knows if he was based on a real person) convinces Frost to punish Nixon. He says that Richard Nixon needs ""the trial he never got"" and that he should not be able to exonerate himself in the interview. Frost cleverly brings up 'watergate' and keeps asking Nixon until the President cracks under pressure. The initial idea for this film is very interesting and I think it was executed well both in acting and writing."

","Ron Howard has once again a stirring and interesting drama. Many critics have cited his new film 'Frost/Nixon' as his best film to date but I still believe that his finest work is his Oscar winning picture 'A Beautiful Mind.' Ron Howard I believe is a wonderful storyteller who can experiment with films and most of the time do it successfully and it is because of his confidence behind the camera. Apart from the sloppy 'Angels and Demons' he has had a great track-record for me. Yes, even 'The Da Vinci Code' I liked. This film is based on the play written by Peter Morgan who also wrote 'The Queen.' He adapts into the screen perfectly giving it a brilliant cinematic feel with half the credit going to Howard as well. The actors Frank Langella and Michael Sheen played the same roles as disgraced former President Richard Nixon and TV personality David Frost on Broadway. Their performances are wonderfully intense in their own separate ways. Langella's performance was one bound to win awards whilst Sheen's is equal in every way but not bound for the same fate. The story follows the legendary interviews between the two and a quest for the truth about 'Watergate.' It is compelling and intense - a great piece of cinema."
"johnnyboyz","7","1","2","6 December 2009"," Astute direction from Howard and two booming central performances elevate televisual material onto a new realm.
","It's to Frost/Nixon's great credit that a series, or passage, of televised interviews from thirty or so years ago come across as cinematic as they do here. In a film whose requirements are to distribute a certain amount of dramatic weight to both the interviews themselves as well as to all the talking, planning and building in the lead up to the interviews, Frost/Nixon rather impressively balances the burden. Most of the scenes in the run up carry a strange, laid back and somewhat cheeky aura to them; driven by Michael Sheen's gleefully faced, easily excitable, 'the world is my oyster' journalist David Frost. There's nothing that the man doesn't think he cannot achieve; and the period setting, in which a lot of the mise-en-scene seems to boast somewhat proudly ""this is the 1970s"", mixed with a colourful palette creates an odd overall juxtaposition clashing with the fact it's Richard Nixon we're additionally dealing with here; and it's what he did that spawns what the film's essentially revolving around.<br/><br/>I'd say a lot of the film feels carefree, almost as if we're supposed to find a lot of what goes on quite funny, but I mean that with the greatest of respects. Out of the interview room, the universe in which the film is unfolded is Frost's and is captured dutifully by the above characteristics. When the cameras are rolling and the two men are sitting opposite one another, Frost initially seems lost: that sense of 'fun' dissipates and Nixon dominates a lot of the proceedings. The film is a clashing of two perspectives of the world and those that inhabit it: young with old; carefree with careful; colloquial with formal but in addition, that underlying essence of British with American.<br/><br/>The film begins with what looks like some sort of formal interview about tricky subject matter shot with a 'vox-pox' ideation in mind, very quickly setting up that sense of juxtaposition Frost/Nixon seems to maintain in regards to character attitudes and sense of atmosphere. Frequently using, but not overdoing, the docu-drama convention; the early dialogue to camera is a journalist talking about how he followed Nixon's gradual decline from The White House as president of the USA, before observing the finale to everything and how to him it all resembled a soap opera of sorts, as these incredible events played out to the world. The relation that the film makes here, towards how real life events are able to carry some sort of dramatic weight, is a further example of how Frost/Nixon's self-referential style and content believes in its subject material and invites you to dramatically enjoy it. This is both the talk and the build up to the interviews as well as the actual Frost-Nixon interviews themselves as a piece of cinematic drama.<br/><br/>Sheen is Frost, as mentioned, whilst Frank Langella is Nixon. Nixon is a big guy, both in name and stature. Frost is softly spoken in comparison, juddery and wide-eyed whereas Nixon's deep, gruff and somewhat slurred voice twinned with a supposed bottomless pit of knowledge, interests and life-stories has him as more than a match for this relatively small time London Weekend Television based TV presenter whose overall televisual genre, if we go by what Frost is seen presenting early on, seems to be a combination of both news and slapstick.<br/><br/>Most of the film is fun and games in regards to the build up to the first interview. Nixon establishes himself as the kind of man who subscribes to challenges, likes to set himself goals and enjoys battles with individuals, be they victories or otherwise. When Kevin Bacon's Jack Brennan, an aide to Nixon, begins to label it a boxing match – a sort of on screen verbal jousting, the notion of this being a close to one-off; one-on-one scenario between two contrasting individuals is really pushed home in case nobody's got it by now. The film's somewhat colourful and upbeat content prior to the sessions, helped by Frost's seemingly invincible confidence, establishes one sense of aura but everything gradually gets lowered down to a more grounded level when it's established money is an issue on Frost's behalf, something that will crop up later in in regards to loosing a lot of it as well as potentially one's career. There's that feeling that Frost, playing an up and coming television personality, whilst Nixon, as an on the way down politician, has a chance to bury him when they meet half way.<br/><br/>But Ron Howard's impressive direction puts pay to this, very gradually reiterating the money as an element which puts everything severely at stake. The reality of the situation is brought home when Frost is all alone in a darkened and gloomy hotel room on a Friday night prior to a days shooting – he doesn't have much to go on in terms of material, and his career is on the line: there's that interesting sense that the guy is beginning to realise what 'real' journalism is all about. But while encompassing elements of self-discovery for Frost, establishing a wrong belief and a wrong approach before having him correct himself, the film isn't necessarily dominated by this study. Rather, it sees a man grossly underestimate another man, much in the vein he did an entire nation with a very fair and very specific political system rendering the whole thing a success on careful and minute levels."
"Hitchcoc","8","1","2","25 August 2009"," Respectfully Submitted
","If one is expecting to see a surly one dimensional Nixon and Frost as a pure white knight, it doesn't happen in this film. Someone here really looked into character and created a set of complex events and complex people. One doesn't become President of the United States without being a pretty charismatic figure. Nixon goes down in history as a crook, but he was a lot more than that. Frank Langella reprises his theater role and plays Nixon to the hilt. He is manipulative, calculating, somewhat charming in the correct circumstances, and nearly obsessed with ""correcting"" his image. The byplay that takes place between Nixon and Frost is priceless. I've been told that even if you don't like the President, the power emanating from the office itself, makes one weak kneed. There is a really precious scene that illustrates this, though I don't want to spoil it. David Frost comes off initially as a bit shallow. If we are to believe the events, we see him really in over his head. I had no idea that he had made such a financial commitment to these interviews. It is also interesting to see the dynamics among himself and his colleagues. This is an ""acting"" move and well worth the time. If you lived through Watergate, you will especially treasure this."

","For anyone who's ever read the news, made the news, heard of the news, or even said news would know about the Frost-Nixon debate. Ron Howard has now made an enthralling telling of it. It has a half-documentary, and half-fictional feel that works perfectly. Michael Sheen is excellent as David Frost, a news reporter who tries to set up an interview with infamous president Richard Nixon (Frank Langella). When David finally gets Richard on his news show, as always, Richard turns into Tricky Dick, wasting David's time with nonsense stories. The supporting players such as Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, and Oliver Platt also had to the witty excitement to be had here. But, while reading this review, remember it is not meant to be a fun movie, it's just surprisingly kind of fun. Ron Howard has made a marvelous movie, which we all know he can do, blending a great mix of drama and thrills. The movie is not bland like it could have easily been, but instead is a witty, Shakesperean-like film that is a perfect example of a definite Oscar movies.

","Well, if you try to compare Frost/Nixon with other semi-documentary movies like JFK, you will totally lose the point here. This is a movie where performances mattered,camera works matter and pace mattered. But none of them is enough to summarize the unique quality provided by this movie.<br/><br/>It started slow with interviews with most of the leading actors in their characters. It gave you a realistic feeling from then. Then, it goes directly to the two title roles and their lives and interactions, and finally lead to maybe the most sublime conversation ever illustrated in a movie. A lot of audiences may have already known the contents and the results of such a conversation, but they, like me, were still totally stuck by the dramatic personality of Nixon and the presentation. Therefore, you can safely go to the theater and sit down to enjoy, even though you thought the story has nothing new to offer.<br/><br/>The performances were nothing like you'd expect them to be. Frank Langella well deserved his Oscar nomination, while in my opinion, Michael Sheen also deserved to be nominated.<br/><br/>But, sadly enough, all the people I recommended this movie to, tend to fall asleep watching it.

","Ron Howard does to Frost/Nixon what he knows best. He picks up people and develops them into these intriguing characters, as he did with James Braddok in Cinderella Man or John Nash in A Beautiful Mind. Frost/Nixon is not an attempt to bring out a protagonist in either of the two lead characters. It is rather an intense presentation of a fallen but stubborn President and a maverick talk show host who knows what sells on TV.<br/><br/>Langella is brilliant as Nixon. And Michael Sheen is developing into a niche character actor. The film initially develops his part brilliantly, which is needed, since we know much about Nixon but little about Frost. The film does not bore you with needless background. it comes straight to the plot and moves smoothly.<br/><br/>Ron Howard presents gripping tale with moments of sheer class augmented by superior camera-work with focus on closeups and expressions given by the actors. the narrative style gives the viewer time to catch her breath in an otherwise fast paced and indulging film.<br/><br/>One of the best films of the year."

","Ron Howard's finest film? I had certainly not expected Howard to direct a political drama surrounding the famous 1977 interviews of President Richard Nixon by TV host David Frost, that's for certain. Starting off with a montage of newsreels, cut-out photos and names on paper, the film takes on a sort of documentary style (aptly named 'mockumentary') as we see the characters of the film interviewed by a unrepresented behind camera - it's like Howard deals with this as pure fact, something it is - well, sort of. Howard, and screenwriter Peter Morgan (who also wrote the original stage act), has taken liberties in creating this drama, which happily is for the better; they narrow it down, they pace it smartly as a duel of two eventually either falling or rising stars, and although the dialogs are very politically concerned (off course), they remain vital and full of energy - much to Morgan's screen writing, but mostly to Michael Sheen's swaggering performance as Frost and Frank Langella's hunching lion of Nixon. For me, this was a left-hook from Howard, and if this is him doing it alternative, can we please have more?"
"Lemniscate433","8","1","2","23 July 2009"," He's not a snowman, he's not a poet...
","He's probably the world's bravest interviewer in all of American History. This film is the story of David Frost and the four part interview he had with former President Richard M. Nixon. But if you think that these interviews were just any ordinary interview that you would see on Letterman, Leno, or O'Brien, well, you will be pleasantly surprised about this movie.<br/><br/>Let me give you some history behind the movie. After Nixon resigned from office due to heighten controversy about the Watergate scandal, Nixon was trying to redeem himself from the mistake by showing America that it was a non-intentional mistake. He was planning to write a memoir about his life journey and even go to a few interviews, hoping that through the words that he wrote and spoke, that America can forgive him for his past wrong-doings and remember him as a legacy for incredible achievements such as being the first President to have good connections with China. But then he saw David Frost's offer for an interview and Nixon and his team basically said that they could bully David Frost on air and make David Frost look stupid and Nixon look very presidential. But what Nixon did not know about this was that David Frost's funds for this interview was coming out of Frost's dear friends, or as I like to say, ""Beg, borrow, and steal."" So Frost was not going to let Nixon ""bully"" him around on air. He was going to give Nixon a fight.<br/><br/>And that was a huge premise of the movie. While you watch the movie, it is treated like a boxing match or a fight. You see the two opponents on each side of the ring with their entourage, giving them pep talk, developing strategies on what to do or what to say, and helping them on how to tick off their opponent. Also, the interviews that were conducted were very intense and thrilling (especially the last interview). I was legitimately and thoroughly hanging on every word and stall in the interview and that was what made the movie so great. The anxiety of those interviews and the raging wit and word war between Nixon and Frost.<br/><br/>Frank Langella was probably the best Richard Nixon impression ever since Anthony Hopkins. Even though Langella did not look anything like the real Richard Nixon, his movements, his way of speaking, and his expressions all really emphasized the idea of not just his impression of Nixon, but also how Nixon was not at all a nice guy and how Nixon became known as ""Tricky Dick."" And let me not forget about Michael Sheen and his great performance as David Frost in this film.<br/><br/>I thought that the beginning of the movie was rather rushed a little and in some ways, not favorable, but everything else was just marvelous. Also, there was so much limelight on the two characters David Frost and Richard Nixon to the point that all the other characters in the movie just seemed like shadows. But then again, you can make a backfire about that by saying that the movie is solely based on the interviews with Nixon and Frost, thusly, being called Frost/Nixon. And I liked that because if this movie were to go off into the other characters for too long, I would have been condemning the movie more.<br/><br/>But if you are interested in politics, especially one that involves Nixon and Watergate, I highly recommend this movie to you. Thusly, I give this movie a low eight."

Which is mostly an achievement of the script, the direction and the acting. A movie that can be seen a bit like history lesson, but in a light and enjoyable kind of way.

","""Those who heard me on radio thought I'd already won. I lost the 1960 elections because of perspiration on my brow and above my lips"" says Nixon prior to the start of the interview. Alluding to one of the most celebrated events in the history of television (the televised debates between Kennedy and Nixon before the 1960 Presidential Elections), the lines ram home the idea that it might be worthwhile going out of the way to project an image of confident repose rather than banking entirely on content. This is one of the major purports of the film - the impressions that images on television make on people and what they make of the same. Based on Peter Morgan's (writer for Frost/Nixon, The Queen, The Last King of Scotland) 2006 play of the same name, and featuring the same leads, the film portrays the events lacing the famed 1977 interviews of Richard Nixon by British talk show host David Frost. As the title indicates quite literally, it was make or break for the two - Nixon seeking to salvage his reputation and rebuild on his political career while earning dough from the same (he was offered $ 600,000 + 20 % of the profits) and Frost trying to further his career. In the lead-up to the interview, two men with contrasting personalities and world-views are portrayed in their bid to deal with the upcoming event. The paradox is summed up by a Nixon line towards the end when he asks Frost if he enjoys all those parties he gives. At Frost's yes, Nixon remarks, ""You have the gift then. Of liking people. Being liked by people. This facility. I never had it"". In etching out this contrast, the narrative avoids being primarily about Nixon in a calculative yet regretful phase. As it is, Nixon is easily the most compelling political figure of modern times and a movie that has anything to do with him will inescapably veer towards the irony of it all. With a portrayal like the one Frank Langella has fleshed out here, the other aspects of the film are very nearly overshadowed.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen as Frost is all ambition and balance. The support cast delivers (with the possible exception of a miscast Matthew Macfadyen) - Kevin Bacon does his reliable, steady-as-a-rock confidante, Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell provide the counterpoints to Frost's liberalism. Toby Jones as the enterprising agent who arranges the deal is the stand-out supporting performance. Rebecca Hall's Caroline Cushing isn't merely eye-candy, it furthers the contrast between the leads - Frost is able to juggle and balance out quite a few things at a time. Ron Howard (director) steers the film clear of the play-like feel that other films with origins in successful plays (Closer) couldn't avoid. Only later on does it develop such a feel, at a juncture where the movie depends on the tete-a-tete between Sheen and Langella. Peter Morgan may have had a lot to do with the framing of the structure of the narrative. If it is so, then his established credentials as a playwright and screenwriter have been enhanced further.<br/><br/>Peppered with wit and political satire, there is something in the fact that this film aims more at amusing than raising any serious questions about the role of media or even in portraying the Frost - Nixon interviews as watershed events in the history of media and journalism. For what Frost manages to extract from Nixon during the last bout of the interview is not so much a confession to the world but a confession to the self and Frost isn't motivated by concerns that involve filtering out the truth. In an expected turn, he comes to sympathize with the man in the spotlight and is appreciative of the mettle it takes to make an admission of guilt. This event did not open up a new means for investigative journalism and mass media to ally against corruption at the highest level; indeed, there have hardly been other coups of a similar nature since then. Howard and Morgan, knowing this, have shied away from making it out to be an epoch-making event of sorts of the last half a century. Instead we have, as mentioned earlier, a portrait of contrasts and an acknowledgement of the impressionistic role of television."
"goddardr","8","1","2","17 May 2009"," Spectacularly done - with a caveat
","Mesmerizing film on the Frost/Nixon interviews that electrified the public after several torturous years with Watergate news articles, hearings, and eventual first resignation of an American president. This movie is a documentary style work involving how the interviews came about and the people involved on the two teams; Frost and his producer, researchers, and girlfriend on one side with Nixon, his staff, and family on the other. It succeeds brilliantly in staying away from mimicry of the two personalities that would otherwise be impossible to convincingly duplicate with impersonation. The viewer is soon pulled away from the sense that actors Sheen (playing Frost) and Langella (playing Nixon) are not the people portrayed, but are intensely credible likenesses.<br/><br/>The film starts with a small amount of actual footage running up to the Nixon resignation and then starts to blend in the produced film sequences. The look of the film color is intentionally off-color to give it a mid-70's period film quality (overly bright and warm with some haze). Frost finds out that getting air time (re: financing) for an unpopular ex-president interview is not fruitful. But he boldly continues to stretch for that bit of fame that will take him back in the TV mainstream. Remember, this was a time that TV executives were abhorrent to the notion of paying for interviews. On the other side, Nixon was looking for a way to make a buck, so a good sized check for doing interviews by a lightweight entertainment interviewer was an attractive proposition.<br/><br/>The acting and dialog steal the show. Comparing favorably with ""Milk"", this film bubbles with timely dialog between the two lead actors. Of course, they had to be spot on in order to make it convincing and emotionally satisfying. The only part of the film I question is one of the moments leading up to the all-important Watergate interview session between Nixon and Frost when Frost is in his hotel suite. I don't want to give this pivotal moment away except that I found out later that this didn't happen. It is a riveting piece of film, but the fact that it was a fictionalized segment hurts the credibility of the film and I feel as if I was managed by the film makers. I think anyone going to see a movie based on fact should have the option of knowing if they can take the information at face value. For instance, almost all movie goers know ""The Da Vinci Code"" isn't a credible source of religious teachings, but it is still a fun movie to see as long as one doesn't use it as a basis for fact. Here, it appears almost all of the events are pretty accurate except for this one moment. For this, and this alone, I can only give it an 8 out of 10 versus a 10/10 it would otherwise deserve.<br/><br/>""Frost/Nixon"" deserves viewing for those who lived the Watergate era and those who didn't. The performances and production are a tremendous plus and the story is particularly pertinent as we are now faced with another questionable presidency for the past eight years showing how a president can choose to impart his will beyond his constitutional powers for the things he believes is right. History repeats itself again."

Their battle of wits electrified an eager nation, that would have loved to kick the disliked former leader while he was down.

","Between two Dan Brown movies Ron Howard directed this strong docu-drama about one of the most controversial presidents in the American history. The interview that Richard Nixon gave to the British talk-shows host David Frost in 1977 was seen by Nixon as a means to rebuilt his public image badly damaged by the Watergate scandal. By selecting Frost a non-American and apparent outsider as a interviewer he was hoping to find a more easy or good willing partner of discussion, but he missed the fact that the born-for-TV professional also saw in this confrontation the big chance of his career. The resulting minds fight between the two is the focus of the film.<br/><br/>There is a second and also very interesting plan of discussion here. David Frost was not a political commentator, or even an investigation journalist. He was a talk shows host, and the question asked is whether entertainment television can be up for the task of catching such important moments in the life of the nation. The answer given in the film is positive, although in real life I am not sure if this great TV moment was not rather the exception than the rule.<br/><br/>As in other films of his Howard is great in bringing to screen the works of great and fascinating minds. He is helped here by the fabulous acting of two actors who are not stars but approach bravely the roles and gave big performances, not by trying to mimic the physical appearances of their heroes but more by focusing on their characters. Especially Frank Langella is bright in his rendition of Nixon, a role previously played by Anhony Hopkins in the 1995 biographical film. Langella's Nixon is less brutal and more complex and sophisticated than Hopkins made him on screen, he is a great conservative communicator, a Reagan avant-la-lettre. His human dimension as well as the limitations due to his conservative approach to life and policies show obviously. At least on screen thanks to Langella's performance Nixon's image seems somehow rehabilitated."

Nixon, however, is convinced that the interview is going to somehow sooth the public disdain that has been forced on him. An interview with Frost will simply make him appear more presidential, more confident, more qualified as a leader than ever before. After all, he's just a talk show host, right? The real story behind Frost/Nixon is not only the confrontation that eventually comes halfway through the film, but also in the way each opponent underestimates the other and starts to attack the other's vulnerability. Nixon, it appears, has no vulnerability—he's a steel wall, nothing gets past him. It's easier to see Frost as the one who needs to protect himself but that all changes. After a brilliant scene in which a drunken Nixon makes a late night phone call to Frost's hotel room, the susceptibility behind the man is finally exposed. Frost sees an opportunity to flip the interview in his favor. He's now seen that even the most impenetrable men have sensitivity and it can be brought out. Langella's Nixon is perfect. To do what he did, which was to paint Nixon in an almost pitiable light is incredible.<br/><br/>The message trying to be conveyed is how on television, it's impossible to see past the camera work and delve deep into the minds of all the people involved. Frost/Nixon is a story within a story—the story of two great minds at battle.<br/><br/>My grade: B-"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","8","1","2","14 April 2009"," Critique of journalism
","I did not see the award winning play this movie is based on so I cannot compare it to the original source. Frost/Nixon is a little slow in the beginning but once the interviews start it almost takes on the form of a boxing movie. It turns into a critique of television journalism and a character study.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen plays David Frost, a British television personality who wants to gain popularity in the United States. He is stuck hosting mediocre game shows in Australia during Nixon's resignation when an idea comes to his mind: If he could interview Nixon, it would revitalize his career. Back in the states, Richard Nixon is a broken man. The most powerful man in the world, a man who went from rags to riches, is now relegated to giving speeches at Country Clubs and writing memoirs. The whole world has reduced his entire life to the Watergate scandal. Desperate for attention, he accepts Frost's proposal for the interview, for a paycheck of $600,000, an unprecedented amount. Frost loses his backers and pays out of his own pocket. He hires two journalists to help him research the Nixon Administration, but Sam Rockwell will only work on one condition: they must give Nixon the trial he never had. Nixon must admit he committed treason. The journalists become worried when Frost does not prepare for the interview.<br/><br/>Nixon expects the first interview to go smoothly, but Frost sucker punches him by asking why he didn't burn the tapes. Frost thinks he's got Nixon in a corner, but Nixon delivers a strong comeback that ends up making him look good! The next three interviews proceed in the same fashion. I like the boxing match metaphor of the interviews. Frost's journalists are like his trainers, while Kevin Bacon is Nixon's trainer. <br/><br/>The two men are from different generations, with different tastes in just about everything, particularly fashion. Nixon thinks Frost's shoes without laces look particularly feminine. Deeply entrenched in a competition that could make or break their careers, Frost and Nixon learn they have more in common than they think. Both men have fallen from grace so to speak, and they yearn to be on top again. They develop a certain respect for each other. Their relationship is not entirely accurate; Nixon makes a very personal phone call to Frost while drunk which did not happen in reality.<br/><br/>In the last interview Frost succeeds for the first time. He pummels Nixon with Watergate questions and corners him. Nixon's admission of guilt is quite general and not the knockout blow they wanted, however. Frost/Nixon becomes more than just a competition between two men; it is a powerful critique of television journalism and how it reduces people to sound bites. The only clips from the interviews that received a significant amount of exposure dealt with Watergate. People would only remember the former President saying ""If the President does it, it's not illegal."" Journalism is entertainment now.<br/><br/>I think Michael Sheen gives the better performance here. Frank Langella is a good Nixon, but I think his Nixon voice distracted me somewhat. Frost/Nixon is a good commentary on journalism today bolstered by good performances all around. It's not quite as good as Milk though, the other 2008 film about a famous politician."
"erik-welin","8","1","2","12 April 2009"," Intelligent film featuring great acting and a fascinating portrayal of one of the most controversial political figures of our time
","Being far too young to have experienced this apparently historic interview live on television, or to know much about the Nixon-years in general, one might conclude that my knowledge of the event itself as well as the character of the notorious Richard Nixon was close to zero before seeing the film. But even though the real Richard Nixon remains outside my grasp, I have much to say about Langella's Nixon, who without any doubt is the center and primary attraction of this remarkable film. <br/><br/>The first thing that struck me was how incredibly likable Nixon the person is portrayed in the opening of the film, with his garrulousness and irresistible down-to-earth charms. The same reaction seems to be drawn from Sheen's character when the two first meet at the former president's home early in the film. As the film progresses, however, it becomes fairly clear that Nixon is really running game on Mr Frost as well as the audience, and that his affable demeanor - to a very large extent - is really a performance. So as for the interview, what explicitly starts out as a friendly chit-chat between two new found pals, eventuates in what it implicitly always was: a fierce no holds barred battle for survival between two former public stars. <br/><br/>So, once the interview is commenced, the intelligence, fierceness and persuasiveness of Nixon is divulged - something that before had remained hidden behind his tongue-in-cheek charms. Frost and his collaborators are forced to realize that they have underestimated the capacity of the former President and an intense behind-the-scenes battle begins. The psychological game between the two camps, together with the stunning performance from Langella, are indeed the feast of this film. <br/><br/>A small glimpse of the Nixon behind the political game-runner is, nonetheless, offered the audience. When an inebriated Nixon calls Mr Frost in the middle of the night, he reveals a resentful and ambitious careerist who is willing to to anything to get back in the political limelight. Still, even at this moment, Langella manages not to demonize Nixon, but succeeds in maintaining the former President's likability - with his charms and capacity to show genuine empathy for his adversary remaining intact. <br/><br/>All in all, the film is one of the best features I have seen this year, with its original and intelligent script, and overall superb acting (Rockwell and Platt being the two other stars here). This film is a must see!"
"wliia","9","1","2","21 February 2009"," A very interesting look at political history
","Very rarely do I see a drama film, because I'm more into comedy films like Robin Hood: Men in Tights and Airplane, but this film really surprised me.<br/><br/>It's kinda like one of my favourite Australian films, The Night We Called It a Day, in that we have America and another country clashing with each other. In the case of Frost/Nixon, it's America and Britain as David Frost prepares to interview former US president Richard Nixon, in what would be history in the making.<br/><br/>Frank and Michael are really great in their roles, and this film is very deserving of its Oscars it's nominated for. It features great camera work and wonderful dialogue from Peter Morgan, the writer of The Queen and the stage play that this film is based on.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who's interested in political history, or who wants to see Richard Nixon's final defeat from David Frost via the interviews done in a really great way (the film is directed by Ron Howard).<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way (and this is my Australian self saying this!), I love how they got to mention David Frost's time in Australia!"
"DonFishies","8","1","2","21 February 2009"," Langella is astonishing in this fascinating film
","After resigning the Presidency, Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) lived a life of silence. He never spoke about his misdeeds, and he seemed to want to just leave the life behind. Enter David Frost (Michael Sheen), a British talk show host who botched his job in the US and is now syndicated in Australia. He gets the great idea to interview Nixon about his life and the scandals that plagued his presidency. But no one really wants to go for it. But Frost never loses hope, and eventually the interviews are set.<br/><br/>The entirety of the film is a mix of fact and fiction-style storytelling leading up, obviously, to the legendary interviews between Nixon and Frost. But even if part of it never actually happened, there is still some rather fascinating film-making going on here.<br/><br/>I am not usually a fan of Ron Howard, but coupled with Peter Morgan (who also made a very interesting story out of The Queen a few years ago), he is practically on fire. Here is a movie that could have just been a biographical-esquire piece laced with boring, uninteresting Oscar-baiting material. But instead, it makes even the tiniest of details seem important and worthwhile. From courting Nixon to researching material to coax answers out of the man, Howard and Morgan have crafted something surprisingly well done and all the more relevant for the times (as another disgraced President was in the process of leaving at the time of the film's release).<br/><br/>The filmmakers seem to have an eye for detail, and every costume and set looks straight out of the 1970's. Even for someone who was not even alive at that point in history, looking at the sheer production design of the picture is a clear mark of accuracy. The harsh and minimalist style lighting make the film look like it was even made at that time, instead of in 2008. The immense amount of smoking done by characters is also a nice touch, and hearkens back to the days of All the President's Men, and puts it right firmly beside it as a piece of historical fiction.<br/><br/>Sadly, the film follows the historical fiction genre a little too close, and frequently drags itself out longer than it needs to. I was interested throughout the film, but felt it frequently drifted away from its point. If it stayed on course throughout, I think it could have been a real candidate in the big race, as opposed to being merely a good film.<br/><br/>Although it is not entirely unique, the film loops in character testimonials every few scenes to help accentuate both the bit players in the film, and help with the historical accuracy. It almost makes the film transcend its status of merely being a dramatization with a heavy amount of fictional elements, to being a full blown recreation of the actual events. Again, it makes the film feel authentic, and gives it a documentary style feel, almost like the camera is an unacknowledged film-making team keeping an eye on both camps in order to make a film like this years later.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are given quite a bit to do, but never get any real time focused on them. But with the small amount they do get, they help complement the film in a way that would have made the film far too boring if it was a two-man show. Matthew Macfadyen, Oliver Platt and especially Sam Rockwell are excellent in their roles as Frost's researchers. Macfadyen continues to prove why he should be miles further ahead in his Hollywood career, and Platt was as good as he was here. Rockwell, a heavily underrated actor, gives a flavor to his performance that makes it distinctively unique. Coupled along with his raucous performance in Choke, he is slowly on his way to making a stronger name for himself. I can only hope he is up at the Oscars with a nomination in a few years. Being an almost totally obscure character actor can only work for someone this good for so long.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Nixon's side gets very little material between them, other than the blink and you will miss it performance by the always reliable Toby Jones, and from Kevin Bacon. Yes, Bacon is the punchline of a lot of jokes (and even has that incredibly amusing ""Six Degrees"" game basically dedicated to him), but he is rather slowly making his rounds into becoming a great actor. It took a long time, but with his small role here, he seems to be on to something. Just watching him emote in his small amount of scenes is just great.<br/><br/>Of course, the heavy hitters are the best thing about the movie.<br/><br/>Langella's portrayal of Nixon is just astonishing. He has the man down to the most minute of details, and watching him recreate Nixon's history making scenes is downright chilling. He is that close to the man in his performance. Yes, he may still look like Frank Langella under the makeup (and is evidently taller too), but it would be very hard to tell the man apart from the real thing if he was still living. If Sean Penn and Mickey Rourke were not already battling it out, Langella would have been the obvious Best Actor of the year.<br/><br/>Sheen unfortunately, has to compensate for how towering Langella is in his performance. He does a fabulous job playing the man who is trying to measure up to greatness, but he looks visually like he is putting in too much effort. It looks like it will be a running schtick for him (as he was the same in The Queen), but he makes the most of it anyway, and delivers a wonderful performance, miles ahead of everyone else.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is a good and fascinating film, but it could have been stronger. Langella's performance is nothing short of astonishing.<br/><br/>8/10."
"turk_rooster","9","1","2","21 February 2009"," Mother of Interviews
","In an amazing character portrait, director Ron Howard (The Da Vinci Code, A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man, Apollo 13) pits the dilettante-ish English talk show host David Frost (Martin Sheen) with all his charm and naivete and susceptibility to ""mind games"", against the redoubtable Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) whose pugnacious redoubtable personality was bruised but not beaten by the experience that was Watergate, in Frost Nixon. The clash of unequals is not concluded by any unexpected victory in favor of Frost  it is perhaps more of a case of the former president clearing a heavy conscience, going through a televised catharsis for all to see. Yes, as the movie mentions, television simplifies, and a single shot becomes the summary statement on a complex and difficult presidential tenure. Witness today's reality shows the need to capture that defining moment that woos audiences and ""sums it all up"", while completely missing the undertones, the buildup and the complexities therein. And it takes a brilliant performance by Frank Langella to show us just how acute those nuances can be."

","If anyone were to do justice to a role that deserves justice done to it its Frank Langella as Richard Nixon. There isn't a second in the gorgeously crafted film that he loses focus and while he doesn't look like the man himself to a degree he certainly embodies the character, as does the supporting cast. Michael Sheen flawless and the self obsessed talk show host attempting to exonerate Nixon. The real triumph however comes in the form of the direction. Ron Howard has undoubtedly brought his a game to this. There isn't a moment of boredom simply because of the fact that its films as such a quick pace it feels impossible to reach that level of boredom.<br/><br/>The reason this film works so effortlessly as it does is due to the fact that, unlike many other historical dramas, it doesn't feel like a history lesson. Anyone with a pet peeve for this sort of historical account will still find enjoyment in Frost/Nixon because it's just so goddamn entertaining, with a pacing to rival any Rocky movie.<br/><br/>The director Ron Howard shoots his movie with such an energy and such resemblance to, as I said before, a boxing match that it's no wonder this is one of the front runners at this years Oscars. It may climax like a Rocky film, but doesn't end like one. There are more words to be said, and you're glad for every one.<br/><br/>Hollywood heavyweight Ron Howard adapts playwright Peter Morgan's West End hit for the silver screen with this feature focusing on the 1977 television interviews between journalist David Frost (Michael Sheen) and former president Richard Nixon (Frank Langella). At the time Nixon sat down with Frost to discuss the sordid details that ultimately derailed his presidency, it had been three years since the former commander in chief had been forced out of office. The Watergate scandal was still fresh in everyone's minds, and Nixon had remained notoriously tight-lipped until he agreed to sit down with Frost. Nixon was certain that he could hold his own opposite the up-and-coming British broadcaster, and even Frost's own people weren't quite sure their boss was ready for such a high-profile interview.<br/><br/>When the interview ultimately got under way and each man eschewed the typical posturing in favor of the simple truth, fans and critics on both sides were stunned by what they witnessed. Instead of Nixon stonewalling the interviewer as expected, or Frost lobbing softballs as the truth-seekers feared, what emerged was an unguardedly honest exchange between a man who had lost everything and another with everything to gain. In this film, viewers are treated to not only a recreation of that landmark interview, but a behind-the-scenes look at the power struggles that led up to it as well. Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, and Brian Grazer team to produce a film adapted for the screen by original play author Morgan (The Queen and The Last King of Scotland).<br/><br/>It sounds like an awful night out in the cinema. But you will be amazed. In Frost/Nixon Ron Howard turns this duel between Michael Sheen's glossy playboy and Frank Langella's shifty ex-President into a gripping tango of egos. The two-hour plus running time zooms by as the so-called ""thinking man's Rocky"" plays like an intellectual boxing match with Nixon effortlessly dodging Frost's hesitant jabs and the young challenger looking like he won't last the distance.<br/><br/>Verdict: Thought Ron Howard was going to stuff it up? Think again - Frost/Nixon's a great advert for stage-to-screen adaptations. And if you'd forgotten the power of the close-up, prepare to be dazzled by dapper Dave and Tricky Dick. For my overall rating I give ""Frost/Nixon"" 4/5."
"amitaishwaryajogi","8","1","2","18 February 2009"," It's in the Eyes, really
","You don't have to look like Nixon to portray him. That point was already proved by Sir Anthony Hopkin's in Oliver Stone's film of the same name. But while Mr. Stone's film was a biopic, this one focuses on only one- and also, what would become the last- public chapter in the disgraced president's life. <br/><br/>In that sense, Frank Langella's role is far more difficult: he had to convey the entire meaning of a man's life sitting at an interview, and using nothing more than words and- this, I believe, is the key to understanding his performance- expressions, in particular, the way he uses his eyes. No, he doesn't cry or stare; he doesn't even look away; what he does is that he doesn't look at you. And that's telling a lot about the man he portrays. <br/><br/>In the famous interviews, Mr. Langella's verbal evasiveness just doesn't sync with what his eyes are screaming aloud. David Frost, it would seem, already had his confession long before President Nixon uttered those famous lines; long before the interviews started, even.<br/><br/>I guess Frost's real brilliance lay in realizing this before anyone else- and then, risking everything he had to get the interviews. In making this aspect clear, Ron Howard's film makes a contribution no history book or archival footage possibly can. Nixon's confession wasn't redemptive for the American nation only; more importantly, it was an act of self-redemption for the man who made it.<br/><br/>Langella/Nixon doesn't admit this, but we can read it very clearly in his eyes."
"varundelpiero","9","1","2","17 February 2009"," Technically superb dramatisation of one of the most important events in American Presidential History...
","Most people are familiar with the term 'Watergate'; it is indelibly etched in most Americans' minds, and any political wrongdoing/scandal is almost immediately given the suffix, '-gate'. A film of this importance, documenting the highly influential Nixon/Frost interviews following Nixon's resignation from High Office, needed to be helmed by a director of Ron Howard's experience. Howard arguably tends to be a bit manipulative and compulsive at times, and a few of his traits are seen here, but in small doses. However, the script is intelligent and compelling, and its brilliance makes this film worthy of viewing. Note that this is by no means a hard-and-fast documentary, as many liberties are taken with some dialogue/events. Nonetheless, the facts are presented as accurately as possible, and one will learn a thing or two from this intriguing film.<br/><br/>The cast is superb, and it is this brilliant casting that makes the film work. Michael Sheen (best known for playing Tony Blair in THE QUEEN) is quite impressive as David Frost. Frank Langella is simply outstanding as Nixon; he takes while to develop this influential and difficult character, but by the time the interviews get rolling, he almost becomes Richard Nixon. The synergy between the main characters plays out like a chess match, or a boxing match, with each character countering the other's moves. The interaction is technically superb and really accelerates this film into greatness. The rest of the cast is above adequate, with Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, and Sam Rockwell playing memorable roles.<br/><br/>FROST/NIXON's nomination for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Lead Actor (Frank Langella) are well-deserved. 9/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 176. Unreservedly recommended."

","I went to see this movie based on the reviews and the people involved (star and director) but after watching it I realize the subject matter is the least relevant thing about it. Simply put, this is a terrific character study that just happens to be about a former president and a celebrity interviewer, very much unlike, say, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BEJAMIN BUTTON which is all about its subject matter and a screenplay that's about nothing. I would have never imagined a portion of David Frost's life would make a worthwhile movie but the sections of this movie dedicated solely to him are just as interesting as Nixon's even though Michael Sheen sounds just like Austin Powers. In conclusion, this is a must see film even if neither Frost not Nixon sound like a couple of people you'd care to spend a couple of hours watching."

","Richard Nixon is perhaps the simplest or most difficult President to analyze. That is one of the reasons why his presidency has been constantly disputed and reviewed with plays, films and operas about the man.<br/><br/>But seldom has there been an occasion where people are drawn to see Nixon after his Presidency. The premise of this film is the disgraced President going to ""duel"" with a long shot talkshow host named David Frost in a series of interviews. I personally was more drawn to the film in learning how a man like David Frost could gain the courage and strength to interview the President of the United States.<br/><br/>The film is delivered as a tastefully done biopic taking the story from both stories with Frost putting all he has on the line in the interviews and Nixon trying to regain his tarnished legacy. Both of the actors play their characters very well nearly capturing the key aspects of them. Langella matches the deep voice and muttering of Nixon very well and Sheen nearly matches Frost's appearance and looks.<br/><br/>The film is an excellent duel of words and shows raw emotion of the President and a talk show host."

","In 1974, President Richard Nixon resigned for suspicion of his involvement with Watergate. Soon after, T.V. personality David Frost decides, seemingly out of thin air, that he would like to interview the ex-president. It goes without saying that things get interesting, or at least I hoped they would. Ron Howard may not be the most celebrated director currently working today, but he does deserve some credit for flatteringly capturing this project. Give him something like 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas', you know he'll f_ck that up. Give him 'Frost/Nixon' and he'll fit right in.<br/><br/>Most of the actors here did a fine job. Michael Sheen was alright as David Frost. Nothing exceptional, but serviceable. The supporting cast was all very good as well, with Kevin Bacon (stepping out of the spotlight for a little), Toby Jones, and Sam Rockwell. Frank Langella I did have a problem with, however. Maybe it's just me, but his performance as Nixon appeared forced. It wasn't very convincing at all and the film suffered for it.<br/><br/>'Frost/Nixon' does take its good old time getting to the interviews, which are indeed the highlight of this film. We spend almost an hour of plot and character development before anything of interest happens. At first, Nixon rambles and wastes time (like I do with these reviews). But it's when Frost fights back when things really get interesting. But by that time, I don't expect many people will care anymore. I barely did.<br/><br/>Like Nixon starting the interview, 'Frost/Nixon' spends way too much time on useless information that means nothing to the film as a whole. Perhaps, a little more time spent with the tenser parts of the interviews and less exposition would have benefited this film a great deal. There is a certain level of enjoyment to be found in 'Frost/Nixon', just not nearly enough for a recommendation. As it stands, the film spent too much time leading up to the interviews that when we finally got there, it was too little too late. There's just nothing special here. The directing is plain, the actors seem rather bored to be honest, and the script just appears more interested the journey rather than the destination."
"DexterManning","6","2","7","31 January 2009"," Frost/Nixon: A Review.
","Though far from being one of the defining films of the president at its center, ""Frost/Nixon"" is an interesting-enough take on his famous post-resignation interviews in an era when Americans were disenchanted with the office of their president, though it follows the typical formula of its director.<br/><br/>Although ""Frost/Nixon,"" the new movie from director Ron Howard, is presaged on Richard Nixon, the United States president who resigned from office in disgrace, and his series of interviews in 1977 with the British television talk show host David Frost, it is more about people working to overcome the odds and obstacles they face in order to prevail when most other people expected otherwise. In other words, it basically follows the typical Ron Howard formula, like ""Apollo 13"" and ""Cinderella Man."" This is not to diminish the premise of the film in any way, as it remains an intriguing one, nonetheless, despite the foregone conclusions of those who are familiar with Howard's other work. The second major political docudrama set in the 1970s to premiere in US theaters in about as many weeks (after ""Milk"") ""Frost/Nixon"" has been given the visual appearance of a somewhat a downbeat documentary, with its frequently muted colors and dim lighting, by cinematographer Salvatore Totino, as well as a light, often comical, though not always appropriate, feel by writer Peter Morgan. The various key players from both sidesexcept the two in the title roleseach appear in their own little ""interviews"" talking about their recollections concerning the main topic at hand and, in so doing, providing a narrative context of sorts (a device loosely similar to that employed by ""Milk"").<br/><br/>The picture is at its most riveting when it shows the destruction of such a man during the interviews by Frost, who was widely considered unqualified for the task of doing just that. Nixon, who held the most prominent and powerful job in the world, who finally forced to admit to himself, through Frost's interviews, that much of his presidency, and himself, is a sham, that his legacy will reflect as such for all future generations in the US, and that he will have to live with it for the rest of his life. That is, by far, the most interesting part of the movie.<br/><br/>Yet, only a relatively small portion, the last half-hour of a feature with a running time four times that length, is devoted to it. The remainder concerns itself, essentially, with David Frost's underestimation of his subject and his failings as a serious journalist. Frost, incarnated by Michael Sheen (also reprising his Broadway stage role), is a talk show playboy who is very nearly the definition of carefree and flamboyant. But he is also ambitious and, ultimately, determined. This is a man who seeks a seven-part television interview with Richard Nixon, despite not having what most journalists and broadcasters would consider the right credentials, and attains it. That, however, is only the start of the battle toward realizing his goal, as he must find financing to actually produce the series of episodes, financing that remains elusive even during the actual taping. Then, there's the small matter that Frost has no clue how to handle an interviewee as shrewd and manipulative as ""Tricky Dick"" Nixon, who is an expert at twisting critical questions to his advantage and dominating a conversation by rambling on about the extensive small details in his considerably large memory."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In 1974, David Frost (Michael Sheen) a bright, up and coming young TV presenter, made history by arranging to interview soon to be outed President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) at an address over in the States. With his most famous achievement, a once popular game show over in Austrailia, on the brink, this interview hinged on Frost's career. But interference from hanger's on on Nixon's side and Frost's lack of bite during the interviews held things back- until the final of the interviews was held in 1977 and Frost finally backed Nixon into a corner, leading to one of the most explosive controversies of all time.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's account of the history making event when President Nixon was backed into a corner and let out the dreadful blooper: ""when the president does it it's not illegal"" doesn't seem to have attracted any bad reviews and could quite well attract some Oscar nominations. It's undeniably an ambitious, daring and provocative piece with some strong performances and it deserves a lot of it's acclaim. But it's still a film where the emphasis is on talking, and not so much action, which won't make it the most exciting of films with some.<br/><br/>But, as I say, strong performances play a big part in moving it along. Langella, who I best remember as Skeletor in Masters of the Universe, is dynamic as Nixon, catching the huff and gruff of his manner and delivery perfectly, and setting you back when he raises his voice and shouts at those around him who he thinks can see where his anger is coming from. As Frost, Sheen compliments him perfectly, as the reserved, reluctant to offend but not quite meek young reporter who has to grow and find the confidence to really take Nixon to the dogs. And what a fine supporting cast, including Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon and Mattthew Mcfadyen, who as the supporting players give the film a weird (and I'm not sure completely necessary) docu drama feel as their characters give talking head moments about what went on at various points in the film.<br/><br/>So, a well made, interesting and dynamic film but sadly, all with talk and no action. Which might just make it boring to some. ***"
"meeza","8","2","7","19 January 2009"," Read my review of 'Frost/Nixon"", I promise I am not a critic crook!
","""Frosty the Hostman was a very busy nose-body, he wanted to get the ex-Prez Nixon to confess and to come back to life some day."" Maybe that is not the ideal mature way to describe the plot of Director Ron Howard's ""Frost/Nixon"", but it does give some precise insight on the film. ""Frost/Nixon"" is based on the infamous interviews between British talk show host David Frost and former President Richard Nixon which took place a few years after Nixon's resignation due to that little water-spill people call Watergate. Veteran actor Frank Langella commands screen presence with his presidential performance as Richard Nixon, and Michael Sheen continues his steady acting play portraying influential figures caught up in government scandals with his charismatic performance as Frost. The goal of Team Frost was to get Richard Nixon to confess or as one of the Team Frost members states ""give Nixon the trial he never had"". The interviews took place in 1977 which were a couple of years after Nixon resigned. The former President was living a tranquil life with his wife during that time; but he was sickened to be held down to incongruent public speaking gigs. He wanted to be back in the limelight so he accepted Frost's offer for the interviews; and it did not matter that Nixon also got a hefty paycheck from all of this. They do not call him Tricky Dick for nothing. Team Frost consisted of Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr., two investigative reporters who were consumed and fixated on a Nixon conviction; in addition Frost's producer John Brit was also a major player in Team Frost. I especially liked Sam Rockwell's restless performance as Reston Jr. The hottest Team Frost member had to be (by a long-shot) Caroline Cushing, a nice cushy intellect beauty that Frost meets in a plane and inadvertently becomes part of ""the high mile club"", I mean part of Team Frost. The up-an-coming Rebecca Hall does some nice work here as Cushing. Speaking of fine acting and its degree, it now leads me to Kevin Bacon; his degree of acting connected again with viewers by his portrayal of Nixon aide Jack Brennan. The set of interviews which took place between Frost and Nixon never did reveal an actual confession from Nixon, but there were definitely physical and verbal signs of lifelong regret from Richie Rich. Tricky Dick did shoot a few verbal jabs at Frost during the first interview, but then Frost kept his cool and made a nice comeback during the latter interviews. What caused Frost to power up? Was it verbal steroids? Was it verbal sabotage or blackmail? Watch the movie and you will find out. Screenwriter Peter Morgan and Director Ron Howard proved they can ""talk the talk and walk the walk"" within their praiseworthy film-making exertion in devising the realistic Frost/Nixon interview scenes of the film. I also liked how Howard carried the film into other areas as in the media's inner workings, the fixation to protect superiors at all costs, and how insignificant daily rituals can have mammoth impacts. ""Frost/Nixon"" did drag at times but the man Nixon himself was also a bit of a drag. ""Frost/Nixon"" does not get my vote as the best film of the year, but is one you should not resign yourself from viewing. **** Good"

","Why this movie is worth watching? A few reasons can attract a person like me. a) it is up for award consideration. b) Has a director of brilliant movies such as beautiful mind or Cinderella. c) is depicting a real person. Apart from attracting a person to watch a movie, there is a question: how to keep him interested in watching movie through. Frost/Nixon has an amazing duel between to giants - politic giant and performing giant. Those together impress the audience. Movie is involving, loud, and thoughtful. The guy who played Nixon and the dude who was Frost did brilliant job. No complains on them. Sweating looked real, movie seems real and good. Maybe it will grab an award or two of some sort this or next year."
"QTarantino-Fan","9","1","3","3 January 2010"," Great performance of Frank Langella
","First I have to say that i'm a German and way too young to have seen the interviews, which means that I didn't had a good knowing of the historical circumstances. Nevertheless I really enjoyed the movie, which describes the interviews between British talk show-master David Frost and former US-President Richard Nixon in 1977 and the events which eventually led to these interviews. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie is without question Frank Langella's performance as Richard Nixon. As Nixon he is unbelievable convincing and even resembles him physically in a striking way. He really gives you a good idea how Nixon was, even if you don't know much about him. Another plus-factor is that Langella doesn't act too over the top as Nixon. He really embodies Nixon and isn't some flat caricature of him. On the other side there's Martin Sheen's Frost. Don't get me wrong Sheen delivers an excellent performance - perhaps the best of his career - but in contrast to Langella he just seems a little pale. Though considering that Nixon is a lot more powerful character to play it's quite understandable that Langella appears more convincing.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is well done with a good direction by Ron Howard for whom I'm glad that he doesn't only direct stuff like The Da Vinci Code etc. The pace of the movie is well executed but a little bit too conservative in terms that Howard doesn't differ from the usual story line telling formula.<br/><br/>Overall it can be said that the great performance by Langella adds real excellence to an good movie.<br/><br/>9/10 stars"

","Frost/Nixon. Amazing visually, by performance, acting and directing. Frank Langella plays the role of President Nixon [ and which he did very well],and the man who plays David frost [ forgot his name..] This movie uses the unique skill of building up for the whole 105 minutes and then releases all the excitement during the climax scene between Frost and Nixon, it never bored me, and it was a great effort of story, drama and some stunning scenes. It may be hard to understand for some people as lots of events occur during the final interview, and people may get confused on what is going on so far. But for me it was a summer winner. After watching this film, i felt more than satisfied and I'm pretty sure you will feel that way too. Just be warned it is a political film.<br/><br/>overall, it s a big winner for me. Highly recommended."
"ShadeGrenade","10","1","3","17 November 2009"," Hello Mr.President, Good Evening & Welcome!
","In 1977, David Frost's interviews with disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon attracted the highest ratings ever for an American news programme. They are regarded now as a highpoint in current affairs broadcasting.<br/><br/>It is easy to forget how ubiquitous old Frosty was then; forever jetting back and forth across the Atlantic on Concorde, hosting chat-shows here and in America. As the '70's arrived, he focused less on satirical comedy of the sort he'd made his name with ( such as 'T.W.3 ) and concentrated on 'big star' interviews. But by '77, the perception was that his career had nosedived. He then got the idea of interviewing 'Tricky Dicky', and getting him to apologise for Watergate. Frost was no stranger to slippery customers, having famously torn insurance swindler Dr.Emil Savundra to pieces back in 1967. Nixon represented the ultimate challenge. When no network agreed to pay the ex-President, Frost was forced to approach big business interests, cap in hand. The programmes went ahead.<br/><br/>From the onset, it looked as though Frost had his work cut out for him. His very first question - ""Why didn't you burn the tapes?"" - was met by a long, rambling answer that told no-one nothing. Other questions were met with similar unhelpful responses. It must have looked as though Frost was wasting his time ( and other people's money ). But then a remarkable thing happened. Frost's research uncovered new facts about Watergate; these enabled him to ask searing, probing questions which wore Nixon down and got him to speak from the heart, something no-one had previously managed to do. It was a personal triumph for Frost.<br/><br/>You would think that a film about a television interview might turn out boring, but 'Frost/Nixon' is far from that. Peter Morgan's script ( based on his play ) is literate and absorbing. Frost's verbal battles with Nixon are riveting, a meeting of powerful minds. Tremendous performances from Michael Sheen and Frank Langella. Sheen gets 'Frost' to a tee, while Langella's 'Nixon' comes over as remarkably sympathetic, outshining even Anthony Hopkins' performance in Oliver Stone's 'Nixon'. I am not a big fan of the films of Ron Howard, but was impressed greatly by this. Another amazing thing is that it makes John Birt ( the man who sacked Stanley Baxter from London Weekend Television and then crucified the B.B.C. ) seem likable!"
"BrianMemphis","6","1","3","9 November 2009"," Engaging and worth watching
","The film is framed by shots of TV cameras from Nixon's point of view - at the beginning the camera Nixon is resigning into and at the end the camera into which he apologizes. As one of the characters states, the movie is about the ""reductive power of television."" Nixon understands this, tries very hard to manipulate TV to his advantage, and fails. He's haunted by TV from his earliest debates to the very end. (Is the scene with the dog intended to further drive home this point by reminding the audience of the 'Checkers' speech?) A complete opposite approach from Nixon, Frost builds a career by embracing the shallowness of TV and is ultimately rewarded for it. Excellent performances all around, nice interplay between the two main characters over a pair of shoes. <br/><br/>The movie is probably about as exciting as it possibly can be, despite the fact that it is about a TV interview. In the end, like an old western the main characters face each other alone, with even their support teams watching from separate rooms through the filter of television. <br/><br/>Sure to attract and entertain US history buffs, the movie will inevitably be compared to 'All the President's Men' but should not be. Neither this movie nor the interviews have the same level of historical significance as the reporters uncovering the actual events. In other words, don't expect 'Frost/Nixon' to replace 'All the President's Men' in your high school history classroom anytime soon. A more apt comparison would be to the movie 'Quiz Show' - this movie feels like the 1970s in the same way 'Quiz Show' felt like the 1950s, and it attempts to add some depth to the dimensions of the characters we watch on TV. Another comparison that comes to mind is to the recent Richard Gere movie 'The Hoax' - Gere's character approaches and pushes his project with the same intensity as Frost in this film."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","3","5 March 2009"," Heavyweight, and exhilaratingly entertaining
","Watching the opening news clips is re-living the history of Watergate. Just as one of the commentaries intimated, I was glued to the TV every evening watching the judiciary investigations by the Senate Committee under Sam Ervin and Howard Baker. Subpoenas brought before the Committee the infamous four: Ehrlichman, Haldeman, Mitchell and Dean (there was even a spoof song written with the four names as title). But I stopped following the events after Nixon's resignation, and missed out on the dramatic Frost interviews. Thanks to the movie, it's better late than ever.<br/><br/>The preliminary, which occupies about a third of the 2-hour movie, is already addictively captivating. The two camps are briskly established. On Nixon's side is doggedly hard-as-steel aid Jack Brennan played by equally hard-as-steel Kevin Bacon, as well as world-wise contact man Swifty Lazar played masterfully by Toby Jones (who would have given Philip Seymour Hoffman a run for his money with his own portrayal of Capote in ""Infamous"" (2006)). In Frost's camp we first see partner-in-crime (a manner of speaking) John Birt, played effectively by Matthew Macfadyen (who played Mr Darcy in the 2005 version of ""Pride and prejudice""). Then, recruited into the team are two top-notch people: researcher James Reston Jr played by Sam Rockwell (who played Jesse James' brother Charley, in that 2007 movie with a title too long for me to repeat) and TV camera expert Bob Zelnick (played by veteran actor Oliver Platt). To add a romantic touch, playing Frost's newly-acquainted girlfriend Caroline Cushing, is beguiling Rebecca Hall (remember her award-deserving performance as Vicky in ""Vicky Christina Barcelona).<br/><br/>The heavyweights are of course Frank Langella and Michael Sheen, and this movie has indeed been likened to a heavyweight boxing championship match, by just about every critic. Frost, hitherto a successful yet never seriously recognized entertainment show host has a heavy (and reckless, claims many) financial stake in this series of interview shows as his door to fame and fortune. Nixon looks towards this as a heaven-sent opportunity to win back the support of the people, his door back into the limelight of politics which he has sorely missed. In the beginning, looking at the track record of Nixon's cunning manipulating skills, it would seem that Frost is a lightweight stepping into the ring to challenge a heavyweight. But as the bouts unfold, the story of David and Goliath gradually emerges. Nothing more needs to be said other than this is stage drama at its best (this is originally a stage play performed by the same two gentlemen).<br/><br/>Michael Sheen is excellent as David Frost, but it's Frank Langella's portrayal of Richard Nixon that deserves an Oscar, with due respect to Sean Penn."
"richard-1787","7","1","3","1 March 2009"," Better than I expected
","I haven't (yet) seen the play on which this movie is based, so I can't say whether it's faithful to it, better, worse, different, etc. All I know is the movie, which I just saw in the theater.<br/><br/>It was a little disconcerting for me at first, as I kept seeing David Frost in terms of former Prime Minister Tony Blair (because the actor who plays Frost played Blair in The Queen). That's not the movie's fault, but it definitely skewed how I first saw Frost, i.e., I didn't see him as the largely frivolous man that contemporary viewers were used to seeing - even though the movie did a good job of presenting that aspect of Frost's career at that point.<br/><br/>It also took me a little time to get used to Langella as Nixon. Because he doesn't look like Nixon, I at first saw a bad impressionist doing Nixon. Again, that wasn't the movie's fault. Langella doesn't try to do an impression of Nixon. But it took me awhile to see him as Nixon. Once my mind made that shift, my involvement very much changed.<br/><br/>For the better. This movie gets better and better as it goes on. Once it gets to the preparations for the final interview, it really becomes a first-rate movie. By the end, I was very moved. Which surprised me. I didn't feel at all sorry for Nixon, nor did I feel any great joy at Frost's eventual success. The movie doesn't try to make you cheer for the latter or weep for the former. Rather, I had a feeling of sadness at seeing what a deeply flawed person Nixon turns out to be, and the thought that such a man led our nation, and mislead it, with that flaw.<br/><br/>It's definitely a movie worth seeing. It might be better watching it at home, as the first part may not hold you and being at home would give you a chance to get up to go to the kitchen for something, etc. But once the preparation for the final interview begins, you will be happy you rented it, and won't have any desire to take a break."

"Argemaluco","10","1","3","19 February 2009"," Undoubtedly,the best film from 2008
","Although it has been acclaimed all over the world with various awards and nominations (including the one to the Oscar as Best Picture),I went to see Frost/Nixon with some doubt about its social or political relevance.After all,Richard Nixon died fifteen years ago and his life as well as the Watergate scandal have been examined on movies (from the biographical drama Nixon to the comedy Dick,without forgetting the most famous one,All the President's Men),books and television and it seems there is not too much fresh material which does not limit to recycle what we already know.But,after watching this movie,I just forgot about all the prejudices I had before watching it because Frost/Nixon is an extraordinary movie whose main point is not examining the multiple mistakes Nixon has committed,but to examine the man behind the scandal and at the same time,offering a fascinating behind-the-scenes look to the interview that,for many people,represented the judgment Nixon has never had.Frost/Nixon is based on a play written by Peter Morgan,and the author himself made an excellent adaption.Morgan did not intend to take a play to the cinema but to transform the play into a movie.In other words,Frost/Nixon never feels as a filmed play,but as a movie.Frank Langella made a magnificent work as Nixon and he completely deserves all the acclamation he has received.Michael Sheen,Oliver Platt,Sam Rockwell,Matthew Macfayden,Kevin Bacon and Toby Jones also bring excellent works because they completely become on their roles,so they never seem to be acting.Ron Howard made an extraordinary work as a director.He has an irregular career and although he is a talented director,he has shown a doubtful criterion for choosing some projects (like,for example,The Da Vinci Code and The Dissapearences).But in Frost/Nixon,Howard proves all the talent he has when he works with good material.Although the story of the film is a little bit static,Howard found the way to make it enormously entertaining,interesting and not boring at all.I honestly think Frost/Nixon is the best movie of his career.By my point of view,this is the best film from 2008 (from what I have seen).Frost/Nixon is a fascinating and magnificent movie thanks to its interesting story,brilliant performances and excellent direction.I completely recommend this movie because this is certainly cinema of the best quality."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","3","14 February 2009"," Innocence Lost
","At the telling juncture of Director Ron Howard's ""Frost/Nixon"", Michael Sheen's David Frost asks, ""Are you saying that the President can do something illegal?"" Frank Langella's Richard Nixon emphatically replies, ""I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal!"" Powerful scene. Power corrupts, absolutely. Frank Langella is amazing as former President Nixonhis nomination is so deserved.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is at the top of his game; telling the story of 1977 David Frost interviews with former President Richard Nixon, forced to resign the Presidency following the Watergate scandal from the screenplay and play by Peter Morgan. I had watched the Frost/ Nixon interviews as teen, but their significance escaped me at the time. ""Frost/Nixon"" is solid story telling. The performances by Michael Sheen as David Frost and Langella as Nixon are stellar. However, as well crafted and expertly told by Howard, ""Frost/Nixon"" is very linear in naturegranted this is historical. And the story arc catharsis is the possibility of compassion for Nixon as a man, who sold out on his beliefs and his very soul.<br/><br/>What Howard and Morgan do poignantly is depict Nixon as not an evil man, rather a tragic man, who was so blinded by his power. I think that is really closer to what was so. There is a surprisingly touching scene where empathetic Frost (Sheen) asks whether Nixon realizes that he has ""done something that will haunt you for the rest of your life"" The resolute Nixon says, ""I let the American people down"" <br/><br/>Although story and dramatic arc are linear in nature, my bud John pointed out that ""Frost/Nixon"" like the actual interviews themselves captures the tragic loss of innocence of our nation. The Nixon impeachment and resignation indelibly punctuated the end of ""Camelot"". And perhaps, the nation never recovered from this loss of innocence. This is strangely relevant today, as we question the use of absolute power even under the noblest intentions. In retrospect Ron Howard has done amazing, and culturally important work here.<br/><br/>The performances are great throughout. Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell are solid as Frost's research staff, Bob Zelnick and James Reston. Rebecca Hall is enchanting as Caroline Cushing as the right girlfriend at the right time. Matthew Macfadyen is compassionate and strong as Frost's conscience and producer John Birt. Michael Sheen is amazing. David Frost was almost a glorified game show-like talk show host, whose final redemption was the Nixon interviews. Sheen is charming and light, and hints at the underlying power that will arise above the superfluous, and embrace greatness. Kevin Bacon is awesome as Nixon loyal Jack Brennen. Langella defines ""Frost/Nixon"". He is such a powerful actor and presence. Here he is Macbeth. His is never a caricature of Nixon, instead a sad and tragic man who finally gets his place in history. And it haunted him for the rest of his days. ""Frost/Nixon"" is tragic, sad, and so compelling."

"mgayles2005","8","1","3","29 January 2009"," In the tenth round,,,Nixon goes down....
","""Frost/Nixon"" could be thought of as a heavy weight boxing match: A political version of Tyson's loss to Buster Douglas. Both Nixon and Frost enter the fight for personal reasons, Nixon attempts to repair his shattered post Watergate image, and Frost attempts to make a name for him self. While ""Frost/Nixon"" is being sold as an intense political thriller, it's no more dramatic then the interviews it's based on. It recreates them with astonishing accuracy. That's not saying the movie isn't good. It's fascinating, but far from nail biting.<br/><br/>""Frost/Nixon"" is an actor's movie. Ron Howard places the camera on his two stars, Michael Sheen and Frank Langella and lets them go at it. Langella's performance is transcendent. Not knowing what Langella looks like helps the experience. At first his slouching posture and thick Nixon accent become distracting. After being absorbed into the movie I was convinced that he really was Nixon.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. He was great as Tony Blair, supporting Hellen Mirren to an Oscar victory. This time he's supported Langella to a best actor nomination. Maybe Sheen will be considered sooner or later. Sometimes it takes two or three snubs to finally get the Academy's approval.<br/><br/>Neither Frost nor Nixon know what they're getting into. Frost doesn't expects Nixon's bullying tactics. Nixon throws him off only seconds before the interview shoots by commenting on his shoes and asking him personal questions about his sex life. Nixon doesn't expect Frost to fight back. At first Nixon is dominant until the final moments of the interview, where Frost grows a spine and drills Nixon with the tough questions everyone in the world wanted to ask Nixon.<br/><br/>Ron Howard made this film based on a fantasy of what any one would want to do to Bush: ask him the tough questions he would never want to answer. While Bush may have been the worst president of our time, even he is smart enough not to fall into a trap set by a blood thirsty journalist. Did you see the last television appearances the 43rd president made? He lied as if he wasn't there. If Frost/Bush were made I would gladly see it, but as I said before, that's just a fantasy."
"gary-444","7","1","3","29 January 2009"," A Moment in Time Captured
","There is a paradox central to this film. The Frost/Nixon interviews were recorded over several hours, yet they are only remembered for a few minutes. Yet the running time of the film is around two hours, so what do you do with the rest of the film? There are two audiences to play to. The first, of whom I am one, are old enough to recall ""the real thing"", and will see it as Drama AND history. Those too young will see it primarily as Drama.It is too fleeting in its treatment of Nixon to be called a Biography. As a snapshot of ""those moments"" it is very good. But in order to understand the significance of those moments requires a remit way beyond what the film could hope to achieve. Indeed Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" needed 3 and a quarter hours, and ""All The presidents Men"" needed two hours twenty minutes on Watergate alone! Inevitably it fails in this regard, and as a result much of the true drama of the occasion is lost.<br/><br/>The credentials of Screenplay writer, Peter Morgan, are peerless. ""Last King Of Scotland"", ""The Queen"" and ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" all demonstrate an ability to write about those at the seat of power. Michael Sheen plays an impish Frost, Frank Langella is a compelling, truculent , imposing Nixon, Kevin Bacon gives an impressively restrained performance as aide Jack Brennan, and Rebecca Hall as Frost's girlfriend Caroline Cushing has great legs.<br/><br/>Frost was closely involved in this project and comes out of it as clean as a whistle, portrayed as a raffish ,intelligent , go getting bon viveur, whose career defining gamble pays off. Nixon is not shown unsympathetically, but the caricature of him as a clever bully who thinks he can outwit a lightweight English Talk Show Host, and fails is too simplistic.<br/><br/>There are some wonderful vignettes, presumably true. Nixon asks Frost whether he had done any ""Fornicating"" the night before  just before they start recording, and makes a soul  baring late night call to Frost, which he subsequently fails to recall. Frost makes a gift of a pair of stylish Italian slip on shoes to Nixon as a parting gift  a style which Nixon had queried Brennan on as to whether they were ""too effeminate?"".<br/><br/>A stylish, entertaining, erudite script, is head and shoulders above the lamentably banal fare trotted out by much of Hollywood these days. Unsurprisingly, a single writer provides a cohesion and consistency of vision which multiple screenwriters so rarely deliver. Yet ultimately it is not quite enough. As a tale about a drama, it is fine, as a drama itself it does not quite find the angle to carry it off."

","Its been sometime since I saw a film which completely works as a piece of cinema. More than just a few good performances, there is a direction and a story fully told. Basic elements maybe, but oddly missing in much output of the last year or so.<br/><br/>One thing that made this film click was the realisation that power and success are circumstantial and not elements of fate. No conspiracy theory is needed here.<br/><br/>We see Nixon, a president whose power was only vaguely contained by American law, on the crossroads between greatness and delusion. Nixon's lack of personal warmth was a disaster in the TV age - more so than his conditional morality.<br/><br/>And we see the lightly talented David Frost succeed because he didn't appear to Nixon as a likely enemy. That Sheen plays Frost a little Blair like is probably no accident.<br/><br/>The film keeps a respectful distance between the political elements. The liberals are seen as worthy, but blinkered - the right as smug but defencive. This allows the two protagonists space to fill the film. And from that flows the humour, tension and entertainment."
"Terrell-4","8","1","3","4 January 2009"," Clever entertainment, with one of those wonderful, political non-apologetic apologies for a climax
","Entertainment, it is; history, it's not. David Frost, if he doesn't hate Michael Sheen's amusing parody of himself, should. Sheen's Frost is a young man in love with the excitement and high life of being a television celebrity, as eager and quick as a chipmunk and as shallow as a plate. The portrayal of Richard Nixon, however, is misleading. For the purposes of a cathartic audience conclusion, Ron Howard (the director), Peter Morgan (the playwright) and Frank Langella, (the actor, in an amazing performance) lead us up to an emotional climax which is played for something that looks like Shakespearean tragedy...a great man, torn by internal conflicts, finally brought down (on television yet) by the recognition of his own deep flaws. Well, come on. This certainly makes a surprisingly effective movie, but Richard Nixon is a more suitable study for students of morbid psychology and for those who appreciate the hypocrisy of self-serving politicians. Nixon was no Greek protagonist, just a hard-working, deeply insecure, ferociously ambitious man who was willing to do whatever was needed to defeat those he thought of as his enemies and to prove to the world he was a worthy man. This is the mediocrity of loveless ambition matched with lots of Scotch, not the tragedy of self-inflicted wounds in a noble cause. <br/><br/>Howard and Morgan allow one of those political non-apologies to pass as revelation. ""I let down the American people,"" not ""I created the climate that led to the crime of a burglary, and then I initiated and took part in the cover-up...and I was wrong."" As much to the point as anything, Howard and Morgan give us such an old-fox portrayal of slyness and one-upmanship, which confounds Frost's young puppy, that most of us probably wind up routing for Nixon. All this works dramatically, of course, when the puppy finally grows some teeth...but then we're merely left with that masterful non-apology and a moment of supremely effective acting by Frank Langella. The only part of Frost/Nixon that brings into focus the real-life ruthless danger of a man like Nixon in the presidency is the moment when Frost teases out of Nixon the ex-president's belief that whatever a president does is always legal because it is the president who does it. We know (and should be scared to death) that there are political lawyers and ambitious political hacks who agree. That moment, for anyone who values the Constitution and those strangely effective concepts of the separation of power and the rule of law, was, in my view, passed over too lightly. <br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is a fascinating and enjoyable bit of movie entertainment based on a fascinating and enjoyable stage play. It's expecting too much to think it would be more than that. <br/><br/>For those who might be interested in another portrayal of Nixon, this time alone in his study, deep in Scotch and self-pity, talking into a recorder while he justifies his life, watch Robert Altman's, Donald Freed's and Arnold Stone's Secret Honor. Philip Baker Hall as Nixon is mesmerizing."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Film interpretation of the play starring the same two leads, standout director Ron Howard evidently demanded Mr. Langella and Mr. Sheen be cast in their stage roles. What a simple and brilliant decision ... these two are captivating.<br/><br/>Peter Morgan is the playwright and also wrote the screenplay, so the key players were intimately familiar and engaged in the material. Nowhere is that more evident than the ferocious performance of Frank Langella as former President Nixon. Langella's performance reminds of Forrest Whitaker as Idi Amin in ""Last King of Scotland"" (not coincidentally penned by Mr. Morgan). The nuances of his performance are fascinating and can only be appreciated through multiple viewings. His gait, mannerisms, voice and expressions capture the ego, power and vulnerability of this man.<br/><br/>Overshadowed by Langella's performance, Michael Sheen does an outstanding job as David Frost, the performer/interviewer that really just jumped into this thing for ratings. The importance of the event did not hit him until much later. Sheen is best known for his stellar work as Tony Blair in ""The Queen"" (also written by Peter Morgan), but I believe this may even be better.<br/><br/>Strong support work from the cast of Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Mattew McFayden, Toby Jones as super-agent Swifty Lazar and Rebecca Hall (most recent of ""Vicki Cristina Barcelona""). Nice to see Mr. Howard cast his brother Clint and father Rance again. Something cool about the family togetherness.<br/><br/>While the film really makes me want to re-visit the original interviews from 1977, it makes me a bit sad that Gen X and Gen Y'ers probably don't understand the lasting impact Nixon and Watergate and the interviews have had on political reporting in general and politicians in general. Here we get a glimpse of the megalomania that goes along with a lifelong dream of becoming President of the United States. While there is certainly differences in perception of each of the men who have held office, there is unquestionably a driving force of power that motivates them. Howard and his fellow project players do a nice job of capturing that."

","As powerful of a performance from Frank Langella (I can see him accepting an Oscar, though I still hope it goes to Sean Penn for 'Milk') as Richard M. Nixon in 'Frost/Nixon,' one must not forget Michael Sheen's almost equally commanding portrayal of David Frost. It was suspenseful at times (admittedly, I have little background knowledge on the whole Watergate scandal, as I had little to go on with Ron Howard's other films: 'Apollo 13' and 'A Beautiful Mind'), had some punch in the dialogue, and a great score. I've heard the interviews were switched around for dramatic effect, and though disappointing, I understand how film (usually) has to have climaxes. That being said, already self-stated ignorance of the controversy, and as in the case with 'Apollo 13,' it was fairly predictable towards the end. But the good completely outweighs the bad, and the movie as good as it was, should be, at very least, viewed for Langella and Sheen's mesmerizing performances."
"PWNYCNY","9","1","3","27 December 2008"," For $600,000 a politician might say just about anything.
","Imagine this scene. You're in a theater, the lights are dimming, the curtain is rising, the spotlight brightens the center of the stage and into that bright spotlight enters ... Richard M. Nixon. Then the spotlight widens and reveals another man, David Frost. They both bow to the audience and then take a seat and start a conversation about Richard Nixon. It's not journalism, it's theater. It's not candid, it's rehearsed. It's not spontaneous, it's been meticulously planned by Frost and an entire production company which has been selling air time to pay for Mr. Nixon's fee. Then after the interview both men go their separate ways, one with a check for $600,000 in his pocket, the other with a newfound career as the entertainment impresario, all this under the guise of journalism, affording it a degree of legitimacy demanded by historians and political scientists. Unlike his 1960 television appearance with the dapper and confident John F. Kennedy, which was not theater but a political debate, Mr. Nixon is cool, calm and gets flustered only when the intensity of the interview begins to sag, necessitating something dramatic to generate audience interest in what is an otherwise humdrum affair. For who cares what Mr. Nixon has to say? And besides, how long can anyone be expected to listen to the disgraced ex-President drone on and on about his family, his checkered political career, his almost laughable debate with Chairman Khrushchev, his strange relationship with Mr. Kissinger and his meetings with Chairman Brezhnev and Chairman Mao, before falling asleep? And Mr. Frost knows this and he communicates his concerns to Mr. Nixon who obliges as a good performer should, for he is after all Mr. Frost's paid employee who has been given a golden opportunity to emerge from his exile, a chance for one last appearance before the public for which the disgraced ex-President and pardoned wrongdoer is grateful. Then years pass and someone decides to invest millions of dollars in time and money to make a movie about the staged ""coming out"" of this unusual and troubled man. Strange indeed but Hollywood has done a lot worse and besides a dose of Richard Nixon, properly packaged, is something the public may enjoy provided the dose is not too big, not too strong and not too offensive. Careers have been made and destroyed trying to figure out the life and career of Richard M. Nixon and this movie is but the latest addition to the Nixon genre, once again leaving the audience to wonder: was he really such a bad guy? Did he really have to resign? <br/><br/>There is Richard Nixon as politician. Nixon as crook. Nixon as president. Nixon as an historical figure. And now: Nixon as stage actor. For that is Mr. Nixon's role in this dramatization of a series of interviews produced, staged and conducted not by a journalist, not by a scholar, not by a writer, but by a TV impresario who secures the services of a well-known performer, who happens to be a disgraced ex-President of the United States, to put on a good show. The story maintains a high level of suspense as the film maker causes the audience to wonder how well Mr. Nixon will play his role. Will Mr. Nixon be a dramatic flop who drives away the audience or will he rise to the occasion and thereby help the show achieve high ratings. Whatever the case, this movie admonishes the audience to great take care not to confuse journalism with showmanship and as such anything that Richard Nixon said has to be taken with the biggest grain of salt. After all, for $600,000 a public figure, even a disgraced public figure, might come out of hiding and say just about anything. Nevertheless this is an excellent movie. It offers interesting and engaging portrayals of the two main characters, Frost and Nixon. Frank Langella's resemblance to Richard Nixon is uncanny. The movie also highlights the ludicrous hypocrisy of the pre-interview grandstanding engaged by Frost as he shamelessly hypes up his project to attract an audience. Frost's effort to sell the interviews to networks and sponsors underscores the theatrical nature of the project. Remember: Richard Nixon was PAID to perform, and he gave an excellent performance worthy of a truly gifted actor. Whether Nixon was being candid with Frost is of course another question."

","Ron Howard is certainly back on top after the disappointing results of the movie adaptation of ""The Da Vinci Code."" His direction and bringing of Peter Morgan's ""Frost/Nixon"" to film is just incredible. Salvatore Totino's cinematography and Howard's direction make this film a two hour first-person look into history (although some of the events in the film are not entirely non-fiction) with the help of one of the best adapted screenplays of my time (adapted/written by Morgan himself).<br/><br/>I was not alive to see the original ""Frost/Nixon Interviews,"" but no prior knowledge of the Watergate scandal itself is needed to enjoy and appreciate this two-hour tour de force.<br/><br/>Frank Langella portrays ex-president Richard Nixon and doesn't stretch every acting muscle in his body to play Nixon, but uses every single one of them and more to his fullest potential to embody Nixon himself. Langella's last 30 minutes on film sure are a sight to see, but his performance as a whole is certainly a big part of what makes this film a great one.<br/><br/>It's enthralling but disappointing to see Michael Sheen give such an incredible performance in this film because he will most-definitely be overshadowed by his co-star come Oscar time. Sheen's transformation from ""talk-show host"" David Frost to confrontational David Frost is just phenomenal. His final interview with Langella in the film is what will drive his chances.<br/><br/>Salvatore Totino's cinematography in ""Frost/Nixon"" brings his time to shine. Totino's cinematography brings Langella and Sheen's characters to be seen on screen as they would if they were on television. But in such a beautiful and innovative manner that you'd never know that the ""Frost/Nixon"" interviews were shown on television, but rather made into the very film that you are watching. Bravo."

""Frost Nixon"" turns out to be engaging and emotional. Despite the sedentary nature of the film, it never feels boring. There is a lot of intellectual war going on which makes it engaging to watch. Frost's initial interviews are well done to show how Nixon has the upper hand. It captures Frost's despair and enormous stress perfectly, and I felt sorry for him to ruin his career and his pocket. Nixon's tough and confident image is contrasted by an emotional speech at the end, which stirs up much emotions.<br/><br/>It is remarkable that the emotional climax is filled with much silence, contrary to most of the movies out there.

"milofromtheblock","6","1","4","21 July 2009"," Oversimplified Retelling of a Defining Moment of Television
","The story of the Frost interviews of Richard Nixon has the raw materials to build a fascinating film but it's a fundamentally disappointing effort that fails to make best use of one of television's greatest moments. The script turns the interviews into a boxing contest, a comparison highlighted by various characters throughout the film, and makes it a battle of personality between two men desperate to get back into the mainstream American consciousness. However, real life never fits so easily around the stereotypes of film and the script and director sacrifice a lot of the real character of these two men to fit them into this structure. One half of this equation is fine, Michael Sheen has plenty ability to manoeuvre in his portrayal of David Frost because, as with all the great interviewers, we never really got a sense of his values and personality in real life.<br/><br/>Sheen's Frost is a chancer, desperate to get back into the big time of American television and more than willing to risk his career on doing so. Here Frost is so desperate for an interview that he believes will put him on the television map that he outbids the networks without any knowledge of how to earn the money back and places himself in a financial black hole. He has to spend so much of his time chasing advertisers and establishing his own network for a night that he cannot properly prepare for the interview. Here one of Britain's most established television personalities is reimagined as an out of his depth talk show host without any political opinion. Sheen provides a compelling character and wears the stress of the situation all over his face while maintaining a permanent fake cheery grin. Is a fantastic portrayal of a character so often portrayed in the sports movies this film draws its inspiration from, the lowly idealist with one chance of greatness.<br/><br/>The problems lie on the other side of the title, Richard Nixon may be one of the most psychoanalysed presidents in history and his personality is simply too famous to mould to a film script. Langella imitates the President rather than becoming him and the script bends him to fit a stereotype necessary for its morality play. Langella is unable to portray a consistent character as too often the script demands he veer from wild anger to detached cynicism. At one point showing him unable to tell anecdotes and small talk, about another showing him distracting Frost before a taping session with an easy chatty style of conversation. When Nixon doesn't feel like Nixon the interviews themselves get taken out of context and the film loses the moment when all the arrogance and paranoia the man was famous for slide away to reveal a broken human being. It's that moment which makes the interviews so famous and it's when the film quotes them word for word that it's at its best. Even a film that fails in so many regards as this cannot fail to showcase the sheer power of the interviews as a piece of political theatre, a moment in the maligned history of television news beyond compare.<br/><br/>The staging of the film is directly derived from sports movies, even as far as the ""corner men"" as they are referred to in the movie. Both Nixon and Frost have Teams of advisers that sit in rooms away from the interview and narrate the action like the omniscient commentators in every sports film from Rocky to Cool Runnings to Dodgeball. Ron Howard has always liked his control room yelling and cheering scenes, most notably in Apollo 13, and here is no exception. The characters themselves are wastes of fine acting talent, Kevin Bacon is reduced to playing the most stereotypical of Nixon advices to the point where he can barely open his mouth without accusing hippies of taking down his man, and Sam Rockwell is given barely anything to do as a passionate Nixon hater. Perhaps most laughable is the bureaucrat's bureaucrat John Birt being reinvented as a daring and commanding producer. Liberties are taken with the truth everywhere in an effort to fit this into a Hollywood model. In probably the film's lowest point a large part of the plot revolves around a completely fabricated phone call between Nixon and Frost, in fact the only reason the phone call exists is lazy scriptwriting. Peter Morgan is unable to communicate the shared paranoia that Nixon and Frost have about being shut out of their respective fields so simply has Nixon call Frost and tell him they have a shared paranoia. It's not just bad writing it also loses the authenticity needed for the film, and shows the lack of vision of those involved. They cannot see beyond the standard film plot so bend this amazing truth to be that much less interesting and that much more film like.<br/><br/>This is ultimately what makes the film such a disappointing exercise; it's too concerned with itself as a film and again proves that not every tale works in that context. The irritating this is, with a director with more ingenuity and a better actor portraying Nixon, this could have been an excellent film. The sheer magnetism of the interviews themselves and Nixon as a real life character should have made it an easy adaptation to write but instead we have a diverting but paper thin story of enigmatic charmer David Frost versus bruising old curmudgeon Richard Nixon."
"m_shankar20","7","1","4","24 March 2009"," The Story of a Confession
","I'm not sure how America looks at Nixon now. I was not aware that Nixon confessed to his countrymen in his interview to Frost. Confession does not undo the wrongs but is still indicative of integrity, or at least leftover integrity, especially when coming from men of highest offices. I say this because my own country has such a long list of scandals, scams, corruption and moral impropriety from politicians and bureaucrats, that it's people have grown almost immune. And, nobody expects that anybody will ever confess anything, even if convicted. At least I don't remember any. The closing scenes of Frost/Nixon show the courage it takes for Nixon to confess and how it drains him completely at the end. But at least, coming out of the interview, I guess, he would have been at last at peace with himself.<br/><br/>Frost/Nixon is a part fictional and part factual intense drama. It is told primarily from Frost's angle. More time is spent on showing us his background, preparation and events. That may have been because there is already so much said about Nixon, this film too spending time on him would not have added anything new. As a result, the film is also about how his interview with Nixon catapults Frost into the big league.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is a great director. He, assisted by his editor, brings in pace and drama to the film. He uses documentary-style participant interviews placed throughout the film. These characters look back at the events leading up to the interview and the interview itself and comment. They provide the footnotes to the main content.<br/><br/>The film hinges on solid performances from Frank Langella and Michael Sheen. Langella brings out so many facets of Nixon's character. We see varieties of Nixon's confidence - ingrained, faked and lost. He is cool, impulsive, outraged, frustrated, calculative and manipulative. Langella lives his character. Sheen brings in a strange mix of cockiness and uncertainty to the role of Frost.<br/><br/>Not to be missed."

","I just wanted to say that I had trouble getting anyone to go to this movie with me because everyone expected it to be dry and depressing. This had mainly to do with the fact that people from my generation remember this era all too well, and it was quite painful at times. <br/><br/>In fact, largely because the movie focuses on David Frost as much as Nixon, there are many humorous moments in the movie. I really expected to see a lot of time devoted to rehashing the events of that era, and was surprised that you saw none of the usual anti-war demonstrations you would expect, hippies being perhaps the only group of people besides politicians who weren't exactly shocked when Watergate exposed a high level of corruption, since they had so often been the target of it. I can't explain why that was left out entirely, though it was referred to obliquely, being the group Nixon most reviled.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was fun taking a peek into Frost's world, and his character truly sparkled.

","So just how entertaining can a a movie centered around an interview be? The answer is far more than thought possible. The story does an excellent job of holding the audience's attention. I didn't want to leave my seat for popcorn.<br/><br/>Mr. Frost is an English television host who is fighting to regain glory in America. As soon as he gets word that president Nixon has resigned, he seizes the opportunity to interview The president. Because of Frost's inexperience with interviews and his lucrative offer, Nixon accepts the interview. Frost Soon realizes that he has bitten off far more than he can chew. What happens after this point I think is very well portrayed from Nixon's point of view and From Frost's point of View. The ending was very pleasing to me especially since I had no prior knowledge of the real-life interview.<br/><br/>The casting was flawless for this film and it is by far the area that I give it the most credit. I had not seen a whole lot of either Langella of Sheen and they just flat out sold their parts as Nixon and Frost respectively. None of the supporting characters were designed to really have Oscar potential and all of our actors in those roles, especially Kevin Bacon and Rebecca Hall did a great job of standing back in a way. They did not try to overact.<br/><br/>I have now seen most of the Oscar contenders this year and fully expect Langella to be a front runner for best Actor. He is definitely in the top 3 performances of the year"
"jaredmobarak","8","1","4","24 December 2008"," I let them down  Frost/Nixon
","Now if you want a film to show the problems of drinking and how it can ruin your life, Frost/Nixon could be it. I jest somewhat here because, of course, that is not what this story is about. However, if what is shown is to be believed, a drunken night of nerves and fear on behalf of Richard Nixon might have been his ultimate demise. After what had been a steamrolling of his interviewer, David Frost, basically reshaping his image and making he, recently disgraced and resigned, seem presidential, soon became the nail that finished his political career forever. One phone call turned the tide, one moment of weakness and hubris lit a fire under a playboy performer and created a journalist with a mission to uncover the truth and save his very life from absolute collapse. Nixon was correct in what he screams through the phoneonly one of them can come out on top. All he had to do was stay quiet and let the chips fall, but a man that never had it easy, never had the looks or natural charisma for life in the public eye had to take one last shot, one last ditch attempt to instill the fear he felt into the man across the table. It's a misstep that he doesn't even remember, so whether it happened is up to the memory of Frost himself, but witnessing that unbelievable turn of momentum can only be explained by it. If this film did anything for me, it has given me the passion to seek out the actual interview to watch that close-up, that moment where television molds reality into exactly what it wants, with the ex-President himself.<br/><br/>This film, based upon Peter Morgan's own stage play, is the bread and butter for a guy like Ron Howard. He is the kind of director that makes solid films, but never that masterpiece that may show off his unique style as an auteur. He is a hired handand I mean that in the best waythat excels at non-fiction tales, getting great performances from his cast, keeping the camera on them to drive the story without the need for flash. When he attempts an adaptation of fiction, like he did with The Da Vinci Code, his static style just makes the fantastical boring, and those moments of visual splendor become forced and out-of-place. Give him reality, though, something like Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind, and he can direct it with the best of them. Frost/Nixon, being a play that involves pretty much two central characters is just that type. It becomes a boxing match, (Kevin Bacon's Jack Brennan's metaphor is uncanny), between these two personalities, clashing and jabbing and trying to keep the other off-balance. Frost becomes Muhammad Ali, taking the punches, taking the abuse, until the last possible second where he counters with an uppercut of his own. That punch connects and the staggering giant finally relents to give the public what it had been begging for.<br/><br/>Now I don't want to call the filmic style static, because that word has a negative connotation. In fact, that very structured, composed style is exactly what is needed here. While Howard never makes the movie feel staged, there is no theatrical feel or stilted movements, it is just a wonderful use of minimal angles and panning. The camera stays focused on the performers, allowing them to become the people they are portraying, enveloping us in the story, tricks and effects unnecessary. And with the bravado of a guy like Frank Langella playing Richard Nixon, that is all you need. This performance is superb, he transforms into the fallen leader absolutelyplaying mindgames, constantly smiling his sly grin, working the crowd, and reinvigorating his image. That scene with the phone call, as spoken of before, is fantastic. A star-making monologue if there ever was one; I would have loved to have seen this play because Langella is a formidable creature on the screen, I can't imagine the power he'd exude on stage.<br/><br/>But don't count out the rest of the cast. Michael Sheen is a favorite of mine and he doesn't let me down. His transformation, from ladies man talk show host to a driven, serious, journalist is on par with Langella's from confident trickster to beaten and ragged man, if not as front and center. Sheen shows Frost's ego, so huge and successful abroad, yet so fragile in the states, something he desperately wants to change, unfortunately thinking his charade with the President might not have been the best idea to do so. Without funding, without distribution, without faith from even his closest advisors and friends, Frost went out on a limb and he sacrificed everything for just one shot at giving Nixon the trial he'd never have.<br/><br/>And the supporting players, a who's who of character greats, bolster these two giants and allow them to do their thing. Toby Jones is a complete surprise as Swifty Lazar. Between the baldhead, the tough accent, and the hard demeanor, I couldn't believe this little man, who usually plays nerdy intellectuals, (Truman Capote anyone?), was taking charge. Rebecca Hall adds to her great performance in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Sam Rockwell does nice work as the crack reporter with more than fame invested in his work, and Oliver Platt excels, especially with his own Nixon impersonation. I also enjoyed the complete transformation of Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt. This guy played Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, and here he is a bookish producer that no one would say is getting by on his good looks. These players are firing on all cylinders, mirroring the film itself as a whole. It's a story made all the more intriguing knowing it's true, and, as a film, very entertaining and a showcase for some of the best acting of the year."
"ylmzyldz","6","1","5","28 April 2009"," watchable but disappointing
","I believe Ron Howard would make a great filmmaker if he were a little more unconventional. In his best movies, he has no ""faults"" but there is always something essential missing. In ""Frost/Nixon"", this something was context. If anyone who knew nothing of Watergate watched the movie, he would think Frost was a hero for making Nixon confess (sort of). He never did give the ""trial"" the film said the American people wanted. Using the information gathered during 3 days of research based on the ""hunch"" of a research partner, Nixon can no longer keep up the face. And, the film suggests, it is not because he is cornered, it is because he, too, is a human and has a conscience and he wants to confess anyway. As if Woodward and Bernstein or hundreds of researchers in the Watergate trial hadn't gotten to him even a little bit. The film has no build-up and no complex characters, in the sense that even the characters in fact are complex, they are not developed that way in this film. Frost, a womanizer with a future to secure and Nixon, a fallen president with a reputation to reclaim. That's all we see and really, there is not much more to get. For the real drama about Watergate, everyone, ""All the President's Men"" is a must see."

","If I were David Frost I think I'd sue Ron Howard for gross misrepresentation. Michael Sheen may be a good actor, but the Frost that I remember from the 1960's ("" That Was A Week That Was"" etc) was a far more substantial and complex figure than that displayed by Sheen, who seems, like his name, just to be all shine and no substance ..I cant imagine someone as lacking in depth as the character portrayed by Sheen could have pulled off a media coup of this dimension -- especially given the local (i.e. American)competition. Frost may be a media ""type"" but it's difficult to believe that he would have achieved what he has by being a little boy lost -- which is the way he is portrayed here. Certainly the old Frost had oodles of quiet charm, but behind his facade you always sensed a bright and penetrating mind at work.. Alas none of this comes across in the film. <br/><br/>Neither does it help that the actor playing Nixon is far more weighty -- in both meanings of the word. He looks far heavier than the original who always came across as having a lean and hungry look, suitable to the Brutus-type of politico that he was. <br/><br/>This doesn't mean I think the film doesn't have its merits. But given the fact that it is dealing with 'recent' history it fails to compare with the original broadcasts, which were surely far more dramatic than this cover version."
"blubb06","6","1","5","9 February 2009"," The real thing?
","I watched this half-feature, half-docu-drama with mixed expectations. Why delve into the sordid past, unless you want to make a point about politics today?<br/><br/>In 1974, Richard Milhouse Nixon resigned the US presidency to avoid impeachment over his involvement in illegal wire-tapping and spying on his political opponents, namely the Watergate scandal. Déjà vu? The film doesn't omit the fact that he was pardoned fully by his successor, Gerald Ford, although the Watergate interviews make it pretty clear Nixon was guilty as hell.<br/><br/>Although he had been reelected by a landslide for a second term, to the liberal left ""Tricky Dick"" was one of the most hated figures in pre-Bush US politics, for his conduct of the Vietnam War, and his reputation of dishonesty. Having seen the real Watergate interviews, I can see why -- it's hard to find anything positive in an Ex-president who squirms and wriggles this shamelessly in his attempts to dodge a straight question. The real-life interviewee Nixon lacks any of the brooding fighting spirit of his movie counterpart. He can be adequately summed up as the ""New Car Salesman of the Year"", a homage Nixon earned in 1971. As this performance of this man was such an embarrassment, why resurrect and polish it for a movie? Does it bear any moral message, or is it an attempt to water down the impact of a president's ""wrong-doing"" by turning him into just another human being?<br/><br/>Judge for yourself. I found the real thing, the original interviews, a lot bolder and quite a bit more fascinating than this apparent look at the ""Making of"". Michael Sheen as Frost, the British interviewer, gives the impression of reenacting his ""Tony Blair"" role from ""The Queen"". Nixon, the main course of the banquet, rules the screen because Sheen doesn't have any weight to throw around. The script stays remarkably close to the wording of the real interview -- watch them side by side and decide which one is more dramatic. In this case, life wins out over fiction by a mile."
"thaflida","7","1","5","27 January 2009"," Bad portray of Nixon but a good entertainment
","I must admit that I had high expectations for this movie as the real Frost/Nixon interviews are a historical gem. A lot has been written about the good parts of the movie so I'm gonna write about what I thought was wrong with it.<br/><br/>Firstly, I can't understand why so many here are praising Langella's performance. I didn't think he was a good Nixon. I never really thought he quite got the part right. Of course it's a little unfair but that's just what I thought. Definitely not an Oscar-worthy performance. In the close-ups (that really portray Nixon's state of mind in the real interviews) Langella just didn't cut it for me.<br/><br/>Secondly, I can't understand why screenwriters left many of the best parts of the real interview on the editing floor. By that I mean the Camp David story, the Eisenhower-Adams bit and the one where Nixon talks about the hours before he resigned. Watching those three bits in the real interview (which I strongly advise everyone that's reading this to do) you can just see and feel the agony Nixon is going through.<br/><br/>To do my rating some justice I will say that I enjoyed the movie in spite of the faults. In fact I couldn't decide if to give it six or seven stars. I ended up giving it seven. But I think it was mainly due to the fact that I like the real Interviews so much. Michael Sheen was pretty good."

","Watching the previews for Frost/Nixon suggest a film replete with growing tension and excitement, a sort of ""All The President's Men"" played out before the TV cameras. In actuality ""Frost/Nixon"" is a fairly unimaginative filming of what must have been a great play; at the time Ron Howard plunked down a record amount of money to by the rights. What has made it to the screen is something less than riveting.<br/><br/>On the plus side we have Frank Langella, who, having starred in the stage version has the part down pat. Almost a little too pat as he seems to give his performance in a vacuum. While this causes the early scenes in the film to be somewhat void of excitement it does contribute to the undeniable peak of the film, when the interview schedule turns to the Watergate cover-up. Is it worth it? That is a question of individual taste and attention span as the film boils down to what was a fifteen round heavyweight fight. The early rounds are dull indeed, as the fighters probe and spar, searching for weaknesses. The supporting players are strong. Kevin Bacon and Oliver Platt do more than their share, but in the final analysis it comes down to what the the title suggests. Frost/Nixon is not a great film but you could do worse and probably often do at the multiplexes these days."

","Frost/Nixon (2008) ***1/2<br/><br/>His most lasting legacy, as a character in the film suggests, is the the use of 'gate' as a suffix for every political blunder since his own. Richard Nixon was not a delusional man - he likely recognized this as well. We all make mistakes, but his was broadcast widely and cost him the American Presidency. We all know how affecting our greatest blunders are to us - imagine the effect it must Nixon's must have had on him. Given the comparably larger scale, I suspect it must have been devastating. <br/><br/>The new film adaptation of Peter Morgan's much admired play, Frost/Nixon, is rooted firmly in its performances and screenplay. Michael Sheen plays David Frost, the British television host who coaxed Richard Nixon into exercising his guilt in a series of interviews. Frost was at the time living in almost a form of entertainment exile, banished to Australia, though still successful. He was something of a playboy, something of a joker. When he proposed interviewing the disgraced former president, he was balked at. He was a variety brand host, not a serious journalist or seasoned interviewer. Nixon would eat him alive. But he persisted, and put it all together, largely out of his own pocket. Nixon, played with shocking embodiment by Frank Langella, and his people accepted, due in part to the $600 thousand payday, and in even larger part because they agreed with the general consensus - Nixon would eat this joker alive.<br/><br/>And so he did for most of their sessions. Nixon routinely circumvented questions with anecdotes and hyperbole, with Frost allowing him to ramble without response. But Frost, though disheartened, never gave up, and kept doing his homework. To help him was his friend and producer, John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen), Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt), and James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell). While David spends much of his time away promoting films he's produced, or courting potential advertisers, his three wise men cram and plan their attack. Reston Jr has already written four books about Nixon, and has a hunch about a key date and meeting early in the film which turns out to be the key to breaking Nixon down. On the other side, Nixon is almost never without his right hand man, Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon). He believes in Nixon to the end, in his righteousness, and wants to protect him from further attacks. <br/><br/>The film, directed by Ron Howard, uses an interesting technique. It's structured as a documentary, right down to the retrospective interviews with those involved. In a way, it's sort of a mockumentary, but sincere and without the satire or slapstick. I was slightly off put at first, wondering perhaps if this would have been better as a documentary, but it works out pretty quickly thereafter. After a while I was actually looking forward to these moments. And although the subject would make a fascinating documentary, Frost/Nixon has something that a documentary would not be able to attain - Nixon himself. Nixon was reviled at the time, hated by nearly all. Frost/Nixon and Frank Langella do not make Nixon an evil man, but a stubborn man, dedicated to his predilections. What he considered moral and just were misguided, but he was not evil. He was simply a man who made many mistakes, not least of which the abuse of his power. Most films would have taken the easy road and turned the interviews into some sort of revenge themed tale - the horrible Nixon defeated and embarrassed by a television fluff host. <br/><br/>Frost/Nixon does not. Instead, thanks especially to Langella's powerhouse performance, we're made to empathize with the man. We don't have to sympathize with someone to criticize them, bu we ought at least empathize. How else could we even begin to comprehend what we ourselves would have done if placed in the same situation? <br/><br/>What makes Frost/Nixon work is the two lead performances by Sheen and Langella. Both actors played their roles in Peter Morgan's play, and seem to wear their characters like an old pair of pants. Frank Langella is the great highlight of the film. His Nixon is startlingly transcending - not necessarily because he looks like or sounds just like the real Nixon, but because he so profoundly embodies the man's soul. When he elaborates on his misdeeds, it seems almost more because that soul is so tortured, the weight of guilt burdened too heavily on his shoulders, than because he has been outwitted."
"earthcrake","7","1","5","14 December 2008"," Nixon not Nixon
","My challenge to watch this film is that Frank Langella just isn't Nixon. He is an incredible actor and does an excellent job in this film. It's just that I never buy him as Nixon. For those who can remember in real time, Nixon the person was like nobody else ever. His looks, posture, style of speech and mannerisms are as bizarre, unique and funny as has ever been seen in American political culture. A figure of true comedy. Dan Ackroyd in SNL'S early days was closer to a real personification of Nixon the image, though obviously taken too far to be real. But to get it right you need to go over the top like that (at least a little bit anyway) and Langella isn't that character in this film. He's too reserved. Measured. So I felt like I was watching a drama about someone else. And I found the movie itself a little flat at times. The pace starts slowly and ends the same. But done well in terms of a craft, and I followed it through to the end okay. It's just not an image of Nixon the character that resonates with me."
"Pierre_Kirby","8","1","5","12 December 2008"," Ron Howard? Oh yeah, he makes pretty good films.
","What negative things can we say about Ron Howard? He narrated Arrested Development, he starred in Happy Days, he has Clint Howard as a brother, and he always makes good, solid and entertaining films. As such is the case with his latest biopic- Frost/Nixon. It treads mostly on requisite Howard ground, and some people might say this is just another 'Oscar Bait' film filled with Oscar Bait-ish principles. But you know what? Most of those people forgot that the film is actually pretty damn good.<br/><br/>The film basically follows the famous Frost and Nixon interview in the late 70's; what happened in and outside of said event. We get to see the overall preparation of the interview, the comedy bits between Rockwell and Oliver Platt (James Reston Jr and Bob Zelnick respectively), the drama involving David Frost and his near-impossible challenge, his love interest, Kevin Bacon insulting Frost's shoes, a drunk Nixon talking about cheeseburgers, and the third act which can be summed up as- a happy ending. All shot of course in stylized cinematography and editing, with gorgeous production design backing everything up. Now, there is a lot of hype with this film, and the reason isn't because of Michael Sheen.<br/><br/>Sad to say that while Sheen does admirably in most scenes, he is nothing compared to the towering performance of Frank Langella as Nixon. Hell, I thought it was going to be something resembling a parody; an over-hyped, average performance, just like George Clooney in Syriana, or Sandra Bullock in Erin Brokovich. And yes, ladies and gentleman, I WAS VERY F*CKING WRONG.<br/><br/>I underestimated Langella, which has proved himself better than Anthony Hopkins in my eyes. Because it isn't just about looking like Nixon, it is about emulating him and all of his subtle emotions, expressions, you name it. Langella nails it with intense precision and 'no-holds barred' aggression that I quite simply felt just like Sheen in the film- awe-struck. Which makes me wonder if Sheen was really awe-struck in his scenes with Langella...<br/><br/>In other news, the rest of the acting was efficient. Rockwell and Platt did their usual characters, Bacon was a no-nonsense military officer, and Rebecca Hall looked pretty. I think Howard didn't really bother with the other characters; I think he knew from the get-go that this was a going to be vehicle movie for Langella. Meh, I don't blame him.<br/><br/>The result of the equation is an 8.2 out of 10. But WAY?!, you may ask. Well, this film felt just like any other Howard Drama (there will be no surprises here), but the difference being that the supportive acting wasn't as memorable or as good as said Drama's. But what we get to see though, is one of the best performances of the year by Frank Langella, and that in itself is reason for admission.<br/><br/>8.2/10"

","This was an enjoyable film for the most part, thanks mostly to Frank Langella's performance as Nixon, but be warned, if you have one single conservative bone in your body, steer clear of the bonus features. Without going into a whole political diatribe, I fail to see why these Hollywood drones have to inject their own political views into everything. Just let the damn thing speak for itself for once! Throughout the cast and crew interviews, nearly everyone involved felt it necessary to constantly label G. W. Bush a liar and compare him with Nixon, and state and restate the standard mass-media B.S. that we've all heard again and again and again. Opie seems to forget that while every president does things that upset both opponents and supporters, this nation is still a 50/50 split. This guy's been a filthy rich TV and movie star since he was a kid, so I guess I can understand how he would be disconnected from most of society.<br/><br/>And speaking of disconnect, I understand the need for drama, but I wish that Hollywood would stop over-dramatizing of just plain making things up when dealing with factual events. Frost/Nixon is loaded with inaccuracies and made-up parts; parts that only exist because this film was adapted from a play. I think in most situations, as in ""Apollo 13"", the fact is every bit as dramatic as the fiction.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film was well made and engaging and while it couldn't help but trumpet the ""we got Nixon GOOD!"" angle, it nonetheless was entertaining. That's all I have to say about that."

Frank Langella, who portrays the 37th president, is very wooden in the part but I guess that is what you would expect.<br/><br/>Pat Nixon's role was never able to evolve in this film and the way the interviews are conducted are unduly boring. By the time that Nixon admits that he let the country down, we may not even care about this.<br/><br/>Gerald Ford was criticized and ultimately lost the 1976 election because of the pardon of Mr. Nixon.

"denis888","8","0","1","5 July 2018"," Very Compelling, Though Not Perfect
","Ron Howard made no easy feat - to portray a seminal Forst / Nixon's 1977 Interviews wasa real ordeal. To depict such a deep, difficult, traduced, much maligned and very multi-faceted man as Richard Nixon was, is never a very sweet job. Oliver Stone did a huge task with his awesome 1995 movie, with powerful Sir Anthomy Hopkins as a main part. 
Here, Howard used the obvious talents of such giants as Frank Langella as Richard Nixon, Michael Sheen as David Frost, Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan, Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick, Sam Rockwell as James Reston Jr., Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt., Rebecca Hall as Caroline Cushing, Patty McCormack as Pat Nixon and Toby Jones as Swifty Lazar, among many. They certanly showed very high class and shone like real Luminaries. But yet, a very itchy question remains - was it all done right?
Well, the biggest problem is the general tonality of the movie - it is way too syrupy and way too mecriless towards great late President, the film tries too hard to persuade us what an evil lonely monster Nixon was, and how great to see him smashed and grounded. 
Oliver Stone did a far more weighed potrrayal of a tormented soul, with all his ups and downs.
The second biggest problem is shockingly Frank Langella - he is too old, too slwo, too bulky for avid, acidic, agile Nixon. The funniest fact is that Langella could have been better playing the very Leonid Brezhnev that his hero mentions so much.
To sum it up -
Fred Schwarz, writing for the conservative National Review online, said that, ""Frost/Nixon is an attempt to use history, assisted by plenty of dramatic license, to retrospectively turn a loss into a win. By all accounts, Frost/Nixon does a fine job of dramatizing the negotiations and preparation that led up to the interviews. And it's hard to imagine Frank Langella, who plays a Brezhnev-looking Nixon, giving a bad performance. Still, the movie's fundamental premise is just plain wrong."""

The script managed to remain accessible but at the cost of a superficiality that maybe doesn't serve the movie.<br/><br/>The main characters' psychology particularly is a bit left aside, but one can also deplore the lack of depth of the supporting characters, who are pretty transparent.<br/><br/>The staging, not bad but very academic, is typical of Ron Howard."

","Frost/Nixon was indeed a good movie but the question is ""will it stand the test of time?"". I seriously doubt it. The performances are admirable and the writing is very good but I was not overly impressed compared to other movies I have seen.<br/><br/>The acting was good throughout the cast. Frank Langella was good but not spectacular as Richard Nixon. In my mind I will have Anthony Hopkins as Nixon not Langella. In Nixon strange emotions were brought up towards the man himself, in here Nixon seems to be quite a very good man. This I had a problem with, I liked the approach of him not being shown as an evil man but I did not like the fact he appeared to better than he was. I felt that Michael Sheen stole the show from Langella and in fact played better than him. His performance was more diverse and versatile and of course the movie is about him interviewing Nixon not Nixon interviewing Frost.<br/><br/>The directing was solid as usual of Ron Howard. Yet with the character of Nixon he seemed to be pushing the idea of sympathy upon us for Richard Nixon. When it comes to feeling emotions such as sympathy, it should not be pushed upon you. Many scenes though were quite intense but this movie was carried by the writing of Peter Morgan. The nice quick dialog between the characters is what really set the tone of the film above all.<br/><br/>I liked Frost/Nixon but it is NOT a powerful movie. It sets a good tone at the beginning and stays with it throughout. Like other Ron Howard movies it doesn't take a giant leap of greatness. It does have moments of greatness and a few memorable scenes but not enough to really stand the test of time. I do not believe it deserves its best picture, best director or best actor nominations as other men and movies have had more powerful and affecting influence this year."

"MichelleAudrey","7","0","1","25 November 2011"," Fine for what it is. Langella holds it together
","Every review I've seen of this film seems overly eager to mention the fact that you will enjoy it if you arrive at the cinema prepared for the fact that it is a retelling of the post-Watergate interviews. This is no lie however, Frost/Nixon is something more than a dramatic remake of the battle between one Sir David Frost and disgraced former US President, Richard Nixon. The film leaves an indelible mark, a feeling of indescribable angst that Sheen's determined Frost cannot and will not draw the most widely desired apology from a man so corrupt and ignorant to his own nation and the trauma he instigated. It is not necessary to have an informed background on Watergate or Nixon's legacy (as I have discovered that many people seem clueless to him aside from affixing the suffix 'gate' to him) but it is necessary to view this film with an open mind. Anyone with an informed opinion on Nixon may feel a certain revelation after watching this. If anything, it enhances the sense that Frost is not the only one facing the biggest challenge of his career.<br/><br/>The film divides the four segmented interviews with profiles of Frost and Nixon individually. This allows for the viewer to digest the reactions of the President to Frost's initial weak attempts at interrogation and offers room for speculation into Frost's approach to Watergate. Sheen's portrayal of Frost is both engaging and disheartening. The latter is not for any faults by Sheen but rather a relaxed disposition with the real David Frost that makes viewing a little irritating, especially during the first interview segment.<br/><br/>Frank Langella, star of TV's Dracula certainly rises to the challenge proposed by Nixon's dictatorial-like stance. Langella defies any myth that Nixon's character cannot be portrayed truthfully most clearly during the Watergate interview. It is here that we see the former President's weakness through a facade of strength that is broken through by Frost's straightforward approach. The films most notable moment for me occurs when Frost drops his notes after he is challenged by Nixon to interview him sans script. Here Sheen does not steal the limelight but cleverly allows the focus to stay upon his fellow protagonist and highlights the weariness and hints at a possible self-loathing within the former President. The utterly disgraceful motto, made famous by Richard Millhouse Nixon is repeated by Langella in as cold and inhuman a fashion as his real-life predecessor: ""I'm saying if the President does it, it's not illegal"" – referring to his part in the Watergate cover-up and the US attacks on Vietnam and Cambodia jointly.<br/><br/>Overall, Frost/Nixon provides a chance for the audience to review Nixon's hold in the United States – a point of particular poignancy when no US network will agree to broadcast Frost's tapes or give him financial backing in the process. It is a film notable for it's representation and lack of bias. Perhaps more importantly, it allows Langella the chance to shine like few of his previous roles have ever done.<br/><br/>All Rights Reserved © Copyright 2009 Michelle Lacey (Michelle Ní Láitheása)."

However , the reverential portrayal of Frost as a genius rather than the bumbling TV chat show host whose directionless attempt to grab ratings is unsupported by the industry, is either nieve or brilliantly provocative. Eventually lucking out by being embarrassed into giving a serious interview by an ""angry expert"" , this is held up as his greatest lifetime achievement , over 30 years ago , never to be repeated , nuff said. A self promoting film of ""massive"" importance actually mirrors the subject matter of the ""interview of the century"" , with the main players narrative just inflating the egos and the story to a level of worldly proportions , whereas in truth , Frost was in the right place at the right time to be manipulated into showing Nixons ""human"" side.

","The four interviews David Frost conducted with Richard Nixon, the resigned ex-president in his first public outing, were exchanges of information about incidents and the reasons behind them.<br/><br/>For added dramatic impact, the writers beef up the emotional and moral load carried by each of the two teams. Frost, a TV celebrity, has lost much of his audience and is making a come back by paying for this production. Nixon has a lot to lose as well. Too many unanswered questions about Watergate hang over his head.<br/><br/>The film tries strenuously to take sides. Nixon should be the heavy of the piece. He should break down sobbing on camera under Frost's barrage of penetrating questions.<br/><br/>That's the usual formula but it doesn't apply very directly in this case. Nixon defends himself handily and seems at ease and unpretentious. Frank Langella, as Nixon, does his best to invest the character with an explosive kind of anger. I remember from the real interviews, Nixon's statement that if the president does it, it's not illegal. In context, it seemed to me that he was arguing (with a polite and conspiratorial smile) that no president would do something illegal. The way the line is handled by Langella and his director, Ron Howard, it sounds as if Nixon means that the president can do anything he likes, regardless of the legality of the act.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen is David Frost and we learn little about him except that he desperately wants the project to be a success. Subsidiary characters help us fill in the blanks and keep us informed about how they'd like viewers to feel.<br/><br/>I didn't vote for Nixon but I could never understand the hatred he inspired in some of his critics. He couldn't do anything right. He was despised for eating cottage cheese with ketchup on it, just as our current commander-in-chief is blamed by his enemies for reading speeches from a teleprompter and appointing ""czars"". The logic behind the criticisms is the same, in that there is no logic. Nixon virtually opened China to the West but all people remember about him is his silent-movie villainous eyebrows and Watergate.<br/><br/>At the end of the final interview, Nixon admits making ""errors of the heart"" and failing the American people. The camera lingers on the man's gloomy face and this is interpreted by commentators as loneliness and self loathing. The cast and crew have turned a sad expression into the breakdown of Captain Queeg and treated it as a giant victory for David Frost.<br/><br/>I wound up feeling sorry for Nixon, as some of his biographers have done, Stephen Ambrose and Oliver Stone among them, even when they've begun with the intention of hacking Nixon to pieces."

They really don't add that much and distract from the absolute brilliant portrayals by actors Sam Rockwell et al in all other scenes.<br/><br/>One brilliant moment: When Sam Rockwell's character has just chewed out Sheen's Frost about blowing one of the interviews and Frost's revelation of his upcoming birthday party. Awkward! Nixon will be remembered as the one who shamed the United States and this film doesn't redeem him. It does try to give him a break and not portray him as a deceased joke (sorry).

","In 1976, David Frost interviewed Richard Nixon. Journalists speaks to politician – it hardly seems like big news. But Frost was an ambitious talk show host on the make, Nixon had been silent since falling from power, and in the event, many considered the resulting interviews revealing. Still, why make a film about the interviews instead of re-showing the originals? It's true, there's an interesting story to how Frost raised his own money to buy Nixon's participation, but Ron Howard's film fails to make this story wholly dramatic – he chooses to present the background in pseudo-documentary style, with his actors giving in-character interviews. He could, of course, have directly interviewed the real protagonists; but this would have punctured the film's recreated world, where Martin Sheen is Frost and Frank Langella is Nixon. Sheen is as good as he was playing Tony Blair, another smooth talking intellectual lightweight; although in both cases, he just misses capturing the full star quality of the original. Langella seems more statesmanlike than his model, less shifty - Anthony Hopkins in Oliver Stone's 'Nixon' was more like I imagine the man, although that's really the whole point – that what we are seeing is an imagining, albeit firmly grounded in public facts. Nixon died with his reputation un-recovered, but has proved the inspiration for a multitude of movies and even an opera. Meanwhile, the avuncular John Birt, a widely disliked bureaucrat during his later tenure at the BBC, must never have expected to model a major supporting role in a Hollywood film. In Frost's case, one imagines, the expectations were different."

","I was born after the Nixon presidency, and so I've only heard of everything that Tricky Dick did. As it stands, I've never seen the Frost/Nixon interviews. But Ron Howard's movie ""Frost/Nixon"" - based on Peter Morgan's Broadway play - tells the story magnificently.<br/><br/>Having resigned and seen his career ruined, Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) retired to his San Clemente villa. But English talk show host David Frost (Michael Sheen) got the idea to interview the former president to get his opinion. Clearly this was a risky move with Nixon's bad reputation. But Frost suspected that something could come of this. So it came to be when, during the fourth segment, Nixon said two important things: ""When the president does it, it's not illegal,"" and ""I let the American people down."" While the second comment was obvious all along, the first goes to show the precedent set by Nixon's crimes and Ford's pardoning of him: subsequent presidents did even worse things. The movie can easily be seen as an allusion to Bush.<br/><br/>The characters' physical appearances are like their own characters: the slimy, tanned Nixon as opposed to the affable, photogenic Frost. It was good that they showed how Jim Reston (Sam Rockwell) pushed Frost to ask Nixon about his escalation of the Vietnam War, since that was a far worse crime than Watergate (not to mention spying on peaceful citizens, destroying the Black Panthers and American Indian Movement, re-segregating the country and overthrowing Chile's government).<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this movie, as a look at history and a look at the present.

Mr. Langella is a noted actor from primarily Stage & Television. Mr. Sheen is mostly known for his excellent role as Prime Minister Tony Blair in THE QUEEN.<br/><br/>They both are quite good as Richard Nixon & David Frost. For those who do not know, Mr Frost was a noted Television interviewer & wit.<br/><br/>The supporting cast however is even better than the 2 stars.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt & Toby Jones excel as aides & associates of both leads. Rebecca Hall has the major distaff part,<br/><br/>Pat Nixon (the Presidents wife) is very nicely done by ex-child actress Patty McCormack (BAD SEED).<br/><br/>The costumes & settings are excellent I felt I was back in the time period.<br/><br/>Dear Readers , note I have said little about the script, It has its moments, just not enough of them. For the first hour or so I was watching a competent film, It wasn't until the scene where both Noxon & Frost are talking in the phone very late at night.That scene made me pay attention to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I never saw the original interviews (films subject matter) when they were on Television, It was during Tax Season & I had more pressing things to do.<br/><br/>i feel this is a good movie, just not the great film many say it is.<br/><br/>Ratings: *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)"

","The subject of this movie is one that is already very well-known, and one which every viewer should know the outcome, before they see it. So, it has be be done in a fresh manner, telling us what we didn't already know. Otherwise, why not just view the tapes of the original presentation? <br/><br/>Before I watched this movie, on DVD, I commented to my wife ""How did they make this into a two hour movie?"" The way they did it was to tell the back-story, of how the idea of the Frost/Nixon interviews came up in the first place, the negotiations, showing Nixon as always somewhat greedy to get a bit more pay, the efforts of Frost's team to get financial backing, the research they did, the preparation Nixon's team did to help him be general and avoid getting into a negative light.<br/><br/>Frank Langella is just plain masterful as Richard Nixon. He was nominated for Best Actor in this role and could have won it, but as luck would have it there were several award-caliber performances that year. Still, even though Langella doesn't look that much like Nixon we soon forgot that we were watching an actor. His performance really embodied the Nixon that I knew back in the 1960s and 1970s.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen, who was so good as PM Tony Blair in ""The Queen"" has the role her of David Frost. I was not so familiar with Frost, but Sheen does a fine job also.<br/><br/>Much of what we see is a fictionalized account of what lead up to the interviews, and what went on behind the scenes during the interviews, but with proper research I feel that what we see is plausible, and certainly worth a viewing.<br/><br/>Good movie."
"JoeB131","Null","0","2","25 April 2009"," Let me make this perfectly clear
","Oddly, it's the signature Nixon line, and Langella's Nixon doesn't say it once...<br/><br/>I really did believe that Langella was Nixon. Rarely does an actor pull of a transformation so effectively that you can no longer see the actor but the character he portrays. A man in political exile, who believes that he had done the right things when in office, but comes to the realization at the end that he profoundly failed.<br/><br/>Of course, the movies flaw, if it has one, is that it makes Frost out to be this great interviewer who elicited a long awaited ""confession"" from Nixon. The reality is that Nixon wanted to make the statement he did for the record, and his staff carefully negotiated the terms of that confession.<br/><br/>As high drama, though, it is very good."
"wolftab-1","7","0","2","24 April 2009"," Ron Howard's Metaphoric Attempt at Putting Bush in the Hot Seat
","A fine rendition of the play of the same name. Michael Sheen and Frank Langella reprise their roles from the play as David Frost and Richard Nixon in a story about one of the most famous political interviews in the history of television where a struggling English talk show host, David Frost scores an interview with then former President Nixon and gets him to admit wrongdoing in the Watergate scandal. At times it has the typical clichéd feeling of the underdog-going-up-against-the-champion type story but it was entertaining. However, I felt like Mr. Howard was using Nixon as a metaphor for President Bush and wanting to put Bush in the hot seat for all of his wrongdoings as President, with himself as Frost. The portrayal of Nixon was fairly pathetic, but then again, there is no version that of him that is flattering, especially Anthony Hopkins version in Oliver Stone's ""Nixon."" What was interesting is how much of a money grubber Nixon is shown to be, ie; always wanting more money for doing the interviews. Not to mention being delusional, as in not recalling a drunken phone call to Frost a few nights before their final interview.<br/><br/>Parts of the film are a little slow and oftentimes too grandiose for a story of this kind. But the climax is a huge payoff and Langella does an incredible job of portraying the desolation, the anguish and loneliness of Nixon. However, I liked his nonverbal emotions to his vocal inflections better. Sheen does a admirable job as the partying playboy Frost. You can see how he feels about his difficult circumstance and how everything he had was literally on the line with the success of this interview. The supporting cast led by Kevin Bacon, who goes back to his cold loyalist part he played similar to A Few Good Men as Nixon's chief of staff Jack Brennan. It works for Kevin and he is good at it. Oliver Platt also plays his typical sardonic, caustic witted type character as Bob Zelnick. Sam Rockwell plays the whiny, revenge filled James Weston who wants nothing more than to make Nixon pay. Rebecca Hall plays Caroline Cushing, in a not much to do part except smile, look pretty and be strong for her man, role. However, she conveys good compassion when called on. At the helm, Ron Howard, who's direction seems a bit rushed and distracted at times, especially when he is showing who David Frost is. I didn't have a strong feeling for Frost one way or another but it was a good attempt."

","With 3 free tickets to use before 12 April, i had to go to movies for 3 consecutive evenings. My first choice was this movie. Why ?<br/><br/>1 - Because Nixon left the White house just 2 days before my brother and I were born. So i was intrigued to capture the mood of this special time. For those who are interested, our parents don't recall something in particular: our mother was in hospital since 1 week and our father has memories of this event but don't remember the timing with our births!<br/><br/>2 – because I never clearly understood what the Watergate really was! I know there were burglars, but can't link it with the missing tapes or Nixon. I should see my classics (""Nixon"", ""All the President's Man"") instead!<br/><br/>3 – because if JFK has become a respected icon, Nixon is depicted for many as the evil himself. So, hearing the real man would be interesting, even thought i can't really say if the debate is 100% accurate.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't wash my enthusiasm.<br/><br/>It caught my attention from the beginning up to the final credits. The 70s are well portrayed with bright colors. The debate is edited as a sport event, especially a boxing match. I didn't know so far the actor playing the host but he is really talented. I really like how he took strong punches by Nixon while he is a bit carefree and how he start to bite too as he becomes studious. <br/><br/>But finally, i am really amazed how America can speak freely about politics and makes movies on that topic while my country is shy or more exactly less tolerant. Like everyone else, everyday, we hear about the political class, on TV, radio, newspapers but french producers don't want to tell their ""real"" story in movies. We never complain about them, never tells a critic. I really wonder where is the real democracy thus?"
"antoniotierno","7","0","2","16 February 2009"," absolutely brilliant and entertaining‏
","Both Langella and Sheen don't look that like their subjects, but both succeed in making these men interesting and sympathetic, more than the viewer would have ever imagined. Langella doesn't try to imitate Richard Nixon, and gives a powerful and convincing performance, freeing the old president Nixon from the association of sleaze and turning him into something somehow Shakespearian. Frost is shown at first as a journalist with no ideas, no principles and convictions, no ambition but to make money and be famous in the US; at the end he gets to prove likable and clever. Never mind your political opinion on Nixon, there's no rehabilitation at all here. It's just that the man is depicted perfectly, regardless of a judgment about his deeds."
"agmoldham","7","0","1","12 February 2009"," Well crafted movie
","This film is based on the period after Nixon resigned the US presidency. It follows the run up to his interview by David Frost who was a fairly average talk show host anywhere in the world that he could hold down a job. All the major US TV networks wanted the interview for themselves and did not take kindly to Frost landing the job mainly through his own enterprise.<br/><br/>The film is a classic battle of David and Golliath. Personally I love the verbal battle between characters more than physical battles and anyone of the same opinion should love the film. If you need a fix of action from your movies you are probably well advised to skip this.<br/><br/>Frank Langella is brilliant as Nixon and Sheen isn't overshadowed either as Frost. There are a number of elements to the film that are open to interpretation and I'm not as convinced about the main conclusion of the 'victor' of the interview as I was before seeing it. Ron Howard also does a reasonable job and it's always interesting to spot which role his brother will land."
