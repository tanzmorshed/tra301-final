","I know its gonna sound bloody insane,but for me(no critics,as an average human being like you) it was the best Hindi romantic movie i've ever seen.<br/><br/>Nice chemistry between Shahrukh & Anushka(I'm their fan :P ),plaudits for Aditya chopra for this masterpiece,amazing music & Cinematography.Some questions will rise,how someone can't recognize her own husband without mustache,and some silly others.But the fact is i don't know how,but somehow this movie just touch your heart deeply,i mean u have to..u have to smile and cry in the meantime while watching this movie....for not only me,my friends and companions,almost 90% were having same feeling.credit goes to the whole team for this kind of creation.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and reading this review.hope,u would be kind enough to forget if i made any mistake.Stay blessed :)"

","With Aditya Chopra Directing this Sharukh Khan starrer I obviously had huge expectations from this movie the first time its promo was aired...<br/><br/>The Music was marvelous. Great work by Salim-Sulaiman that made me more eager to watch the film. I remember that while I was lining up for the tickets, a friend of mine who was coming out after watching the movie said that it was absolutely pathetic. According to him, the entire movie was stupid because it was about a wife not recognizing his husband without a mustache & having a flick with him thinking it was some one else.....<br/><br/>his review did make sense & i was a bit demoralized coz I had just purchased the tickets. But when I did watch the movie, I realized ho beautiful it actually was...<br/><br/>The movie was not about a stupid wife not recognizing his husband without a mustache. In fact, though they were husband & wife the reason she could never figure out the difference between Raj & Suri was that she was never that close to Suri in the first place.<br/><br/>The message that the movie tries to convey that ""If one has to love me then it's got to be the real me & not the person that I can pretend to be""<br/><br/>Sharukh's best work after Chak De India!!!!<br/><br/>God Bless the Makers of this Film!!!!!"
"hassanalizaidi","10","30","45","15 December 2008"," Not Typical, but treat to watch
","First of all i would like to comment on the dare step taken by the A. Chopra to make a movie on such a middle class topic.It's an excellent movie with very different approach. I am amazed after reading different reviews. Come on folks, don't expect King khan all the time doing the Millionaire roles.<br/><br/>Excellent direction, outstanding performances with average music. Script of the movie might be a much tighter. I am not a SRK fan by any mean, but after this movie, i started thinking by doing this.<br/><br/>In the end, very good family drama movie and treat to watch. Come on folks stop dreaming Glamour all the time. These low budgets and middle class story movies are the real time facts of our lives."
"kc-amith","10","23","35","15 December 2008"," just go watch it!!!
","The first thing that come to my mind after watching the movie is.........!NO WORDS!, simply mind blowing. A Fantastic movie which worth every pi of my money and every second of my time. <br/><br/>SRK's performance and the odd look as Surinder Sahni is simply superb!. Surinder Sahni is a non active normal Indian guy who was forced to marry the beautiful Desi Taani(Anushka Sharma). The story is full of expressing Surinder's pure love towards Taani.<br/><br/>Surinder changes himself completely to get the attention of his love Taani. The story runs with twist and turns, dance and music, comedy and drama and with a little action! by Taani.<br/><br/>Finally an expected-unexpected climax steals the heart of every audience and make them to forget themselves in the emotion of love.<br/><br/>Thats all about the movie. My suggestion is to simply just go and watch it. You will really appreciate the performance of King Khan and Anusuka."
"rushda","7","13","18","29 July 2012"," So what if she didn't recognise him?
","I didn't love this movie, but I'm frustrated at how most of the negative reviews are focused on the wife not recognising her husband. Have none of you seen Superman? In that, Lois Lane doesn't recognise that Clark Kent is Superman, and yet I doubt any of you would complain there. It is a trivial plot element that can be overlooked - and in the film's defence, they did try and justify it by making romance a bit magical (though probably didn't need to go that far).<br/><br/>The film was sweet, colourful, and fun to watch. The music was great and the acting was decent. Having said that, I think there were some fundamental flaws in the films and tricks they missed:<br/><br/>1. Why should the girl love Suri when he offers her none of the love and fun that Raj does? I don't understand why she is supposed to settle for the 'real' Suri when he is so boring. If Taani is supposed to compromise for her husband, should he not also become a bit more like Raj and meet her half way? It would have been great if he had started dressing a bit more fashionably for her even in his 'Suri' self. <br/><br/>2. We are told that Taani is a loyal and decent wife. Yet it is completely out of character for her to think about running away with another man. I was a bit disappointed that she didn't even tell Raj she was married and spent so much time with him outside home.<br/><br/>3. A perfect twist to the film would be for Taani to have known all along - it would have been a nice way of showing that Taani did recognise his heart from the start but she also wanted to see how far Suri could go. But without this twist, the story was very predictable.<br/><br/>These things make the film very frustrating for me. But at the same time, I don't want to fault it too much as I think it is still on the right path - I'm fed up of the show-offy 'Don's of Bollywood today. Romance is still where it's at."

"springsunnywinter","10","86","153","12 December 2008"," Aditya Ne Banadi Wonderful film
","The movie was already the most hotly anticipated film of the year when it was announced in March because it is finally the third directorial outing of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Mohabbatein director Aditya Chopra. Aditya's films always turn out to be good and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is his next movie 8 years after Mohabbatein. <br/><br/>The story is about an 'odd' couple played by Shahrukh Khan and Anushka Sharma who find true love in the backdrop of a dance competition called ""Dancing Jodi"". Surinder Sahni (Shahrukh Khan), a man working for Punjab Power, who falls in love with Taani (Anushka Sharma) the flamboyant, fun-loving, vivacious girl for whom the whole world is her canvas and she paints her own life with the colours of rainbow all until unforeseen circumstances changes it all and brings them together. They get married and lead a not-so happy life due to huge age difference between Surinder and Taani. Taani, meanwhile, wants to participate in a reality dance show called ""Dancing Jodi,"" which is the main backdrop of the movie. The dance contest showcases couples of all races, colours, backgrounds and sexual preferences. Taani wants to take part for the show, but she is not able to due to her husband's lack of fashion statement. Later on when Surinder finds out about his wife's wish to participate in the reality dance show, he undergoes a major change. Taani keeps falling in love with her changed husband.<br/><br/>Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is such a beautiful film that touches your heart that makes you cry and laugh in some points like Shahrukh against a sumo wrestler. Some of my friends thought that it looked rubbish because in the promos Shahrukh Khan had a moustache, and comb over and was wearing bad cloths but is truly the best the best Bollywood movie of the year after a long list of turkeys. It is also the first Shahrukh film of the year and before this he made special appearances in Krazzy 4 and Bhootnath. <br/><br/>The music is brilliant although they can't match with the classic soundtracks of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Mohabbatein but there were about 5 songs and every single song was good and I don't know what the best songs are. <br/><br/>It is a must see unless you do not like Shahrukh or have a heart of stone because there is no way you are going to like it."
"nitap","10","16","24","6 January 2009"," A movie made from Rab!
","I went to see RNBDJ because of Shah Rukh Khan first of all, but did not know what to expect since I made a point not to read any reviews or synopsis of the film. I only knew that the audience seemed to give good review but critics were not friendly with their reviews. I must say they have become to jaded upon watching numerous films that they missed the beauty of this film. I love Aditya Chopra for directing such a brave and bold film that comes straight from his heart! SRK portrayed Surih and Raj with sheer perfection. I loved him as both characters; they both made me smile and also drove me to tears! Anuksha did a brilliant job as her debut character and I couldn't believe this was only her first film. She was marvelous and fresh as Taani. The songs are just beautiful and they will either make you get up and dance or lay down and just cry tears of happiness. The climax was mesmerizing and surprising, the comedy was wonderful and the message was very important that we need to love our ""jodi"" for who they are and not who we wish they are. We are all made from God so we have to remember to see God in everybody! What a brilliant and different film Yash Raj Films made; I love you guys for this gift!"
"arkasamanta","10","67","122","12 December 2008"," Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is Extraordinary!!
","Superb!! Is the first thing that comes into your mind when you are going to see this film!!! Perfect is the second exclamation that will follow! Everything about this film is perfect (Even Anushka Sharma, on whom I didn't have much expectation!).<br/><br/>The story is about a regular guy Surinder Sahani who works for Punjab Power and leads a regular, monotonous life. But Rab (God) had different plans for him. His life undergoes a complete change when Tani (Anushka) comes into his life. <br/><br/>This film is about Love in its purest form, and everything that expresses love, Dance, Music...<br/><br/>Coming to the technical staff! Everything here were perfect too! Lyrics, Music, Direction, Camera, Cinematography! <br/><br/>Acting of everyone was natural and proportionate.<br/><br/>Lastly, A film For Everyone, Go and Watch this movie and then You'll see that I am not Overreacting here!!"
"prianka-guru","8","5","6","14 July 2013"," Its a good movie
","This storyline is nice, so is the idea. But there are some ignorable flaws in the direction like when Shahrukh brings his bride home and lifts the suitcase, one can easily tell that it is an empty one. But then again they have paid so much attention to details, like the usage of 'yellow' color in every possible way. The chemistry between the lead pair is good nothing over the top. Shahrukh's character is extremely sweet and lovable.<br/><br/>My suggestions: 1. Watch this movie when you are feeling hopelessly romantic. 2. Don't watch it keeping DDLJ in mind, DDLJ is beyond comparison."

","after seeing shah rukh khan in om shanti om i completely lost faith in him...the second half in which he tried to act cool was painful to watch...but his performance is this movie is simply mind blowing. <br/><br/>Aditya chopra has done it again.its a very simple film with a simple plot but u leave the hall with a smile on your face. anoushka sharma gives an excellent performance way better than deepika.this movie reminds me of the old greats which yash raj studios used to make. please go watch this movie.simply fantastic.<br/><br/>also watch out for vinay pathak who gives a funny performance as shahrukhs best friend bobby."
"maheshkoneru","8","44","84","14 December 2008"," Rab ne is a lot of fun...don't miss this one
","Rab ne is an absolutely entertaining film. Have no doubts about that...<br/><br/>But before I go on to review the film, I would like to say a thing or two about the so called professional reviewers of our online media. Each genre and each storyline will have a different yardstick depending on what the film is setting out to achieve. Don't go looking for logic and 'intelligence' in a film when its primary motive is to make people laugh and have a good time.<br/><br/>And I will host a grand party the day rediff ditches Mr.raja sen.<br/><br/>That aside, Rab ne is a film which will make you feel good and happy and Shahrukh absolutely deserves credit for this. His performance as Mr.Surinder is an absolute delight to watch and the mannerisms will leave you in splits of laughter. And then, the performance as Raj is the icing on the cake.I wont say anything more about this as it will spoil the experience for you.<br/><br/>Shahrukh Khan, take a bow.This is amongst your best performances to date.<br/><br/>The new face of the film, Anushka deserves special mention for the way she acted and carried off the role of Taani. There is innocence,charm,a certain vulnerability and tenderness in the character but at the same time she can be quite a force to reckon with if provoked. And Anushka lived in the role. For a debutant, its amazing.<br/><br/>Vinay pathak as usual was his excellent self as the best friend of Shahrukh and their moments on screen are truly rib tickling.<br/><br/>'Haule Haule' song is very good and so is the background score. It adds weight to the film and to the comedy. All the other songs are pretty decent.<br/><br/>The way the city of Amritsar was shown is also very nice and the rich production values of yashraj films is clearly visible in each and every frame.<br/><br/>And finally, for the director. Welcome back Mr. Aditya. We missed you and we hope that you make movies a little more often than you do.<br/><br/>Maybe, the ending could have been handled slightly better but then its not a major gripe. Some parts of the story may defy conventional logic like the way Shahrukh manages to juggle his different 'careers'. But as I said earlier,these kinds of films are not about logic or intelligence.They are about making you laugh and have a good time and in that Rab ne is eminently successful.<br/><br/>All in all, Rab ne is a very feel good film that you can go out and watch with your whole family. 100% Paisa Vasool film"
"shariq_forever","8","28","52","18 December 2008"," Very entertaining and interesting throughout
","This is very different from DDLJ 1995 and Mohabbtaein. RNBDJ 2008 is very entertaining and different film. We have not seen such a good movie for a long time. This film is not about a dance competition but it is about a human being who can be so natural that do not need any artificial pomp and show to be an honest lover. Shah Rukh Khan has done his job brilliantly. He is such a solid actor and no one in Indian cinema can match his character playing and emotions portraying. He can even make a dumb movie like Om Shanti Om look good and be hit. Must watch this movie in theater, and you will definitely want to see it again."

"arunkesi","8","22","42","12 December 2008"," Who says Rab Ne is Boring!!!!Go Watch It!!!!!
","Well...Inspite of all the reviews going around of Rab Ne being clichéd,sluggish and what not,the movie according to me is top notch.I would give it a 8 on 10 ""jeee"".Admitted I adore SRK, but even if you are not a fan you would invariably become one by the time the end titles start rolling.And if u still believe even after watching Chak de and Rab Ne that SRK is good only playing Raj and he is no good actor,then forget it!!!U must be having serious,serious reservations against the actor. Swades,Chak De and now Rab Ne.His performance in Rab Ne is right up there and no other actor could portray the character of Surinder with such élan as SRK did. Well I've heard SRK say in some interview prior to Rab ne release of how his previous 6 Yashraj Films had contributed in making him 90% superstar. Well,now you could make it 7 in a row and YRF has made him 100% superstar. The Yahraj,SRK saga continues and it is now in the form of its life. Aditya Chopra after a historic DDLJ,a mediocre Mohabbatein is back with Rab Ne.It doesn't get bigger and better than Rab Ne.Well after watching this film you would curse yourself on how Adi betrayed all the Indiam movie lovers by directing just 3 films in the last 14 years.How rich could Indian cinema have been had he directed a few more gems ala Rab Ne.<br/><br/>C'mon Adi..We would want to see you in the director's chair rather than producing those horrific movies Roadside Romeo.<br/><br/>Darr,DDLJ,DTPH,Mohabbatein,Veer Zaara,Chak De and now Rab Ne.SRK is back with YRF.<br/><br/>What is it that makes this combo churn out the most memorable movies we would ever watch on the silver screen year after year.<br/><br/>Rab Ne inspite of being a good 2 1/2 hour long movie rivets you in every single frame.It is a movie which would take you into a different world,a world of Surinder Sahni.As promised by the makers one would identify themselves with the protagonist,feel for him,live with him and when u start living with the character and forget everything around u know pretty well that the film is working big time.<br/><br/>A simple love story where every scene is so convincingly shot that one wonders on how the shooting was completed in just 47 days and the script written in 12 days. It would be immature of me to even comment about SRK's performance.Anushka Sharma, Well she couldn't have asked for more.And she performed with such confidence that would have made even the likes of the Kajols and Madhuris proud Vinay Pathak enters the big league as well and we will now start seeing him taking center stage in the more prominent movies.<br/><br/>Little moments from this film leave such a lasting impression.Be it the scene on the dining table with the rose,The back ground tune and the score of ""Haule Haule"" being played intermittently at regular intervals for little triumphs of Suri, Taania greeting Suri's friends on the Reception night,the Holi scene,the ""Yellow Tiffin Box"",the Biryani thing,The sorry episode to name a few.You would yearn for Taania to unite with Suri and not elope with Raj.<br/><br/>""Inspite of loving the character ""Raj"" all these days in DDLJ,KKHH and so many other movies we start disliking him and rather feel for the Surinder and would want him to succeed in his love.That is where the movie succeeds big time."" Admitted it gets a bit dull in the middle with the dance episodes and all but u would when the entire 2 1/2 hours revolves around just 2 characters.But still the movie remains afloat thanks to all those wonderful little moments that are spread throughout.<br/><br/>Agreed it is no DDLJ,no KKHH but still you would not want to miss it.<br/><br/>Go watch it!!!!"
"unsiahussain","10","14","26","14 July 2009"," Very sweet movie..
","This is a very cute movie, that brings tears to your eyes. Surinder Sahni (SRK) marries Taani (Anushka Sharma) because of a twist of fate. As he loves her and she doesn't love him, he decides to change his appearance and go to her dance classes as Raj, the flirty,funny, and cheery guy. He woos her , and she starts to like him. With great performances by Anushka,SRK,and Vinay Pathak, with great songs, cute duologue's,and sweet characters, this movie is SO worth it! I liked it because of the sweetness of Surinder, the bubbliness of Taani, the funniness of Vinay, the foot tapping Dance Pe Chance, the cute Haule Haule, the interesting Hum Hain Raahi Pyaar Ke,and the romantic Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai, these songs definitely deserve some space on your iPod, and in your heart."

","Grrrr......I took my friend who is a crazy SRK fan to watch this ""Rab Ne..."" thing thinking at least she might enjoy and I'll enjoy her company as I already had known how bad this movie is.<br/><br/>But it turned out to be so pathetic that even my SRK crazy friend also couldn't bear it and decided to wait hopelessly post interval that something good might come. Eventually she quit just 15-20 minutes before the ""climax"" if thats what you can call it. We moved out of the theatre to do better things on a lazy Sunday evening but lost so much time already waiting for some ""chamatkar""(miracle) from Rab(God) or ""Rab Ne..."". My friends condition was similar to that of Anoushka(Tanni) in a scene when she is watching some movie and runs out of the theatre away from SRK. I wonder if that was an ironic hint for the audience as well.<br/><br/>The performance of Shahrukh(Surinder Sahni) is so predictable and irritating that it would make a brain tumor look merciful. Anoushka(Tanni) forgot to join acting classes before entering this venture and Aditya Chopra needs to revisit direction classes. Even the songs seemed too forced in certain situations and the chemistry between the lead pair is flat as it was supposed to be touching. In a love story there is supposed to be love and not compromise + ""good luck"" which it appears to be in this case.<br/><br/>Also I heard a lot of praise about Vinay Pathak's(Sahnis friend) performance. Firstly, he doesn't fit the role of a guy who can produce a makeover by just shaving someones moustache. And then he seems to be competing with Shahrukh Khan in the over-acting business looking more like the audiences worst enemy than Surinder's best friend.<br/><br/>Thanks Yash Raj for proving once more that you'll are up for producing only rehashed bull which we the audience are supposed to digest at any cost.<br/><br/>Everyone please take a prescription from your doctor for severe headache and nausea if you plan on visiting this movie."

"vikrantjindal21","9","15","30","27 December 2008"," Love rulez !!!
","I know many people hated the movie. And their stand is correct. A SRK-Adi combo ought to provide a blockbuster. Instead the result is a gentle, sweet story... Its not about Raj/Rahul sweeping the maiden off her feet. But its the story of a common man ""Surinder Sahni"" who loves his wife a lot. And would go at great lengths just see a smile on her face. He does not fight 20 goons or jump into fire to save her love. He just makes her ""Taaniji"" happy. You would love the movie if you like mushy love stories. But beware, there is no over-the-top sparkle as is generally in YRF or Karan Johar movies. It does not show the couple dancing in Switzerland, but in SDIPA's dance classes. It does not have unbelievable dance moves like Hrithik's but a wonderful couple dance. The music will not make you wild, but would touch your heart. Especially the last sequence (instrumental) creates the required emotion and restlessness of the Taani.<br/><br/>The movie has some beautiful sequences. Suriji falling in love with the yellow tiffin, Raj's entry, the PROPOSAL (you certainly should not miss this one), and finally the climax. The starting and ending 30 minutes are awesome. But the intermediate portion is not up to the mark. It could have been improved or trimmed, but its kept to keep the film lighter.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. SRK has once again proved his mettle and is par excellence. Anushka does a great job. She has done a great work in-spite of being pitted against a top notch artist. Vinay Pathak is good. The songs are a big let down. Most of them seem to be stuffed forcefully. And in Choreography, Shiamak has done a wonderful job with the climax sequence. Also the picturization of ""Tujhme Rab Dikhta Hai"" is mind-blowing...<br/><br/>Watch it if you believe in Love..."
"rjnishant-1","10","14","28","24 December 2008"," A breathtaking Indian movie
","I saw Dark Knight recently, and as much as I loved it, I was saddened that it could be light years before an Indian movie could reach that standard, story telling wise. Then comes along 'Rab ne bana di jodi'. As much as I like properly made, not trying-hard-to-be-cool Hollywood movies, it rarely ever fills the part of my heart which is purely Indian. Even for perhaps my favorite movie of all time (Batman Begins+Dark Knight), I kill myself a little to truly enjoy it.<br/><br/>Rab ne bana di jodi follows slightly in the vein of Swades, a movie I loved but a dud at the box office, perhaps for its slow pace. <br/><br/>I will try to go about the review without giving away anything that might spoil this wonderful movie for you. The first half of the movie has a fair dosage of comedy, while the second has practically no entertainment(comedic or any kind of a breather) whatsoever and I'm incredibly grateful for it. The only way you can enjoy this movie is by completely immersing yourselves into the characters of Shahrukh(Suri) and Anushka(Tana). I was among the 2 of our group of 10 who liked the movie. Having discussed the movie with those who didn't like the movie, with the benefit of hindsight, I would like to give you a couple of pointers to enjoy the movie. First off, Suri is in NO WAY JUDGING Taani's character by doing what he does to make her happy, but doing it for her sake alone. Secondly, the reasons for him continuing to do what he does are exemplarily well put and explained, if you can bear with the nuances of the characters. Thirdly be patient and try not to be critical, at least in the first viewing. Finally, don't be bogged down by the moustache/hair thingy, as Suri plays it really well, with the true personality shining through, throughout. So it is not unrealistic or impractical at all. I tried to leave it as vague as possible, and if it sounds like gibberish, plz be PATIENT and give the movie the benefit of the doubt, at least while seeing it. <br/><br/>Every character and every relationship arc is flourishingly ended leaving you extremely satisfied.<br/><br/>TODAY, I wish I could type this review, and everything else in Hindi."

SRk takes his glasses and mustache off and he is Raj and with it he is Surinder...<br/><br/>How stupid they think viewers are?...<br/><br/>Very week storyline and too much emotional gibberish...<br/><br/>In my opinion... don't spend your time on it.."
"jerrythres05","1","27","61","17 April 2009"," A SHAME FOR BOLLYWOOD or is it a coincidental hit
","This movies was one of the most predictable piece of work I have ever seen. There was absolutely nothing natural about this movie. From the first 10 minutes to the last everything happened as a coincidence and the actors keep saying it God's reason that they were together, given straight form the title RAB NE BANA DI JODI. Shah Rukh has given one of his worst performances ever. He over acted as Suri, the geek who worked for Punjab Power, and even worse while playing Raj, a cool hip guys that comes out of no where. Although the heroine in this movie, Anushka Sharma, did put a lot of effort into her debut role, but sad to say her character was not well built. I mean seriously, you wont recognize you husband if he took of his glasses and shaved his mustache? Where did she think she was going to end up with being friends with Raj? From the first time Raj and Taani met, he was flirting with her and kept talking about love and just kept overacting to be the coolest person in the planet. Everything happens coincidentally, from Day 1 of where Suri and Taani met, at her wedding, there just happened to be a bus accident where the whole family of the groom , and the groom himself, dies. Hearing this news her father has a heart attack, and then they are married shortly after all this tragedy. How realistic does this sound to you? Even a kid in Pre-school can figure out that there's something not right with this picture. I don't understand how some one can say this is a good movie in any way: the music including the background score was mediocre, the photography was below par, the art direction was bad, everything in the movie from the streets to the garage looked like a set, the only realistic looking location was the Golden Temple, the actor has give out a performance with the same crap he has been giving out for his past 100s of movie, and most importantly the dialogs and the story were absolutely ridiculous. With the movie rating to be below par in all these categories how can one say this was a great movie. We are in 2009, and Bollywood has been making the same kind of crap since the dawn of Indian cinema. One can argue with me by saying if this movie was crap why did it do so well in the Box Office. Well I have 3 letters for you SRK. People will spend money to see SRK's appearance on screen not matter how crappy the story or the director is. Well getting back to the movie, I gave this a 1 out of 10 because of its impracticality and the redundant storyline over the years of Bollywood cinema."

","One thing is for sure..If you don't enter into a theater showing Rab Ne Banadi Jodi expecting another Raj Malhotra or Raj Aryan, then trust me ,you will surely take home with you, Mr.Surinder Suri of Punjab Power. Suri is someone whom we come across everyday in our lives.He is there in every bus, he is there in every office building and he is there in every by lane of India and he is the most boring person in the world. Surely,its the realness of Suri's character that brings a smile on one's face.Trousers with tucked in shirts and sneakersMy God, I meet such people twice everyday.<br/><br/>There is no point giving any synopsis of RNBDJ so I will jump directly to the views Rab Ne Banadi Jodi , honestly is damn good illogical cinema at its best with a touch of magnificent subtlety.Its a laughathon but behind this super funny film,there is a masterly screenplay ,where the movie reels fly off with one comic situation after the other, but then in the end when we are at the closing stages, we end up realizing that this film is not about Mr.Suri's unintentional buffoonery instead its about the God that resides in him..And trust me, that God is one funny bloke..<br/><br/>Newbie Anushka is a stunner and she plays the role of a one helluva confused girl, extremely well. You can hate her for the decisions she takes in one scene and you certainly want to give her a hug ,for the next step which she takes, and this is what her role demands.. For a newbie, she has done a fabulous job.<br/><br/>Vinay Pathak as the ever helpful barber friend is funny and I hope to see him more with Shah Rukh in future films. The two share great comic chemistry.<br/><br/>The songs are all very good .Haule Haule is a cool crowd pleasure whereas Tujhmein rab dikhta has been shot really well..Dance pe chance flaunts Anushka's dancing capabilities but one big disappointment was the Phir milenge song.I loved this song the most on audio but the picturization was a bit too bland. None of the girls looked good except Lara. I was really expecting another Deewange.I remember this kind of song way back in the early 90's in Salman Khan's Patthar ke Phool..Wish Shah Rukh gave us something like that but then it ain't too bad either The story is actually a one page story and it is indeed commendable that they have stretched it past 2.5 hrs without boring us even once. RNBDJ is a compilation of many old Hindi films like Golmal, Hum dilde chuke sanam and Aaja Nachle but what makes this movie spectacular is Shah Rukh Khan.He is good as Raj but it is his rocking ,shocking ,fantabulous Suri ,who will be remembered for a long time.. Shah Rukh is ageing and it is visible and thank god, he is choosing the perfect roles.Its impossible to think of anybody else as Suri. Shah Rukh is there in almost every scene of the film and I can surely say that he has made this wonderful movie rock big time.<br/><br/>Suri might be lighting up Punjab but SRK had indeed lit up Rabne Bandi Jodi with his magical performance..<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10.."
"JaikrishnaVS","9","15","31","17 December 2008"," Everything above the ordinary about this movie
","Now I know what took Aditya 8 years to bring out his next movie, after Mohabatein. Nobody would have churned out such a heart-touching simple sa story and said it with equal simplicity and yet achieve the max possible mileage out of it. And even more amazing was the fact that there were just 3 characters( well that is if you count the two characters played by Sharukh as one ), with significant roles , in the whole movie. The screenplay was so tightly woven and every emotion was there to be seen and felt.<br/><br/>Shahrukh delivers yet again and his performance as Surinder from Punjab Power is going to remain etched to my memory for a long time. Raj was typical to an extent but there again there was a visible amount of peculiarity about the character that separated it from the usual ""Raj"" characters that we see so often in Bollywood movies. This man does know the point from which the 'dil se' (directly from heart) connection can be made.<br/><br/>New-comer Anushka as Taani literally swept me off my feet. To be honest, I never liked her in the promos that were shown on TV, but when I saw her on screen I was totally mesmerized by her charm, simply beauty and excellent dancing skills. She is here to stay. And of course Vinay Pathak's role as Suri's friend revelled with atmost conviction.<br/><br/>Okie , so here is how I would sum up : If did not see the movie till now then better go and watch it soon coz there is heart and soul in the movie n along with that a Rab Ki Bana hua Jodi. Cheers :)"
"Ibuk","7","10","19","16 April 2009"," Shah Rukh comes to the Chopra's rescue again
","After the financial disaster of Lamhe and Parampara, Yash Chopra casted a then relatively unknown actor called Shah Rukh Khan for his next venture Darr. Not only was the movie hugely successful but it made Shah Rukh an overnight sensation. Since then he has been the Chopra's lucky mascot,Dil to pagal hai,Veer Zaara(for Yash Chopra), DDLJ,Mohhabatein and Rab ne bana di jodi(for son Aditya Chopra) and Chak De India for Yash Raj films. Whilst it is not as good as DDLJ(then again what movie is?)it is a vast improvement on Mohabbatein. Yash Raj films produced 4 films last year, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom,Tara rum pum pum,Aaja Nachle and Chak De India, Chak De was their only hit and it was a massive one at that. So with Aditya Chopra going behind the camera lens Shah Rukh was the safest best.<br/><br/>Shah Rukh is given a very different look, he has a moustache and wears glasses. It tells a story of a very ordinary man who enters into a marriage with a lively girl after her father passes away. She despises him whilst he does everything to please her. She enters into a dancing contest but is embarrassed at the thought of having to dance with her ordinary husband. Then Shah Rukh has an idea, he takes on a completely new avtar and aims to make her fall in love with him. He cuts of his moustache and changes his look but doesn't have the courage to tell her. So he assumes two identities, one as her dancing partner and one as her husband. Things get complicated when she starts to fall in love with her dancing partner not realising that it's actually her husband. Shah Rukh realises that the dancing partner has to break her heart and she will have to go back to her husband. In the finale the ordinary husband shows off his moves he learnt from attending the dance classes and his wife falls in love with him. My enjoyment was marred by the improbable plot. I am not bearded and nor do I wear glasses, according to the logic of this movie if tomorrow I don a beard and wear glasses my own family will not be able to recognise me, that doesn't sound right to me. Now onto the music, as per usual in a Chopra production the songs are absolutely top notch. Haule Haule is very very good and Tuj me rab dikta hai is one of the best love songs I have heard in a long long time. RNBDJ is pretty entertaining leave your brains at the door fare from the Chopra's and much much better than I expected. Recommended by me,7/10"

","The movie hangs on the story line which is beyond absurd. The premise that the wife cannot identify her very own husband, without his mustache (and his formal attire probably) is not only ridiculous, but also sets new levels of stupidity. The wife not only flirts along with the new guy with ease, but also conveniently forgets to mention that she is actually married, only one the many flaws here. As far as the flow is concerned, its clearly a mess, and entirely mediocre. Putting God into all this mess makes only matters worse, and the clichés are just too over-used. Songs are average to say the least, which is itself an upside. Movie definitely worth a miss."

"ijzeren_jan","6","9","17","5 September 2009"," Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi
","Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is a typical example of a romantic comedy. A sympathetic, light movie, far from being ambitious. We have seen stories like this many, many times before, notably in teenager movies. Here's the basic formula of the latter: Nerd falls in love with Beauty Queen, but she doesn't care for nerds, and so, Nerd takes off his glasses, puts on jeans, and suddenly becomes a super-cool dude. Of course, Beauty Queen does not recognize him in his new outfit, and quickly develops a liking toward Mr. Cool. But now our hero has a problem: he is leading a double life, and the girl still does not love him, but merely his creation. His alter ego also becomes his rival. After a while, the girl comes to understand that there's more in life than just coolness, and that our Nerd at least has a good heart. And so, exit Mr. Cool. Nerd and Beauty Queen live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Formulaic, predictable and far from innovative, but let's be fair: that's what romantic comedies like this tend to be like. That does necessarily make it bad, because at last, everything depends on the script, the characters, the acting, the jokes, etc. And here, RNBDJ should be given credit: the story differs from the above-mentioned teenager movies in so far, that the characters are a bit older, and our nerd is not a nerd, but a boring, gray office clerk. Besides, he already is the husband of the girl he loves. His problem is that she doesn't love him, and in his efforts to gain her heart, the husband becomes his wife's lover simultaneously. Funny ingredients, indeed. Yet, RNBDJ has quite a few major flaws.<br/><br/>The first 30-40 minutes are well-made and fairly promising. Unfortunately, after that the whole thing becomes painfully predictable. The level drops and everything goes on as expected, without any particular surprises. But okay, we are dealing with a romantic comedy here, so let's not be tough. There are too many things I cannot buy, though. For example, Surinder's metamorphosis is only a matter of taking of his glasses, shaving off his mustache, a slightly different haircut and different clothes. How is it possible that his own wife wouldn't recognize him, while everybody else recognizes him immediately? Is she blind, or what? I also find the way Surinder handles his wife hard to swallow: he loves her more than anything, but yet, he keeps pretending to be the most boring husband on Earth. But then, she isn't entirely consistent in her behavior herself either. The moment when she finally understands that her husband loves her, comes way to easily, making it look like nothing but a cheap excuse for a happy end. Another weak point is Suri's fight with a Japanese sumo wrestler, especially this easy victory over an opponent who is five times heavier and ten times stronger. It would have been more effective if the wrestler hadn't left him in one piece. Looking how her husband was wounded and covered with blood, Taani might have understood something about his feelings toward her. At last, this whole dance competition was nothing but a joke, without any serious rivals and without any impressive performance. Here, the creators of the movie missed a splendid opportunity to add music and dance sequences in a fairly natural way.<br/><br/>A strong minus of this movie is the limited number of characters. Basically, there are only three: Surinder/Raj (Shahrukh Khan), Taani (the débutante Anushka), and Bobby (Vinay Pathak). All the rest are extras at best. Of these three, I like Vinay Pathak best. Although his role is a minor one, he plays it with so much flair and humor that he steals the entire movie. A really gifted actor, this Vinay, and a true asset for Bollywood. I find it hard to tell much about Anushka's role. Although she plays the female lead role, her character is surprisingly colorless and underdeveloped: a pretty face, nothing else. All in all, I think Anushka isn't doing bad, but nothing memorable either. And Shahrukh Khan? In my opinion, his creation of Surinder is cartoonesque, artificial and little credible. Same goes for his Raj character, although that one was at least supposed to be like that. All in all, Surinder is a matter of clothes, glasses and the like, rather than than a matter of acting. Just look at similar characters in other movies (like Tusshar Kapoor in ""Gayab"" or even Vinay Pathak in ""Aaja Nachle"" and ""Dasvidaniya"") and you will see how a role like that CAN be played. Sure, Shahrukh obviously has some comic talent and there are sequences in the movie where he does very well. But in general, I feel this role was just another piece of hackwork for him. Besides, he is really getting too old for roles like this.<br/><br/>As for the music, I'd say it is neither particularly bad, nor particularly good. A fairly good background score, one great song, the rest of the songs nothing special. Unfortunately, the video clips with song and dance have surprisingly little in common with the rest of the film (which really is a bad thing in a movie in which dancing plays a central role). To me, they are little more than grotesque showoffs of Shahrukh Khan's glitter and glamor, and all they seem to communicate is: ""Hey folks, don't forget that I'm not this boring Surinder or this idiot Raj at all, because... I am Shahkrukh Khan, the superstar you all love and adore, the King of Bollywood!"" <br/><br/>All in all, for a movie that is brought with much fanfare as the new Shahrukh Khan movie, I think RNBDJ is slightly disappointing. However, in spite of its several major and minor flaws, it should be said that it is still a nice and pleasant piece of footage, absolutely worth the effort of watching it at least once."

"tareque-laskar","4","20","45","13 December 2008"," A cheap trick bereft of the Adi Chopra magic
","There are numerous times in 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi' when Surinder Sahni (Shah Rukh Khan) keeps saying that it's God who is scripting this love story. Well, if that's the case then the almighty happens to be a rather lousy scriptwriter. Aditya Chopra's anticipated directorial return is lukewarm; there may be an extraordinary love story behind every ordinary jodi according to the tag-line but the film is firmly ordinary. Chopra, unlike his other films doesn't cast the canvas wide this time, delving only into a marriage arranged by fate between Surinder and Taani (debutante Anushka Sharma somehow never rises above your average soap performance). But he keeps the length of the film the same, which stretches the story far too thin for it to be even remotely plausible.<br/><br/>SRK fits decently well into 'ordinary-man-trying-to-be-awkwardly romantic' garb as Surinder hitting the ji-spot with his humble Punjabi demeanor but his alter ego, Raj (the guise he assumes to attend dance classes with his wife!) is old SRK in a new bottle and not one bit refreshing. As if to emphasize the lunacy going on in the name of a story, Taani falls for Raj never realizing for one instant that it has been her husband all the time! Raj's over the top performance looks so cooked up that sometimes even you, let alone Taani, will wonder if it's two different people.<br/><br/>The film takes too long to build up, and about as pacy as a turtle on a morning walk. The repetitive moments (the whole dance gig outlasts its welcome), self referential gags (once again YRF's Dhoom gets a mention) and ungainly plot twists pretty much kill off any salvage value left in the film. This one won't warm the cockles of your heart, unless you are an SRK worshiper or Anuskha's college mate, a bunch of whom were right behind me screaming up a racket right all through."
"Peter_Young","6","13","27","10 October 2009"," Entertaining but...
","Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is great as a leave-your-brains-at-home entertainer, but as a film it is not that great, although it does try to convey a message. I had a certain feeling at some points that it was just made for the sake of making. First, it is terribly unrealistic in whatever it deals with. The entire idea of Surinder, an ordinary square trying to go through a dramatic physical change to make his wife fall in love with him, is ancient. The transformation itself suffers from a ridiculously poor execution - it is completely unbelievable. A man who's been someone for his entire life cannot become another person within two hours and behave in the way Suri starts behaving. The fact that he leads a double life throughout the film with his own wife through both Suri and Raj and that she herself does not even suspect it is the same person is laughable. Although I don't say a thing like this is totally impossible, the story was at times slow paced and at times was filled with the usual Hindi film clichés. <br/><br/>Having said that, we don't watch films to see reality, but rather to escape it. The main element reminds me of Raj Kapoor's classic 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram', in which the only difference in the woman's appearance was the presence or the absence of the disfigured side of her face. So if Raj Kapoor could make that, I believe we cannot blame Aditya Chopra. Rab Ne is technically well made, and it has a fantastic soundtrack, all the songs being extremely enjoyable. The film's comedy is wonderful and there are many great moments and hilarious scenes. The cast is very good. Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in the refreshing role of Suri, and he is his funny and witty self as Raj, a side of his we are very familiar with. Anushka Sharma gives a surprisingly fantastic debut performance, and she is credible throughout the film. Vinay Pathak is amazing as Bobby and provides great support. Anyway, RNBDJ is not a great film and has its share of flaws but it is a good entertainer. I generally enjoyed the film and I do recommend it to those who are yet to watch it, though frankly I'm not planning to watch it again any time soon."
"yourz_sanju","9","13","27","14 December 2008"," How Extra-ordinary an ordinary story could be !
","Before going to theaters, there has been rumour that I heard about this movie that it seems long ans stretched. Critics has given one of the worse review to this movie. But I still took a chance to watch this movie. This movie isn't telling a story about a rich, poor, or some type of thug falling into love. This movie is about an unattractive sophisticated guy falling in love with beautiful modern girl. This is not it. There are more secrets to this movie once you start watching it. Even though I am not SRK's fan, I personally found this one better. There has been comparison with this movie to Ghajini or recalling of Chopra films such as Mohabbatein and Dilwalein Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. The story on which this movie is based on has no kind of similarity with above movie stated. This movie deserved to be watched and then commented. The first hour is about how Suri Sahni(SRK) and Taani(Anushka Sharma) got married though it's just a compromise. But slowly slowly the are working out on their relation although she has made herself clear about can't fall in love with him. Till the song "" Haule Haule"" finishes story seems bit slow, but then Taani request him of being part for dance competition. Suri agrees to her since he wants to see her smile. He changes his get up and goes to see her dancing. But due to a mis-understanding, he somehow gets involved in dance competition and co-incidentally also becomes her dance partner. He named himself as Raj. She couldn't recognize him so he keep acting like Raj. He also acts so flirty with her. Although She hates him, he still doesn't really change that much. But slowly she starts to get along with him now on. The second hour starts up with dance practice and Suri giving her excuse for not being home on time by saying her that he will be doing over time. Through all these Suri is being supported by his friend Bobby(Vinay Pathak) who contributes for the proceedings. He is worth watching and shares good part with Suri. He also creates few comical moments in the film. Since Taani is spending enough time with Raj and they do starts closer day by day. She starts to feel for him. Thats where the entire story takes different turn. Suri was set out to write his own love story, but it's going in different way. He decides not to tell her anything and leave everything on her to choose where Raj or Suri. Although Bobby tries to convince him to confess in front of her, he denies .<br/><br/>It was hard since Suri is less talking, always into work, and not much in contact with her. On the other side Raj is close to her in the third hour. Without spoiling your fun for watching this movie , in last I would like to conclude that even climax is amazing. Watching this movie was not only different experience, but also this movie is an example of fine class cinema. As far as music is concerned, it's not like previous movies of YRF movies. It's simply good. There is a song where Kajol, Preeti Zinta, Raani, Bipasha, and Lara Dutta is performing with SRK. SRK is soul of the movie and plays his characters well. Anushka never makes you feel like its her first time on screen. She is confident enough and likable. Vinay Pathak will be praised for his work on this movie. I don't think Aditya Chopra has made mistake making this movie."
"raghavramaiah-1","6","13","27","12 December 2008"," Rab Ne Bana de Jodi - Scripted to perfection
","Rab ne Bana De Jodi is a movie which definitely brings back the old touch of YRF movies. And who else could it be apart from the king himself,who would bring the magical touch with such a impeccable performance. A performance that will be definitely remembered for years to come. Shahrukh Khan plays Surinder Sahwni a pale-typical-middle-class-man working with Punjab Power marries Tanni a-beautiful-bold-fun-loving girl played by the débutant Anushka Sharma because of some uncalled circumstances and how life takes them from then on is something to watch out for. How well Surinder Sahwni transforms to Raj just to impress his own wife Tanni becomes her partner in a Dance Show in which she wishes to participate changing his looks completely into a Fun-loving-jovial- cheerful guy. The character of Raj adds the right humor in the right ratio with emotions and romance. The icing on the cake is Vinay Pathak who plays Bobby-a close friend of Surinder adding on that extra flavor making the movie look even better. Anushka Sharma steals the show with a performance that every other actress should watch out for. Very Impressive in her very first movie. Overall a great package that us as an audience would love to watch.<br/><br/>Aditya Chopra has directed another gem of a movie after his previous wonders DDLJ and Mohabbatein. Though still thought the Music could've been a lot better. ""Haule Haule"" being the most catchy of the lot makes you humm the tune till you reach your house from the theater's.<br/><br/>The movie is all about 1. Shahrukh's amazing act as always. 2. Anushka Sharma's refreshing performance. & 3. Aditya Chopra's directorial brilliance. <br/><br/>I would really suggest you to just pull any of your loved one and go watch this movie and you will be more than pleased after watching it. Entertainment Guaranteed. <br/><br/>And do stay till the credits roll. You've something more to enjoy."

"shaff-k","7","16","35","19 December 2008"," Inspite of all the negative points, Rab ne is a sweet romantic movie
","I was having a bad day when I was watching this movie, and I am glad that I saw this movie. <br/><br/>OK, the story is outdated.I mean at this era of live-in relationships and people hating the idea of marriage, this movie is about a married middle class couple. And many people do criticize the part where Shahrukh acts like two different personalities and his own wife doesn't recognize him while only his spectacles and mustache are missing and anyone can easily figure out that both are one and the same. ( When I first read the plot overview of the movie, I seriously laughed) <br/><br/>Well the most obvious explanation would be that Indian audience ( not all,but most of them) would not like idea of an Indian wife having an extra-marital affair especially when the movie is set in a place which is trademark of Indian culture. I do accept that Yash Raj have produced many movies like Salaam Namaste ( portraying live-in relationship) but that story wasn't set in India. It is OK to not respect your culture if you are not in India. :p <br/><br/>So Adi made his wife love the same person with a different personality which people will easily accept (though now we people are having difficulty in accepting it) Next negative of the movie would be its length and slow pace of the movie. But i really was glad that the movie lasted for long. :) <br/><br/>The movie is too predictable but actually that adds as the positive point for the movie, as somewhere in your mind you want that to happen and when it happens, you are glad that it happened. The movie has many outdated and clichéd dialogues which remind you of the Bollywood movies of the 80s, but Shahrukh's dialogue delivery just makes it seem alright ! :)<br/><br/>Well now the acting department. Shahrukh Khan did it again. well, I personally had this feeling that SRK normally overacts in movies directed by the chopras and johars. But this is an exception. He really did it well especially in the role of Surinder Sahni. He made everyone smile, laugh and cry. He really makes you feel for his character.<br/><br/>Anushka Sharma did an appreciable job doing all the justice to her role. And do watch out for Vinay Pathak!! His presence does really rock the screen.<br/><br/>The dialogues are smart and funny though it gets every clichéd at many parts. The music is average but the background score does deserve an appreciation.<br/><br/>I really guarantee you that it is a kind of movie where you will be smiling while tears roll down your cheeks! <br/><br/>I was really happy to see all the people in the cinema sit though the end-credits ( which is really a special part of the movie)<br/><br/>Its outdated typical bollywood movie, and I really hated the plot of the movie initially but now that i have watched it, I cant help but say, that is one of the sweet romantic movies Bollywood has ever delivered to us.<br/><br/>Its of course not an extraordinary movie, but the director has really turned a very ordinary story into a very sweet romantic movie full of heart, which is definitely worth a second watch ! :)"
"d1uw","7","19","43","12 December 2008"," A delicious over-cooked Indian dinner.
","A poorly tailored trailer does not begin to describe what is one couple's journey from the ordinary Jodi to extraordinary Jodi.<br/><br/>It's a Simple life story of a ordinary couple which goes from many ups and downs and finally typical Indian ending. What else one can need ?? My first impressions were, 'WOW, this Shahrukh guy has a tremendous screen presence (but, yikes, what a profile!)' and 'I love the old guy with the black hair' but still the potential of the character is very real with a touch of grass root and it's totally judged by king Khan. This is ShahRukh's best performance after ""SWADES"". ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" is a common man real life drama made into a modish glamorous movie. The film has a knowable love story made to look like an extraordinary film by Aditya Chopra as it comes with intense emotions, songs, dances, drama and succeeds in touching hearts of audiences. You enjoy, cry and have fun watching the film. Performance of Shahrukh is at its best and Anushka is made to match him.<br/><br/>Aditya Chopra writes and directs ably proving that his first movie ""DDLJ"" was no fluke . In fact ""MOHABBATEIN"" carries the same theme of love way ahead of ""DDLJ"" but in case of ""RNBDJ"" it's really disappointing. The dialogues are average but yes Shahrukh is surely over the top... but isn't that the reason why he is where he is today. no character has to justify their actions but for the fact that they are driven by their emotions... which is pretty common among common human beings..<br/><br/>The problem I have is with what exactly message the movie wants to spread? I feel that the movie is trying to say, love first other things later. Other things including personal relationships, office work and careers.<br/><br/>But to be honest, I didn't like this movie much, and after seeing about 100 Hindi films since then, I still don't like it much. It has some great songs that are almost completely destroyed by the ancient and I still can't sit through the endless love stories of the couple.<br/><br/>You don't have action thrills suspense but those going for Shahrukh Khan's film, can watch the movie. Since the film is coming with high expectations many won't find it up to their thoughts. <br/><br/>Overall, the story and the execution is a let down. The performances are decent and the movie sure has some light moments that would make you smile and laugh. The film fits all generations, families and ages and it can be expected to be a hit film. At the all important box-office, the opening has been surprisingly not upto expectations for such a huge film. It should pick up over the weekend. Going past the Week 1 figures of either Singh Is King or Om Shanti Om seems highly unlikely."

It would have made perfect sense because the geek and the weird fashion stud were both the same person and Taani loved them both!!!! But that wasn't meant to be; I watched with growing disgust as the honeymoon photos flipped by because an ugly, very middle-aged looking geezer and a young, beautiful woman didn't look like a convincing couple at all, more like a father and daughter!!

"saxena_ashes","5","14","31","3 January 2009"," Boring movie
","The movie begins with a situationally forced wedding between the blander than common-man Punjab-Power-lighting-up-your-life employee and his teacher's commoner than the girl-next-door daughter Anushka Sharma. Following which, they inhabit, but do not cohabit, in the mansion the small-town average man lived all alone. The moustached, oil-haired, bespectacled, white-full-sleeved-baggy-shirt-clad cartoon transforms into another spike-haired joker donning red/yellow/orange/peach/lavender/plum/violet tees and sporting large fashionable shades, in an attempt to win his wife's love. And the wife does not recognize the new guy as her husband, because she abhors him so much she never even saw him properly, and falls for the outspoken blabbermouth who emerges from the shy introvert every evening. There is another toon who provides all the paraphernalia required for this double life. And I still wonder what part did poor Rab play in all this.<br/><br/>Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi goes an as SRK shifts hamming from one character to the other, going through several emotions and changes of minds. The simple Simon character keeps smiling secretly and mischievously, as if he is the forged one, or is playing a prank. The good-for-nothing Anushka prepares lunch boxes for one (and asks them back in the evening without fail) and teaches choreographic steps to the other. She doesn't have any charm or appeal whatsoever, and an extra would have looked better. Vinay Pathak disappointed immensely. Sirji, you are not made for this kind of crappy shadowy roles when you can run an entire film on your own.<br/><br/>The only good part lays exactly at the end of the first hour, when Kajol/ Bipasha/ Lara/ Preity/ Rani appear on screen for less than a minute each, and SRK mimics Raj Kapoor/ Devanand/ Shammi Kapoor/ Rajesh Khanna/ Rishi Kapoor, to the tunes of an intelligently written and choreographed song even with stupid lyrics: Hum Hain Rahi Pyaar Ke, Fir Milenge Chalte Chalte. You can listen to Haule Haule too.<br/><br/>Shahrukh's last venture, the year-old Om Shanti Om is closely paralleled in Rab Ne.... SRK in two characters, one introvert, timid and sincere (an underdog there), the other flamboyant, smart and vivacious (a successful superstar there), one new girl in the lead role, one good actor screwing up his reputation being a sidekick to SRK, a star-studded light-hearted song, even the release timing at the end of year, coinciding with another actor's who allegedly has a dog named after him. <br/><br/>How much ever money RNBDJ would have made, SRK-Adi's third project together is nowhere compared to their first (DDLJ). The second one, Mohabbatein, was likable too, maybe because of AB and Aish. But I would nevertheless agree with Shahrukh, SRK and Adi ek saath hain, kuchh to hoga, dekh to lo ek baar, though I'd rate it only 5 on 10."

"cowboythakur","3","13","29","17 December 2008"," Total Rip-off
","Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is a totally flawed concept that you start believing in true love when you see the lord (aka Rab) in a human (to some which could also mean that everyone loves the same face!). Desis (Indians) in the United States have very few Indian movie options and so we kind of watch most that are released here. I made a terrible choice last weekend of watching ""Rab ne bana di Jodi"" over ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Post 1996 (when DDLJ was released) Yash Raj et al. have created a ""recycle bin"" of their movie fundas, or I should call it over saturated movie mantras. What Chopras failed to imagine was that they needed a good plot and a decent performance from SRK to make this movie watchable,not a Punjab background and girl begging SRK (again!) to take her with him. I still wonder what made Aditya come up with such a plot (he probably spoiled his DDLJ fame this time). Anyways, movie started with Amritsar (India) in background followed by this guy: Surinder Sahni. Now I appreciate the typical middle class look Shahrukh Khan (SRK) was given (massively oiled hair, plated ol'fashioned trousers with sneakers!). But then starts SRK's acting (over-acting). Indeed he is a good actor (check Swades) but for some reason he has this habit of making the stupidest faces ever (he started this from movie ""Duplicate""). I personally don't think there was any need to use plethora of ""hello ji"" (kind of a ""hello sir"" in Hindi/Punjabi) and SRK could never make it sound like Punjabi ""hanji"", if at all he was trying. Anyways, movie takes off and reaches a saturation point within 30-45 minutes and stays there for remaining two hours or more, with occasional comedy scenes. You got to ignore stuff like ""wife doesn't recognize you if you get rid of mustaches..Blah blah blah"". And then there are scenes where SRK talks to himself or a Mannequin forever. Man! Can someone please screen such shots before actually releasing the movie? This movie definitely needed a much early termination point. I don't believe in reading background story if I want to watch a movie...but for this one it doesn't matter. 40 min in the theater and you know what next and what's going to happen in the end. The movie leaves you scratching your head for remaining hours figuring out that how can you spend > $10 on such a movie."
"bobbysing","5","13","29","12 December 2008"," An OK feel good movie but entertaining only in parts.
","A Shahrukh movie along with Aditya Chopra having a unique look had great expectations. And fans all over were just ready to fall in love with the movie in any case. But the final outcome may not be upto the standards expected. In a short review RNBDJ is an OK sweet movie having good performances by the lead pair, has all predictable content, a bit lengthy and entertains only in few parts. No doubt Shahrukh's fan following is capable of making it a Hit, but the movie leaves the viewer somehow less satisfied.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is the starting 20 minutes where all the characters are being introduced impressively and you easily start liking the narration. Using the Punjabi feel, the current favorite of Bollywood, Aditya captures The Golden Temple beautifully and sets the mood showing the streets of Punjab. Everything is fine till the main plot of a dance competition is disclosed. From there onwards the movie starts entertaining in gaps. The plot moves around how a Husband (Shahrukh) tries to win his wife's (Anushka) love by playing a double role of a shy husband at home and of a happening and chill out dance partner in a dance competition.<br/><br/>After the transformation of Shahrukh as a fun loving dance partner, the movie is completely open to the viewers as if they have already read the script. Every sequence from then onwards is all predictable and you also know how the movie is going to end too. Still as a loyal fan you keep waiting for more entertaining sequences but they are not too many to come. The movie never surpasses the mood set in first 20 minutes, so you start feeling lazy at times too. Whole movie relies on the two main lead characters and they both carry their part with perfection. But as the storyline has no exciting twists and turns to offer so it remains a sweet movie, nothing extraordinary, far below the expectations.<br/><br/>Among the merits of the movie are the top rate performances of Shahrukh and Anushka. Shahrukh plays the role realistically without falling in the trap of over-reacting. He surely deserves appreciation for the simplicity he adds to the role of a common man and his visible support to the newcomer. Anushka surprises with such a professional debut very close to just perfect. Her dialogue delivery and confidence doesn't reveal that it is her first movie. She may not have the looks to kill but has got the talent to sustain. Vinay Pathak is purely lovable in his act and provides a good support to Shahrukh. These are the only three characters around which the movie revolves and that works as a drawback to the movie because you miss some more catchy characters in the plot. Apart from good performances there is nothing extra special about the movie to write on. It really does not look like a Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra movie.<br/><br/>Among the weak points, first comes the thin and all predictable storyline. The moment viewer comes to know the plot he starts losing interest in it. Secondly the comic sequences in the movie, like the motorcycle run by Anushka, Gol-Gappa eating scene, both watching films in the theater and Shahrukh's fight with Sumo wrestler are not convincing or entertaining at all. There are not many great moments to share in the direction. Thirdly the whole dance completion thing is played too simply and in minute details. There are no major judges to the completion and there are no major competitors to watch too. There are no lavish dance performances in the competition and Shahukh-Anushka pair simply wins the contest as they were the only couple competing there. Their final performance at the stage is completely uninteresting and unimpressive. The whole dancing couple contest and Stage sets were not as expected from an Aditya  Yash Chopra movie. The glossy and stylish look of a Yash Chopra movie is totally missing. In fact it seems to be a film from a not so established production house. Fourthly, the length of the movie pinches you at times and you feel some scenes to get over fast giving way to more good ones. And lastly there is a major flaw in the direction. If a garage owner (Manmeet Singh - from whom Shahrukh buys his new car), can recognize Shahrukh in his new avatar, then how his own wife is not able to recognize him.<br/><br/>Musically, the movie is weak too with only one song to remember that is ""Haule Haule"". Interestingly this only good song is also an inspired version of a Adnan Sami number. The other added attraction is a song featuring Kajol, Lara Dutta, Rani Mukherjee, Priety Zinta and more. But this song is not able to impress too as it was not even one tenth entertaining as the song in ""Om Shanti Om"". Songs have been a merit of all Shahrukh-Yash Raj movies, but this one stands far out of that impressive list.<br/><br/>In few words, Rab Ne Ban Di Jodi, fulfills the expectations only to some extent. Everyone was expecting an entertaining movie with sequences of laughter, fun, youthfulness and excitement. But there are very few such moments in the movie. Aditya is not able to create the same magic as he did in DDLJ. It's not a bad movie, but it is not a highly entertaining movie too. You will surely feel restless at few places and also bound to hear some noises in the cinema hall.<br/><br/>In the end, I would like to mention that after the first 20-25 minutes of the movie, the most entertaining part of RNBDJ is the Voice Over of Shahrukh along with the end credit rolls sharing the experiences of their successful Honeymoon in Japan. A Well executed ending makes you feel good while you leave the theater."

","I was a bit anxious when I went to watch RNBDJ, One because the film hadn't received great reviews, Two because Yash Raj Films of late have been competing with each other for ""The MOST Pathetic Film of the Millennium"" award and last (but not at all the least) because I hadn't liked Aditya Chopra's last directorial venture, Mohabbatein.<br/><br/>So I went inside the theater fearing the worst..... and came out with a smile on my face. I won't say this film is anywhere near DDLJ, but its much better than Mohabbatein, Veer-Zaara and the other Yash Raj Love stories of the past few years put together.<br/><br/>The film is all about Surinder Sahney alias Suri and his attempts to make his wife fall in love with him. How he does it, well, I won't reveal it! But suffice to say that the journey is pretty wonderful, making you laugh and cry at times, with a Happy Ending, of course! The music is not extraordinary, but quite hummable. The dancing background is kept to the minimum (which is a relief). There are no big dances as in Jhoom Barabar Jhoom! Of the cast, Vinay Pathak as the best friend and ally is superbly funny. Anushka Sharma looks pretty and does a decent job as the cute Taani-ji. But of course, the film is about THE KING and he does not disappoint at all! His Suri and Raj are equally brilliant! Especially the scene where he bares his soul to a mannequin...... Shah Rukh is just Awesome (as usual!) All in all, its a good entertainer. Not an out and out comedy, not really a Mills n Boon Romance and definitely not like the boring, sobbing movies shown in the film itself! Don't expect a DDLJ, and you will definitely enjoy this one, I can vouch for it!!"

","To be honest, even if you are willing to buy into that bizarre premise - that Taani fails to recognize her own husband because he's shaved his moustache, lost the spectacles and picked a funky hairstyle - Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is still an exhausting watch because it's such a predictable story, because it recycles the same old clichés, and because the characters are so poorly developed. Going back to the oldest trick in the book to solve all his screenplay problems, director Aditya Chopra drags in Rab, or God to solve the film's decidedly uncomfortable conflict of whether Taani should run away with her lover, who's actually her husband-in-disguise; or whether she should stay with her husband? You see, the message this film delivers repeatedly is that you know it's real love when you see Rab or God in another human being. When it's not peddling God and its theories on love, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is really an antiquated love story that is regressive, chauvinistic and plain stupid in parts. Which is sad if you think about it, because stripped down to its basics there is clearly a sensitive idea there - about facing one's insecurities, and about coming to terms with the fact that it's okay to be yourself. Aditya Chopra's return to direction after eight years is marked by a flawed script, which in turn spawns a disappointing film. Where's the smart dialogue and the spirited characters that defined his debut film, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge? There's no trace of either in this film. The problem then, at the root of Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, is that much like those artificial sets in the film, the emotions too are contrived.If you must, watch it for Suri(SRK); he's the only honest thing about this film."

"TuFNuT","7","12","28","12 December 2008"," An Overcooked Cuisine
","What happens when you over cook the best recipe? Result is a cuisine that you eat when you are hungry without relishing it. The most awaited, Aditya Chopra's Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is just like that overcooked cuisine which the audience is expected to digest just because it has the magic ingredient, the Badshah of Hindi cinema Shahrukh Khan starring in it.<br/><br/>The plot is about the unrequited love of a geek, meek and a shy small town man married to a pretty girl in unexpected circumstances. How will he win his love and make the only woman he has ever loved, love him in return? This interesting plot premise, despite taking off well in the first 20 odd minutes is battered thanks to shoddy writing which lacks both conviction and logic.<br/><br/>The only well written and endearing character is of this geeky guy  Surinder played by SRK. The new actress Anushka Sharma comes across as beautiful, confident, and charming. She fits perfectly in the role of a Punjabi girl, giving a good performance for a newcomer. Raj, the cool, clean shaved and hip Jatt guy again played by SRK is a bad caricature of the romantic image of 'Rahul' and 'Raj' created by SRK and Yash Raj over the years. After the initial interest, this character too fails to make the storyline any interesting. So there you have it when in the script two out of the three central characters are ineffective, you know it's time to fasten the seat belt as this flight is in some trouble.<br/><br/>But this flight somehow doesn't crash. What saves it is SRK who gives it his all to make Surinder and Raj as endearing as possible. He is the sole reason keeping you on board. SRK tries hard and succeeds to engage you emotionally in some sporadic scenes, like the small and few chocolate pieces hidden on a big plain biscuit. Also, the success of a romantic comedy is determined by the number of magical moments the lead pair have on screen. In RNBDJ, unfortunately these moments are almost nonexistent. But right from the last few minutes to the end of the credits the film ends on a creative, humorous and feel good note which again spares it from the wrath of the audiences.<br/><br/>The film has only four main songs, Haule Haule and Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte being the highlights. Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte is a tribute to the great romantic heroes of the yester years and has five leading ladies of Bollywood dancing in five different segments. In segment one the duo of SRK and Kajol dancing together one again show us why they were and are still the best looking pair in Hindi Cinema. And In the same song in segment five, Rani Mukherjee looks totally out of place. Nevertheless this track is an extremely entertaining affair. The movie is shot well and has good production value which you expect from Yash Raj. The Amritsar setting looks very authentic.<br/><br/>So all in all 'Rab Ne' is a watchable but underwhelming affair. Aditya Chopra is below average in his duties as script writer, dialog writer and director. In fact, after Mohabbatein, he has plummeted to a new low. There is a lesson to be learnt for directors who lack a great script and expect SRK to deliver the goods for them each time no matter how puerile the plot. And SRK needs to watch DVDs of Swades and Chak De and remind himself of what he is capable of doing and in future choose roles of substance. Sadly, RNBDJ is not going to be a highlight or landmark in his golden career."

","I am great fan of Sharukhan. He is actor who stands taller than the crowd. For me this movie was way beyond I had imagined. I usually don't want Hindi movies or like usually Sanjay Khan vs other new generation actors.<br/><br/>Depiction of Amritsar is very realistic and even Ms. Chadda will agree (Bride and Prejudice) that she could have added some more here and there.<br/><br/>I was watching this with my wife and all along tears kept rolling. The pain is portrayed so well, I never thought the actress was acting the first time. She was as seasoned in acting or say natural that I kept on thinking about Rani Mukharjee (Not comparing to Ash because it needs 2nd or 3rd to prove).<br/><br/>Moreoever the pain was with both sides and they both were oblivious of actually each others pain (it is not easy to understand what the other party is thinking when you are busy in your own thoughts.) Sharukh represents a true simple middle class Punjabi (Rather West Punjabi) who spends life in very simple way all through. As Raj, it proves how Indians could be deceptive as Surinder's and transform in Raj's (West) of America (Pretty simple evolutionary jump which for some is unfathomable generation gap).<br/><br/>Ankusha has shown all the roles of serious as well as a modern actress, like, keeping it up with Sharukh's talent. On top of it she is extremely beautiful and you will be forced to devour the beauty.<br/><br/>Ending and other parts of the plot are as usual we have in Hindi movies and cannot be translated. For me Sharukh is like an alien who entertains us and is giving message of brotherhood while holding back his identity."

","This is a well disguised, gender reversed version of 1970s movie 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram'. Ironically Surindar calls himself 'Raj Kapoor' for his alternate identity. A mid level electricity company employee, Surinder (SRK) is helping his college professor with his daughter's wedding when news arrives that the groom has died in an accident. The professor sustains a heart attacks and on his death bed convinces his daughter (Anushka) and Surinder to marry so he can die in peace. With more than a decade of age difference and having sustained two losses, the wife tells Surinder that she will try to be a good wife but will never be able to love him. With help of a hairstylist friend, Surinder creates an alternate persona for himself which is younger, peppy and somewhat loud to win heart of his wife. He flirts with his own wife as his alter-ego 'Raj' in a dance class and at night at home keeps his distance from as himself. The rest is entertaining but quite predictable. Other than 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram', you see glimpses of 'Mask' and 'Mrs. Doubtfire' in the story. It is rather unbelievable that a wife would not recognize her husband just because he has a new hairdo, a pair of sunglasses and has shaved his mustache (as it was in 'SSS' that a husband would not recognize his wife just because she has covered half of her face).After two decades, SRK has finally learned to harness his over the top antics and started giving understated performances. Fortunately for him, his last three movies - Don, OSO and RNBDJ have given him chance to do two characters  one over the top and one subdued. He has taken advantage of all and actually got better with each movie. Anoushka is very impressive and Vinay Pathak is emerging as a deserving member of a very impressive group of supporting actors of Bollywood which includes likes of AnupamKher and Boman Irani. He will be considered one among them pretty soon. All technical departments are adequate if not great. Overall a decent experience."

","This movie is, for me, the best movie of the year. I LOVED IT! It makes you laugh, cry and makes almost all of your other emotions come out within the movie. Here are my ratings.<br/><br/>Performance/Acting: Shahrukh Khan : 10/10; Anushka Sharma : 10/10; Vinay Pathak : 10/10; Direction : 9.5/10; Production : 10/10; Everything else : 9.5/10 (The script took the marks down a little) OVERALL : 9.8/10<br/><br/>Synoposis: This movie is about a simple man named Surinder Sahni or Suri, who is played by Shahrukh Khan. At the start, him and his ""LOVE"" Taani (Anushka Sharma) get married. Actually, Taani, at first, is scheduled to marry someone else, who is not shown at all in the movie. Taani's ""future"" husband dies in an accident on the way and Taani's father gets a heart attack after that. He asks Taani to marry Suri. They both agree. Taani says to Suri that she'll be his wife, but will never ""love"" him. :( She then finds a poster about a dance competition and she wants to participate. Although Suri is a simple guy, he agrees.<br/><br/>Suri goes to Bobby Khosla (Vinay Pathak) and Bobby does a complete makeover of Suri and turns him into a cool, bad boy Raj. Raj and Taani first meet at the Dacing Jodi Competition (Raj is Taani's partner). At first Taani thinks that Raj is an awful guy, but she later changes her mind. Suri now wants to know if she loves Suri or Raj. He keeps on disguising as Raj.<br/><br/>Just about at the end, Taani asks Raj to run away with her. At her last day (competition day), Suri and Taani go to the Golden Temple. She asks god for one thing. That is to see god in a person and turns out that it's Suri. She decides not to run away with Raj. Raj doesn't show up at the competition, but Suri does. Suri and Taani get 2 free tickets to Japan and spend their honey-moon there. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY! :) Bye"

","Let me first say that it is not in the league of DDLJ. Having said that, there are hardly any such films.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it is a very real film. And like CDI, the trump card here is the victory of the underdog. The difference though is that the underdog as well as the front runner is played by SRK. The movie is predictable at times, but hats off to Adi for the presentation and treatment. I would spoil it by saying anything else. To sum up, you are surely gonna enjoy and appreciate the movie (if you don't go there with the purpose of nitpicking) The best part about the movie is Casting, it is spot on, and SRK's act as Surinder has to be seen to be believed. One of the most amazing performances, and right up there with his best. His other persona is the RAJ one, but this one's an ace too, as he spoofs every romantic notion, romantic movies, including his own spoof. I enjoyed it very well. the transformation of Surinder into Raj is funny and believable. It is as believable as one of us trying to imitate a star after seeing his movie. Anoushka is awesome, in fact, she really steals many scenes, and holds her own, and sometimes even betters SRK.<br/><br/>Songs and background music is authentic and blend seamlessly with the movie. All the songs are well shot and placed in the film. Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte song is awesome, while Rab dikhta hai is truly heartwarming! Negatives: Few Scenes are cheesy, and few Over The Top.<br/><br/>Overall, 8/10.<br/><br/>PS: Don't miss the END CREDITS!!"

The movie starts off with some good scenes, but as and when movie proceeds, it fails to grip. The role of Raj was a very lengthy and sometimes it got very bored towards the ending. Also I was a bit irritated that everyone was 'ji' to everyone. It was fun for a while but then it was a bit too much. Though the ending was expected, it was kind of boring.<br/><br/>All in all one time watch for SRK fans and for other, its OK if you miss it.

"manoj-aryan","4","7","17","18 December 2008"," We want more Suri!
","When credit rolls in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi a voice-over of Surindar Singh Sahani played by Shahrukh Khan in trimmed mustache and without furrowed brows shows us his honeymoon album with disarming charm are some of the embracing moments you will witness in a movie. It captures the spirit of Surinder Sahani whom we now call Suri. He is a simple man. Bathing under tap water, having bread-butter from his toaster every day, attire entirely formal with the exception of doohickey sports shoes. He carries a laptop shoulder bag and rides iconic Bajaj scooter, works in some firm called Pujab Power (may be a government job). This man can easily go unnoticed or disappear altogether in crowd. At first he can be mistaken as a parody of common man as measures to establish him are such extremes and efforts can be damned as effusive or maudlin but there is indelible sincerity in all this manifestation.<br/><br/>While promoting the film SRK told media his director described Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi as a love story of ordinary man. His director is not ordinary let me unnecessarily remind you. Aditya Chopra is in our top filmmakers gave two timeless classics DDLJ and Mohobbattein. Indeed I will take his word and expect something magical again. My expectations were not unreasonable.<br/><br/>Suri's eyes catches Taani (debutante enchanting Anushka Sharma, boy! she can dance) while sipping some Mazza or Slice with straw. He tells us shyly it was love-at-first-sight. In hurriedly quick cutting scenes they get married as a result of a mishap. Girl has just lost her father. On the night of wedding he collects all his belongings in a box and moves out to store-room on terrace. Camera swiftly moves up from terrace room to down on both. There is a beautifully poignant scene where she confesses that she will surely be a devoted wife but can't love him ever. He tells her he didn't know what love really is and didn't know any ""ladies"" until her. Now our hero wants to win her heart. This is so far and, start of a beautiful love story, right? But no, spell is broken by entry of Suri's alter ego -Raj.<br/><br/>Suri gets into new avatar of Raj with the help of his buddy Bobby (Vinay Pathak) who runs a saloon (they share some cracking moments). Raj is clean shaved, no mustache, spiked-hair and goggles. Why do this? He wants to be hero to the girl of his dreams. She doesn't recognize him at all. Ironically he is parody of Bollywood pop culture buffs. He bluffs ""style"", ""attitude"", paints himself in all possible colors, try to appear flamboyant, quote endlessly sometimes famous often corny songs-dialogues from n number of movies and act funny (not in a charming way). He annoys her (and audience) with his ceaseless flirting and clowning. She doesn't recognize him and they end up as dance partners in a competition.<br/><br/>Film crumbles from entry of the second character and grows in absurdity to sheer disappoint until it bounces back in its near damn good climax in flash-dance-glory. It does intermittently come to life, throws some dilemmas and asks difficult questions. What if girl falls for the second guy? She is a chaste girl, a loyal wife. Yes, writer-director's exalted faith in pure love that runs through his previous works is still here but his protagonist is lost amid filmy treatment and director's ambiguous approach. I wish this would have been the ultimate love story our bespectacled Clark Kent but no. Damn it Suri, we wanted you more!"

","I have watched the movie on first day not just for SRK,also for the director Aditya Chopra. The other two films directed by him was excellent and made a mile stone in Indian film industry. After watching the movie 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi' it seems to me that it was made by some other person,not him. The film is based on a absurd story line. SRK has nothing to do with the same poor script. The song with so many popular Bollywood faces is now becoming common and boring. Its difficult to believe that people can make this kind of film in 2008. The movie in all aspect is a eye torture. Only Anushka Sharma is a little bit of breeze in this (bad)film."

"DICK STEEL","10","6","14","20 December 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi
","Surinder Sahni is your typical routine joe who works for Punjab Power, meek and gentle, and a nerd to most. His love life is practically zilch, but on a visit to his old school teacher's home, he gets captivated by the beauty and vivaciousness of his teacher's daughter Taani (Anushka Sharma), who has heard about him because of the frequent comparisons her father makes. But that day turns out to be a tragedy instead, with her fiancé and in-laws meeting with a fatal accident, and her father coincidentally suffering a stroke. A decision was made then, for her to be betrothed and married to Surinder, someone whom her father trusts, but this shotgun, arranged marriage turns out to be a loveless one for Surinder.<br/><br/>There's this albatross hung around his neck, because his arrival heralded the darkest period in Taani's life, and thus was told upfront that while she can be a good wife to him, but she will never love him. Naturally this breaks Surinder's heart because there's nothing in this world he wouldn't do in order to bring her happiness that was originally hers, if he had in the first place not been associated with pain when he entered her life. While he has some little itsy-bitsy happiness stemmed from Taani's taking care of him, he still feels shattered knowing that whatever sincerity, care and concern he'll be showering on her, will have zero effect in trying to win her over.<br/><br/>Opportunity presents itself of course, when Taani, bored with being a housewife, signs up for a dance class with Surinder's sponsorship. With the help of his good friend Bobby (Vinay Pathak), he transforms himself to the suave romantic hero with an alter ego Raj, crafted according to the male leading men in films that his wife appreciates, and decides to take ownership on his love life by wooing Taani from scratch with this new, outgoing persona. But alas as we all know, such a plan becomes a recipe for disaster, because while Taani would not change her heart for Surinder, he has now taken the extreme into becoming someone totally different, and thus struggles with the pain of living a lie, especially when his plan becomes successful and leaves him pondering over whether to live a lie forever, just to be with her.<br/><br/>Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi thus becomes embroiled with plenty of situational comedy involving different identities, but at its core is still a very strong romance story dealing with the notion of unconditional love without expecting anything in return, which Taani fails to fathom why anyone would go to such lengths in order to bring happiness to her life. Written and directed by Aditya Chopra, this story is strictly for the romantics at heart, otherwise you'll naturally balk at the thought that nobody could recognize Shah Rukh Khan whether or not he's the ordinary man Surinder, or the styled up Raj, especially when his wife Taani is the one who is blind-sided. But of course you can live with it if you buy into the whole Clark Kent- Superman secret identity where a pair of spectacles does wonders.<br/><br/>The literal translation of the title means ""a couple made by god"" and as you know the man up there has a sense of humour sometimes, preferring to allow the couple to go through a number of painful periods in order to strengthen their resolve for each other. However, the story still steered very clear from the darker themes such as adultery, although Surinder and Raj are essentially the same person, Taani's falling for the latter does come after a long period of courtship, and curiously, she doesn't reveal her marital status till late. So while that theme might rear its ugly head once in a while when you pause from the incessant bonding between Raj and Taani, it doesn't get broached beyond that.<br/><br/>Being a Bollywood movie would also mean plenty of song and dance, and being set against the backdrop of a dance competition, it brings about opportunities for the characters to hit the dance floor their moves. Shah Rukh Khan gets to showcase both extremes in character, one being the nerd with two left foot, while the other being at the opposite with plenty of smooth moves to show off. If anyone's in doubt of his acting ability, I guess this one movie will show what he's capable of. In fact, between his portrayal of Raj and Surinder, I prefer the latter more, because he had fused some wonderful nuances into his Surinder, that makes him an instantly likable character, while at appropriate moments, his portrayal shows you that tender side of him as well as the internal emotional struggles he has to go through as he woos his wife. Newcomer Anushka Sharma holds her own against the veteran as the young wife Taani, who's at constant odds with her marital obligations, and on the other knowingly falling in love with someone whom she becomes dangerously attracted to. Of course what she fails to realize is that they're the same person after all, and her best performance comes from the finale where you can see how she reacts to her make believe world come crashing down under the weight of realization.<br/><br/>I guess loving someone unconditionally is that constant challenge, if it's at all possible extending otherwise from that of a mother toward her child. This film is an ode to that kind of loving emotion, and to a certain extent it puts the other person on a higher pedestal than oneself. I would prefer to overlook the flaws in the movie if any, and highly recommend his one to all the die-hard romantics out there, given the excellent performances, story as well as the beautiful songs that puts romance back into the air. An average joe can have an extraordinary romance, and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi captures that wonderfully."

","When I got out of the movie hall I noticed one thing which is in my view is not regular sight. What I saw was many middle aged couples were smiling and holding hands tightly. One could sense the positive vibes they are carrying out of the movie hall.<br/><br/>The movie is not DDLJ but is very simple very logical and very heartening. The story is of these two completely different personalities. One who just understood what love is and another is trying to run away from it. There is every possibility that this has happened in many Indian homes if not this much dramatic but somewhat on similar lines.<br/><br/>The Characters are so believable and uncomplicated that you within seconds start relate to them. There is one Suri in each Indian middle aged male who wants to be Raj for his wife, Raj who is dashing, funny, and stylish. And which is not wrong. Suri tries to be filmi hero for Taani but eventually realizes that its not ones looks or talks but its the purity of ones heart which matters. Suri is simple may be you can call him little boring but by no means a pathetic a**, with whom you should show some sympathy. When the movie starts you will laugh at his acts or looks but eventually you will be clapping for him. Taani is any Indian girl you will find in every other house in India. She is daring and wants to move ahead in life but she still believes in constitution of marriage and Indian culture. SRK is at very best as Surinder Sahani. He has again showed how brilliantly he understands the script and overall plot of the film. Behind those spectacles the eyes speaks a lot in this movie which also add to this charm. He portrays Suri which such a conviction and ease that after few scenes you stop referring him as ShahRukh. As Raj he don't have much to do  he has done this in the past. Anushka is fresh and faces camera with confidence. In many scenes she has given very strong support to SRK.<br/><br/>I will say go and watch this movie which somewhere is reflection of our life. And don't get up from chairs until the credits are over, I bet you wont stop blushing."

","When Surinder's (Shakrukh Khan) mentor dies of a heart attack, Surinder is forced to fulfill his mentor's dying wish: to marry his daughter. Surinder complies with his mentor's wishes however the marital bond between himself and Taani (Anushka Sharma) is merely for the sole purpose of allowing Taani a place to live and not one of love. As an introvert, Surinder finds it difficult to express his deep love but finds a solution when Taani joins a dancing competition: transforming himself into Raj, an extrovert and flamboyant man who catches the attention of Taani.<br/><br/>The story gets off to a slow start and steadily gains pace as the film progresses and this greatly mimics how Surinder's life changes from routine to excitement. At heart the film is a simple love story, echoing how Surinder fails to attract the attention of someone he loves and having to become someone he is not in order to do so. There is a nice, simple message to be learnt here and the love story is not entirely clichéd so the film does have a somewhat refreshing take on the ingrained romance tales of Bollywood. This does not however stop the many scenes where Surinder is battling with his love for Taani becoming a little repetitive by the film's end. With a little tighter editing on these parts the film would have also cut a little off its long run time but the film's length is a minor disturbance at best. The film is also fairly humorous, but not quite like Dostana's minute-by-minute comedy. As well the humour does not feel constructed but instead natural giving the context of some scenes a fairly real undertone.<br/><br/>There is a slight mishap on the subtitling for English viewers. There is the odd spelling mistake and there are a few moments where the subtitling makes some comments from a single character appear as if one character begins and another ends of the sentence, when it is evident that is not the case. Sadly the credit sequence lacks subtitles altogether and the credits are important in gaining an understanding into the aftermath of the ending with a monologue. While it can be accumulated as to what is being talked about, the monologue itself is fairly humorous and English viewers will e missing out.<br/><br/>Surprisingly the acting ensemble is stronger than expected with even the minor characters being more than adequate to the job. Of course Shahrukh Khan is as amazing as ever and anyone who thought he might be losing his shine will discover he is not. In the film Khan has to portray two different personalities for the same character as he attempts to live a double-life. His nuances in the shy and uncertain Surinder are heavily contrasted by his performance as the outgoing and hip Raj, and Khan does so with consistency. The biggest surprise is Anushka Sharma. Her debut performance is delightful, full of vigor and, most importantly, believable whether her character is full of joy or sadness. You would be hard pressed to say she was an amateur. In fact she embodies a top notch Bollywood actress with good acting coupled with a natural prowess for dancing. Sharma makes the music sequences she is in far more enjoyable to watch then they ought to be.<br/><br/>That said the music, and accompanying dances, is a slight disappointment. Neither category is bad by any means but they don't reach the optimal level of excitement to truly heighten the love story. But as said Sharma does appear in her element in these sequences and Khan's experience shows through so any sequence with these two dancing together is a worthwhile watch.<br/><br/>There are no sexual connotations, violence and very little use of language, making the film a true family treat.<br/><br/>Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is an amazing film which tells an equally amazing, albeit simple, story. With stellar acting, especially from newcomer Anushka Sharma who compliments Shahruhk Khan well, and good detail to creating a natural context, it becomes a pity that the film is let down by its musical sequences. They are not bad but not up to par with the rest of the film, and when coupled with other niggles the film is unable to be as moving as it potentially could. Still it's a worthwhile film and not one to be missed."

","I had no idea what this was all about as I hadn't watched many of the promos of this movie. But what I did know was who it starred and that it had a new actress and that it was filmed in Amritsar.<br/><br/>A young woman who is fun loving, flamboyant, basically an extrovert, is about to marry a man she loves. However fate takes a turn and she marries a man who is sincere, realistic, government employee, hard working  basically an introvert. The problems are that he is much older than her and there's no love on behalf of the woman and he is unable to express his love for her.<br/><br/>The movie stars Shahrukh Khan, Vinay Pathak, Anupam Kher, Kajol, Priyanka Chopra, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukherjee, and Farida Jalal. But it does go on to introduce newcomer Anushka Sharma. This is directed by Aditya Chopra and co  produced by himself along with his father, Yash Chopra and Shahrukh Khan. The music is superbly given by Salim Suleman.<br/><br/>What a way for the newcomer, Anushka Sharma to make an entry into the movies  introduced by Yashraj and acting in her first film as King Khan's heroine! Indeed she has made an impact with this movie and has gone on to prove that she is a good actress. She is able to use her facial expression brilliantly and her eyes are expressive as well. She has done a good job of her role in this, her, first movie. In time to come, this actress can give some of the other actresses of today a good challenge. One is able to see that she is determined and is capable of giving a good performance.<br/><br/>With Shahrukh? Well what can one say except that it is unusual to see him the way he does in this film! His performance, as usual is beyond doubt, good and he manages it extremely well. He has also made Yashraj laugh after all the disastrous movies that have been released from them earlier. Not only that it has probably made the cinema owners smile as well due to the opening weekend being able to rake in the money that it has. He has once again proved why he is where he is and why he is called ""King Khan."" Its been a year since ""Om Shanti Om"" was released and so it may be a good few months before we see another film with him. Let's mot forget ""My Name Is Khan,"" with Karan Johar.<br/><br/>Vinay Pathak is just excellent in the supporting role as the friend who supports all the way through and one who does not hesitate for one moment to tell his friend whether he is right or wrong.<br/><br/>The settings is beyond any doubt well done and being set in the Punjab city of Amritsar, the Golden Temple being shown every now and then gives on the real atmosphere of the area and the music by Salim Suleman does suit this very well and not to mention the songs and the dances that come along in this semi musical genre movie. The songs are also worth listening to and especially ""Tuj Mein Rab Dikhta Hai,"" by Roop Kumar Rathod and Shreya Ghoshal and ""Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte"" by Sonu Nigam.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Whoever thinks that this is a boring film, it isn't. This movie also shows what each partner has to do in order to try and make their marriage work and more so when one of them is much older. This is a movie that can be watched with your family and enjoy it."

"MartinHafer","7","1","1","3 September 2016"," The film is very good BUT the writing was not especially inspired.
","""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" is an enjoyable film, though I have to admit that the story is awfully silly and make this a rather silly Shah Rukh Khan outing.<br/><br/>When the story begins, Surinder (Khan) has just gotten married through a traditional arranged marriage. The problem is that his wife, Taani (Anushka Sharma) is much, much younger and Surinder is a bit of a dork. So, instead of celebrating their marriage and both being happy, the marriage is in trouble. Surinder sees his wife as perfect and unapproachable and Taani seems to give very little emotionally to the marriage. In fact, I wanted to slap Taani repeatedly and yell at her ""He's your husband...love him with all you have!"". <br/><br/>Later in the film, Taani decides to take a dance class. While there may be dance classes like this in India, it took me by surprise, as they seemed to be dancing much like you'd expect in a Bollywood film. However, her new partner is an odd guy...brash, full of life and conceited. Well, this Raj is actually Surinder in disguise...and Taani believes these are two different guys. When this happened, the film lost me and I almost turned it off. After all, aside from shaving off the mustache and blow drying the hair and changing clothes, they BOTH looked exactly like Shah Rukh Khan!! I assume the Indian audiences just suspended disbelief...but I kept thinking Taani was really stupid for not seeing that they were the same guy!!! And later, when Surinder works hard (finally) to win her over, she is pretty awful about this.<br/><br/>Despite my MANY reservations, the film does work overall for three reasons. First, the acting is quite nice...and you cannot blame the actors for the dopey story elements. Second, the music is great. Third, the ending is so sweet that I ALMOST forgot how dopey the story had been! Worth seeing but inconsequential as well."

","The movie evoked a lot of emotions because both of the main characters, Taani and Suri were well developed and characters you can feel much sympathy for. They are both lost and alone in their own ways, and I kept thinking 'But they don't have to be lost and alone...if only they would talk, if only they didn't remain so silent with each other, they could help each other not be so lost, so alone in their marriage.' Maybe that's what the message was supposed to be. That said I loved the soundtrack, the dancing was great, even if the character of Raj was an over-the-top kind of fool. Raj's character did provide some comic relief from the overwhelming sadness of Taani who lost both her father and her fiancé the day of her planned wedding and then married Suri which was her dying father's last wish, and the equally sad state of Suri who loves Taani but is too quiet, too reserved to tell her he loves her since he first saw her and does not want her to change, that he wants her to be happy, but she's too blinded by her sadness and loss to see the subtle ways he does try to show his love, in fact she doesn't really see him at all. She does see Raj, but only because he is so ""in your face"", he forces her to see him, to spend time with him, to get to know him, and she has no idea he is actually her husband in disguise. Unfortunately Suri's alter-ego of Raj is such a persistent clown at trying to win over Taani, that Suri fades even more in to the shadows in Taani's eyes."

","This movie was the one of the lamest bollywood stories ever. Srk nerdy look with mustache was just OK and normal average shy man in the streets but his cocky makeover is annoying(He overacts).<br/><br/>Anuksha Sharma was the only good thing about this movie and of course songs which were better than OK but not that good as srk's earlier movies.<br/><br/>Did this movie become a hit because of the songs or srks overacting, i don't know.<br/><br/>Anuksha looks pretty in yellow.

"hmobeen2000","10","5","12","20 December 2008"," Simply fabulous.....
","The Movie ""Rab ne Bana di Jodi"" is a treat to watch... Sharukh Khan has done his magic and has proved once again that he is the only king in bollywood who can do extraordinary magic with dull and ordinary characters...<br/><br/>The movie revolves around Surinder Sahni (Sharukh Khan), a government servant who is having a 9-5 life alone in Amritsar and has got only one friend Bobby (Vinay Pathak)... Surindar marries a beautiful younger girl Taani(Anushka Sharma) by chance... and then their odd love story starts... He wants to impress her, tries to show his love to her but Taani who still has not recovered from the deaths of her father and fiancé.. keeps herself to her room only and doesn't talk much to her husband.. the ordinary man Surinder... <br/><br/>Then the story takes a turn when Taani joins a dancing class and in search of a dancing partner.. Here idea comes to Surinder mind to impress her... He disguises himself into a young clean shaved handsome dude Raj.. but his wife doesn't recognize him so he now befriends with his wife through his new identity and flirts with her... <br/><br/>The love triangle between Surinder, Taani and Raj is the rest of story.. and who does Taani choose in the end as her true lover... <br/><br/>Sharukh has produced a magical performance in this role..... Sharukh looked like a common man when he played Surinder and looked younger and smart when he played Raj.. The contrast in the personality was clearly visible... and looked so good on screen.. Anushka Sharma is hot and a welcome entry into Bollywood.. She never looked like a newcomer in whole movie.. She has been auditioned for this role with other girls so that proves her ability as a brilliant and beautiful addition in Indian cinema..<br/><br/>Vinay Pathak who plays role of Sharukh's modern and fashionable friend (compared to Sharukh's character) did very well in this role.. This is his first big budget movie I guess and was so fun watching his scenes with Sharukh Khan especially the ""Macho"" scene where he lectures Sharukh about manhood... <br/><br/>So overall, This film was really wonderful and good entertaining material overall... 10/10.."
"uddalak-banerjee","10","5","12","13 December 2008"," Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008)i is far better than Om Shanti Om
","Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) is way better than Om Shanti Om and again proves that Bollywood king Srk can even at his age produce blockbuster romantic hits which can sweep people from all ages ...<br/><br/>the movie speaks of a sincere attempt of a middle aged man to win over his younger bride through a complete make over of personality .. not only is this plot brilliant and engrossing as usual Shahrukh khan rocks with his deft handling of the character of middle aged man. The film also stands out in the fact that subtle romance is brought out brilliantly without having to use any erotic scenes which most other contemporary films use in abundance..<br/><br/>Lastly, I think Anushka Sharma too has played a brilliant stellar role in the film creating a lasting impression in the hearts and minds of the people who I suppose will enjoy it to the fullest and welcome into their hearts the image of this upcoming heroine.<br/><br/>The scene in which Shahrukh khan uses his Punjab power connections to light up ""I love you"" is really charming and leaves a new mark on the hearts and minds of the audience which will certainly stay on for ever.."

"puneet-bhatia-in","8","4","9","15 December 2008"," Adi Ne Bana Di Jodi
","Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is a commendable attempt by Aditya Chopra to provide the audience a wholesome family entertainer. But let me warn the viewers beforehand. In order for you to enjoy this film, you have to acknowledge the cinematic liberty Adi has taken  he wants us to believe that a wife will not recognize her husband after he shaves off his pencil mustache and undergoes a wardrobe change. But isn't cinema all about bringing alive a make-believe world! So, just as we embrace a Spiderman or Krisssh, knowing very well that it is fantasy, I'd allow Chopra this expediency.<br/><br/>Through a not-so-long-back flashback sequence, we are introduced to Surinder Sahni who, least expecting, gets to marry the girl he has fallen in love-at-first-sight with. Only problem is, the marriage is a result of circumstances rather than love or even a pondered arrangement. The end result is two individuals, with very different love quotients, set up to live life together.<br/><br/>It is a very interesting premise and what makes it more so is the manner in which Aditya Chopra paints his characters.<br/><br/>Surinder Sahni is a person who is as diffident as it gets, and depicts a love so pure that it is almost incredible. Shahrukh, in this avatar, excels and is at his winsome best. Your heart goes out to him as he goes about his daily chores, or requests his wife to entertain his friends, if she can, he politely adds. In this another scene, where he gazes the lunch box, prepared by his wife, he leaves you in splits. This perfect look of naivety, love & admiration has King Khan's signature all over it. This and many such brilliant moments etch out the ingenuous character of Surinder Sahni.<br/><br/>On the other hand is Taani, the once-ebullient girl, who is willing to forego her past self to a new life as Surinder's dutiful wife. But even while she would pack his lunch, clean his room and entertain his guests, because she has ""willingly"" accepted this marriage, she can't love her husband and tells him so. There is a real element to Taani's character and Anushka Sharma brings forth her predicaments with a quiet confidence.<br/><br/>Also, praiseworthy is Vinay Pathak's portrayal of the loud-mouthed yet sensitive friend of Surinder. Like all his performances before, Pathak makes his character believable. He has some good dialogues to boost of and he fits well in the method of things. It is he who helps Suri transform into Raj, so he can woo his better half by being the ""hero"" she craves.<br/><br/>This might seem a silly premise and it is actually that, but still Aditya manages to add some substance to it through his screenplay and dialogues. He has generously used SDIPA (Shiamak Davar's dance school) and their actual instructors to take the story forward. I wasn't whole-heartedly convinced of Raj's character as it could have been depicted better from the over-the-top yet inadequate Jat that came across. Also Shahrukh's performance of this manifestation pales in comparison to the taciturn Suri. What I think Aditya wanted to show was a clash between the extrovert and the introvert and he was out to (predictably) make the underdog win it. And I think it is this bias that shows.<br/><br/>At a point in time, when I feared that the film would turn into another musical (Dil To Pagal Hai  II), Aditya carefully, and thankfully, steered the screenplay back to the main plot of Suri and Taani. What however, he could have done better was to emphasise more on Suri's display of love (even though Suri mentions to Bobby that he wants Taani to see it on her own) which would have made the choice Taani makes more convincing. Perhaps Aditya wanted things to be more subtle and left it for the audience to fill in the lines. The end message that he wanted to convey is that, with time and patience love conquers all! The music, which has always been the hallmark of an Aditya (or Yash) Chopra presentation, is surprisingly understated in the movie. The songs are situational and again far fewer in number in comparison to earlier movies. When I first heard the songs, I found them of a pretty low standard for an Aditya Chopra movie, but after watching the film, they grew on me. In the same breath, let me add that it is still nowhere near the high standards that Yash Raj has set for itself.<br/><br/>The predictable story could have been a damp squib had it not been for splendid performances. The screenplay keeps slipping but picking up soon after at many places. The cinematography is adequate and though there are no Swiss locales to be shot here, Amritsar has been captured well.<br/><br/>As director, Adi Chopra sparkles in a number of places. Consider the scene where Surinder places the rose on the table and then, true to his reticent self, puts it back, or the lunch box scene, or the heart-to-heart tête-à-tête between Suri and Bobby. And I'm sure thanks to Adi, a number of Amristari lads will queue up for being recruited in Punjab Power so they can propose to their girl in the innovative manner Raj does! In this quite unlike Yash Raj film, the medley song ""Hum hain raahi pyaar ke, phir milenge chalte chalte"" stands out with high production value. It is a tribute to Bollywood's yesteryear actors and you wish it goes on and on as one leading actress after another is serenaded by Shahrukh.<br/><br/>No matter whether or not, you like the movie, but please do stay till the end credits roll. Adi had saved the best for the last. Suri's narration of their honeymoon to Japan is the high point of the movie, it'll surely make you laugh and you'll come out of the hall wanting more of the endearing Surinder Sahni!"
"sant2050","8","4","9","14 December 2008"," Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi - An intense emotional drama
","He is not called the King Khan for nothing. In one of his finest performances, Shah Rukh Khan delivers the best in what he is best at. The intense tumult Surinder Sahni faces as he sees his wife drift away decisively towards Raj, played none other than himself but who is unlike himself, is portrayed with such an aplomb and sensitivity that the viewer even if he is at least a little love-literate would come to shedding tears for the ordinary Soori.<br/><br/>Taani played by Anushka Sharma, a débutante plays endearingly and proves the love Soori is showering on her is not only not wasted but is more than deserving. The ambiguity that she faces as her nature takes her naturally to Raj but her conscience and good self can't let go of Soori either.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, Sardar Mechanic and Bobby played by Vinay Pathak add vigor to their roles and make the party a grand success.<br/><br/>The defining moment probably is, when Raj/Soori is confronted with making a decision on behalf on Taani in choosing himself i.e Soori or a more jovial, cool guy that happens to be Raj. If the love as they often say is exemplified by the fire moth diving into the fire, then Soori enacts that here.<br/><br/>If you have experienced""your love"" loving that someone else, then you can celebrate that director has orchestrated exactly such a drama to give life to your ineffable emotions. In the end, it's a happy ending, no one scripting Shakespeare here. At least in movies, if it's not a happy ending then it's not the end of the movie."
"divyamaansrivastava","8","3","6","11 January 2010"," Good show
","This is a story of a middle class couple who had an arranged match.The storyline tried to experiment with the fact that, love is above looks and style. The girl falls in love with the same person twice in the movie. It was a very difficult storyline to carry off, but a perfect novel stuff. A new concept like DDLJ. Such movies/stories are generally understood only after a period of time. The only spoiler which I could find was the 'masala' component added. Like the actress shows here MI2 stunts on the middle of the street. All n all the movie had a tight storyline and keeps one guessing as what would be the climax, but in the end it was the Aditya Chopra genius. Good show !!"

","The romantic comedy is a genre that Bollywood do very well. And this is another good example.<br/><br/>The film has a good, heart felt story. You really feel and can connect with SRK's character. The comedy is equally great. Laugh out loud funny at times. Anushka does a good job. But the plaudits need to go to SRK who puts in an excellent, if sometimes slightly over the top performance. Although his Raj character may be a bit typical, he plays Sri very well and his comic timing is spot on. The only slight negatives I have are, for me personally, disappointing songs. I also <br/><br/>Very entertaining and highly recommended. Go see it."
"Dhoni7575","10","3","6","24 December 2008"," ""Rab Ne Bana Di "" is a message for all the Aamir khan fans from SRK

Go and watch it if u haven't because if u don't then u will be missing a great movie. That aside, Rab Ne is a film which will make you feel good and happy and Shahrukh absolutely deserves credit for this. His performance as Mr.Surinder is an absolute delight to watch and the mannerisms will leave you in splits of laughter. And then, the performance as Raj is the icing on the cake.I wont say anything more about this as it will spoil the experience for you.<br/><br/>Shahrukh Khan, take a bow.This is amongst your best performances to date.<br/><br/>The new face of the film, Anushka deserves special mention for the way she acted and carried off the role of Taani. There is innocence,charm,a certain vulnerability and tenderness in the character but at the same time she can be quite a force to reckon with if provoked. And Anushka lived in the role. For a debutant, its amazing.<br/><br/>Vinay Pathak as usual was his excellent self as the best friend of Shahrukh and their moments on screen are truly rib tickling.<br/><br/>'Haule Haule' song is very good and so is the background score. It adds weight to the film and to the comedy. All the other songs are pretty decent.<br/><br/>The way the city of Amritsar was shown is also very nice and the rich production values of Yashraj films is clearly visible in each and every frame.<br/><br/>And finally, for the director. Welcome back Mr. Aditya. We missed you and we hope that you make movies a little more often than you do."

","Yes this is Beautiful movie. Shah Rukh Khan is simply superb, I found the movie very entertaining. The direction lacks punch but SRK delivers big time. This is a must for people who like love stories, because this is what it is.. A Love Story, and a very beautifully told one at that. The actress Anushka, carries herself very well. Very aesthetically shot, nice dialogs .. A film which will leave you satisfied. Very few films manage to do that, satisfied ! I just found myself smiling throughout the movie, not laughing out loud, but smiling, it meant that the jokes were witty, the dialogs were prompt, the acting was fabulous, SRK, for me does his best after Swades, (better than Chak De). The songs were very soothing, specially ""Tujh mein Rab dikhta hai"" which was so sweetly shot.<br/><br/>The screen obviously belonged to the one and only SRK, he just dazzles beyond compare, I cant figure out any other actor doing the same role with such ease and style. I loved the movie and I hope people will love the character of SRK in this flick.<br/><br/>A movie which cannot be missed no matter what, and once again Hats Off to SRK !"

","Destiny plays a cruel joke on an extremely enthusiastic young girl Taani (Anushka) as she loses her fiancé and his family in a road accident on the eve of her marriage. Her father, a retired professor, on his death bed requests her to marry his old favorite student, Surinder Shahani (SRK). Taani obeys his last wish and thus begins the start of this extraordinary love story between an otherwise ordinary jodi.<br/><br/>The shy, somewhat geeky Surinder has already fallen for Taani since the first time he has seen her but alls his hopes crash when Taani tells him the day they arrive at his house that she won't be able to give him any love as that's one feeling she has lost forever with the sudden turn of events in her life. The rest of the film is about how Suri transforms himself into a very hep flirtatious dude Raj to win her love using a dancing school as a platform for his antics. He is well aided with his childhood buddy Bobby (Pathak) who brings on the physical transformation in him. But what happens is Taani who is unaware of Raj being Suri himself ends up falling in love with Raj. Suri is now again in a fix but then he finally decides to take a bold step Rab Ne has been definitely amongst the most awaited films of 2008 and there have been great expectations riding on it especially because it is Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge maker Aditya Chopra's comeback film after a long gap of 8 years. The script has its moments and master craftsman Adi keeps you engaged initially with some really beautifully handled moments between SRK and Anushka. But as SRK's character's transformation comes in the grip slowly loosens and you start feeling restless with the pace slumping down considerably. What follows is a criss-cross between some really well penned and executed scenes and some really drab moments with badly placed songs acting as speed breakers. But Adi's terrific dialogues deserve a special applause for touching the right chords.<br/><br/>Shah Rukh Khan is simply superb as first the shy Suri and then the flamboyant, full of energy, Raj. Newcomer Anushka gets a really well etched character to perform and it despite being her first film, she comes across an absolute natural. Vinay Pathak is fun and provides good comic relief.<br/><br/>Music of the film is good but the problem is apart from a very well tuned and picturised Haule Haule number, the rest songs appear wrongly placed. The picturisation of the number featuring Kajol, Preity Zinta, Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta and Rani is mind blowing but again it coming at a wrong juncture doesn't really make it work."

","First the good news- It is better than om shanti om<br/><br/>Bad news- It is nowhere near DDLJ<br/><br/>The groundwork of the story is very interesting leading to some very interesting possibilities of some unconventional character development and engaging storyline.But along with another flattering to deceive intro, the plot becomes severely flawed with unrealistic behaviour of a married woman, sudden transmutation of a nerd to a dude and utter lack of interesting characters to fill in this otherwise stale plot.<br/><br/>The nerdy character of Shahrukh khan, Mr Surender Sahni is an affable persona at first impression.No doubt the cinema goer will fall in love with the utterly ingenuous, totally spontaneous and unmasked behaviour of Srk.However the character of Raj seems too far-fetched and overacted. As for Anoushka, she is a splendid ,fresh treat to the eyes and also Adi seems to have extracted the best of her potential as she impresses considerably to be tagged the "" next big thing"".Shahrukh has a broader range of emotions to work with here that infuses fresh blood to his acting as compared to previous films like Om shanti Om and Anosuhka is eye candy and spellbinding at the same time.<br/><br/>The movie has its dose of slapstick humour and poignant drama.For those steadfast devotees of Srk's mannerisms this movie is a sheer delight.The songs complement the situations with Haule Haule and Dance pe chance being the most memorable ones.No doubt,this is going to be a superhit as did OSO but it is hard to believe a director who made the perfect romantic movie a decade back, is falling short of some novel, ingenious ideas on a great script.However, this is the perfect launchpad for the cute dimpled Anoushka and she has definitely gone on to the big league.RNBDJ doesn't impress.Let's wait for Ghajini."
"rahel-kidane","9","4","10","25 May 2009"," Commentary
","Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (Match Made By God), 167 min 2008, Yash Raj Films<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Sharon Maguire's, ""Bridget Jones Diary"", you will love this Hindi movie. With less melodrama and fantasy that Bollywood is known to offer, this film gives the allegiance to blind faith in the true self. The story is so charming with its mixture of insouciance, wit and candor that it's enough to restore a belief in fairy tale endings to the most embittered casualty of modern life–urban marriage. This film is full of wisdom and hope especially for at Generation X buckled up to ride on the fast lane of urban dating.<br/><br/>Don't expect Suri to be Casanova, however. Rather, his seduction process is pure, unblemished and almost spiritual. I have to admit, to bring this rather interesting, meek character to life must have been a challenge for director Aditya Chopra. Who could have imagined that Shahrukh Khan would be so perfect? Adopting an impeccable look of a geek who can't seem to ""lit up his own life"" let alone his energetic wife's, he plays the role of Suri with so much sensitivity and dignity, and you fall in love with Suri. Shahrukh brings integrity with childlike stubbornness, innocence, and tenderness melting your heart like ice cream in a New York Summer. Shahrukh's double role of Raj is impeccable making Suri enter into Taani's life in the guise of Raj—the skintight shirt, ripped jeans, spiked hair with ample of tackiness and brassiness — to win Taani's affection. Aditya accomplishes a miracle of making Suri entirely endearing, utterly real and acceptable while the aloof, slick and hypnotizing Raj becomes attractive even alluring to a woman with broken dreams. Sharukh's performance of Suri is deeply sentimental and natural one barely senses the work that must have gone into it. Throughout the film you ardently root for Suri to succeed and pray that the two will end together. This film is a delight to watch giving a whole new meaning to Billy Joel's song, ""I love you just the way you are"", although I would have suggested a film title to be ""Against All Odds"". If you want a more spiritual title, Match Made in Heaven definitely works.<br/><br/>What makes this film more relevant to Generation X is that we can all relate to Taani. How many dates have we been without seeing an end in sight? How many of us have lost the faith in loving, completely disenchanted with this entire concept of love? Taani summarized well, ""I can't see love in anyone"", she says. It is not that love does not exist, but we are so caught up at the moment, we no longer recognize it.

"sidin","7","5","14","12 December 2008"," Magnanimousness but lacks Diplomacy....!!!!!!!!
","Well, to start off with, Aditya Chopra spells yet another poignant dimension of pure love as in his previous ventures with SRK; DDLJ and Mohabattein. Yeah! These tales were retentive impressing everyone from 8-80yrs old men and women. Of course, we fell in love getting imbibed with those spellbinding personations in these flicks. So, guess what about Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi  a film that brings back sensational pair SRK-Aditya together after 8yrs? Does the film exceed everyone's expectations on 'Love' n 'Entertainment' factors? Or merely conks out dashing down our hopes? Hats off to Aditya Chopra! An awesome motif of delineating a touching story of romance...<br/><br/>Have you ever stopped to think if the most ordinary, uninteresting, unobtrusive man you might see on the road or around you might have a love story to tell? Maybe not! How can an ordinary man have a breathtaking, goose flesh igniting, awe inspiring love story of all things to tell? But guess what - love does not differentiate between the ordinary and exceptional, the uninteresting and interesting, the unattractive and attractive. Because love knows no distinction. It can happen to anyone and once it does it engulfs us into it completely and gives us those heaven-sent experiences that only love can yield.<br/><br/>Perhaps, everything in fine and good with the one-liner. But Aditya Chopra fails in crafting a gripping narration all throughout the show. A flimsy screenplay lacking finesse with bits and pieces of discontinuities and these attributes easily scatters audiences' attention. The best illustration goes with SRK's ducky actresses shaking legs with him for 'Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte' on theater screen. It's completely odd for that situation and possibly, the sequences could've been switched over to latter half as a 'special round in Dance show'. Was it an attempt to deliver a replica of 'Om Shanthi Om' song of film stars dancing together? The film is about Surinder Sahni (Shahrukh Khan) - a simple, clean hearted, honest man working for Punjab Power, leading a humdrum life, when he meets his total opposite and finds love in the flamboyant, fun-loving, vivacious -Taani (Anushka Sharma) for whom the whole world is her canvas and she paints her own life with the colors of rainbow all until unforeseen circumstances changes it all and brings them together. Sooner, its biggest dance show in Amritsar and Surinder coiffures himself as Raj what he calls 'Macho Chap' He does it all to impress his girl Taani and what's next? It's a journey filled with laughter, tears, joy, pain, music, dance and a lot of love. A journey that makes us believe that there is an extraordinary love story in every ordinary jodi.<br/><br/>The first half dawdles with sluggish narration until earlier minutes to pre-interval where SRK's soliloquy with statue takes on emotional quotients. Well, the latter half comprises of few enjoyable moments like Anushka racing on her bike with 'Dhoom Machale' on BCM and next ultimate shot of Vinay Pathak-SRK at garage.<br/><br/>It's a creme De la creme performance by Shah Rukh Khan as he emotes resplendently on all situations. Be it his make-over sequences adjusting his tight jeans in dance class or the performance in penultimate minutes, King Khan is awe-inspiring. A flawless performance by débutant Anushka Sharma and of course she eclipses Shah Rukh on many parts. What to say about Vinay Pathak? He's over-the-top and more emblazons to the screen. He strides sparkling smiles on our lips with his waggeries and soaks our eyes as he gets emotional. Don't miss the great dance of SRK-Vinay for the original tune of 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi'. Its emotional outbursts from every characterization that turns entire spotlights on RNBDJ Aditya's innovative thought is laudable on certain parts like Shah Rukh laying rose next to food and again placing it vase, pictorial of Anushka's face for the song 'Tuj Mei Rab Diktha Hai' and entire Amritsar being lit up, 'I Love You' deserves grand round of applause. Fine! Young lads and Misses would hail with praise worthy comments for Adhi's ideation. Both SRK and Anushka swallowing Pani Purees followed by abrupt sequence where he has to finish of delicious Biriyani are evokes laughter.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the biggest flaw is that how come a woman fails to recognize her husband with a slight-make over. The characters of Surindar and Raj differ merely with thin mustache, hair style and costumes. Both the characters have same voice sans any modulations.<br/><br/>What barricaded Aditya's cognizance while dropping these lines on his paper? Indeed, it's a billion dollar question.<br/><br/>Ravi K Chandran's cinematography enhances visual quality and his placement of creative angles deserves special attention. The duo Salim-Sulaiman seems to have not percolated a lot for background scoring. It's again the pieces of existing numbers in album tuned and they sway on all songs.<br/><br/>Possibly, 'Haule Haule' and 'Dance Pe' peaked with high-promos prior to release. For sure, both the versions of 'Tuj Mei Rab Dikta Hai' capture your senses with beauteous visualizing. 'Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte' fails to make it big despite grand set decorations, costumes and top-charting actresses with SRK. Ritesh Soni's editing especially on 'Dancing Jodi' at the climax is mind blowing... Choreography by Vaibhavi and Shiamak are sumptuously ne plus ultra On the whole, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is enjoyable on many parts with fun, frolic, lots of music and dance, pains and emotions. Well, Aditya Chopra gets stuck failing to pen an engrossing screenplay. It's too long, irksome and more predictability when it comes to narration and the auteur could've better avoided these vistas."

New York, perhaps, or even London, England. heck, London, Ontario would've been a better choice.<br/><br/>aside from the plot hole big enough to drive an Ice Road truck through, the movie is wonderful - tender and sweet.<br/><br/>SRK does a lovely job of portraying a quiet, mild man driven to extremes by panic when his lovely wife tells him she must ""kill the old taani"" and become a new one in order to be his dutiful wife. he's a nerd - he knows he's a nerd - but he wants her to remain the carefree, vivacious, outspoken girl she was the day he fell in love with her, hence the creation of his alter-ego, ""raj"", a ""cool"", ""macho"" ""dude"" (who really isn't - *wince*).<br/><br/>anushka sharma does a great job (esp for a debut!) but she's a bit ""jennifer aniston"" to me - there were times when i'm guessing she was supposed to look thoughtful or pensive but came across as calculating. but hey - who am i to judge?"

","I don't know where my comment will land up in this big ocean of comments, still here's my opinion on the movie. The movie is a very lengthy one and has been dragged a bit too much in the start-middle scenes. But it is a pleasurable and joyful ride in the life of Mr. Surinder Sani whose character has been played magnificently by Shahrukh Khan.<br/><br/>The simple yet enjoyable character has been explored to its full extent. The story though does not turn out to be very great and gets predictable many-a-times during the movie. Anoushka Sharma's role didn't require much of great acting but she too does well for a first-timer. Stupidish attitude of Raj (also played by shahrukh) is also very funny at times.<br/><br/>Surinder and Bobby's talks in the movie were funny. But in the end, its the story that spoils the fun. The music complements the movie very well. Its a one time watch for sure. So get some popcorn and play the DVD !!!"

"Miss_Weasley_Potter","6","4","11","7 January 2009"," A one-watch SRK flick.
","This 2008 flick stars Shah Rukh Khan, Vinay Pathak and introduces Anushka Sharma.<br/><br/>It has a very typical beginning, boy sees girl, and of course it is love at first site. Girl, however, is already somebody else's. In fact, she is about to get MARRIED to that person. But that person dies, father gets a heart attack from the trauma and, because he knows he is going to die, he marries off his daughter to his favorite student, a simple, sweet, shy geek, Surinder Sahini. The girl, let us please make it clear, is not forced to marry him, she chooses to, although when one thinks about it...would any sensitive person be able to refuse their dying father's last wish? Taani (Anushka) is heartbroken, though she tries to hide it. Suri seems to understand, and knows that this will not be an ordinary marriage. The possibility of the two having a normal marriage, at this point of time, was something that he could only hope for. So, he picks up a pillow, a blanket and makes a bed for himself up in the attic.<br/><br/>He loves her. He had already made that clear to the audience from the very beginning when he had shyly announced that he had fallen in love with Taani) Though Taani tells him that she can never love him like that, he continues to hope that 'Haule Haule' (Slowly, eventually) she too might fall in love. In the meantime, Taani continues to play the dutiful housewife.<br/><br/>He becomes Raj  a wannabe cool dude- in hope to be what she wants in a guy. And ends up as her dance partner.<br/><br/>How she fails to notice the similarity between her husband and her dance partner is something that will remain a mystery to us and thus, should be left in-argued and tagged as one of the loopholes of the plot.<br/><br/>The other loophole, and a major one at that, is: how could a thin, in-athletic man like Suri possibly survive a Sumo's attack? However, not only does Suri-Man survive, whole and healthy, he only BEATS the 300 pound something Sumo! The movie is a one-watch movie. Shah Rukh has showed that he can pull off any role and can even make us love him as the irritating Raj. The movie is, completely and absolutely, Shah Rukh Khan's.<br/><br/>Vinay Pathak is his usual golden. A very sweet and good performance as the best friend, indeed.<br/><br/>Anushka Sharma is a decent actress. She was, at times, a bit stiff and expressionless, but yet, only she could have pulled off the role as Taani. She is very good find and perhaps, hopefully, will succeed in the Indian Cinema as well as improve as an actress.<br/><br/>Overall: Not a bad watch, despite its loopholes. It will definitely ensure that you keep laughing through out, or else singing along the catchy songs. Purely a SRK candy and can be enjoyed much better on the DVD.<br/><br/>6/10"
"megha6582","7","4","11","16 December 2008"," A simple love story!
","Rab ne.... is the story of a simpleton Surinder (SRK) who ends up with the girl of his dreams Taani (Anushka) but is unable to evoke feelings of love in her since their marriage was brought about by certain unfortunate circumstances. The story goes on to show how Suri tries desperately to woo his wife by undergoing a makeover to become a smooth talking-savvy Raj. Fortunately for him.....in his new avatar, his wife does not recognize him to be her plain, boring, middle class husband (Ummm....that part by the way, a little hard to digest!). His attempts to win her over succeed and now the damsel in distress cannot decide what to do. Should she continue to be a 'good' wife and live in a loveless marriage with the person who has done so much for her or should she follow her heart and go back to being the old Taani who loves to laugh, have fun and live life to the fullest with Raj? Throw in a dance show premise and u have the story of Rab ne bana di jodi.<br/><br/>The entire movie is shot in Amritsar and every scene has a realistic look. There are no perfect 'dream-like' houses, streets or even songs in the movie. The movie is fun in places (catch Taani riding a bike aka Dhoom 3), slow paced in certain others (most of the emotional scenes)and downright boring in a couple of scenes (one notable being the scene where SRK talks to the mannequin dressed like him). The songs are alright.....I expected more from the score of a Adi Chopra movie. SRK is good but his age has really started to get the better of him. The 'cool' look (meaning: tight clothes, tattered jeans, colored hair, metal chains) don't really suit him anymore! Maybe another actor in the same role would have done a better job. The newbie Anushka is quite good in her debut movie although she has a long way to go in the emoting department. Her wardrobe and make up have been dealt with well. Vinay Pathak as Suri's friend Bobby is OK.<br/><br/>If you are an SRK fan, you will like or may even love this movie. If you are not, you will probably end up finding it boring and uninteresting. For those in-between, go watch it to find out!"
"m_shankar20","6","4","11","15 December 2008"," 'Raj' yet again from YRF
","Rab Ne opens with a bespectacled SRK with mustaches, wearing trousers and sneakers, alighting a train with his bride. That shot, at once, shatters the image that SRK has had over the years in Yashraj films. I could sense excitement running through my veins. But alas, it was short lived. Very soon, they return to 'Raj' business that we have been made to endure over the years.<br/><br/>SRK impresses as the docile Sukhi but as Raj he varies from flamboyant to a buffoon. The newcomer Anushka Sharma is very impressive. This is easily the best debut performance of the year so far. She is convincing throughout the film and is not intimidated by the towering presence of SRK.<br/><br/>Sukhwinder Singh ('Hole Hole') and Sunidhi Chouhan ('Dance pe Chance') lend their voices to probably the two best sung songs of the year. Both are choreographed equally well.<br/><br/>Rab Ne does have a story but it lacks any subtlety. For some reasons, SRK speaks out all emotions leaving nothing for the viewers to extrapolate. No time is spent on telling us how Taani falls in love with Sukhi. The only apparent explanation is that she sees Sukhi walking towards her in the background of the Golden Temple. It seemed that SRK's character, while playing the Sukhi vs. Raj game, got confused in what he really wanted to achieve after all.<br/><br/>Aditya Chopra is a talented director and I don't doubt that. But Rab Ne is just a box-office pleaser attempt and not anything to test himself."

","Rabne Bana di jodi was one of the most awaited movie of year 2008.The main reason for it was for sure a good film maker Aditiya Chopra comeback after a long gap of 8 years,and off course Shahrukh Khan.<br/><br/>I just returned from watching it tonight in Avenues Cinema in kuwait.It was full house.OK i do enjoy movie but i must mention here that it was below expected or beyond expectations and it is not better than DDLJ and Mohabbtain in terms of Story,Music,Script.<br/><br/>I will with the story.The story is not strong enough or challenging.Aditiya Chopra did attempt to make it look like a different story or new story and he did succeed to some extent but again the story is not much convincing.Also the script and dialogues are just OK or average,for which Aditiya Chopra consider as one of the best dialogues writer of Bollywood.But this time he didn't focus much on his writing.<br/><br/>The first half of movie is much better,specially the first 30 minutes,but 2nd half is only good at the end.There is a lot of factors or a lot of minus points in movie.Now just think how sharukh khan wife anushka could not recognize his husband,who pretend to be different man RAJ. Music is just OK but the songs are very few and not the best as compared to DDLJ and Mohabbatain.My favorite track is Title Song. But song picturization is good and dancing is also very best.<br/><br/>Performance wise Sharukh khan is best in the role of Surinder Sahni but his acting as a RAJ is totally bad as he is over acting.Anushka is beauty and she did fine performance.Sure she will become A list actress.She look pretty.Vinay Pathak is surprise package.I was surprise to see him in the movie and he is Excellent in the movie.He should at least get nomination for best supporting role.<br/><br/>At the end i Will say that weak story,poor script,average music gone against Rabne Bana Di Jodi.Now my wait is only for to watch Amir Khan starrer GHAJINI<br/><br/>I will give 6.5/10 to it."

","Surprised to see this one attaining 7+ ratings on IMDB which frankly it does not deserve. There are much better films than this one which needs higher ratings. Had it not been for Shahrukh Khan, the ratings must not have been that high. First things first, the film's story is not even original. It's lifted straight from a track in the YRF produced film Aaja Nachle released a year ago starring Madhuri Dixit that failed.<br/><br/>Aditya Chopra himself had written the story of Aaja Nachle and when that didn't work, he went onto make another film borrowing a similar track from the film that featured a simpleton Vinay Pathak trying to woo his ambitious wife played by Sushmita Mukherjee. The wife finds her husband boring and in order to impress her he takes part in a dance competition and surprises her and win her love. The same story has been borrowed in RNBDJ but exaggerated and stretched to date.<br/><br/>The film doesn't have anything new to offer because it's so darn predictable you know how it shall end from the first frame. Secondly, its unconvincing. How does Anushka falls for her husband in a blink of an eye at the gurudwara and searches for god in him. If it wasn't enough, it was hilarious to find out that the entire city knows about the dual personality of SRK but not Anushka, even though she's shown to be a smart young woman.<br/><br/>Talking about the only few good things. SRK is superb in the nerdy role and gives his 100 percent but acts hideously as the alter ego Raj. He goes overboard in every scene, his costumes are also weird, doesn't make him look sexy or anything for a woman to fall for him. SRK is a legendary actor, he needs a great story. Anushka on the other hand, stereotyped herself in her debut film itself. And that explains why she had been doing those spunky, no-nonsense type of roles. Although she acted fine in this film and looked far more prettier than what she looks now.<br/><br/>Music is just about okay. The cinematography is also good. The film has been shot beautifully but the direction of Aditya Chopra disappoints. Still this one is far better than his last release 'Befikre'. All in all watch this film only if you are a die-hard SRK fan. Otherwise I don't see any reason to cheer for this film"

The way he looks at his wife when she laughes about a stupid movie or the way he carries the bright yellow thermos to work is unbeatable.<br/><br/>Yes, Shah Rukh Khan's acting can be over the top, especially for us Europeans.

","Vivacious, beautiful Taani (Anushka Sharma) suffers a catastrophe on the eve of her wedding, and at her father's request, she marries his trusted student Suri (Shah Rukh Khan). Serious, nerdy Suri fell in love with her at first sight, but Taani tells him she'll never be able to love him, nor be happy and light-hearted again. Suri takes on the role of a fun-loving Raj in her dancing class, hoping to make her laugh again, and hoping to use Raj to help Taani fall in love with Suri. Things don't work as Suri had hoped, and he sees his chance of happiness with Taani become slim.<br/><br/>In this romantic drama, Khan plays an average man as Suri, and brash and loud as Raj, neither the handsome or charming character that is his usual role. This he does surprisingly well. Sharma, in her first role, was excellent, and fully believable in her emotions. While the songs and choreography were average, the cinematography, locations, and sets were lovely. <br/><br/>I was conflicted as to the credibility of Taani's reaction to the truth, but otherwise found this to be a sweet and enjoyable film with a beautiful message, celebrating unselfish love."

Yes , we do believe that marriages are made in heaven , but once married , it's not only the duty of husband or wife , to make the marriage work . If Taani wants to dance to the modern Western beats , that too, in a conservative place like Amritsar , Surinder doesn't have to miserably try to change his otherwise acceptable image ,to an exactly opposite character ,just to win her heart ,or make his vivacious wife happy ! Are we fools ? Or is Taani so naive ,that she can not notice the similarity between her husband and the other hep guy ? Come on Aditya , you can not take every thing for granted , and present us with an absurd plot line , equally absurd incidents , starting from the beginning , with all that rush to make every body concerned die , and then tie the knot of Suri and Taani , to shift over ,and eat toast and butter every day for breakfast, and the Taani making some lunch for her hard working husband ! Tut tut ! i am an ardent fan of Shah Rukh , and feel sad that his talents were indeed wasted over such a stupid movie. He did try to enact a simple guy , with spects and all , and gave us some sensitive moments like putting a rose next to his wife's breakfast , taking it away etc. Like in his other movie Duplicate , he was much more adorable in his two different roles, and that was due to the factors of a strong , entertaining plot, forceful direction , alluring songs and dance numbers , among other stuff. And what do we have here ? Not much ! If Suri would have decided to take his wife in confidence , and agreed to transform himself to her expectations , this movie wouldn't be typical Bollywood fare.<br/><br/>Swinging between romance and comedy , light entertainment to emotional scenes , this movie fails miserably in making any impact in the end , and would be easily forgotten. Except for that Haulle Haulle.. song , and Shah Rukh dancing to it's beat , there is no relief offered.Anushka is fresh and endearing , but her character is so confused , the viewer is confused even more. i have given five points , exclusively for the cinematography of some shots like an Ariel view from a terrace of the night lights , the Temple , and of course Shah Rukh , in a limited way, as his potentials are not used at all !

","There are many films those have been made using love triangle in a different way and this formula is considered as a hit Bollywood formula. This film also falls in the same category but here it seems that it is very different and very special film as it touches your heart. It is based on very different love triangle where the same person plays two characters. It is thought provoking and very appropriate in today's times. It is successful in conveying its messages to the target audience with good entertainment by a typical Bollywood hit formula. It creates much interest in viewer's mind from the very first scene and continuous until it ends.<br/><br/>It is happen to be marrying a simple common man by a young beautiful girl because of situation but girl vows not to love this common man even after marriage but in contrast common man loves her very much from the day when he first seen her. Here common man goes for makeover with the help of a friend and tries to make his wife to love him by becoming and playing character of changed modern man and by meeting her regularly in different scenario. Simultaneously he also lives his life of common man with his wife. So here the story revolves around these three characters as simple common man, his wife and changed modern man. Initially he feels good but later on he found it to be wrong. Here this common man many times feels to be quit from this game of look change and think to tell true to his wife but somehow he thought to continue with it as he wanted to see whether with whom finally his wife prefer to live with. This thing creates very much interest in viewer's mind and whole episode is very good to see here. It is very interesting to see how this changed modern man lose this game to simple common man and how the later is simply winning his wife's heart away with his simplicity and inner goodness.<br/><br/>I feel it is better film than other films of the director Aditya Chopra and believe that it will be considered among the good works of Shahrukh Khan though I personally feel that it is second heart warming film of Shahrukh Khan after Swades."
"ilpintl","7","3","8","14 December 2008"," Utterly charming fare!
","Okay, so I saw the new Shah Rukh Khan film directed by Aditya Chopra and--no points for guessing right--I LOVED it. ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" has the sketchiest plot, but thoroughly endearing performances by Shah Rukh and confident new find Anoushka Sharma. Vinay Pathak was very good, too, playing the usually thankless hero's best friend role. This is probably the first Yashraj film to be shot in India in a long time. We are shown Amritsar, its Golden Temple, but mostly the bustling lane where Shah Rukh lives in a gorgeous rambling old-world house with courtyard and barsaati that I immediately wanted to own.<br/><br/>Shah Rukh gets better and better, once again playing two characters in the same film. There would have been no film without his performance. I loved the decency and diffidence of his Surinder Sahni character, who mans a help-line for the State utility company: Punjab Power here; lighting up your life, ji. To reveal any more would rob whatever tiny element of surprise the film has. I reiterate: Shah Rukh's phenomenal success allows him to inhabit characters that are compellingly real. During his struggling days, he was so full of himself, so desperate to prove himself and to succeed, there was no room for a character. Audiences saw the same abrasive smart Aleck in film after film, until he hit the big time. Once stardom came, the actor in Shah Rukh was able to emerge. For the past few years, every character (with the possible exception of ""Don"") he played has been immensely watchable: the dignified Kabir Khan in ""Chak De India"", ""Om Shanti Om""'s hapless Om Prakash Makhija and oversexed bratty Om Kapoor, and ""Paheli""'s lovelorn shape-shifting ghost, to name a few.<br/><br/>I am blown away by the poise and professionalism of recent first-time leading ladies. One would never guess they are débutantes: Deepika Padukone was almost scarily self-assured in ""Om Shanti Om"", and Anoushka doesn't lag far behind. She doesn't appear to possess Deepika's megawatt glamor, but fills the girl-next-door requirements of this film admirably, while singing, dancing (full marks here), and emoting like a filmi veteran. Anoushka wears understated salwar-kameez for most of the film with a spectacular collection of ""aari"" and ""phulkaari""work dupattas...now there will be a huge spike in their popularity. Very sad that the one-of-a-kind ""phulkaari"" ooparnas that I was thrilled to find this past March at a Taj Blue Diamond artisanal exhibition/sale (and for which I plonked down a bundle) will soon be seen on every Harinder, Gurinder, and Jatinder Singh and Kaur. Amend that: the Harinders and Gurinders have always been wearing them, but now the rest of India will catch up. <br/><br/>The BIG item number of the movie: Anoushka imagines a filmi song sequence where Shah Rukh's ""Raj"" character sings and dances with five heroines in a colorful homage to the various eras of Hindi films: Kajol as Nargis (Kajol, in a simple white saree and black blouse, has never looked more beautiful.), while SRK plays a Chaplinesque Raj Kapoor; Bipasha Basu as Vyjayantimala (makes an interesting pair with Shah Rukh, wonder if they'll be cast together in a film soon...) with SRK as a noddy and natty Dev Anand; Lara Dutta as a Helen-type (there will only be ONE Helen, Lara's valiant efforts don't even come close to the real thing) while SRK channels a suave Shammi Kapoor; Preity Zinta as a Technicolor Mumtaz paired with SRK's Rajesh Khanna, and, finally, Rani Mukherjee looking amazingly like the ""Khel Khel Mein"" Neetu Singh with SRK Rishi Kapoor. Must say, however, that the song itself isn't memorable despite the gimmicky mix 'n' match lyrics taken from old movie songs, but the visuals make up for it. Surprisingly for a Yashraj film, the music is not brilliant, but merely serviceable.<br/><br/>Also saw trailers for ""Billo Barber"", the next Shah Rukh film costarring Irfan Khan and Lara Dutta (they play husband and wife) with SRK as a very famous movie star (hmmm...hasn't he done this before?), and the next Yashraj offering--located comfily once more in NRI land--called ""New York"", starring John Abraham, Katrina Kaif, and Neil Nitin Mukesh with some sort of a tense 9/11 plot line.<br/><br/>Glossary: ""aari"" and ""phulkaari"" - types of embroidery that originated in Punjab...I learned this on my last trip to India."

","You might read the Story somewhere elsewhere..<br/><br/>Here i'd say about the Movie. It is simple story of everything.<br/><br/>Whatever people say about it .. I'd suggest you watch the Movie once for yourself and then Decide. Many people are reviewing this Movie due to sole reason of them doing the biased reviews coz they are fans of some other actor.<br/><br/>Here's some notes: Really a very good movie. Friends used to comment on SRK as a crybaby in movie or not a good actor or even an over-actor..but here.. he has shutted their mouths.. SRK really spun the character of Suri on fingertips.. Really Must watch Movie. I'd say 5/5 for movie. But not to sound too much good in craze i'd say 4.2 / 5<br/><br/>Liked the scenes 1) That Rose seen where he puts the rose on note and then removes it again. 2) That Gol Gappe scene.. and the Biryani. 3) That Macho Thing of Raj 4) That scene where he takes the ""Dabba"" ie tiffin box and dances and background music plays ""Haule Haule""..really enjoyed that seen<br/><br/>*Simple Movie of a Simple Man* *People Do not keep your expectations high would love this Movie and it will really overwhelm their Expectations*<br/><br/>PS: +point.. Not a single Adult joke. No Fighting . No Full Romance . No Full Comedy. No Full Drama . Yet it make you feel really elevated :)"
"movie_freak_dubai","6","3","9","14 December 2008"," A nice movie with a wonderful acting debut!!
","RNBDJ is not bad at all but there is one problem with the movie according to me.<br/><br/>I must say that this movie does start off really well with SRK playing against type by acting as a shy, geeky common man plus Aditya Chopra starts the movie off in unexpected fashion. I will not spoil it for you here in this review. But i must say it was clever and not what I expected after watching the promos. The first part of the movie really does motor along nicely but at this point something happens that I just cannot fully buy into.<br/><br/>VERY MINOR SPOILER HERE<br/><br/>As everyone must have gleaned from the promos Sahni i.e. SRK goes through a complete makeover/transformation to woo his lady love, the effervescent Anushka Sharma i.e. Taani. This is done with the aid of Vinay Pathak's character the childhood buddy of Sahni. He transforms into the ultimate cool dude with all the works : spiky gelled hairdo, new clothes, no moustache, funky jeans and a new motorbike. This transformation essentially leads to Taani not recognising her hubby at the dance tryouts. Plus there seems to be almost no awkwardness when Sahni becomes his new alter ego, with a snap of his fingers he is completely transformed into the typical filmi hero. IF you can believe this transformation then i can guarantee that you will love this movie but I was not completely taken along for the ride.<br/><br/>Anushka Sharma makes a wonderfully confident debut and I feel that she is the real star of the movie handling both the light and emotional moments with great ease. It does not feel as if this is her first movie.SRK is pretty good as the meek Sahni but grates slightly as his confident alter ego Raj; although it is still a vast improvement from his OSO 2nd half character. Vinay is OK . <br/><br/>The music was not bad with Haule Haule for me being the most memorable Keep an eye out for one song which has a couple of interesting special appearances. Adi Chopra has done a good job of directing the movie with a couple of inspired touches here and there but i really wish he would stop rehashing some of his Yash Raj hits in certain sequences.<br/><br/>I am sure this movie will be a big hit so do go and watch it if you are an SRK but I predict that you will leave the cinema admiring the lead actress. Do stay for the end credits (this is becoming an SRK movie trademark a la Jackie Chan)"
"vaibhav_bhandeo","8","3","9","14 December 2008"," Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi --Review
","Identity crisis, this is what happened throughout the movie where the most unconventional aspect was how a wife can't identify her husband being in his vicinity all the time? <br/><br/>Apart from this flaw the movie seems to create some magic though is far away from the era created by DDLJ. The story traverse around a mid-aged gentleman Surinder Sahni and his subtle lifestyle which portrays any common man in the country. The movie is themed to show his quest to conquer his spouse's heart with his simple yet sober living style which he finally achieves with keeping his values and dignity intact, the end of movie definitely going to remind the melodramatic end of Dil To Pagal Hai's. What movie lacks is the strong projection and theme based character, apart from Surinder Sahni none will remain on top of your mind once you leave the theater.<br/><br/>Shahrukh undoubtedly works the way to top by his portrayal of character Surinder Sahni. He looks so genuine and real as the character that one wouldn't give a second thought but by putting himself in his shoes, very realistic. What kills the movie's class is his second role as Raj, he must understand now that such flamboyant roles are not characteristic to his age and image now and he should avoid clinching such roles. Apart from this he steals the screen anytime as soft spoken Surinder. New girl in the block Anushka Sharma plays a good part. She looks good, matured and shares the screen with Shahrukh with ease. She never looked as a new bee in the movie and played her role convincingly. She is definitely going to get some big projects after this one. She has elan, grace and perfect weapons in her arsenal to cruise the way into audience heart, way to go girl.<br/><br/>Entire movie is shot in Amritsar, a contrast from any Yash Raj camp movie which are mandate to shoot in Switzerland, if not all then at least a song. Surely now they are realizing that it's not the location but the theme and performance that matter more to make a movie success. Music of the movie definitely is melodious, all the songs are well timed and helps to move the movie ahead, not just simple fillers. The track ""Dance pe chance mar le"" would definitely let you make some moves when you listen and see it on screen. The important point where movie lacks is the element of surprise within it,the storyline also is not new. Viewers are always aware of what would be next which drops the level of excitement a viewer should have while watching the movie. The role of Raj is not at all convincing and it's more an irritating one than anything else, a role which should have been thought in better way. It's only the individual performance that lifts the movie from falling in the category of an average movie.<br/><br/>In a nutshell if you are an SRK fan then it's a must watch for his role of Surinder Sahni, if you like good family oriented musical then this can be a good watch for a family. All in all I recommend this movie, at least you won't be disappointed after leaving the theater."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","3","10","8 July 2009"," An Below Average Flick With A Terrible Title
","'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi' is another fairy tale love story from the Yashraj factory. The story isn't anything new but I liked the way it started until it becomes a makeover story where the guy becomes a different person after getting a makeover and the girl's love is put to test blah blah. Chopra's writing is flawed as it lacks consistency. The dialogues are very ordinary. As horrible as I find the title to be, it's base doesn't make sense. There's a dialogue where Taani's dad tells her that some relationships are made by people and others are made by God and thus, her relationship with Suri is God-made.....uh, why? If anything, it was the father who obliged her into marrying him using God. I'm also surprised that Taani wasn't mad at Suri for having lied to her. Then again, one is bound to encounter more such plot holes. After all, Aditya Chopra is nowhere among the best writers. Most of the songs are nice. Item numbers seem to have become a regular ingredient in Shahrukh Khan's films. Here's one where he shakes it up with 5 item girls: Kajol, Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee. Regarding the acting department, Shahrukh is pretty much the same he's been in Yashraj's other films. Anushka Sharma is quite promising as she turns in a decent performance. Vinay Pathak lends some comic relief. 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi' is pretty much an average flick with some bright moments and some dull moments (including the dragging pace). Perhaps it may be worth a one time watch but nothing more."
"ssvikas","5","3","11","23 December 2008"," A potential blockbuster concept spoilt by a half-baked screenplay!
","When King Khan and Aditya Chopra come together, you can be sure about a formulaic high budget feel-good movie that will market itself into a blockbuster. While picturesque locales, expensive sets and tears are usually a must, Rab ne though makes a departure from the first two and delivers the typical family drama that pushed the envelope a bit further. Despite all the benign intentions behind the script, the movie misses the mark.<br/><br/>Middle aged Surinder ‘Suri’ Sahni, a square, starring King Khan in an avuncular avatar falls in love with a young and vivacious Taani, the débutante Anushka Sharma. Twists of fate lead them into sudden matrimony. Taani chooses to kill her bubbly self to become a dutiful housewife to her boring cubicle worker hubby. Deep in her mind though, she still craves for filmy romance rendering herself impervious to Suri’s unspoken love for her.<br/><br/>‘Dancing Jodi’, a contest comes to town and Taani enrolls herself. Eager to see her happy and bubbly, Suri the square turns into Raj the dude, with a little help from buddy Bobby (Vinay Pathak) to get closer to her. Though a flirtatious brat, Taani seems to like Raj better and the twine plan to elope. But Yash Raj style drama and the concept of seeing ‘Rab’ in the loved one lead the story and the dance contest into a happy ending! The success factor for this flick was to be the middle-class portrayal the multitude could relate to. Per se, SRK does well and so does the fresh and sweet Bangalorean Anushka. So is Vinay Pathak. Despite it all, you can sense a lack of ease of expression in the narrative. The transition from Suri to Raj is unbelievably quick for comfort. A scene with lesson from Bobby to Suri may have helped. Though lengthy, it misses critical points.<br/><br/>It’s too funny that Taani fails to recognize her own husband! Agreed, they never spent much time together nor did they consummate their marriage, but the fact that she doesn’t even show surprise at the similarity between the two faces is absurd. If this were shown in a movie that is a silly comedy or is used purely in a dramatic sense, I may have accepted it; but surely not in a movie that is supposed to be an endearing love story.<br/><br/>And what was that song with multiple actors all about? Simply passé! Also, Suri’s stance while he receives the end reminded me of the mentally ill character of Rohit in Koi Mil Gaya! Well, there is no reason for Suri to stand like his typical self; he just won the love of his life and should actually look delighted! Among the positives, the song ‘Tujh me rab dikhta hai’ is sweet and continues to play on in your mind much after the movie is over! True, audiences have enjoyed SRK’s contrived stories, especially the likes of OSO. But, while these are the custom made ‘masala’ flicks and thus gain a license to fool you, Rab Ne was supposed to be a plausible drama involving an average middle class man in an arranged marriage. Inconsistencies, clichés and what seems to be a hurriedly written and dated screenplay make this new flick from the DDLJ makers, disappointing!"

","It had been a long since I have seen a Hindi movie in theater, or seen a Hindi movie at all. I am not outright fan of Bollywood, but it does have its charm that Hollywood movies don't. Thanks to my mom and sister for taking to this not so great but OK movie, which does change my views about ""going down the ditch"" Bollywood scenario. On the whole, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is very desi at heart with a strong start and an equally strong emotional end. But more is expected from Aditya Chopra. Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is no Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, it's not Mohabatein either. But it is a movie with healthy humor. The movie is set on the backdrop of Amritsar. Surinder (Shah Rukh Khan), a simple, clean-hearted, honest man working for Punjab Power, leads an average work-class life, but the moment he sets his eyes on Taani (Anushka Sharma), his life undergoes a change. She's flamboyant, fun-loving, and vivacious, unlike Surinder. Unforeseen circumstances bring them together. Taani goes to learn dancing and then wants to participate in its dance competition, a reality show called ""Dancing Jodi"". Surinder wants to make his wife happy so he allows her to join. He then, with the help of his childhood friend Balwinder Khosla 'Bobby' (Vinay Pathak), metamorphoses into an alternate persona, named Raj who is a quick witted, outspoken, smart, dashing, fun loving person who fortunately becomes Taani's partner in the competition. And what then, like all Hindi movies they live happily ever after. The movie is not so strong with respect to plot, story or even screenplay but I did enjoy a good laugh. The funda of Hindi movies is simple just sit back relax and let the movie happen and don't think about it much. It is worth mentioning that to mention you see a different Shah Rukh Khan in this movie. He is very much involved in the character of Surinder that he makes it so effortless. Shah Rukh Khan delivers a excellent performance, and shows us why he is the best with a lot of change. It was nice to see him do some unusual and unparallel role. The lovely newcomer, Anushka Sharma, come out a very confident and promising star for the future. Having debuts with Mega Stars like Shah Rukh Khan may be the new formula Hollywood is trying after success of Deepika Padukone. As per me the ""Shah Rukh Khan fights a sumo wrestler"" scene, was a mess (if not a disaster), either it has to be funny or sad - it can't be both, and in this case it was neither. How many times does Surinder need to tearfully mention that he loves Taani an awful lot? And how many times does he have to do this - in the hair salon? The film skipping like a scratched record at times and becomes repetitive. The movie is plain with no crescendo, climax or movement of any kind. And not to forget Hindi movies are all about songs indeed and the movie does deliver a few good songs like Haule Haule, and upbeat song Dance Pe Chance. The item song Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte was not great but OK, reminded me of ""Dani California"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, (if you don't agree with me, don't crucify me) it gets repetitive with the same lyrics repeating over and over again. It's a tribute to Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Shammi Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna, and Rishi Kapoor. The song does contain lyrics from and allusions to some fantastic songs from the 1950s through 1980s. It would be a fun exercise to try to identify them. Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi really should be one of the better comedies of the year. I certainly hope it is. Regardless, at least it'll have lovely newcomer Anushka Sharma in wardrobe I'm most attracted to!"

","I saw this movie two times (one alone and one with my little sister) and now I'm here to write my thoughts and give a vote to it.<br/><br/>I'll give 6/10. The music is nice, the story line isn't that bad yet it could be better (i'm talking about the scenario). I didn't find it that convincing. The principal actors are playing nice yet for me it's hard to believe that the girl Taani didn't recognize that the 2 characters are the same (talking about Shahrukh Khan' roles).<br/><br/>I advice you to watch it at least one time (for Shahrukh Khan and for the pretty songs). The new actress is playing well for her 1st movie with Shahrukh Khan she was acting not that bad."

","This movie is the best movie I have seen. Suri and Taaniji acted wonderfully. But I guess that a few parts could be cut out which would<br/><br/>make the movie fast going. Example, when Suri talks to the mannequin-it was for too long a time. And the song 'Hum hai rahi pyar ke...'seemed as a filler and could have been left out. <br/><br/>Inspite of Anushka being a new actress, she acted very well. Shah Rukh Khan's acting as Raj Kapoor and Suri was convincing, they really appeared as two different people. <br/><br/>I like the concept/story of the movie. But the Director made Taani kind of foolish because when Raj wrote 'I love you', she should have guessed that this could have been a handi-work of Suri as he works in Punjab Power. The best part which I liked was the 'Honeymoon' pictures at the end, they were really cute. The movie gave a taste of comedy, romance and drama. Its a beautiful movie don't miss it!"

","Kahani: Basically, Suri falls in love with Tani at first sight and she has to marry him coz of some problems. She doesn't love him and so he changes himself to Raj! A dance show takes place where Tani and Raj keep meeting and so Tani falls in love with Raj without realizing that Raj is Suri! To find out who she stays with at the end you have to watch the movie! 4.75/5<br/><br/>Performances: Shah Rukh Khan Omg, this MAN is just unbelievable! He was flawless as usual but this time it was just something different yet brilliant! SRK plays 2 characters in the movie, Suri and Raj. Suri is an ordinary man who is boring, shy but very cute! He loves Tani to bits and so changes himself to Raj, a very modern and handsome young man! SRK plays both the characters very well and believe me you, if you thought that Suri was really cute in the Haule Haule promo, then you've seen nothing yet! I just cant believe how cute a simple man can be And of those people who say SRK cant do comedy now my answer to you is think again! I just fell in love with SRK all over again! 5/5 (though, I don't think I can rate SRK - he is just fab!!)<br/><br/>Anushka Anushka aka Tani is a very modern yet cultured girl (thats what i felt)! She marries Suri coz she has to but doesn't love him! Anushka has done a fab job and her performance was just outstanding! At first, I didn't think she was all that and really thought that she might not be able to play the role! But oh boy, I was so wrong! She was brilliant and I seriously, cant say she is a newcomer! Anyways, personally i feel she is the best newcomer in a very long time! 4.5/5<br/><br/>Vinay Pathak Omg, this guy was really funny! He is Suri's close buddy in the movie and helps him turn into Raj! He was another fantastic and a very emotional character in the movie! A very good performance by Vinay but I don't really know how to rate him! I can try tho! 4/5<br/><br/>Music: Haule Haule - 5/5 Tujh Main Rab Dikhta Hai (male) - 5/5 Tujh Main Rab Dikhta Hai (female) - 5/5 Dance Pe Chance - 4.5/5 (tho its starting to grow on me now) Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte - 4.5/5 Dancing Jodi - 4.5/5<br/><br/>OMG, I just love the music in this movie! At first I never used to like some of the songs as much but after watching them, I just love them! Especially, Dancing Jodi - That was the one I liked the least but now I just love it<br/><br/>I would like to rate it 5/5 but then you guys will kill me for it therefore am giving it 4.75/5<br/><br/>Baaki-Sab: Spoiler Alert Firstly, OMG Suri is just so cute and his smile in this movie is just to die for!! the bit where he nearly drops the laptop is so funny but my heart nearly came out in that scene (as most of my friends n family know how much i love laptops esp mine lol)! In the beginning when SRK puts the rose on the table near the note (with his phone number) and then put it back to the place is also very cute n funny! oh also, when she gives him the food and tifin he gets so happy, and when he doesn't know wat macho means, and the pani puri bit... - omg, i can just go on and on and on lol Tani's and Raj's characters were also fantastic and the bits they came in together they looked lovely as a couple! I found the movie really funny and at the same time it had a sweet and simple (love) story! omg, the bit where raj and Tani go out is just so gorgeous and omg, the 'i love u' in the lights *faints* I felt so bad for Suri when Tani told Raj that she didn't love anyone and omg, when Suri was getting beaten up by that stupid Japanese guy - i felt like crying oh i haven't laughed like this in a long time! Damn it! Suri is just so cute - if only he was for real! The end-credits are really funny lol oh and not to forget the last dance SRK can dance so well *faints* OK, i have always loved his dancing but this was so different! i don't remember seeing him dance that way and that too in those loose clothes and omg, did any of u lot notice! SRK's REAL LIFE pics were in the movie! i saw 2! have i forgotten anything!? don't think so but seriously, once again Suri is the cutest character ever! that shy smile of his is stuck in my head now! lol IT WAS HOUSEFULL!<br/><br/>The Bottom-Line: Overall, a very nice and entertaining movie! its a must watch and personally, i don't think anyone can get bored of it! I can watch this movie again and again without getting tired but thats just ME! 5/5"
"sid_yadav_1","10","2","6","14 December 2008"," A Extraordinary Movie Disguised as Something Ordinary
","Let me just qualify my review by saying the following: I am a Shahrukh Khan Fan. I did not like KANK and Om Shanti Om. I loved Swades, Don, and Chak De! India.<br/><br/>Now, for the review. I know most reviews have talked about the story, the cast, the director, etc., and you've probably gotten tired of reading and hearing about it, so I'm going to cut directly to the chase.<br/><br/>The movie is simple, sweet, and safe. It has a charm. It's the same charm which was last seen in Kal Ho Naa Ho, and before that K3G, Mohabattein, KKHH, Dil To Pagal Hai, and DDLJ (the Chopra/Johar/SRK classics). You feel the same emotions you did while watching those: you laugh, you cry, and most of all, you enjoy. You hear the same kind of emotional background music, the same kind of dialogs, and you see the same kind of picturized scenes. And that's what makes it so good -- that feeling you experienced 15 years earlier is back. So if you didn't like any of those I mention above, forget liking RNBDJ. If you loved them, you'll like RNBDJ if you ignore and close your mind to the biased reviews.<br/><br/>Shahrukh Khan is as good as he can get, and I don't know what to say apart from that. His performance is on par with that of all his other classics, and far far better than his non-classics such as Om Shanti Om and KANK. Surindhar Sani is just plain believable -- he is me, or the guy next door. Anoushka Sharma is brilliantly cast. Apart from being a great debut for her, she really fits the role of Taani. If Taani was played by an established actress such as Kajol or Rani or Preity, I don't think it would've worked as well. She's the simple Delhi/Punjabi girl, and complements Shahrukh's performance as the simple Delhi/Punjabi guy. Their pair just works. The other great (and only other?) performance is Vinay Pathak, who really shines just like the two main leads.<br/><br/>The story is fulfilling to say the least. Sure, it has its gaps and some might argue how believable it really is, to which I can't help by responding: IT'S A MOVIE. Have you seen DDLJ lately? Or KKHH? Or any movie which is considered a classic? They all have ridiculously unrealistic plot lines! If you don't believe me, get out that old VCD and give it a watch. No, I don't think the Rahul from KKHH would have had an affair with his college girlfriend after his wife's death, or the Raj Aryan of Mohabattein after-death sightings of Aishwarya Rai. If the ""unrealistic plot"" is the only reason you're not going to like this movie, I think it's fair to conclude that you don't like Bollywood movies, or even movies as whole. (I have to wonder about these people, how do they manage watching any sci-fi movie in the world?)<br/><br/>Now for the music, I'll willingly admit: I wasn't a fan the first time I heard it. In fact, I was sorely disappointed. Apart from Haule Haule, none of the tracks appealed to me, and 'Dance Pe Chance' just seemed old and lame. But over the last couple of weeks, they've really grown on me, and after watching the movie, I'll go as far as saying that I've become a fan. 'Tujh Me Rab Dikhta Hai' is a masterpiece. 'Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte' is well-pictured (except for Preity Zinta's appearance. What went wrong there?!). 'Haule Haule' is excellent. 'Dance Pe Chance' fits well with the plot and Raj's character. Sure, it's no DDLJ or KKHH in this matter, but it's damn good and fitting.<br/><br/>In all, if you've watched it and liked the movie, I think you'll agree with me, and if you haven't watched it yet, I hope you'll agree once you see it: RNBDJ is an otherwise-classic overshadowed by the recent events in Mumbai and (rumors say) Yash Raj's unwillingness to pay ""top critics"" for a 5-star review, which is why people like Taran Adarsh and Rajeev Masand, who have been known to 5-star 'classics' such as Karzzz and Om Shanti Om, and 1-star (real) classics such as Swades, Don, and Chak De!, have given an otherwise-extraordinary movie an ordinary rating. If there is one thing you can take away from this review, it's this: DON'T BELIEVE THEM. Watch it with your family or loved one. Once again be overwhelmed the nostalgia of the other Chopra/SRK flicks. Laugh. Cry. Have fun. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, DON'T MISS THE END CREDITS!!!!!"
"long-ford","Null","2","7","11 January 2009"," Very mixed feelings on this film
","I have to admit I am unsure about this film. After a sweet opening thirty minutes with the geeky and shy Suri (SRK), the film suffers after Suri dresses and acts outrageously as the irritating Raj simply so that he can catch a glimpse of his wife dancing at the local dance competition. Raj is very annoying, and Shahrukh is plainly to old to pull off this role. Much of the mid-section invites audience boredom, as they wonder why the husband would do something so bizarre. Some critics have claimed that the Raj character is an open attack on Bollywood romantic heroes. Indeed, this may be true, but it still isn't very interesting to watch as the balance of the film is ruined.<br/><br/>Thank heavens, the film sets itself right in the end with a sweet climax and ends with a charming voice-over by King Khan over the credits.<br/><br/>Overall 5/10"
"kunalkhandwala","6","2","7","26 December 2008"," Mediocre film yet again from the Yash Raj banner
","The Aditya Chopra-SRK combo has given the world DDLJ and Mohabbatein which are cherished in every romantic's memory with the sheer cinematic beauty, story telling, characterization, music and love story. The trademark 'Yash Chopra romance' was apparent in almost every scene. With a title that says 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi', one would expect the epic of all epics of love but what one gets is a mediocre film shot almost on stringent budgets due to the global recession with a story that wouldn't be a challenge even for a débutant director. The music would seemingly fade away from memory like the leaves in Mohabbatein's scenes and the characters which are as mortal as the simplicity of the film's premise would contribute to its undertone of unfailing love. In the end, 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi' is not your Chopra-SRK love saga at all. In fact, it is the most mediocre of King Khan's romantic ventures with just as many good moments as an unshaken bag of warm salted -butter popcorn.<br/><br/>Surinder Sahni (ShahRukh Khan) works for Punjab Power (the 'Lighting of your life') in Amritsar. This Suri fellow is your average enterprise worker  humble, simple, distasteful and boring. In an unexpected move by fate, he is married to Taani (Anushka Sharma) who has lost everything she had in a tragic turn of events. As Suri tries to maintain his distance from his wife who is yet to come to terms with the situation, his polite and humble approach has a charm of its own which is very unlike the flirtatious Khan we have been used to. Taani consciously tries to make things work, being aware that falling in love will be impossible but being a good wife should not be. Thus, as she prepares his tiffin for lunch at work to his utmost joy and as they watch movies together, Suri falls deeper in his blissful state but to gain her acceptance, he plans on something radical with his buddy Balwinder 'Bobby' Khosla (Vinay Pathak) who does a complete makeover, Golmaal style from Suri to Raj. Thus begins the transition that is now fairly common in most SRK films with Raj charming his way to Taani's heart only to realize that she is falling in love with the wrong person. Raj is not Suri and since she is married to Suri, he should be the one she must come to accept for what he is and remain faithful to him. Suri's conviction in this premise is true Yash Chopra fare and is among the more sensible areas that the film touches upon. The rest is just ho- hummm<br/><br/>Debutant Anushka Sharma impresses a bit more than she did in the promos but is definitely on the bottom of the list of Chopra's leading ladies. Vinay Pathak is brilliant in every scene and cracks you up with his typical comic act. The rest of the cast does not even deserve a mention and thus the film is virtually on SRK's shoulders which he ably carries. But then again, the character was so simple, the story was so banal, the look and feel of the film was just so mediocre that it did not really need King Khan. In fact, Ranvir Shorey would have done a brilliant job in the lead especially being paired with Vinay Pathak, the duo would have taken the film to another level. But alas, Adi Chopra's earnest wish to depict a common man in Amritsar in an extraordinary circumstance in his married life just resulted in a mediocre film. Perhaps a finer treatment, more visually appealing with more impactful dialog and never seen before type scenes would've hailed the return of Aditya Chopra as the director. Veer Zaara is a perfect example of the return from a sabbatical wherein Yash Chopra gathered the best of what he had compiled over the years and poured everything into a rich basket that flourished in the fragrance of romance. Nothing of that sort can be found in 'RNBDJ' and Yash Raj films disappoints yet again on that note. Salim-Suleiman give us a total of 4 tracks, 'Haule Haule' being the most resonant and hummable. 'Tujhme Rab dikhta hai' is melodious with Roop Kumar Rathod's rendition while 'Dance pe chance' is catchy but may only dubiously last as a hit track. 'Phir Milenge chalte Chalte' tries to be another 'Om Shanti Om' version of mixing old songs and celebrities but fails on all grounds. <br/><br/>Yes, the film has its moments of charm, innocence, sincere effort in making a relationship work and tender romance with a dash of comedy but everything is just in little doses that fail to leave the bigger impact. Perhaps the Chopras should do what they do best and leave the experiments and simplicity for the new directors that they have been encouraging. Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is a light entertainer nevertheless and while we hope for more spectacles from King Khan, the expectations from the Yash Raj banner go one notch lower yet again. <br/><br/><ul><li>6.88 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","The movie had basically four characters Mr. Surinder Singh Sahni (Sharukh Khan), Mrs. Tani Sahni (Anushka Sharma), Bobby (Vinay Pathak) and the fourth a very complex and a fictitious character Raj (The 'MACHO' Sharukh). In it Mr. Sahni has been shown as a typical medical class man wearing loose shirts and pants along with sports shoes (I don't understand from whom was the director inspired), and driving a bajaj scooter. Mrs. Sahni a chulbuli girl from Amritsar who marries Mr. Sahni because of her father but doesn't accept him as her husband. The story till now looks very simple and is continuing from retro ages of bollywood, but this is when the movie takes a new turn and Mr. Sahni is turned into Raj (Simply by removing moustache and applying hair gel) by Bobby to impress and make her wife fall in love for him and guess what bobby is successful; Mrs. Sahni is not able to recognize Mr. Sahni as he is Raj. The very concept of the movie was so obscure that I had to run out of the theatre 15 minutes prior to the ending even being an engineering student who can watch anything and everything. Raj impresses his wife but when she falls in love for him, he said no Raj has to die and she has to love Mr. Sahni (his Alter ego). Simply because the director wanted the movie to continue for three hours otherwise the movie would have ended in half the time. Second half is just the recap of 1st half with a summary in the end shown as a dream of Anushka. It's so boring and repetitive that in no case u can rate it above 6/10 (6 because of nice songs and actors (Sharukh, Anushka (she looked cute in the movie) and Vinay Pathak)."

","Shah Rukh Khan's films in the past 4 years were below average compared to the films that made him a superstar. Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi brings back the SRK we all love and adore. He captures you with his sweet natured character, Suri. He makes you laugh as the ""cool"" Raj. Aditya Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan return to sweep the audience up in a beautiful, romantic film that truly tells the story of how there's a incredible love story in every jodi! Shah Rukh Khan plays a simple man named Suri. He lives a very boring life and works at a Punjab power company. One day he meets the beautiful Tanni and they get married under unusual circumstances. One day, when Tanni decides to enter a dance competition, Suri decides to join in the competition so that Tanni will realize that he loves and sees God in her. The story was beautiful and the newcomer girl has a great screen presence. very good acting and catchy songs! must watch film!"

""I see god in you""!!! why does everything, even love, has to be about god? if he does exist, which I highly doubt, he doesn't give a s**t about you, he doesn't care if you're crippled, retarded, ugly, and he surely doesn't care if......let's say your family get raped and then burned to ashes by a bunch of burglars, he will only care if you are homosexual(which he is to blame for in the first place) so that he can enjoy burning, scalding, and roasting you for eternity. "" I see god in you"".... when do you see him best, when you f**k? cut the crap and love for the sake of love itself, not some jealous, envious, sadist psychopath people have imagined to be in the sky millennia ago."

How in hell can't the wife recognize SRK in a mustache ? Was she high or something ? People who enjoyed this movie are either blind SRK fans or have never seen movies which actually make sense.<br/><br/>The funny part is that at the end, the director tries to put in a tragedy. Please explain to me where the tragedy is and where the spark is at the end.<br/><br/>If such a story can make a viewer emotional, i think either the makers of this movie or the viewers who actually got emotional need serious medical help."
"manoj-ransing","6","1","5","28 December 2008"," When base is hollow, the building cant stand much
","RNBDJ is a decent entertainer. Fortunately I got free tickets of this movie and it was not so bad experience. Some of my friends who have already seen this movie warned me that its a boring movie. Inspite of that due to free tickets I went and watched it. <br/><br/>Fortunately the experience is not much regrettable for me, but not very pleasant also. The good thing about the movie is the music, songs and the actors. I am no fan of SRK. But I agree that he has the power to make people stick to their chair. In this movie, he performed Surinder beautifully. Raj is his normal overacted character, which we are used to. And here it is much overacted because the script demands it. The new actress and Vinay have done to their best, and performed well. The movie (when watched in theater) will make you sit to your chair till it ends. Some scenes are unnecessary and makes you snore. But still the movie is presented in a very pleasant and cool way, without any of the hyper drama and overdoses of love, friendship etc. These facts makes some positive impression. <br/><br/>But the basic problem of the movie is the base storyline of the movie. And this storyline is very thin and barely believable, and a lot childish. Just because someone trim mustache, remove specs and wear tight clothes doesn't make all together different personality. At least not for his wife. Also the wife saying to her boyfriend that she wants to leave, and on next day saying that she doesn't want to leave, is something that did not digest. Other than this due to very inherently corrupt baseline, the script itself has many loop holes, which doesn't make anything believable (e.g. the sumo fighting scene). The characters are also prescribed same. They are some times mild, sometimes over and hence do not make much impact. The director should know when to end the movie. After Raj says I LOVE YOU the movie should have ended within 15 minutes. But its still goes on, and then the dance at the end was utterly unnecessary. These facts also makes the impression bad about the movie. Faster the climax better the movie. Normally I hate watching songs in the movie. But in this if the songs were not there, I would have got out within minutes. Songs have definitely played a very good role in the movie. But in that too, hearing same music and line 'Rab ne bana di jodi' in high pitch more than often irritates brain. Again I am no great fan of Yashraj and SRK movies. But normally this combination means a funny, romantic three hours which could be spent with family. This movie too comes in same category, but if possible go with the pillow, so that you can take rest in between. And no need to say that you wont be remembering anything after you came out of theater. (Off course unless you want to write a review.)"
"AvinashPatalay","Null","1","6","23 April 2010"," Aditya Chopra's tribute to ""Satyam Shivam Sundaram""
","Adi teaming up with SRK after a decade roused an worldwide interest. If not another DDLJ, the audience were expecting nothing less than ""Mohabbatien"". <br/><br/>۞ SRK:: As the la Amol Palekar, he delivers an honest performance. Sadly the same cannot be said when he puts on the mask of ""Raj"". As with the all the superstars, even SRK has got imprisoned in his caricature. On the same note, had the character of Surinder Sahni worked with the audience (and especially with his fans), RNBDJ would have paved way for a natural transformation for SRK to experiment with unconventional projects. <br/><br/>۞ Anushka Sharma:: Very strong screen presence and come across as a natural performer. Need to make a good choice to establish her standing in Bollywood. <br/><br/>۞ Vinay Pathak:: He is talented no doubt, however his delivery seemed to over-perfected and therefore doesn't come across as natural.<br/><br/>Music by Salim-Suleiman is simple at its best and after a while grows on you. ""Haule Haule"" deserves a special mention.<br/><br/>The disguise of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde probably invited flak like a swarm of bees. How on earth could Taaniji fail to identify her husband? Allow me to be devil's advocate - ""because she is not supposed to"" in the first place! The entire movie is based on this very presupposition. This apriorism is borrowed from ""Satyam Shivam Sundaram"" and interlaced with Yashraj sensibilities. Sight is greatest boon to bestowed to the human, but the very same can turn into a biggest curse by blinding the heart. <br/><br/>Now go back and watch RNBDJ with fresh pair of eyes, you will see the underlying message from Aditya Chopra (and his master, Raj Kapoor)."
"dreaming_girl","10","1","6","27 July 2009"," One of the best Bollywood films of all times!
","This is seriously one of the best Bollywood films I have seen so far.<br/><br/>It's a light-hearted love story of a man who'll do anything to make his wife happy.<br/><br/>I thought it was going to be something like superman, make a guy wear some glasses and suddenly nobody recognizes him anymore, which I think is a bit ridiculous, but I didn't get that feeling whatsoever when watching this film. Shahrukh makes the characters so vivid and believable.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting, I think this is one of the best performances that I've seen from Shahrukh so far.<br/><br/>Great acting performances, also from the newcomer 'Anushka Sharma', wonderful songs, enjoyable dialogues, interesting and funny scenes.<br/><br/>A must see film!"
"leenabr","7","1","6","18 December 2008"," Blah, too Long, too long and too long.
","Im beginning to see a trend in shahrukh khan movies where he tries to crack jokes like ""mind it"" from Om Shanti Om, and his silly shivering and trying to maintain a conversation with a girl. Don't get me wrong I've practically worshipped this guy since DDLJ and KKHH, no one can be a bigger fan. But now its getting to me. Rab ne has a fantastic beginning with him playing a different character who is shy, loving caring and devoted. Anushkha sharma does a great job but she is far tooo tall for him, and looks far too young. the girl is probably in her teens and he's in his 40's even when he tries to look younger in the second half he still doesn't pull it off. On every scene srk has tears in his eyes for ""sacrificial love"" and that gets monotonous. I don't think Aditiya Chopra directed this movie. Even in the making videos he is no where to be seen. I missed Karan Johar. Even if the story wasn't strong, his dialogues, costumes, songs, direction would take the movie places. In conclusion this movie is far fetched (watch out for the ""i love you"" scene where supposedly srk lights up the city for anushka). I would call this movie a pass, and Im disappointed in srk. Watch Swades or Chakde India, don't waste time on this."
"kathuria_nidhi","8","1","6","13 December 2008"," Hadippa...Three Cheers!!!
","Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is a sweet love story that sweeps you away with its earnest emotions and imperfect characters that vouch of their virtues and vices just like you and me. The plot may be something you would be if not hugely, yet slightly skeptical about, but it works because of these very characters who breathe the same air, eat the same food, and dream a little dream just like you and me. The hero is an 'aam aadmi' who could be your neighbor, someone you see everyday on train or bus on your way to work. He wears sports shoes with dull color shirts and timeworn pleated pants; he is a man with ordinary looks almost like sarkari babus, shopkeepers or sales men from old Delhi or here more specifically, Amritsar. He is a man of mediocre stature and boasts of only unambitious common-man material needs. He is no 'Rahul' that thanks to recent breed of cinema is symbolic of rich chocolate boy image. But Surinder Sahni a.k.a. Shahrukh Khan can't resist the temptation to be 'Raj' 'naam toh suna hoga', again, the name and portrait he has immortalized since DDLJ. He is not Jim Carrey in The Mask who aspires to be a superhero to his alter ego. Garish in his makeover, with unsteady and unsure steps, Raj dances with his dream girl to make her laugh and fall in love. You don't see a black and white distinction between Suri and Raj and that's what transpires into a masterly screenplay and brilliant direction. There is a little Raj in Suri and vice-versa. Without fearing to give away much in this review, even though the story is largely predictable, the film exhibits an array of heartfelt scenes. There is a scene where Suri contemplates leaving a red rose with the breakfast he prepared for his wife. It's a beautiful scene that is suggestive of the protagonist's love that is throbbing to express itself. But Suri being what he is must contain his love where Raj is able to take it a leap above its counter self and voice his love from ridiculous to sublime. Another scene where a victorious Raj surprises you by crying for Suri who is slacking behind him in winning the same lady-love, gives you a tug in your heart. Music-wise 'Haule Haule' is one of the best songs to come out of Bollywood in a long time. It's earthy, colorful, with lyrics that describe the whole mood of the film. The pace of the film is tolerable, if not fast. Dialogs are not as good as Aditya Chopra's other films like DDLJ or Mohabbatein, but still they work because they are mouthed with sincerity and passion. But yes, the number of times the word 'Pyar' is used in the movie, pushes it over the borderline for high or too much sugar. May be as a promotion, the producers could have quizzed the audience on how many times the characters mouth that word! Vinay Pathak as Bobby; Suri's childhood friend is very effective. The newcomer Anushka Sharma was a brilliant choice. She is a complete natural but kudos to Aditya Chopra for sketching her character with subtlety and not making the audience suffer any melodrama by making her erratically jump into her sad past at every given opportunity. Finally, why Rab Newill really work? One word, which is also the final word-SRK."

","Yash Chopra films mostly are fantasy films except a few. In RBNDJ he tries to make a slice out of life film and mix it with filmy masala, the result a half hearted film. The initial reels are captivating, With Suri and Taani's love story though which reminds us of Main meri Patni Aur Woh(2005) which was far better. But the film falls flat as soon as Raj enters as it doesn't make sense, the Raj-Taani scenes fail to impress. The film falters as it's obvious to the viewer that both are same character but Taani cant make out.They are some emotional and romantic scenes but the film fails to reach out due to it's far fetched aspect. The film also gets melodramatic towards the climax with a gurudwara thrown in and heroine sees her rab's face in her pati.<br/><br/>Direction by Aditya Chopra is decent Music is good, Haule Haule is superb(shot for long time in 1 take), Dance pe Chance is good, however Chalte Chalte though well picturised doesn't fit in the film, also the presence of Rani, Preity is predictable as they used to be in most Srk films those days in sp.app Tujhmein Rab is good<br/><br/>Shahrukh Khan tries to handle both roles well and he does do well as Suri but as Raj he tends to overact.
