","When young Dewey Cox accidentally cuts his brother in half with a machete, it sets him on a long, hard, and winding road that traverses the most profoundly important moments in modern music history spanning the 1950's to today. ""Walk Hard"" was erroneously advertised as yet another comedic romp from Judd Apatow. While as the co-screenwriter here many of Apatow's trademarks can be found including the usual sophomoric sexual humor and ironic pop-culture references, ""The Dewey Cox Story"" is actually closer in spirit to the mocumentaries of Christopher Guest (""This is Spinal Tap!"" and ""Best in Show"") as channeled through the spastic colon of the ""Naked Gun"" films.<br/><br/>This is a parody played hilariously straight. The target of its mockery is so succinct and sharply pointed--the recent Oscar-winning musical biopics ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line""--that the film's true comedic genius may be lost on people who didn't really pay attention to those films or thought this would just be another ""Superbad."" The film's mimesis of its source materials is so spot-on, that it even follows their same cadence and nearly falls apart midway as it glosses over many points in history and aspects of the musician's life while covering every cliché possible from the temptations of life on the road with drugs and groupies to bouts in rehab and bitter divorces to long dry periods that suddenly make way for life-altering inspiration.<br/><br/>At the center of ""Walk Hard"" is John C. Reilly who sings and acts his heart out to hilarious effect. A former Oscar nominee for ""Chicago"", Reilly has since cut a niche for himself as the second banana to bigger comedy stars like Will Ferrell in ""Talladega Nights"" and for the first time gets a film to call his own. Tim Meadows is shockingly funny as the friend who ushers in Cox's decent into drug use (his overly accentuated but still deadpan line deliveries are priceless), while Jenna Fishcher is sprite and lovely as the June Carter cutie to Cox's Johnny Cash wannabee. Other SNL players including Kristin Wiig and Chris Parnell and Apatow alumni like Paul Rudd (as John Lennon!) and Jonah Hill pop in and out of the film amidst an onslaught of funny sight-gags and one-liners. Also in on the fun is a cavalcade of current music stars including the lead singer of the White Stipes as Elvis and Eddie Vedder as himself doing a nonsensical quasi-spiritual riff on Cox's legacy while presenting a Lifetime Achievement Award.<br/><br/>The heart of ""Walk Hard"" is in the music. If you were to not listen so closely, you might be fooled into thinking these were actual hit songs from their respective time periods. Of course, listening to the lyrics is part of the fun. The ridiculously silly double-entendres in Cox's duet with his honey-to-be Darlene are especially funny, while I personally found their spoof of a Bob Dylan song to be downright brilliant. Since the writers took the time to be so verbose and intricate with their nonsensical free-form versing, they allowed the bit to work on multiple levels as both an homage and a biting jab at Dylan's alleged lyrical genius.<br/><br/>Utimately ""Walk Hard"", in ways both monumentally stupid and unfathomably smart, proves to be almost too clever for its own good. It may have bombed in it's first-run at the box office, but I would imagine it will eventually find its audience. In one pivotal early scene Cox begs his wife to believe in him and his dreams of becoming a successful singer. She replies something to the effect of, ""Oh, baby, I do. I just believe you're gonna fail."" I couldn't have said it better myself, and it still has me laughing."

","I've watched this movie around 50 times. Literally one of the funniest movies ever made. It would be great if it was a movie that kids could enjoy as well, but that is my only complaint. 100% adult themes and shows way too much for a responsible parent to allow children to watch.<br/><br/>When I was a kid we had Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and Porky's. This is a hilarious movie, and I suggest watching it repeatedly since there will be a lot of things you will catch and fall over laughing at if you understand the movie at all. John C Reilly comes into a class A acting role with this one. And deserves it.<br/><br/>Great music as well as amazing acting. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. Love it."
"SourGreenapple42","8","116","152","26 December 2007"," Hysterical and Clever movie!
","""Walk Hard"" is a clever parody of the life of a rock-star, and bio-pics such as ""Walk the line"", ""Ray"" and ""La Bamba"". It follows the formula nearly perfectly, and follows fake rock-star legend Dewey Cox (and yes, they do have plenty of puns with his name, but this is to be expected) through his life in the 50's, 60's, 70's and into today.<br/><br/>The surprise of ""Walk Hard"" is that although it was written by the guys who made ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked Up"", and has the ""formula spoof"" similar to ""Scary Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"", this film manages to be quite intelligent, and manages to avoid overly gross out humor. While it has its share of gross out and slapstick gags, it isn't completely idiotic, while movies such as ""Epic Movie"" or ""Talladega Nights"" tend to be totally moronic and disgusting. The humor here is very observational, self-parodying, ironic, surreal, dark and often hysterical.<br/><br/>The reason why ""Walk Hard"" works well is because of its somewhat wicked sense of humor. It manages to ironically ""overdue"" the jokes to the point that you can see the actual funny part is that it is being overdone and over-the-top. It self implies that something is going to go bad, and makes the audience clearly see what path the scene is heading towards, which is also another part of its sense of humor.<br/><br/>The performances are very good as well. John Reilly plays Dewey very well, and his naive but good natured persona often plays out hysterically in contrast to a society often attempting to harm him. His character does lack some substance and emotional depth, though this is to be expected in the humorous nature of the film, and is the writing, not the acting. He plays the role from ages 14 to 71, and the goofy age difference between Reilly and how old of a character he is playing is another one of the film's ironic self-aware quirky jokes, in which he constantly reminds us of his age throughout the film so we can see this, as well as the purposely awkward looking make-up.<br/><br/>Jenna Fischer is great as his love interest and duet partner, a parody of Reese Witherspoon in ""Walk the Line"", who falls on and off for Dewey throughout the movie based on his life decisions, another movie formula cliché. Tim Meadows is hysterical as Cox' drug-addict drummer and long time friend, with all of his lines being in a tongue-in-cheek and smart-ass manner, and a hysterical repetition of scenes where he introduces Cox to drugs.<br/><br/>All in all, the only problem with this movie is that it is quite uneven. The movie seems to spend a large time dealing with Dewey's life in the 50's, not spending much time in the 60's, 70's or 90's, and spending no time in the 80's. It jumps into his problem a bit fast and doesn't go into depth into some areas of his life as much as others.<br/><br/>However, despite being somewhat uneven, ""Walk Hard"" remains a very entertaining, very funny, and witty movie. It is quite tragic that this opening weekend went up against the liking of nearly 4 very popular movies, resulting in a box office failure of this film. Hopefully next week, or in the future to come, this gem of a comedy (A rare thing in 2007), can be seen and gain a reputation among others."
"vranger","9","24","28","8 June 2009"," Bring on the parody
","And if there is a musical genre out there short of orchestral symphony, it gets sent up by this wonderful comedy.<br/><br/>Not a movie for the kiddies by a long shot, but if you are familiar with music artists from the 50s on, and especially if you lived through those periods of time, the parody of styles and stars will leave you with sore sides from laughing.<br/><br/>Make sure to listen closely to every lyric. They don't miss a chance to make jokes subtle or broad, and they don't take it easy on anyone.<br/><br/>Songs in the credits are just as funny as songs through the body of the movie, so make sure to wait around for those rather than switching off after the story itself fades to black.<br/><br/>A personal favorite of mine are the scenes where Dewey discovers new drugs. Although I've never taken drugs, even smoked marijuana, these scenes were just too funny to be offensive, especially the first discussion of the weed just named.<br/><br/>Be in the mood to watch a comedy, especially for a parody of this type. If you can't really pay attention, you won't get everything, and will just think the movie crude. Also, if you're really stuck up about what's in your comedy, then you may not like this movie.<br/><br/>If you're up for it, you'll die laughing."
"javaman-7","7","29","35","25 April 2008"," Dewey Cox: Riley makes him real
","Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (rated R). Directed by Jake Kasden. Written by Judd Apatow and Jake Kasden. Starring John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Raymond J. Berry, Kristen Wiig, Tim Meadows, Harold Ramis & Chris Parnell. Running Time: 96 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com. <br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>Like the film Ray (2004), a young boy and his brother frolic in the bucolic wonderland of the American South of the 1930s. Like Walk the Line (2005), a young man leaves his loving mother and hateful father to find solace in his music. Like... well, you get the idea. This film is primarily a send-up of the musical bio-pic, as Dewey Cox (Riley) channels nearly every rock icon that ever took the stage... from Dylan, Cash, Orbison, and Presley to Brian Wilson. Like his fellow rock stars, Dewey is often tempted by drugs and sex. In a hilarious motif, he is constantly opening a door and finding his drummer, Sam (Meadows), behind it with sexy backup singers and the latest drug of choice. ""You don't want any part of this s**t,"" Sam says, and proceeds to tell Dewey all of the drug's benefits. Despite their wayward ways, Dewey and his band are discovered by a trio of Hasidic Jews and begin to record a remarkable string of number-one hits. As he cruises the decades like Forrest Gump with a guitar, Dewey meets all of his legendary contemporaries, played by uncredited actors you are likely to recognize. Watch especially for Lennon, McCartney and Buddy Holly.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java Mugs <br/><br/>What is remarkable about this movie is the way we feel about the main character, Dewey Cox. It's easy to find sympathy for the likes of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles because we knew them as real people. But why do we feel so strongly about a singer we know does not really exist? Some of the credit goes to the filmmakers, who know which emotional buttons to push, but mostly we have Riley to thank. In an amazing portrayal, he takes what could have been a spoof-worthy sap and turns him into a fully developed character we really care about. Riley actually becomes Dewey Cox, by singing his heart out and even helping to write many of the film's songs.<br/><br/>Other performances are also worthy of note, particularly Fischer's sultry Darlene, Wiig's ever-pregnant Edith and Meadows' drug-addled drummer.<br/><br/>Though Riley's singing is quite good, it is still nice to have the likes of Lyle Lovett, Jackson Browne, Jewel, Ghostface Killah and Eddie Vedder playing themselves and singing those Dewey Cox originals. But none of the music was as brilliant as an early scene with Honeyboy Edwards singing the blues."
"reid23882007","9","129","181","21 December 2007"," They've done it again!
","I must admit that I went into this one already thinking it would be another home run by Apatow and the gang. And they did not disappoint. John C. Reily has turned in his most comedic performance to date which is something considering his roles in Talledega Nights and Boogie Nights.<br/><br/>Johnny Cash probably is rolling in his grave, but in laughter and not dismay. There are just too many classic moments in this film to label it as a long SNL skit as others have done. IT IS A MUST SEE!<br/><br/>I think any review can be summed by saying that this is a comedy rock biopic in the spirit of Spinal Tap with the biting wit of a Mel Brooks film. Just Classic."
"steelydwill","9","151","215","11 October 2007"," Different style but another great one from Apatow gang
","As a huge fan of the previous Apatow movies, I drove recklessly through traffic to make it into an early screening of Walk Hard, and I'm happy I did. I think this movie is a different direction for Judd and his band, as it is more similar to Airplane in style than it is to Knocked Up. But that impressed me that they took that risk and made it work -- and it definitely worked as me and the rest of the theatre were laughing with regularity.<br/><br/>Without getting too much into the details of the movie because I hate spoilers, the thing that made this movie great to me was the unexpected humor. Like Airplane, there are a lot of times when you just don't see the next line coming, and those are the best laughs. Besides John C. Reilly in the lead role, who obviously got a lot of the funniest lines, Tim Meadows as Dewey Cox's drummer really cracked me up, and Paul Rudd as Jon Lennon cracked up the entire theatre.<br/><br/>It was definitely one of those movies where you're recalling a lot of funny parts a day later. So while it may be a different type of movie than the Apatow groups' other work, the sense of funny is still there, and I think this is up there with the best comedies of the year."
"mattkratz","9","49","68","6 February 2008"," hilarious
","I thought this was a brilliant satire of the biopic genre. It was obviously borrowed from Walk the Line, but there was plenty of other stuff thrown in as well. It was a truly hilarious movie, including the scenes where the band members convince him to try the drugs, a scene with the Beatles, the variety show stuff and interviews, all the scenes with the title character smashing the sinks, and the Walk the Line spoofs. It was very well written with lots of great dialog. You will love all the cameos and other stuff. I guarantee it. This was a tailor-made role for John C. Reilly, who is perfect in and for the part, as is just about everyone in it.<br/><br/>*** 1/2 out of ****"
"harrisonh1","9","98","147","16 December 2007"," Apatow nails it again
","There is no doubt that Walk Hard is a great parody of the musician biopic as we know it today. The film is filled with rips and references to movies such as Walk the Line and Ray. Walk Hard does all of this very well, but also has its own brand of humor and jokes that stand on their own. From the time that the opening scene rolled, I knew that I was in for a treat.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan show their comedic genius throughout the movie, whether it be through clever dialog between characters or the genuinely funny original songs. The music performed by Dewey Cox does a great job of parodying various styles, from Dylan to Brian Wilson.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly is fantastic in his role as Dewey Cox and establishes himself as a solid leading man. I was also thoroughly impressed that he actually sang and played all of the music in the movie and did it well. Jenna Fischer's performance in Walk Hard may be just what her career needs right now. It's nice to finally see her breaking the mold that she has set for herself as Pam in The Office.<br/><br/>Walk Hard also featured a wide range of current and former SNL stars, such as Kristin Wiig and Chris Parnell. In addition, some of the regulars from past Apatow films are also featured, but I don't want to ruin any surprises here.<br/><br/>All in all, Walk Hard is a really solid comedy and a must see for any Apatow fans. If you are going to see Walk Hard, do yourself a favor and check out Walk the Line and Ray before going. It will make for a much more rewarding experience."

","When I first saw the trailer to Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, I didn't think much of it other than ""Oh, great, another Knocked Up wanna be"", it just seems like they won't stop with these over the top comedies. But my friend and I decided to see it the other night and I have to admit, I really did laugh. I'm almost scared to say that the creators of the Superbad, Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin are doing a great job in the comedy genre. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story is stupid humor, but it's definitely a need in our lives when it comes to films where we don't have to think but just enjoy. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story takes a joke at the big Oscar winning biographies like Walk the Line and Ray. Some of the humor is a little out there, but works like in the days of Airplane! The story is a lot of fun to watch though.<br/><br/>Dewey Cox is an inspiring musician with a soulful voice and the history of the blues. He is trying to do double good in his life since he accidentally macheted his brother in half. He goes on to make huge hits in life, but is constantly accused of making the ""devil's music"". But through his success, he finds a beautiful duet singer, Darlene and makes her his wife. But he goes through the life struggle of drugs, sex, and rock and roll. He learns the true meaning of life and must deal with the fact that he can't smell anything, but in the end learns more about his 22 kids.<br/><br/>Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story is silly, but it's all in good fun. I have to admit that I am glad that I saw it, as stupid as it was at times, like I said, we all need those brainless comedies. I'm sure once people give Walk Hard a better chance when it comes out on rent, somewhere down the line this will be a classic. I mean, come on! It had Jack Black as one of the Beatles in the film! OK, I know that it sounds stupid, but believe me, it's funny. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story is a fun comedy that I would recommend to see, you'll get a few good laughs out of it.<br/><br/>7/10"
"ccthemovieman-1","7","18","29","21 May 2009"," Lots Of Laughs, Entertaining But Another Crude Comedy
","I got a lot of laughs out of this film but I warn those that his another modern-day crude comedy. It's definitely not ""family viewing."" It's a parody on ""Walk The Line,"" the biography of Johnny Cash with John C. Reilly playing the famous singer. He is extremely funny in this role but the humor is the absurd, dark variety.....so be ready for that! <br/><br/>It's really a parody of the rock 'n roll/folk/psychedelic scene, more than anything, from the beginnings in the mid 50s up to the present. The majority of the film deals with the late '50s and up to the '70s. You get a lot of ""digs"" at folk singers, Bob Dylan and then The Beatles. It's pretty innocent and very funny. The lyrics to songs are hilarious. You also get a lot jibes as Cash and his relationship with his girlfriend-then-wife, June Carter. That latter is played by a pretty and very sexy Jenna Fisher.<br/><br/>What isn't innocent are the sex, drugs and adultery jokes. Some of them are funny; some are way too silly or just plain crude and unnecessary....but that's comedies of today. I mean, we don't need to see repeated shots of a guy's penis, do we? Actually, the film only goes way overboard, language-and sex-wise, in the last 30 minutes when a bunch of f-bombs are yelled out and the story goes into the sewer....before coming out with a nice, sentimental ending. I guess that was supposed to make up for the all the sleaze. It didn't; but it still was an entertaining film which flew by.<br/><br/>One last thing: the music in here is excellent. Some think it's the best part of the film."
"view_and_review","7","16","26","15 June 2008"," Cal Naughton Jr. no longer finishing second
","Oh yes this movie was funny. I didn't have many expectations, if any, of this movie, but it certainly delivered. I knew from the trailers and ads that the movie was going to parallel if not parody ""Walk the Line"", but there were also several references to ""Ray"". I would say one of the funniest references to ""Ray"" was Dewey Cox losing his sense of smell.<br/><br/>Initially it looked like the movie would be very cheesy with punchlines being telegraphed well ahead of time. But, even with the punchlines being blatantly set up, it was better to go with the transparent set up instead of the thinly veiled set ups that a lot of comedies use.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough there was not much profanity which made its usage that much funnier. Now, I certainly could've done without the male nudity, but maybe that was only in the unrated version. Even still, by and large John C. Reily held his own and the movie was terrific."
"liskula-01161","9","5","7","4 April 2018"," Deserves so much more recognition
","Very surprised to see the IMDB rating for this one. It definitely deserves a higher score. The humour is often crude might not be everyone's cup of tea but you can easily compare it other movies in a similar over the top comedy-type genre like Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step-Brothers etc. This one in my opinion is the best one out of all them. There were a few jokes that didn't land as great as they could but overall, this is was a non stop laugh out loud movie for me and all the people I have ever watched it with.<br/><br/> -John C Reilly's performance is amazing. Despite the fact that his character is unimaginably out of touch with the world surrounding him, he makes it look so believable. He is the perfect fit for this type of character and you can see, he put a lot of improv in the scenes and made it his own thing.<br/><br/>-The pacing of the movie is great. Its very clever in the way it depicts the cliches of music biography movies. It heavily underlines all the overused motifs in the genre (the neglecting father, the wife/lover perturbations, addiction to fame and money) but but makes them very genuine, in a way that the viewer doesn't get detached from the Dewie's story.
 
-And the biggest star of the movie: The music. The songs are great, they're funny, catchy and really well performed. Each song captures the essence of its times and pushes the story forward. I would dare to say they could easily hang with some of the biggest scores from Hollywood musicals. This why this movie works so much better than the more recent ""Popstar"" with Adam Sandberg, which made a similar effort in mocking the perks of being a music star. In that movie, the songs are well written and funny, but never seem like the real deal. In ""Walk Hard"", you can actually see how the songs could be hits in the movie's universe. All of them have great replay value and make the movie very rewatchable. There's the career breaking song, the falling out of fame song, even a Bob Dylan parody witch is hilarious. Its just a clever and enjoyable commentary on the history of music.<br/><br/>All in all you should just watch it, if you haven't. I often skip movies if I see a lower than 7 rating on IMDB. You should not skip this one if you enjoy other Jud Apatow style comedies. Even if you've never been a fan of them, this one might change that!"

","Seven years ago I wrote a review of ""Dewey Cox"" in which I gave it eight stars, and conceded it was probably not a movie for everyone. Since that time, I've had the opportunity to rewatch it numerous times, and with each viewing, I like this movie even more. Bottom line:<br/><br/>THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. IT IS THE MOST UNDERRATED MOVIE EVER MADE.<br/><br/>I can write a thousand words about why this movie is so good. The acting, the original songs, the humor, the unbelievable cast, the costumes, the cinematography, the creativity, etc. Everything looks so authentic, there are moments in which you genuinely forget you are NOT really watching historical footage from 1966, or watching a cheesy 1978 variety show. By the end, when viewing the ""Lifetime Achievement Award,"" you may actually find yourself forgetting Dewey Cox is a fictional creation.<br/><br/>A much more interesting discussion, however, is WHY DID THIS MOVIE BOMB? Why has it received so many poor reviews, and why has it been relegated to complete obscurity, when compared to its ""peers"" such as Talladega Nights and Superbad? Let's toss out some theories:<br/><br/>1. You really need to be a music fan to enjoy this movie at the level it's meant to be enjoyed, especially classic rock. You have to be able to appreciate the parodies of Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, Buddy Holly, the Beatles, George Jones, etc.
2. You really need to be familiar with Ray and Walk the Line to appreciate all the jokes.
3. As a Judd Apatow movie, this movie was probably primarily viewed in the theater by young people who couldn't appreciate all the Baby Boomer humor.
4. Face it, full-frontal dude nudity freaks people out.
5. Some people will find this movie too offensive, and too tasteless. They are pretty shameless with the ""Cox"" double entendres. Additionally, some may feel they are crassly ridiculing Johnny Cash's tragedy, or Ray Charles' blindness.<br/><br/>Bottom line, never has pop culture been so thoroughly skewered in such a creative, hilarious fashion.

","I just got back from round two with this film. ""Walk Hard' the second go around made me laugh, but alas I don't think it is a comedy classic. It is however very funny especially if you know your rock music history and have seen a fair amount of music biopics. <br/><br/>Director Jake Kasdan continues his streak of making films that seem to be made for me, ie The Zero Effect and The T.V. Set (except Orange County which just sucked) Kasdan, bless his soul, isn't interested in making comedies that appeal to a broad audience. I find his movies very refreshing and pretty darn witty. Walk Hard continues the tradition. This time however, he does have Judd Apatow helping out. So ""Walk Hard"" is rife with all sorts of lowbrow humour as well. All of it is pretty funny. The film has lulls, but in this day and age of lazy spoofs like ""Scary Movie"" I can forgive them. <br/><br/>John C. Reilly nails this performance. He plays the movie silly (it is a very silly movie) yet his character still feels pretty genuine. <br/><br/>That genuine aspect probably makes the movie work for me. The songs are good. Kasdan and Apatow obviously have a love for the material. It's good that contemporary film makers are taking cues from Brooks and the Zucker brothers and showing a lot of love for the material while spoofing it. Something that other spoof movies fail at miserably. <br/><br/>So all in all...if you are a fan of all sorts of music..

","I had the pleasure of making it out to the movie theatre this Christmas to go and see a movie. I was shocked too hear my Aunt suggest Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, but there it was. I went to see it with my entire family and some extended family.<br/><br/>Initially, I had heard nothing about the films, nothing from friends ore acquaintances who had seen it before me. After seeing various trailers, I was under the impression it was just another horrible farce movie like Date Movie or The Comebacks. This wasn't the case at all. It did have a few references to Ray and was an overall farce of Walk the Line, but it was not over the top at all with it. It was actually a shock to see how good John C. Reilly's voice was. Also, I may add that Jenna Fischer was stunningly beautiful and did great in her role (I don't think it was her singing though).<br/><br/>There are several lines that had me laughing through entire scenes. I was even surprised to turn to my mother and aunt, who were laughing along with me.

","The trailers for this movie don't do it any justice. I thought it was going to be pretty bad. I mean it's silly, extremely silly but I laughed from beginning to end. The movie it reminds me most of is my #8 favorite movie of all time (yes I keep a list) 'Top Secret!'. Not since Nick Rivers have I seen such an amazing performance from a phony rock star. Also if you're a fan of cheesy biopics or ""Behind the Music"", this should really entertain you. Surprisingly, to me at least, it also is a very good musical. I'm not kidding. John C. Reilly is much better here than in his Oscar nominated performance in 'Chicago'. This is going to sound wrong but this part just fits him better. And he's a really good singer. I'm thinking I just might buy the soundtrack.<br/><br/>At different points you can see bits and pieces of 'Ray', 'Walk the Line' (of course), 'What's Love Got to Do With It', 'The Doors', every rock n' roll movie you can think of. Oh and I love the casting of the Beatles. Paul Rudd's awful portrayal of Lennon just rocked. You see, it's meant to be like all the bad TV movie portrayals of rock stars that you've seen. However, Jason Schwartzman could have passed for Ringo. But the casting of Paul is just priceless.<br/><br/>The movie, as I said, is really well done. I kept thinking ""oh when I get home I'm going to use that quote as my sig"". And then the next one would be even better. For that reason I think this movie will become even better on repeated viewings. But it's not for everyone. There's nakedness in this movie, lots. And some cursing and silly drug use. So if that stuff bothers you, it's probably not for you but I'd say it's for people who don't get offended easily and are fine with laughing at other people. I loved it."

It sort of follows recent films like the ones about Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. It starts with Dewey as a boy and he is responsible for a horrible accident with his talented brother. It's quite funny as the top half keeps talking. Flash forward to high school. Dewey is now played by John C Reily and he is supposed to be 14. Quite funny. He sings a song that sends people into a tizzy. Next thing you know his married, with a kid, and trying to make it in showbiz. Another really funny thing is whenever Dewey runs into the Tim Meadows character doing drugs. He also says you don't want none of this. Then acts offended if Dewey wants to say no. But as the story goes, Dewey gets hooked on drugs. He gets anther wife and has so many kids he can't keep track of them. He is at odds with his dad.<br/><br/>And the songs they come up with are catchy, but silly. The film just en-chances the typical out of control life of a rock star.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Better than expected. Not for kids."

","Five minutes into the screening, I commented to my friend how well written this movie is. Holy cow, they nail every rock bio-pic cliché and then some. Hilarious from the first moment to the closing credits. Our crowd applauded at the end. Of course, it helps to have the director introduce the movie and for the sound crew to be local (somewhat) celebrities. And it also helps that we were given passes to see John C. perform a set in character at a local club after the show. Still, none of that would have mattered with crappy writing or performances. The movie stands on its own, should do well at the box office, and in my opinion, is an instant classic. Now, be prepared to experience heavy overuse of a particular joke based on the character's last name. And there's plenty of language to wade through. One more thing, before this hits Comedy Central's line-up in a few years, they'll have to edit one particular scene pretty heavy on nudity - the nudity is really out there, but it's not at all sexy, just played for comedy. You'll laugh, but it's not for the prudish for sure. Okay, I highly recommend it to those over 17 with those caveats. Scotto says Check It Out!"

","I'm not gonna bother writing a review because 192 people before me have done it on this page. <br/><br/>All i'm gonna say is I literally had to hold my sides about 4 times in this film. John C really nails it in this movie and shows that he doesn't need Will Ferrell by his side to make an amazing comedy. Personally i found this movie on par with anchorman if not better and i hope to see John C making more movies with him in the driving seat in the near future. A must see and if you have bought it on DVD, buy it again in case something happens to your first copy. A comedy classic!<br/><br/>my Rating <br/><br/>11/10 (If i could)"
"tung_webster","10","3","4","4 October 2008"," A must-watch comedy
","If you are looking for a good comedy in recent time, I would strongly recommend Walk Hard. This movie is a musical comedy which just simply tells about the life story of a fictional singer (Dewey Cox) who gains all his fame and fortune, yet simultaneously messes up his life by abusing drugs. The reasons why I keep watching it for so many times: 1. The movie makes fun of everything, the best parts are about Elvis Presley, The Beatles and drugs. However, almost every minute of it is hilarious. All the dialogs are so funny that you can laugh with tears. Here's one of Elvis Presley's quotes: ""It's called Karate, man. Only two kinds of people know it, The Chinese and The King. And one of them is me."" 2. Good acting from all characters, especially John C. Reilly as Dewey Cox and Jenna Fischer as Darlene Madison. 3. The musical work is quite fine. 4. The movie pretty much reflects accurately 2 things. The first reflection is about all the major changes in terms of culture, art forms and music in the United States through a long period of time. The second impression is how different art forms and music are related to different types of drugs that are used. 5. And finally, it is very American ... it is very theatrical."

"ironhorse_iv","6","4","6","22 July 2016"," Walk Hard, Hard. Down life's rocky road. Walk bold, hard. That's my creed, my code. Walk Hard is a funny tongue-in-cheek movie, worth checking out.
","Considering how bad, the parody genre has gotten as of late. I was blown away by how good this movie was. It's so good, that somewhat belongs in the same levels of filmmakers: David Zucker, Monty Python and Mel Brooks's finest works. Directed by Jake Kasdan, and written and produced by Judd Apatow. 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' tells the story of the hard-knock life of musician Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly) from his rags-to-riches beginnings, his raise as a megastar country star, his struggle with drug abuse, and his redemption in his later life with his later-wife, Darlene Madison (Jenna Fischer). If this story sounds very familiar. The plot echoes the storyline of 2005's Johnny Cash biopic, 'Walk the Line' and 2004's Ray Charles biopic 'Ray'. While, Walk Hard mostly heavily references, those two films, there were also a various amounts of other biopics that the film used as inspiration, such as 2004's 'Beyond the Sea', about singer, Bobby Darin and 2007's 'I'm not There' about musician, Bob Dylan to name some. The film also includes elements of the lives and careers of Roy Orbison, Glen Campbell, Jerry Lee Lewis, Donovan, James Brown, Jim Morrison, Conway Twitty, Neil Diamond, and Brian Wilson. The film portrays fictional versions of artists Buddy Holly (Frankie Muntz), The Big Bopper (John Ennis), Elvis Presley (Jack White) and the Beatles: Paul McCarthy (Jack Black), George Harrison (Justin Long), John Lennon (Paul Rudd), and Ringo Starr (Jason Schwartzman). Additionally, some real-life artists were filmed, playing themselves, including Eddie Vedder, Jewel Kicher, Lyle Lovett and Ghostface Killah. In addition, the film feature several musical styles such as the late 1950's R&B movement, the early 1960's California Sound, the late 1960s Vietnam War Protest Folk-music style, the early 1970s, Space Oddity and last 1970s punk rock movement. Despite the humorous approach to the music genre, the film was so well crafted, that the parody music feature for the films became big hits on their own right. Songs like 'Walk Hard', 'Take my Hand', 'Guilty as charged', ""Let's Duet' & others was nominated for both a Grammy and Golden Globe Award. Songwriter, Michael Andrews and Jon Reilly recorded 40 original songs, which 33 are featured in the movie. All with different music styles. That's pretty impressed. Not only that, but John Reilly sang most of the song. Who knew that John Reilly, not only was a gifted comedian, but also an amazing singer!? I didn't see it, coming. However, Singer Angela Correa did had to provide the voice of Darlene Madison Cox as Jenna couldn't pull it off. Despite that, she did pretty well for the role, that she was given. Honestly, most of the actors in this film, were funny in their own right. As a biopic parody, the movie is very funny. It hit every funny bone for me. Very few misses. If the movie had any faults; I can say, the later unrated version is very disappointing. Adding more juvenile gratuitous nudity and gross sight toilet humor doesn't really make your movie, any better. It's not fan service that most people want to see. Even women and gay people might think it's too much. Also, some of the jokes were a bit tasteless like the whole kid getting killed by a machete fight. Making fun of Johnny Cash's real-life boyhood tragedy is a bit much. It's somewhat offensive. It's shock value that really fails to gain any point of reaction than annoyed. It really doesn't add much to the film that the semi-smart dialogue double sexual entendres hasn't done better. If anything, it just makes the film plot go slower. It's no wonder, Sony felt like to cut over twenty four minutes out of the original film, when it was released. It really did make the film, seem way too long. In my opinion, just go see, the original version over this. Other negative elements of this film is how the movie doesn't really bring anything new to the table. The movie relates way too much on being clichés to be, really that funny. It felt a bit tiresome at parts, because it's predictable. It's so unlike the other comedy music films like 2003's 'A Mighty Wind' or 1984's 'This is Spiral Tap' that relies on some music movie clichés, but also brings something new to the genre to work with. Those films were a little more sophistical with its humor. You really don't know, what's going to happen in those films. Overall: Because of that, I felt like 'Walk Hard' could had been something, really great, but in the end, falls somewhere near above average. Still, I can highly recommended, seeing this film."

","Musicians: this one's for us.<br/><br/>WALK HARD is not for Guitar Hero fakers or karaoke jackasses or talentless DJs with the audacity to call their fade-ups and fade-downs ""mixing."" Let me say it again: WALK HARD is for MUSICIANS; for we who have lived the road, beaten the boards, spanked the groupies, trashed the dressing room, fart-filled the studio, fed the beast our day-job dollar, and slapped the roadies and called them Susan.<br/><br/>The public won't get WALK HARD as deeply as musicians will. And I don't care. Cherish it, Musicians. Hug it and pet it and call it George.<br/><br/>After the two formulaic, Hollywood-drenched biopics, RAY and WALK THE LINE, set the standard and simultaneously lowered the bar for musician biographies, WALK HARD takes every single cliché from those glossy turkeys and parties with a penis in your face.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly is fictional songwriter-guitarist Dewey Cox, who rises to superstardom on the wings of cliché. Cliché so battering and obvious, we will never look at musician biopics with a straight face again, especially those featuring the seminal artists of the 50's who rose from 50's dance halls to superstardom - Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly. They ALL look like spoof biopics now! <br/><br/>Dewey finds he is talented at a young age, soon after slicing his brother in half with a machete, Monty Python style, who telegraphs the tragedy: ""Everything's fine when you have such a long life in front of you!"" <br/><br/>John C. Reilly LIVES Dewey Cox, performing all his comedic songs himself, which are actually enjoyable and catchy country/rock and roll tunes. We follow him from his big break in a colored club ""where people come to dance erotically,"" to touring with Elvis and Jerry Lee, to immediate radio airplay with his hit Walk Hard (""recorded just 35 minutes ago by Dewey Cox""). Dewey meets The Beatles (Jack Black as Paul, Justin Long as George, Paul Rudd as John), experiments with musical styles from Dylan to Bowie; on through the 70s he hosts a TV show and marries Cheryl Tiegs (playing herself, taking the name Cheryl Cox-Tiegs - yeah, say it out loud). <br/><br/>In the 80s, Dewey succumbs to mind-altering drugs while trying to compose a magnum opus with ethnic orchestras, trampolines, farm animals and fruit. He even takes a leaf from his friend Will Ferrell's book and runs naked through the streets during a freakout.<br/><br/>WALK HARD will be compared to the progenitor of this rocku-mockumentary genre, SPINAL TAP, as WALK-HARD's makers also display actual hands-on, penis-on knowledge of their target.<br/><br/>Writer-director Jake Kasdan and co-writer Judd Apatow ladle out every single vignette that musician biopic screenwriters have grown lazy on - from teens at the dance warming to Dewey's high school band and jiggling in ways that make a priest yell, ""devil's music,"" to the record producer admonishing Dewey then suddenly loving his song (a riotous John Michael Higgins cameo, ""...and if somehow you are able to sing a song now with these boys whom you haven't even met but I'm telling you right now, I don't think it's going to happen... I'll give you 15 seconds""), to the whining wife in curlers (Kristen Wiig) cradling three babies, constantly telling Dewey he'll ""never make it"" - even whilst he is on the road supporting a number one album. With a penis in his face.<br/><br/>Musicians know these scenes from their own lives, and how Hollywood has compressed them to nut-squeezing idiocy. Kasdan and Apatow display a virtuoso's knowledge of their subject, down to making the instrument-playing look authentic (a pet peeve of all musicians watching musician movies). The script is as taut as a guitar string and sings like a Les Paul plugged through a Marshall stack on 11.<br/><br/>Johnny Cash and Ray Charles would be spinning in their graves - if they were not laughing so hard.<br/><br/>Slap a roadie for me."

","I've read reviews stating that this movie is funny, or that people who don't find it funny are missing the point. As someone who enjoys all comedy, from parody, to raunchy, to romantic, I completely disagree with people who say this movie has any cinematic merit.<br/><br/>I was hopeful that the movie would be a gut buster, or at least a cult classic. It was neither. It was dry, slow, gratuitous, and unlike other parodies, was sorely lacking in biting wit or cleverness.<br/><br/>20 minutes into the movie, I thought to myself, ""alright, it's got to start getting better, soon...they're running out of time."" It didn't. I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have a couple hours to kill, and don't put a high premium on your time."

","I loved Talladega Nights and was really looking forward to Walk Hard. I was extremely disappointed. This movie is slow, the jokes are stupid and the acting is terrible even for a comedy. I don't know if it was the lack of Will Ferrel or what. Despite having several cameos, and even some fairly funny people in major roles, this flick was a total flop. I don't like beating a dead horse, but I have to write ten lines about this pile of garbage. The only reason I sat through the whole thing was a vain hope that it was just a slow starter and laughs were around the corner. Its not even low-brow slapstick funny, Health Inspector was a better movie than this."
"igooglemyself","1","23","55","26 December 2007"," A Blight on Apatow's near flawless record
","I gave Walk Hard a chance, I really did. I love Judd Apatow's work, as producer, writer or director. Knocked Up is one of my favorite comedies and Superbad is up there on the list. Orange County, directed by the director of Cox, was a decent film but wasn't great. But still, it had it's moments and was watchable. Normally, I can base a movies value on the names associated with it and their previous work , in fact that's the main reason I saw this movie. But sadly, it doesn't live up to anything they have been associated with prior (maybe Kicking and Screaming). <br/><br/>To start, I'll list the things that are good about the movie: The directing has a certain quality to it. Considering the director's previous work, I guess that makes sense.<br/><br/>It's not too far from a shot for shot remake of Walk The Line. Which I count as a good thing because that's what your going for in a spoof/parody.<br/><br/>They did a good job with the bio-pic aspect of it, which just means that they can see the humor in the constant ups and downs of a rock star's life.<br/><br/>Some, and I mean SOME, of the lines are good. I did chuckle and the Elvis part. <br/><br/>Now the bad: The first line of the movie is ""I need Cox"", I a movie were the main character, not just that but the movie, is named Dewey Cox, you can really only use that once. But they do it again and again. <br/><br/>The movie fools you into thinking it's a Jim Abrahams/David Zucker spoof (creators of cult comedies like Airplane!, Hot Shots! Top Secret! and Naked Gun) but becomes a Jason Friedberg/Aaron Seltzer spoof (creator of such Oscar worthy masterpieces as Scary Movie, Scary Movie 2, Scary Movie 3, Scary Movie 4, Date Movie, Epic Movie and the upcoming, and sure to be critical success, Meet The Spartans). <br/><br/>There's a monkey joke, enough said about that. <br/><br/>A poor representation of famous individuals, like Buddy Holly, Elvis, and the Beatles. If Buddy Holly has to tell me that he's Buddy Holly it's a bad movie. Even Jackson Browne, Lyle Lovett and Eddie Vedder are caricature of themselves. Basically the movie goes for the, ""haha they are people pretending to be these people and they are doing it badly!That's funny!"". As I mentioned before, Elvis was the only good one because I could see Elvis doing the ""look out man!"" thing, but even that gets ruined by a line that follows it that is basically ""Only two kinds of people know it(referring to Karate), the Chinese and the King. And I'm the King."" We get it you're Elvis Presley.<br/><br/>A monkey joke, it needs repeating, monkey jokes died in middle school.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie interrupt scenes that could be used for character development and story to give you scenes feigning what could be considered important story points. It completely negates the scene prior. Example, Dewey Cox is in a hotel room living it up after his first taste of weed, he is on the phone with his wife. She begins to tell him that she feels a distance. Now normally, a Knocked Up type comedy would use this moment to bring down the fun for a moment. Use it to give us a real insight into the relationship of the characters, thus creating a more interesting level to any involvement later on. An Airplane type comedy would use this moment to do constant sight gags, or create a fake sense of pain increasing any sort of visual of audible humor later on. But instead it goes a complete different route when there's a knock the door. He hangs up and there is no development of his relationship with his wife or any really funny sight gags or quick quips. Instead we are treated to a story from Dewey's dad about how Dewey's music inadvertently killed his mom. Oh dear, his mom is dead due to his music. How plausible. That's not funny, that's Epic Movie. I shouldn't have expected more from a movie that has a little kid being chopped in half and still talking, with his legs just standing there. The whole thing leaves me confused as to what this movie wants me to find humorous.<br/><br/>I fail to see the humor in this movie, an occasional chuckle and smirk does not make this movie worthy of viewing. It could have been a lot better. Less irony and more funny. Airplane!, Naked Gun, Top Secret!, that's how this movie should have been. An Abrahams/Zucker-type movie making fun of bio-pics done by Apatow and Kasdan, that would be magic. But instead we are treated to a movie that suffers from schizophrenia, it's backed the names behind good comedies like Orange County and Knocked Up, It's titled like a Will Ferrel ""Insert title: the story of insert guy's name"" movie with none of the humor, it has the premise of an Abrahams/Zucker film, but is written like a Friedberg/Seltzer. The whole comes off as messy and leaving you feeling unfulfilled. Save your money and rent Apatow's back catalog and hope and pray that the train of suck that left Dewey Cox will derail and Apatow will be cool again. I think Kasdan might be lost though."
"esupin","7","20","47","5 December 2007"," Walking Hard, or Hardly Walking?
","Every comedy has its moments, and this Walk Hard doesn't have anything spectacular to make it stand out from all the other passable, but ultimately forgettable, comedies. John C. Reilly plays Dewey Cox, who is basically Johnny Cash... this is, after all, a spoof of a biopic.<br/><br/>First of all, the fake Southern accents were a bit much. It was cute at first, but it soon became a little grating and obviously fake. Judd Apatow co-wrote this, but I get the feeling that he's better at doing ""realistic"" comedies. There is absolutely no sense of morality or character development in Walk Hard, unlike in Apatow's previous movies. I'm not saying that every movie needs this, but I left the theater feeling like this could have been a ten-part series on SNL or something. Every switch in scene is just a set-up for another gag, and a lot of moments in Dewey's life are skipped over. Nowhere do characters actually have a conversation with each other for a reason that doesn't involve setting up a joke.<br/><br/>I know that John C. Reilly is the ""main man,"" but Tim Meadows got the most laughs from me, including a continuous drug joke. However, absolutely no one laughed at the Incredible Hulk joke. I'm not saying all the jokes were bad, but the pacing of the whole movie was off. Huge chunks of Dewey's life get ignored; Dewey's life is missing a few scenes in my opinion.<br/><br/>But before I start getting too negative, I want to say that this movie has some very good jokes, and some good songs, although the hip-hop one was a bit too cheesy. I know a lot of work was put into the songs, and except for the aforementioned rap song, they were well put together. I know that Jewel (what a voice!) Ghostface Killah, Lyle Lovett, and Jackson Browne contribute to the title song ""Walk Hard"" (and I think Jewel sings for Jenna in the duet, although I could be wrong), while Reilly sings all of his songs well. Still, is this Spinal Tap? Not quite. The best song had to be the Bob Dylan spoof, followed closely by a clever little duet with Jenna Fischer. Jenna Fischer plays Dewey's main girl (he sleeps with 411 of them according to the tagline, but we don't really see many of them). Jenna does a pretty good job, but she doesn't get a lot of serious acting here anyway. It was strange seeing in a lot of cute dresses and hair styles. Definitely not the same Jenna you're used to in The Office, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you were expecting boatloads of ""Cox"" jokes, the whole middle portion of the movie was seriously lacking in them. I know that Walk Hard doesn't take itself seriously at all, but I got the feeling that if it did, I would have cared more about it. All in all, a slightly above average comedy."
"navymom_mary","1","17","39","29 December 2007"," what a waste of celluloid!
","My apologies to Mr. Reilly, because he sings rather well in the soundtrack, but this ranks well up on my list of all-time stupidest films ever made in the history of cinematography. The R-rating is well-earned due to the juvenile attempts at comedy involving nudity. The attempts failed. The story-line was weak, but not dying until the authors and directors tried to fluff it out with the nudity which was pointless and the stupid jokes about doing drugs. In a day and age when drug abuse amongst American youth is at an all-time high, these attempts at humour were stupid and in extremely bad taste. True, Dewey Cox does fight his drug habit, but the attempts at humour involving the rehab process were also in extremely bad taste. Basically, this entire movie was in extremely bad taste. If you have to resort to 3rd-grader jokes about nudity and inane jokes about drug abuse and attempts at detox and rehab, then the project just needs to be scrapped. There just wasn't enough of a decent story line to make the project worth paying the $6.50 I paid to go see it. Message to other filmmakers - please don't write down to your audience all the time. There are those of us out there who do have brains and like to use them to enjoy intelligent humour."

NONE of them made me laugh. In fact the entire theater of about 80 customers sat in silence throughout this movie. Generally ANY movie will have one or two morons that laugh at every profanity or every drug reference, but this movie never elicited a single audible laugh from ANYONE in the theater. I cannot believe that one reviewer even compared it to ""This is Spinal Tap""--a movie I consider one of the funniest and most innovative of the past thirty years. This was definitely NO ""Spinal Tap""!!! The site gags were not funny, the set ups for most jokes were ridiculous, and the pay-offs simply didn't work.

I will give Paul Rudd's John Lennon a thumbs up, that's where the 1 for 1 out of 10 came from. 5. Who writes, produces, and actually PAYS to see garbage films like this? 6. One reviewer wrote that the jokes were unexpected,not really. Only because the viewer didn't know the words of the horrible songs. Thank heaven for Starz and HBO! I find no redeeming value in this film whatsoever. The jokes were stupid. Miss this movie, it's not worth your time. I'm not going to give the reader examples, it would take to long. Let's just leave it said that the acting was okay, the characters themselves were stupid. The humor, nonsensical. Avoid this film"
"Quinoa1984","10","10","21","24 December 2007"," beat for beat, second for second, the funniest parody I've seen in years
","""...and remember it doesn't say Cox, unless I say it tastes like Cox."" <br/><br/>This is an example of prime send-up, a parody that lovingly references everything in rock-music-bio-pics, from (the obvious centerpiece) Walk the Line, Ray, Don't Look Back, Elvis flicks, The Doors, and countless others, including a mention to Yellow Submarine and the eras of Motown, rockabilly, even punk (yes, more than a decade before there is punk a version of Walk Hard is played). Kasdan and Apatow get what it is to do a send up, which is to be knowing of all the conventions, clichés, and formulas that end up coming out of what are, actually, real-life stories already put into a simple context. It follows the tradition of the ZAZ team (Airplane and Naked Gun) by delivering a joke or gag or just something weird every other second, and it builds up into one of the funniest movies in years.<br/><br/>A friend of mine said recently that it takes someone to actually really like and admire what they're spoofing in order for it to be pulled off. This helps, of course, as one can tell that Mel Brooks had a love for the theater and musicals for The Producers and horror movies with Frankenstein, and more recently Edgar Wright with action flicks and Hot Fuzz. But there's another component, I think, that separates a film like Walk Hard from the recent slew of ""Movies"" (Date, Epic, the upcoming Meet the Spartans) is that the people working on Walk Hard are some of the funniest people working in Hollywood today, and knowing what makes fresh, vulgar send-up work. It's not simply about mashing up pop-culture references to make them stick, there has to be just something that clicks through the writing and acting.<br/><br/>Walk Hard has that in spades- from the opening jokes (yes jokes, and they're running ones) about Dewey slicing his brother in half with a machete (with the brother still giving words of advice cut in half, and leading up to the also running gag ""The wrong kid died!"" line), going into playing the blues as a little white kid, to being 14 (and played by Reilly, of course) marrying a 12 year old fan, to the sudden bolts of inspiration for songs in the middle of a scene- not to mention the lyrics- it's already apparent this will be good stuff. But then there's more: Hasidim music agents with names like Kvetch L'Chaim; drug scenes out of Ray ""You don't want to do this!""; the ups and downs and the meetings with other famous stars (""Hey, George Harrison""). I could go on and on about the little details as well, some of which are probably too much to even mention in this review.<br/><br/>Suffice to say Reilly pops out of a shell that he's been in over the past decade or so. One of the superb character actors of his generation (yes, I'm sounding like a pompously sounding critic for now), he's fantastic as Dewey Cox, giving him a sensibility that goes past simple parody- we actually end up feeling for this drug-addicted adulterer who goes in and out of rehab and finally settles in with his few dozen children of various mixed ethnicities (the catching montage, by the way, is priceless). He gives the character that 'umph' that even makes him more human than Leslie Nielson's Frank Drebin, and he creates so many absurd moments that it's easy to miss some of his subtle charms and dramatic touches. Just seeing him talk to a ghost Jonah Hill as ""older ghost"" brother Nate reveals his multi-faceted gifts.<br/><br/>And like A Mighty Wind, Kasdan and Apatow and composer Michael Andrews make the songs legitimately good numbers amid some of the crudest innuendo in movie history (songs go between 'innocent' sexual acts to midgets and then to a huge orchestral number including countless tribes-people). Reilly also has the backup, acting-wise, of people from SNL (Meadows and Parnell), The Office (Fischer and Ed Helms) and of course past Apatow works (Rudd, Black, Long and Schwartzman give a movie-stealing scene as the Beatles in India). In the end, it's everything I love in a go-for-broke comedy that still sticks to the numerous predecessors it's imitating. And, if anything, it one-ups those movies as well as legitimate entertainment.<br/><br/>So Walk Hard... Hard... to the movie theater!"

"jaredmobarak","2","9","19","31 December 2007"," The wrong kid diedWalk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story
","That quote above could not have been more correct, however, not in the way Pa Cox intended. I was thinking more along the lines of wishing young Dewey had cut me in half, because had I been unable to watch the rest of the hour and a half to come, it would have been a much better experience. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story is easily the worst movie I have seen all year long. There have been some bad films, but this was the first that made me look at my watch numerous times, praying that the horror would be over soon. No disrespect to John C. ReillyI think he is pretty good as the titular characterthe main faults, instead, lie in the writing, and for that I can only blame Judd Apatow. You may say, but Jake Kasden co-wrote it too, and that is all well and good. The reason I blame Apatow is because his last three ventures (40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked-Up, and Superbad) have been good if not great. He should have known better with this and made it differently. I think I even liked this less than Anchorman, and anyone who knows me will understand how bad that is.<br/><br/>This thing is poorly written throughout. From the need to use full names when addressing any character so the joke can be understood, to the blatantly obvious descriptions coming out leaving nothing to the imagination or intelligence a person with a sense of humor has, Walk Hard talks down to the audience at every turn and bores the hell out of them. Some gimmicks are funny the first time, but than by the fourth it is way too old, (sorry Tim Meadows), and how many different ways must we see Dewey and Darlene partake in masturbatory motions while courting each other? Even the playing with time and the fact that he is 15 with a hit single, wife, and five children stifles any laughter later on because the writers seem to just want to beat a dead horse over and over and over again. It is really a shame, because this thing had potential.<br/><br/>Reilly is fantastic as the hapless singer/songwriter pushed into the life of a rockstar by shear dumb luck. All the other cast members are funny as well; it just takes so much out of you watching the same situation relive itself that when the good parts come you just feel too tired to laugh. I actually contemplated walking out of the theatre, but could not bring myself to do so because I really wanted to see the Beatles scene. When it finally came, I could only manage a chuckle and by that time I figured I might as well see if the ending could bring anything to the table. Sadly it did not. Besides a montage of what appear to be gag-reel footage playing during Cox's final song, there is nothing but gratitude that the train wreck is over.<br/><br/>There is a lot of talent involved and I kind of feel sorry for them. Maybe they all had a lot more to do and I should be blaming Kasden for poor directing, using bits that aren't funny and throwing the rest out for deleted scenes on the DVD. What happened to Jack White's ""cut a man in two"" line from the trailerthat was funny. Instead his Elvis is pretty stupid and only brings out a reaction from me when he pulls out a pocketknife in the aforementioned end scene gags. The goofy music wears out its welcome fast too unfortunately, because each scene is orchestrated well, the jokes just fall flat. Even when it seemed there'd be a winner with ""Duet"" song's use of innuendo before each verse is completed, the sequence goes on too long. I yawned more than laughed throughout the duration.<br/><br/>Big applause to Jenna Fischer for being absolutely stunning and for holding her own opposite Reilly, in his element at all times. Raymond J. Barry is good as the father without love in his heart and it was fun to see SNL's Chris Parnell and UCB's Matt Besser adding a little flavor. The highlight, though, and only genuinely funny part for melike the gang war in Anchormanwas The Beatles. Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Jason Schwartzman, and yes, even Jimmy Fallon, are fantastic. I guess that scene alone, before it became a cartoon, was worth the dollar I paid to watch it."
"ahaederle","3","9","19","27 December 2007"," One long, repetitive, painful joke
","Good Lord, this was bad. I expected a lot more out of Judd Apatow, who has quickly become one of my favorite directors with the 40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad. But this was just awful...it's basically another Will Ferrell movie gone bad.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly is pretty redundant as the lead role in this; pretty much anyone could have been inserted into the role of Dewey Cox and done the same job. He wasn't bad, but he wasn't particularly funny, either, and for a lead role in a high-expectations comedy like this one, that just doesn't cut it. Doesn't help that the supporting actors were all just terrible, to say the least. The whole Beatles scene is just retarded - I think my IQ dropped a minimum of 10 points after watching a bloated Jack Black repeatedly tell us ""I'm Paul McCahtnay"" - it's an SNL skit gone bad. Even Tim Meadows, one of my favorite comedians, derives ALL of his comedy from the same joke in the film, which is funny the first time you see it, but not the sixth time. Which leads me to my next point...<br/><br/>Repetitive is really an understatement in describing this film's humor. Jokes that aren't even that funny to begin with, such as a jackass father repeating ""the wrong kid died!"" or Dewey tearing sinks out of the wall in his fits of rage, managed to recur throughout the film and made me sigh in disappointment.<br/><br/>If you've seen Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, or any VH1 Rock Documentary, then you've seen this movie. I'm aware that the movie is supposed to be a complete spoof of these typical ""rise to fame, fall from grace, then regain your glory"" films, but its delivery was just awful. Whereas a film such as ""This Is Spinal Tap"" managed to cleverly spoof the genre, ""Walk Hard"" is not clever in any way, which is critical to a film like this. Do yourself a favor and skip this one"
"juleswinfield-2","2","10","22","28 December 2007"," I Wanted To Walk (Out) Hard
","Wow! What a horrible movie. I just finished watching Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story and I feel robbed. After the money I spent on food, beverages, and all of the tickets I could have paid for John C. Reilly to come to my house and place a fresh turd on my chest rather than watch the one that I just did. I mean, I expected more from Judd Apatow (Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad) than this. There were maybe two funny things about the whole movie and thats it. The rapper in the end was named Lil' Nutsack and that made me laugh. Also the gratuitous showing of the male sex organ brought a chuckle. Not because the penis is funny itself, but because of the situations you see it (""Dewey, have you seen my sandal?""). Many of the racially insensitive jokes are not even funny enough to warrant a rise out of the groups that might be offended. Other than those ridiculous moments mentioned earlier, the rest was so bad that a person stranded on a dessert island without humor for ten years would not find much humor. Besides the overall poor story, I was surprised to see the cameos from music legends Eddie Vedder, Jackson Browne, and the Temptations."
"DarthVoorhees","8","7","14","22 December 2007"," ""I can't build you a candy house, it will fall down. The sun will melt the candy""
","I have a special place in my heart for the spoof film. The original Airplane is a legendary comedy. Sadly the genre has been dying, for every Naked Gun there is an Epic Movie. Walk Hard breathes a little bit of life into the classic spoof genre. It isn't a laugh a minute picture but you will laugh during it.<br/><br/>I was not a huge fan of Walk the Line. I felt that Mangold and crew didn't try to show us anything about Cash rather than his pills and his women. You can all most take any musician and give them the same basic plot line, Walk Hard parodies a genre which deserves a spoofing. It is brilliant in the fact that it realizes that our classic musicians have more to them than their bio pics would suggest.<br/><br/>John C.Reilly stars as Dewey Cox, a country boy who goes into music after killing his brother in a machete fight.His judging Dad hates him and he decides to move out with his twelve year old girlfriend. Cox gets his big break when headlines at a night club when the main attraction breaks his guitar fingers and has a sore throat. After producing his record breaking single Walk Hard, he spirals into the cliché life of drugs, women and vice. <br/><br/>The music here actually isn't bad. I was expecting silly songs but it actually has a half way decent soundtrack to it. If Reilly really did the singing he mimicked the Cash style fairly well. Reilly has more restrain than Ferrel or Jack Black does. He isn't off the wall with his character and that makes the punchlines faster and more funny. There is a great scene where Cox doesn't realize he is having sex with a woman, Ferrel would have drawn attention to himself but Reilly sets up the joke. I have to give Reilly credit it's hard to do to excel in both drama and comedy but he does it.<br/><br/>Tim Meadows of SNL comes back in a major way as Dewey's drummer. He is the but of the stoner jokes but he does them with energy and style which makes tired drug jokes fresh and funny. The scene where he is popping Viagra at the end had me in tears.<br/><br/>Walk Hard is over the top and it doesn't take it's self seriously. I feel that it wasn't marketed correctly. The trailers don't lead you to believe that it is a classic spoof."
"charchuk","6","5","9","8 January 2008"," Starts off brilliant, but dries up
","Yeah, I really loved its absurdist humour a lot of the time, but it really dries up by the end and I really didn't find myself laughing as much as I did at the beginning of the film. About the time the film starts jumping ahead in time really dramatically, it starts losing its funny, and the end jokes nearly all fall flat. The musical numbers are terrific, though, simultaneously being hilarious while also being honest-to-goodness great songs in their own right. The Let's Duet montage is brill. And, of course, there's the wonderfully random stuff, like John C. Reilly playing himself at age 14, or the mockingly melodramatic acting of Tim Meadows and Jenna Fischer, or the shocking full-frontal male nudity, which is so obviously an attempt to receive surprise laughter that it's a pretty fantastic joke. If only the film had sustained its momentum, it could have been one of the best comedies of the year."
"PWNYCNY","10","5","9","2 January 2008"," Great spoof. However, if you are a bathroom sink, you will not like this movie.
","What a surprisingly funny and entertaining movie. This movie is one of the best spoofs on media stars to come out in a long time. Not only was John C. Reilly wonderful in his role as Dewey Cox, the entire cast was great. Special commendation must be afforded to Raymond J. Barry who plays Dewey's rambunctious father. Mr. Barry was truly hilarious. Now there a lot of nudity in this movie, but it's part of the story and without it the story of Dewey Cox could not be effectively told. If you like a clever script, strong comedic acting, and a movie that is a great parody of the entertainment industry and undoubtedly draws its material from the actual depraved behavior of some of the most well-known and internationally famous entertainment stars, then this movie is for you. Remember, though, the humor is adult and it's not for kids.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with Dewey the character. At times he can be downright nasty; most of the time he is thoughtless and self-centered. Nevertheless, the creators of this movie have succeeded in developing a character who, despite his myriad of shortcomings, is likable, and, unlike the mentally challenged and emotionally stilted Forrest Gump, is a creditable metaphor for the human condition - and for a Hollywood movie, that's impressive.<br/><br/>This movie also devotes a lot of time to some rather unconventional utilization of bathroom plumbing."

But I picked it up on clearance last night for just a buck (!), and I can only say; even a dollar, was waaaaaaay too much to pay for this turd.<br/><br/>The entire ""Watch how funny we make this next extremely unfunny scene!"" thing is way dead. Every single gag feels like it was written down once and never improved; in the hope that the now-thoroughly irritating combo of the Apatow Barn of blunderers, and SNL 2nd raters would really push it over the top. <br/><br/>They don't. This is lifeless. It's a movie where comedy goes to die.

"hellokristen","7","9","20","12 December 2007"," A Chuckler
","It's a hit-and-miss comedy. There's a few laugh-out-loud moments, but mostly you'll only be chuckling or going ""Was that meant to be funny?""<br/><br/>John C. Reilly is not naturally funny and is NOT good to look at in close-up. In one scene a man's naked tackle appears next to his head. I didn't know where to look! EW! (Naked guy was no Dirk Diggler.) <br/><br/>I think Judd Apatow is going ""I got away with a closeup of a vagina giving birth in 'Knocked Up'. Time for a closeup of male genitalia!"" (And there were lots of drawings of penises in ""Superbad"".) <br/><br/>Did you notice that ""Walk the Line"" and ""Ray"" were practically the same movie? I'm guessing Judd Apatow and Jake Kasden did and set out to write a movie spoofing the formulaic musical biopic. This starts out looking like ""Walk Hard"" but then veers into a trip through popular music history -- which is sometimes fun. I enjoyed the Bob Dylan and Glen Campbell phases of Dewey's career.<br/><br/>The most delightful scene to me was when they were in India in 1967 with the Maharishi and the Beatles (finishing with a ""Yellow Submarine""-like cartoon). <br/><br/>The guys playing the Beatles were hilarious (and dirty -- that's why you only see the briefest snippet in the TV commercials.) Jack Black is Paul and Paul Rudd is John and their bickering is hysterical. Justin Long (""Mac"" on the PC vs. Mac commercials) was George and Jason Schwartzman (""Rushmore"") is Ringo. This scene was far too brief. If only the whole movie had been this funny. I think they need to get these guys back together and make a whole movie about the Beatles! <br/><br/>There are lots of delightful cameos from your favorite comedy actors. The songs seem to be clever, well-written parodies -- I'll have to hear them another way and read the lyrics to fully ""get"" them.<br/><br/>But it's not as sharp as ""A Mighty Wind"" or ""Spinal Tap"".<br/><br/>Reilly is a good character actor and a fine singer -- but he is not the guy to carry a comedy. He doesn't have the ""funny bones"" of Will Ferrell, Jack Black or Jim Carrey. You start laughing the second those guys appear on screen.<br/><br/>It reminded me of ""Blades of Glory"" or ""Talladega Nights"" -- some wonderful moments, but a lot of dull or mis-fired ones. Gags that are repeated till they become annoying."

"rlaine","4","4","7","18 January 2010"," An American comedy
","Being a huge fan of the comedies from 80's I can't help but compare the current gang of Apatow, Phillips, Rogen, Ferrell, Reilly, Black etc to Reitman, Ramis, Landis, Murray, Chase, Candy, Aykroyd, Belushi, Martin etc. Funny enough, always appearing Harold Ramis seems to be the only connection between these two generations. <br/><br/>I didn't know this was an Apatow production before the end credits hit the screen and I have to say I'm quite happy I didn't, because I could now see it without much prejudice, as I haven't really connected with any of the Apatow-era/gang comedies. I did find it somewhat funny. I also found it very American, very formulaic and very this millennium. Everything that the mainstream comedies from recent years are.<br/><br/>The movie made me laugh mostly just because of the explicity of the jokes. Yes, it was funny when a mans private parts appeared on screen (should I put a spoiler tag?), but only because it's a major Hollywood production, not done this explicitly before? And you can easily see it's there ""just because"". Nor can I remember when they so openly and straight forwardly praised dope, even tho it's done in almost every comedy that is produced lately. These two always re-appearing and boundary stretching subjects are what I can't connect to, and at times it seems this is what the movies are all about.<br/><br/>Being a European I don't find nude men funny, per se. Being kind of traditional, I don't find drugs very funny either. Then there's John C. Reilly - who I actually find an enjoyable actor, is doing the lead and trying to run a comedy. He just hasn't got the comedic charisma of Ferrell, Black or let's say Murray or Chase. He's sort of the Dan Aykroyd of the first decade, a good actor, but more of a wing man rather than a leading man.<br/><br/>I was left with mixed emotions. The movie made me laugh quite a few times and it did have fairly good production values, but when the running joke is your path from mild drugs to stronger drugs, I can't say I liked it, even if it made me laugh."
"katchmaster","4","4","7","21 April 2008"," pretty lame....
","I wanted to like it more than I did; I was let down. There are several funny jokes throughout (notably Tim Meadows character, and the Beatles skit), but most of the jokes were totally juvenile and lack any originality. Penises don't = funny; a five minute sexual innuendo song doesn't = funny. And the whole ""cutting people in half with a machetti"" isn't funny at all. I mean, who thinks this stuff is funny still? Its stupid!...and not in a good way.<br/><br/>I'm not a snob. I like most of Apatow's previous movies enough. I thought Taladega nights was funny. I love good comedies, but this isn't one of them.<br/><br/>Reilly does a fine job as the lead, he was just givin a crappy movie in which to showcase his abilities. Jenna Fisher is cute, but her character couldn't have been more boring.<br/><br/>I like stupid comedies usually, but this was just a mish-mash of joke after joke and the same vulgar routine we've seen in a lot of movies lately. NOTHING unique or original at all. It does feel like a long SNL sketch, as i've heard mentioned. Sure, you'll laugh a few times, but that doesn't make it a good movie.<br/><br/>It not horrible or anything, but its typical run-of-the-mill comedic trainwreck that you don't give two squirts of pee about an hour after watching it. Its disposable, cookie-cutter humor. There are just too many of those types of movies for them to stand out amongst the crowd. If this movie had been made 15 years ago, it would have been much better.<br/><br/>P.S. I think people give Judd Apatow WAY too much credit. His movies are funny enough, but give it a rest people. He doesn't do much more than sex jokes, drug jokes, and clueless people jokes, and then he sprinkles in some sweet, cuteness at the end to tie it all together....hardly groundbreaking stuff."

","As a fan of Will Ferrell-style comedy (and I've loved Reilly in other movies), as well as a fan of the Johnny Cash and Ray Charles biopics, I thought mixing the two couldn't go wrong. I was horribly disappointed. Almost every joke was completely predictable  you could see the punchline coming from a mile away, and when it arrived, it wasn't very funny. About the only thing good in this movie was Tim Meadows, who had me howling every time he was on screen (he's the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one). If my daughter hadn't been in the next theater watching a movie with her aunt, I would have walked out and gone home."
"SamwiseRulesAll","9","7","15","23 December 2007"," The best fake biopic in the business
","There are any number of reasons to hate this movie. For one, it can be repetitive. For another, it can be tasteless. Actually, those are the only two reasons I can think of to dislike this movie, which you should be expecting given previous Judd Apatow works when you go in.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this movie truly great is that it is, whether or not you notice, the first American Hot Fuzz. Here is a genre parody so great that I think it would fly over the heads of people who haven't seen enough biopics or don't know enough rock 'n' roll history. There is that good old tasteless humor characteristic of Apatow films that could keep even the casual moviegoer laughing, but really what we have is a very studied recreation of the biopic that shakes a stick at trends we've seen but may not have noticed were trends.<br/><br/>Dewey Cox goes through the phases of, essentially, every major music star between the '50s and the '70s. On the surface you'll find Buddy Holly, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan and the Beatles, but those are definitely not the only ones whose surprisingly formulaic lives and their consequent biopics are parodied (even, impressively, the recent Dylan biopic I'm Not There seems to be parodied stylistically, though it seems odd to suggest that Walk Hard consciously called the off-beat touch of I'm Not There months ahead of its release). What this really is, is a work of genius, a biopic that is really only necessarily funny because you know Dewey Cox did not really exist.<br/><br/>Perhaps the tasteless and obvious jokes are not enough to give this movie the longevity it might deserve, but the perfection it attains in satirizing the biopic should. The audience I was with got so hooked on Dewey Cox that I saw more than one tear fall in the duration of the movie. By the end, even I really cared about the fake recording star, although I did not really expect to. I think the cleverest thing of all about the film is that their invented Dewey Cox is not really half bad. It would have been easy to make that the big joke, that millions of people were falling for the music of Dewey Cox, too stupid to realize he sucked, but it's impressive because Dewey Cox, and his songs, for the most part, do not suck. Some of the numbers he performs are legitimately good songs. John C. Reilly does not always play the role comedically. I think that's what ultimately makes it memorable and good.<br/><br/>So maybe if you see it, you won't like it, because it's often rude or you haven't seen or cared for enough biopics to play ""Spot the Genre Parody."" Fair enough. But if you want to see a movie so carefully put-together that it gives you chills, this is a good one to check out."

I hated this movie with ever bit of my being and I really think the only way I would watch it again was if i got paid to. Superbad and other movies directed by Judd were good, as a matter of fact they actually had a story line an real significance. But this movie really wasn't worth the film it was on.

Also, no one wants to see a penis on a big screen, unless you are one of those 8% of kids who draw them. I'm a little disappointed in Apatow, but then again I don't think anyone can go their whole career without at least one failure. I think it would have been better if it didn't have to follow 2 masterpieces that raised everyones expectations."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","5","10","24 April 2008"," A solid parody, but over-produced and over-the-top
","Apatow Productions had a terrific 2007 and then ""Walk Hard"" happened. At least they know it--$35 M budget and a total gross of less than $20 M. While the musical biopic parody is an idea that certainly among other parody options is fitting for this decade, Apatow productions learned that success will come with originality. That and not to a release a film like this at Christmas time.<br/><br/>""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" stars John C. Reilly in an hour and a half romp through his life as a musician beginning in the 1950s. Spoofing all other music biopics, Cox finds his way into love affairs, drugs and much much more. A lot of the parody jokes get overplayed and redundant, but some are definitely spot on. It definitely feels like an Apatow script, only this time with director/writer and friend of Apatow's Jake Kasden getting his say.<br/><br/>""Walk Hard"" is star-studded. There are an unbelievable amount of cameos from Apatow's trademark crew as well as stars from Saturday Night Live and others not usually in his movies that make an appearance in the film. The amount of familiar faces makes the film seem incredibly over-produced and some of the shortest scenes appear to have an unnecessary amount of money put into them.<br/><br/>The film does have more humor in many respects than ""Talladega Nights,"" but by no means comes close to matching up with ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad."" While those two films are somewhat more poignant and true-to-life, ""Walk Hard"" relies excessively on ridiculousness to be funny, more so than any of the Apatow predecessors.<br/><br/>In short, ""Walk Hard"" is funny and at times clever, but mostly just over-the-top and dumb. Every turn is a left turn and while many are applaudable, some are just downright weird."

","As a fan of the parody movie genre, who has seen it dwindle down from the greats like Naked Gun and Spaceballs to total horse crap like Epic Movie, it's great to see movies like Walk Hard. But that's just it - you HAVE to realize that Walk Hard is a parody. You could even go so far as to say it's our generation's ""This Is Spinal Tap"" in that a lot of people who originally saw it didn't get the joke at first.<br/><br/>It's not just of the Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk The Line"", which it does parody heavily, but every biopic ever made. And not only does it follow the formula to a T, even right down to the part where the musician enters rehab and sobers up, but portraying the fictional Dewey Cox instead of a real-life musician is not an easy task. Especially when the Apatow gang really does convince you that Dewey Cox exists.<br/><br/>The Cox saga starts off when Dewey accidentally decapitates his brother with a machete. He then overcomes his tragedy by discovering the blues. Then we cut to ten years later when we see a fully-grown Cox as a 14 year old playing in a high school band. From there, Dewey gets married, goes out on tour, leaves his wife for his backup singer Darlene, then goes to India to hang out with a really convincing version of the Beatles and gets involved with every pill and drug known to man, thanks to his drummer (Tim Meadows). But Meadows practically steals the show in that his character introduces Dewey to all the drugs.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great parody, and the Apatow gang pulled it off nearly flawlessly. John C. Reilly is an insanely funny actor, and the movie contains a killer soundtrack, which is more than worth seeking out, with all the tunes being performed by Reilly himself. It's too bad that other Apatow movies, like ""Superbad"" and the forthcoming ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" stole the thunder from Dewey Cox, but it's worth checking out now that it is on DVD."

The best is the use of his last name Cox. when he is old he says to his partner ""you don't want any more of this old dirty cox"" or something like that. Also, Jonah Hill makes a cameo uncredited and does his same ""don't be a little bitch"" rant from Superbad. I really enjoyed Jenna Fischer in her role.

It will alienate viewers unnecessarily.<br/><br/>There are several brilliant cameos, including a Beatles sequence that deserves to be watched more than once. The movie's satire of the concept that Jews control show business is hysterical.<br/><br/>After a while, even a series of funny jokes can become wearing; ""Walk Hard"" has no ""realistic"" narrative.

","This is a review of the commercial advertisements for this pathetic looking piece of garbage, since I have not seen Walk Hard: The Dewy Cox Story. Never will I see it as a matter of fact. Since the ads for this crap were torture to sit through, I doubt highly I would ever consider wasting my time or money and see the actual film. <br/><br/>While John C. Reily may be an adequate dramatic supporting actor, he is not a lead actor and he certainly has no flair for comedy. For whatever reason, Apatow seems bent on reinventing this guy as the new Will Ferrel. Hopefully Walk Hard's disastrous and pathetic showing at the box office will put a stop to this crusade. The 40 Year Old Virgin was far from a great movie, but the funny and talented Steve Carrell made it work. John C. Reilly, to put it bluntly, SUCKS as a comedic actor and has no timing whatsoever.<br/><br/>To sell a feeble attempt for a movie such as Walk Hard to a fickle public, you need a guy like Carrell or Jim Carrey to anchor it. Everything about this production seems like it was destined to fail from the get-go.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, an article brought to my attention around the time the movie was released where Apatow boatsed about the loads of naked male genitalia was was displayed prominently in the film (no pun intended). Thanks for the warning, Judd, but I already was planning on avoiding this movie like the plague.<br/><br/>Anyone who would even waste their time giving something like Walk Hard a chance, you seriously have to wonder about.

It felt like a very long Saturdy night live skit and not the classic funny skits either, the more recent lame skits. Lots of songs throughout the movie (with an actor who can't sing).

Reilly is pretty damn good as musical wunderkind, Cox, but sadly he can't compensate for the lackluster script. This isn't Apatow's worst written film (see Celtic Pride or Fun with Dick & Jane for examples of those), but it's still a step down from his more accomplished funnier ones (Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin) Walk Hard limps especially in the extended cut.

","Americans are getting very good at this satire genre. This film is a spot-on parody of every cliché-infested fake country music bio you have ever seen (despite the great performances) from ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" to ""I Walk the Line"" - which I remember hating for all the things it was not, mainly truthful and meaningful. Every single medical emergency and unwanted pregnancy is there, every ghost from the past, every shameful substance abuse and rehab episode and encounter with the greats of musicdom. The songs cover an extremely wide range from pre-rock to hip-hop, by way of folk, psychedelia and disco. The hero even goes through a ""Brian Wilson"" period, which is musically the most complex and challenging part of the film. So much attention has been paid to the writing, the performance and the arrangements of the songs, in fact, in this film, that (1) it should have won Oscars for everyone involved, (2) this is the best original musical in a long time besides being a very good comedy and (3) the DVD has something like three hours of extras, deleted scenes unused songs and jokes, on top of the longer 2 hour version, all memorable and funny. And John C. Reilly has the voice of Roy Orbison with a lot more versatility. The man is a chameleon and a very underrated actor. All of which makes this film a much more sincere homage to American music than any single biopic it makes fun of."
"tedg","Null","11","29","26 December 2007"," The Third Layer
","I know of only three periods in Americam history when it can be said that the people as a whole, as Americans, were truly noble. Where being was more about ideas, ideals and intents than tribal exclusionism. <br/><br/>One of these was the late sixties. If you were there in the midst of it, you would have experienced something that simply cannot be described today  a sort of group mind that was so shared and shared with better futures that is was often mistaken for spiritual. <br/><br/>Much of that reflected and was fed by the music of the time. Folk. Rock, and that quantum edge between that often seemed perfect. So you, dear reader, may have to simply accept on trust that the music of the times, and times themselves, mattered. That's even though the artifacts have been since re-incarnated as ordinary things.<br/><br/>Much of that ordinariness has been because of how we have reinvented the story to allow ourselves to handle the disappointment of the futures we ended up with. And a large part of that reinvention has been through movies that retell and reshape.<br/><br/>Much of that can be laid at the feet of the slick marketeers behind what has become known as ""country"" music, where the story is in the surrounding wrapper of a metastory: honesty, forthrightness, god and country, guns. (This package comes with the standard negatives: anti-gay, woman, minority, etc.)<br/><br/>The unwitting patron saint of this particular reinvention was Johnny Cash, a poor soul swept up in his and our addictions until even after death. That's when we got a particularly revolting biography. We seemed to want it. It has true love, a successful struggle with demons, performances of music to fill in for the thin story. Grimaces and joy.<br/><br/>It also trivialized what the music of the era was. It turned a whole social movement into a mere plot device, no different than say a Denzel Washington-coached football championship. The music didn't matter at all. It was the fame that turned lives. <br/><br/>(Something similar happened with ""A Beautiful Mind"" where the mathematics was incidental instead of what made the man mad, and along the way changes imagination in and of us all. But few people believe in math, and nearly everyone considers power in music as heavy.)<br/><br/>Oddly, our reaction to this trivialization is not to look deeper at the real thing, but to add a third layer of abstraction that further trivializes. I must admit to laughing here and there, especially at the Dylan spoof. But I left the theater wondering if this is all we end up with from this era. Is it merely a joke now? Is this yearning and work already the same level as the fodder for ""Austin Powers?""<br/><br/>Kids used to play with toy cars. They weren't real cars, but the play was generally along the lines of what real cars do, sometimes flying, but not as planes  only cars on air-roads. Then at some point, the cars could transform into robots and the robots themselves conveyed a simple cosmology of good and evil. Play became disembodied, and the connection with reality was lost.<br/><br/>This is a transformer movie: three layers removed, transforming what celebrated complexity, subtlety and ambiguity into something manufactured by promoters as a battle of good and evil, and then transformed into a joke.<br/><br/>Tom Paine dies again. I'm sure Apatow thinks it is just simple fun, like goofing on Nascar.<br/><br/>It seems important that it is not.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

Up until this movie, all of them may have been pretty dead on. With this movie, all bets are off.<br/><br/>Perhaps if the movie had been cut down to about 15 minutes and put up on YouTube it might have garnered some hits and some pass-it-around-the-office laughs. At full length and in the theater, it is a train wreck. Joke after joke after joke falls flat. Actor after actor mugs and hams and tries to blow some air into this deflating blimp of a film, but it was never properly stitched together to begin with and their efforts come off as sad at best and indulgent at worst.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for the movie to get funny. On paper, it probably read funny. But as I sat in the theater, beginning to dread each new scene, I realized it was a failure on the part of the director, writers, editors and execs to see that it wasn't working. Let's put it this way: even the lame Scary Movie spoofs are better than this. This movie just flat out sucked."

This movie is great if you love the style and get the humor. If you haven't seen ""Walk The Line"", ""Ray"", or get old classic music like The Beatles or Bob Dylan, you will be clueless at some parts.<br/><br/>Reily plays Dewey Cox, who is guilty of cutting his successful brother in half. Being blamed and rejected by his father, he journeys to become great. He learns the guitar and starts The Dewey Cox Four with his friends, and hits it big at 15. At the height of his fame, he meets famous musicians like Buddy Holly, The Beatles, and Elvis. Along the way he loses his wife and falls for his backup singer, gets addicted to drugs and must come-back before he sells out, also meaning caring for his 22 kids he never paid attention to.<br/><br/>The first half is hilarious, then through his drug days it gets more serious.

"rooprect","7","2","3","9 November 2014"," Somewhere between ""A Mighty Wind"" and ""Airplane!""
","""Walk Hard"" is another film from the Judd Apatow gang who brought you such inane gems as ""Anchorman"", ""Talladega Nights"", ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and so on. In the same vein, you'll get a wacky blend of absurd humor, parody, satire and sexual gags not suitable for young kids. Note: I saw the unrated version which has a few gags featuring, among other things, one or two closeup shots of a man's hangy down thing (haha IMDb won't let me type w.a.n.k.e.r).<br/><br/>The tone of the whole film is very tongue-in-cheek and satirical, with a good zinger at least once every 30 seconds. Perhaps even more fun is spotting all the cameo appearances by famous personalities such as director Harold Ramis (playing ""L'Chaim"" the Jewish industrialist), Paul Rudd (""John Lennon""), Jack Black (""Paul McCartney""), Jack White from the White Stripes (""Elvis"") and Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam (playing himself). Other actors from SNL, The Office and Big Bang Theory add to the star-spotting extravaganza.<br/><br/>The story is mostly a shameless mock-up of Johnny Cash's biopic ""Walk the Line"" but with scenes parodied from other musical biopics like ""Ray"" and ""La Bamba"". A goofily predictable rise to fame of a music star story, this film mercilessly skewers the clichés, with over-the-top melodramatic scenes like the bigwig producer telling Dewey he sucks and will never make it, only to start singing his praises after Dewey strums 2 chords. Other gags are even more silly, like some of the corny visual wordplays in ""Airplane!"" (for example there's a dramatic scene where he shouts ""I can't fight the temptations!"" and runs into the hallway where we see ...guess who?... singing their motown hit ""My Girl""). From the outset all the way to its conclusion this movie is pure silliness.<br/><br/>If you like 'em that way then have no fear, you won't be let down. However if you're expecting something more along the lines of the more subtle yet equally hilarious Christopher Guest comedies (""Spinal Tap"", ""A Mighty Wind"", ""Best in Show""), then you might start to tire of the fast paced, deliberately predictable gags we see here. ""Walk Hard"" is an enjoyable experience but probably not intended to be a cult classic music comedy like the aforementioned Guest films which spawned an entire genre of sophisticated comedy (if you can consider a film called ""A Mighty Wind"" to be sophisticated). ""Walk Hard"" is just pure mindless entertainment, and it delivers. Watch it on days when you just want to shut your brain off and have some fun. I knocked off a few points because the nudity & prolonged sex scenes can get a little distracting from this otherwise silly romp (a 10-second closeup of a man's crankshaft might cross the line of discomfort)."

","I truly loved this movie, it is entertaining, funny, idea is fresh and creative, and the music, believe it or not, was pretty good (most of them).<br/><br/>I also loved the fact that it gave the rock industry (in particular the Rolling Stones Magazine) a good dig. Such as: 1. The whole story is based on a guy with relatively modest music talent who made it to the big time. This is kinda true as many musicians at the early 60-70s made it big and became nowadays legends, not for some extraordinary musical talents, but because they had (1) the guts to pick up a guitar on stage and perform (2) the passion to perform and write music (3) a bit of luck (to be discovered by record companies), and most importantly (4) because there were no other competitors at the time, people listen to what they have. Good examples are the likes of Freddie and the Dreamers, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Ramones, The Who, Guns and Roses etc. Even the likes of Elvis, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles can be put into this category. Elvis was a great performer, but not really a great composer, and The Beatles are great song-writers, but looked at how the Rolling Stones Magazine rate them - George Harrison no. 23 of Greatest Guitarist of All Time?! John Lennon, Paul MaCartney & Mick Jagger top 20 singers of all time? On the other hand, a lot of musicians faded into the abyss despite having huge talent simply because they are reluctant to constantly step into the lime light, just ask Nick Drake.<br/><br/>2. Their dig at Bob Dylan was great... Many artist can write nonsense (best examples are Bob Dylan & John Lennon) in their songs, and people think they're genius because ""you guys are idiots... this song is very deep"". Yet when an Average Joe does the same thing, he's considered an idiot.<br/><br/>3. The Beatles are the greatest band in the world, and I truly love them. But they can also act like a bunch of spoilt kids, simply because they're just human, but people often goes to their shrine and bow to them like they're Gods.<br/><br/>4. Punk music are often written by some mad and angry yet rich and wealthy drug-addicts who really had nothing to complain in their lives, but choose this form of music to whine about how they cannot get laid at nights.<br/><br/>5. At the end of the movie, one final dig was on the modern industry, where young money-driven artists take some 70-80's oldies and make it into some pathetic semi rap song. And boy are they awful. Just listen to what Jay Z did to Forever Young, Eminem to Dream On, Gym Class Hero did to Breakfast in America...<br/><br/>Over all, a 9 out of 10 from me. Except a few jokes (such as cutting Dewey's brother & dad in half) I thought was unnecessary, this movie is brilliant and I've been watching it over and over again. So underrated and cult."

Reilly is an amazing actor and great in every movie but ""Walk Hard"" is our absolute favorite. The range he displayed as a singer was, not only surprising, but amazing! Jenna Fischer never looked better and is perfect as Darlene. Chris Parnell, Matt Besser, Tim Meadows, Paul Rudd and Jack Black are all hilarious and, in our opinion, this movie features our favorite performances by all of these actors. Highly, highly recommend! P.S. Dewey's manager (David Krumholtz) suffers the funniest on-screen heart attack in motion picture history!"
"shagginwagen01","9","1","1","4 April 2012"," Too Funny...
","This movie is too funny. It takes a lot of ideas from other movies and is mainly a parody of walk the line. Although I thought walk the line was a good movie, I couldn't help not liking this film. John C. Reilly is one of my favorite comedy actors. Even though he goes for the whole stupid funny thing, he makes me laugh every time. This is probably Jake Kasdan's best movie he's ever made, followed by Orange County which is very funny. I guess anything with John C. Reilly is funny, but I prefer his movies without Will Ferrell. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 because its simply that funny, and when I first watched this movie a couple years ago I liked it so much I went out and bought it."

","Walk Hard traces the life of Dewey Cox, an infamous musician you've never heard of, from his boyhood in Alabama and his last days as a major music celebrity.<br/><br/>This is a role the vastly underrated John C. Reilly was born to play. He is absolutely hysterical in this role, and shows incredible musical skill performing the soundtrack. Reilly is just so, so funny in this, it's my favorite role he has ever done. A role you have to see to believe, he embodies Dewey Cox as if he was Dewey Cox.<br/><br/>The music is great, all original hits inspired by the different time periods Dewey ""lived in"". I'm not a fan of Judd Apatow usually, but here his efforts are wonderfully concentrated with direction by Jake Kasdan, both of which wrote the script. Kudos on their best work, we see Dewey go through every decade, and the tribulations Dewey faces with love, drugs, and music.<br/><br/>Jenna Fischer shows some surprising talent that's a far stretch from The Office, playing Dewey's second wife. Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell, of SNL fame, play hilarious members of Dewey's group. Raymond J. Barry plays disapproving father Cox in spectacular fashion.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite comedies ever, and well worth the ten rating I give it. If you haven't seen it, watch it. You'll love it."

","Spoof movies have really gotten out of hand in the last 10 years. everyone seems to be trying to copy the Zucker's style of gags and film making. That is what sets Walk Hard apart from the rest! This is the most original spoof film since Airplane! It's silly, funny,and somehow at times emotional! The original music really fits the target era it's based in! Instead of directly copying scenes from Ray or Walk the line, the writers have written entirely new scenarios. Keeping it short, because it is a very funny well acted film beautifully shot, and surprisingly original. That is why I'm giving it such a high rating! If you like funny movie that don't come off as embarrassing rent this today!"

","This movie was definitely not what I expected. I had expected all crude humor and nothing more. Of course there was plenty of it, but weaved in between was a bit of a sad meaningful story, not much but it's there.<br/><br/>I found the movie hilarious and I was happy that the same jokes weren't used over and over again. The humor was spread out just enough that it wasn't overwhelming.<br/><br/>The thing about the movie I enjoyed most of all was the music. Some of the songs were just plain hilarious and others were more meaningful such as A Life Without You, which is my favorite song from the movie. John C. Riley has a lovely voice and it was an unexpected treat for me. I was very surprised to hear how well he sings.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie a lot and give it a 9/10!"

","When I was readying to watch this movie, I was not in an excited mood to watch it. It was on the free movies, the complete unrated version, which never happens unless the film is very poor. Very Pleasantly, I was surprisingly, I was hooked within the first minute. Which was weird, because I HATED Superbad. But, I LOVED this film.<br/><br/>The film stars John C. Reiley as Dewey Cox, who instantly becomes a likable character. Even when he's a kid, he's likable. One day, he and his over-achieving brother, Nate, played by Chip Horness, have a machete fight. Things turn bad, and Nate is cut in half. This starts a separation between Dewey and His father, Pa Cox, played by Raymond J. Berry. By the age of 14, he's tired of being bossed around by his folks, and shunned by the town. So, he packs up, and the rock star life comes at him, FULL FORCE! Honestly, if you're going to see this movie, see the unrated version. Yes, it's more shocking, but, it's also funnier, and it has more heart then the rated version. Honestly, this film quite shocked me. It's hilarious, thought-provoking and heartwarming all in one. Definite recommendation."
"chains01","8","1","1","25 October 2009"," Walk Hard: The Story of Dewey Cox
","Spoof movies have been around for as long as the art form of film has been entertaining people. From Charlie Chaplin to Woody Allen to the Marx Brothers and Mel Brooks, film makers have been spoofing other movie forms to satirize society and politics. Spoof movies have made us laugh while also showing us the error in our ways and the inherent stupidity found in our societal ways. Unfortunately, the form has taken a beating with the ""(Insert Genre Here) Movie"" series which has driven the genre into the mire. But when Judd Apatow joined with Jake Kasdan (a co-collaborator on Freaks and Geeks and Zero Effect), what they came up with should have turned the genre up on it's ear.<br/><br/>After the accidental halving of his brother, Dewey Cox learns how to play blues guitar and starts writing songs. At the age of 14, he insights a riot with the song ""Take My Hand"" and leaves home to seek stardom. Dewey's discovered by Jewish businessmen in a club where black folk go to dance erotically when Dewey fills in for the regular act when he gets laryngitis. Making a huge splash with his first single, Walk Hard, Dewey goes on the road and we follow him through the ups and downs, the relationships, the drugs, and the destroying of multiple public and private bathrooms.<br/><br/>Jake Kasdan and Judd Apatow do a great job of making this movie feel like a real biopic and not just a series of skits formed together to make a movie. They present each time frame with real authenticity, injecting the 60's with the whimsy we've seen in past movies, and the 70's with the ""grooviness"" we've come to expect of this kind of movie. The music feels authentic as well, feeling as if it's been written throughout the time frames seen in the movie.<br/><br/>But you don't go into a parody for the dramatic elements, and for the comedy this movie has great pedigree. It fits in handsomely with other Apatow comedies like Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall. John C. Reilly, fresh off Taladega Nights, shows off more of the comedic chops that he had shown in that movie, while also bringing a dramatic pedigree to the role not typical to this kind of comedy in recent years (he was nominated for an Oscar for his role in Chicago). On top of that, it seems as though everyone in Hollywood wanted to be involved in this movie as this movie boasts one of the largest lists of cameos I have ever seen in a movie including Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Jack White of the White Stripes, Lyle Lovett, Jewell, Tim Meadows, Justin Long, Kristen Wiig, Craig Robinson, and Jonah Hill just to name a few.<br/><br/>As with any biopic, whether real or fake, though, this movie seems to loose it's away as the main character loses his way as well. It becomes more frenetic and loses pacing later on, but seems to catch itself before straying too far. Also some of the characters are underdeveloped as usually happens in biopics as you try to cram in characters that truly effected the main characters life. Luckily, the movie never feels as though it's dragging, and remains consistent with the laughs throughout.<br/><br/>While Walk Hard was a critical hit, it unfortunately, it bombed at the box office where it deserved more of an audience. I highly recommend giving this chance if you like comedy and musician biopics. While funny, the movie never feels as though it's making fun of the people presented in the biopics it's skewering like Johnny Cash or Ray Charles. A word of warning, as with any Apatow flick one can expect a large amount of vulgarity including full frontal male and female nudity, a lot of cursing, and more than one person getting cut in half, so this may not be a movie you want to watch in front of the children. For those of you who can get around the aforementioned vulgarity (or embrace it as I do) you will be justly rewarded!"

","Recap: It's about for famous Dewey Cox to take the stage. But before he does he just needs a moment to remember his life. It began an awful long time ago, and is marked by the death of his older brother Nate. Dewey accidentally cut Nate in half with a machete and it has hunted him ever since. But it also gave him the gift of blues, and lead him to his life of music. It is a story of drugs, sex and rock'n'roll.<br/><br/>Comments: I'm not sure it is really right to spoof and parody a movie that is a biopic of someone's life. But it is great, it is hilarious. The Dewey Cox Story is obviously a parody of Walk the line but also spoofs great many other legendary musicians. It is a fine line to make a parody like this funny but not over the line and insulting, but The Dewey Cox Story negotiates that line masterfully.<br/><br/>It's a fast paced story with a lot of twists and turns. There are a lot of laughs and it's a great comedy to relax to. But actually, the music isn't that bad either. Sure, it pays to pay attention to the lyrics but the songs also resemble the time they are meant to spoof.<br/><br/>John C Reilly has had a long career and has had to worked hard to get the lead parts in the big movies. But now they're here and in this he handles it as good as anyone. He is perfect for the role. And he has got a good supporting cast too, not to mention the musicians that have cameos.<br/><br/>If you have the DVD I can also recommend the special feature The Real Dewey Cox. To watch that after the movie is a perfect ending.<br/><br/>Just hilarious.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This never went to the theaters of my city and it was recently when my uncle got its DVD. He loved it and talked to me about it and I was like ""hey I really wanted to look at it"" then I saw it obviously. Previously I found that Apatow Team film with Owen Wilson as the main ""attraction"" as a very average and somehow very disappointing film yet later I found some films from the same time that were what I expected and by now there are three films of the Apatow Team that for me are just very funny and definitely were what I expected. This is one of them. We have and enjoy a parody that simply is based on constants. For Dewey Cox everything happened in a very short time and his story at its beginning has another protagonist in his brother Nate. They made everything just perfect, a charming and extremely talented kid dreaming about a life full of important events, full of excitement, a kid being just happy for a new beautiful day. They made everything perfect just for that event that marked Dewey Cox forever, that machete situation. After that event everything moved faster so we can say that Dewey was a precocious boy or better we can say that was extremely precocious and with a unique voice, he understood the blues. His dream was closer in a very short time so those big responsibilities began; very soon he was the last hope in order to restore one man's faith in Judaism and with that goal completed 35 minutes later he was a new sensation, sharing the stage with Elvis and like him making that the girls went crazy. He was a chameleon and we really enjoy that. One day he knew drugs, other day he wanted to be a punk rocker (he was sort of the beginner of punk) and in other period he was a Dylan follower, influenced by Dylan in all the ways (hilarious, great lyrics!). All because the constant issues with women, drugs, jails, new friends, Johns, Pauls, Georges, Ringos, etc. His own L ucy in the S ky with D iamonds period is very colorful and is animated! <br/><br/>We all know how the great musicians changes, from the young sensation to the big rock star, the bad influence, the legend. Here we have a extremely entertaining and very funny mix of that, here each of the changes of our featured musician are very well known periods, he seems to have prove all the different tastes and that delivers just pure fun and great musical moments. Even when his old music was simply destroyed by some new hip-hop sensation is just perfect for Dewey, not for his extremely known music but certainly for his last masterpiece.<br/><br/>The cast is extremely familiar and more because I have seen not very long time ago The 40 Year Old Virgin and Superbad (Jonah Hill, Gerry Bednob and Jane Lynch are here). Of course there are more memorable cameos than others and in that way we have the second cameo in a 2007 film of The Beatles (Jack Black C**k, Jason Schwartzman, Paul Rudd and Justin Long), the appearance of the great Eddie Veder and The White Stripe Raconteur Jack White as Elvis; a lot of fun with those appearances. Reilly is a funny guy,here is simply great and he has the luck to be together with Jenna Fisher who plays of course Darlene Madison, the woman of Dewey Cox's life. Also the makeup is terrific, they look great at their last live appearance!<br/><br/>I dare to write that every fan of music will find in this a very enjoyable film. Dewey Cox certainly was a legend and this film goes beyond the facts and enters into the myths (in ""The Real Dewey Cox"" featurette Apatow claims that this was based upon Cox's autobiography that was full of lies, just crap). Absolutely entertaining and hilarious, Walk Hard is simply that. 9.5 out of 10<br/><br/>Something about the DVD: The featurette ""The Real Dewey Cox"" is really funny, some of the anecdotes are not as funny as the ones of Reilly, Sheryl Crow, Jewel and Judd Apatow to mention some. Also I found hilarious extended Beatles scene, John and Paul are simply fantastic! By the way and finally, funny Morrison spoof in the poster."

","I have been waiting a very long time to see a parody that I could even laugh at, and I mean a long, long time. The latest crop of parodies today aren't even trying, and seem to be written just to make a quick buck e.i. Meet the Spartans, Scary Movie 1, 2, 3 & 4. Not only do I think The Dewey Cox story is the best parody ever; I would have to say it could possibly be the funniest movie I have ever seen. Before Dewey Cox Story I thought John C. Reilly was kind of riding on Will Ferrell's comedy coat-tails but now I see the true comedic genius is Mr Reilly. I even recall seeing the poster for this movie in the theater lobby early on and telling myself I wouldn't even consider seeing it, but after seeing Mr. Reilly's TV promo pieces for the movie I discovered he was a lot funnier than I gave him credit for and decided to go see it. I was so happy I did. The laughs are non-stop and the wit is razor sharp. Thanks Mr. Reilly for MAKING me laugh so very hard."

","I laughed so hard from beginning to end. I don't give out 10 stars lightly. What was missing that other viewers rated it less than 10 stars? I love saying, it was great, but if only they ..... But not in this comedy. It was original humour, well chosen music, excellent soundtrack. Don't miss this comedy. And just try to feel sorry for yourself and your problems after watching this movie. You just keep chuckling, even days later. Right after seeing it I saw Will Farrell in Semi-Pro, which was funny, but just formula Farrell sports comedy. Reilly hit it out of the ballpark, channelling Dewey Cox to perfection. I disagree with whoever said Will Farrell would have been better. John C. Reilly moved to the A list in my book. SPOILER: Was there a real Dewey Cox? You could just call it another movie about how rock stars become famous, can't handle it, do drugs and burn out. It was that, but so much, much more. It is so rare for a movie to be packed with so many new ways of telling old stories with great performances by all."
"jdollak","8","1","1","9 May 2008"," An excellent comedy with a limited audience.
","Walk Hard is an unusual comedy, in that the jokes in it are not always funny on their own, but they are funny because they exist as a shorthand in pointing out how similar musician biopics are.<br/><br/>It's important to keep this in mind. If you consider the gag of a kid being chopped in half with a machete, it's not funny in itself. If you consider it in the role it plays in this film - to motivate Dewey to become a star, to make him feel insecure with his relationship to his father, it's considerably more funny than treating it realistically.<br/><br/>This movie will accumulate a large cult following, similar to This Is Spinal Tap. If you show This Is Spinal Tap to people who aren't interested in music, they will be pretty bored, since most of the gags don't make sense to them. Same deal as Walk Hard. It's a wonderfully juvenile comedy, but it has so much heart that it doesn't feel cruel. When we see Dewey performing in the 70s, it's hard to think how horrible it is, because despite his decline, it still looks very fun, in a very dated way.<br/><br/>I would not suggest this movie to anyone who didn't absolutely love This Is Spinal Tap. But the lack of accessibility to this movie doesn't change that it is ultimately a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>I have one real problem with the movie - the rehab sequences went on too long. That's it. Everything else feels very well done."
"Chris Knipp","7","7","18","23 December 2007"," Judd and Jake out of their depth
","Judd Apatow, whose involvement in social comedies has been so successful lately, teams up with his ""Freaks and Geeks"" collaborator Jake Kasdan and dancing actor John C. Reilly (who showed us some nice soft-shoe in Chicago) to attempt a satirical musical biopic in Walk Hard. Drawing obviously on Walk the Line, Ray, and other sources, these guys do their best to provide some Christmas end-of-the-year cheer, but their ""hard walk"" goes soft and staggers toward the end. <br/><br/>Cox is a catchall of a pop singer, a chameleon Zelig/Forest Gump whose life from age 14, where Reilly absurdly takes on the role from a younger actor, till early 70's, runs through blues, soul, country, punk--you name it--with appropriate drugs. There's pot for soul, LSD for psychedelic rock--Cox gets to hang out with a crude version of the Beatles in India with the Mahirishi. Cocaine leads him to punk--and so on. The trouble (or one trouble, anyway) is that though he's game to a fault, Reilly is colorless to begin with. It's impossible to believe teenyboppers would swoon for him. He has zero sex appeal. And that isn't funny like Steve Martin's ""wild and crazy guy,"" either.<br/><br/>The constant shifts of musical style neglect to give Cox any unifying factor whatever. Apatow might as well have used six different actors for Cox, a la Todd Haynes with Bob Dylan. And Cox has a Dylan phase. Only you know what? The Dylanesque lyrics aren't at all funny, and satire ought to appeal to devotees. This is a music movie about a musician who hasn't a scintilla of musical authenticity. Or even a consistent shtick.<br/><br/>Of course there are plenty of laughs, but Walk Hard is little more than a string of jokes and rough-hewn, even gruesome stunts. The way relatives are killed off seems infantile violent, while the sexual humor is adolescent. Jokes like the humping motions of couples in a black club, and the Jewish music producers dressed in full Orthodox regalia and with names like Mazeltov and Dreidel really appeal to the basest responses of the audience. This is way too sloppy work to compare with witty musical satire, and Apatow's and Kasdan's catchall screenplay seems lazy--ultimately uninventive.<br/><br/>Of course this is meant to be Reilly's picture, but he's the victim of it.<br/><br/>While it's been said the string of songs composed for Reilly to sing ups the ante for such satire, the incessant shifts in style keep the movie from every coming close to achieving the subtlety and point of a classic comic music movie like This is Spinal Tap, which defined a genre and style, or an oddball serious fake music documentary like Brothers of the Head--both of which evoke the worlds and times they come from brilliantly: Walk Hard doesn't really try.<br/><br/>The movie's only (questionable) new note is the incessant mockery of the devices of music biopics. There it does have a clear and relentless point. The trouble is, it apes those biopics too closely. Again, Apatow and Kasdan have been lazy and unimaginative, good only at reaching for laughs--and too often reaching mighty low for them.<br/><br/>This movie turns humble musical rural people into trailer trash. It's a trailer trash movie. But where the biopic evocation falls short is that Cox really has an easy time of it. He's neither a Johnny Cash nor a Ray Charles. He doesn't suffer the consequences of his drug use or his marital failures. So the ""hard"" of Rock Hard is only a word, unlike the genuine rough life lived by Charles and Cash. This is the trouble with taking everything lightly--and going to overly gruesome extremes to show a dark side of the past. It veers from the bloody to the shallow, with nothing in between. Of course the lighthearted approach was okay, in fact downright welcome, in the youth comedies of Knocked Up or Juno or the trivial adolescent coming of age hassles of Superbad--moments in young lives the kids are going to move on from. But for a life from 14 to 70, this approach leaves you feeling empty."

"DonFishies","7","5","12","21 December 2007"," A solid, albeit a little weary, addition to the Apatow comedy canon
","Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story chronicles the rise and fall of fictional singer Dewey Cox's (John C. Reilly), showcasing the changes in his music as each decade passes, and the struggles he faces as a musician.<br/><br/>Just when we figured we had enough of the typical singer bio-pic, co-writer/producer/comedy golden boy Judd Apatow has delivered yet another one, albeit his first real straight on parody since he first struck gold with The 40-Year-Old Virgin. There was obviously plenty to mine here, and just the brief synopsis should evoke memories of recent Oscar-winners Walk the Line and Ray. And while a lot of the moments that pass do allow for the filmmakers to take grand shots at these two films, it also allows for plenty of satire on the state of music through the various decades, from the rise of rock and roll in the 1950's, to the hippie peace movement in the 1960's and beyond. Also added to the mix are quite a few cameos by actors playing famous musicians of the time including Frankie Muniz as Buddy Holly and Jack White as the King himself, Elvis Presley (and an absolutely laugh out loud sequence featuring The Beatles).<br/><br/>But in packing in a lot of this material from sources that were already too bogged down in the first place, Apatow and co-writer/director Jake Kasdan have bogged themselves down to. For a movie that is under one hundred minutes, it drags a bit too much for its own good. Some sequences run endlessly long, and some just pass by with ease. I do not want to say, or incur, that I was bored at all by one of the best (if not the best) parody films in a long time (especially if I have such tripe as Meet the Spartans to look forward to in the future), it just dragged itself along too much. I understand the effect the Kasdan and Apatow were going for, but I think they could have limited themselves a little bit more. What does not help even more so is knowing that many of the trailer's scenes are cut right out of the movie, suggesting an even longer Unrated DVD (along the lines of the way too long Virgin DVD). There just does not seem to be a middle ground in the area of pacing throughout the film, and it tarnishes the film as a result.<br/><br/>The actual material itself is fairly hysterical. There are plenty of laughs to be found at any given turn here, and many laugh out loud moments to go with them. Just watching these actors delivering their lines in purely serious ways, especially during the some of the film's most ridiculous moments (ironically, moments that fall very close to those found in Line or Ray), is just too much to not be able to laugh at. All of these actors seem very at home with the material, and look like they are having a lot of fun with their characters. This also seems to be one of the closest followed scripts of the past few Apatow films, and rarely does it appear that the characters are improvising (or they have just really improved from their consistent ad-libbing). The sets, backgrounds and costume designs, evoking the specific periods, are just as funny, if not more. There is a grand sense of authenticity at work here, and anyone watching the movie can pick out specific ties to their own memories (real or imagined) of those eras. Of course, there are a few too many nods to current fashion trends, but it stays very keenly in the area of that specific era depicted during that point in the film.<br/><br/>Reilly as Cox is a marvel in the lead role. He brings his more refined dramatic style to the role, and I think it helps lend a certain aura of credibility to the performance. It is just as serious and realistic as Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash, and only a few steps below the mastery of Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles, and Dewey Cox is not even a real person. He really makes this character his own, and when he is not being downright hilarious, without even breaking a grin, he is being heartbreakingly hysterical. It is a mixed bag, but Reilly makes it work, and he makes it work very well. His performance as the actor is only topped by his performance as the singer. He leads songs brilliantly at every point in the film, and even though the subtext of most of them is a bit risqué, they are still wonderfully written songs sung by someone with a great voice. If this role does not spring board Reilly into more leading actor work, it just may give him the needed boost to be a singer (or at least, to do more musicals or head to Broadway).<br/><br/>The supporting cast, although not nearly as funny as Reilly, all lend a hand in making Walk Hard a very funny movie. From Kristen Wiig and Jenna Fischer as Cox's wives, to Tim Meadows, Chris Parnell, and Matt Besser as his band mates, to Raymond J. Barry as his father, everyone manages to steal a scene for themselves, and manages to deliver some solid laughs. Yes, there are quite a few flat jokes that are given by the supporters much more often than Reilly as the lead, but for the most part, they do a great job backing him up. It also helps that it seems like everyone has some sort of minuscule amount of chemistry with Reilly, allowing their jokes to fly very easily.<br/><br/>Despite its faults, Walk Hard is a solid addition to the growing canon of Apatow comedies, and is one hell of a funny parody. Reilly was the best man for this role, and I am happy to say that he makes the film more than just watchable.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

","Movie parodies can be a tough art to master. The best ones, like ""Flying High"", ""Hot Shots"", ""Naked Gun"", ""Top Secret"", ""Scary Movie"" and ""Team America: World Police"" cleverly poke fun at the pomposities of their chosen genre, and often turn out to be more memorable than the films that inspired them. The bad ones  like the reprehensible ""Date Movie""- simply re-create the movies they're trying to parody, with not real satirical insight. Fortunately, ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" lands firmly (no pun intended) into the former category. WH: TDCS is a parody of the good, but overly earnest and reverential music bio-pics ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line"". While the plot of ""Walk Hard"" borrows heavily from ""Walk the Line"" (though the promotional poster is a parody of the iconic Jim Morrison image), it manages to be more than just 'Johnny Cash with dick jokes'. The film had fantastic pedigree; it's co-written by Judd Apatow, the man behind such hilarious comedies as""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad""; it stars perennial sidekick John C. Reilly as Cox, Jenna Fischer (from the US version of ""The Office"") and a slew of cameos, including Jonah Hill (as the ghost of Dewey's dead brother), Jack White as Elvis and Paul Rudd and Jack Black as Lennon and McCartney respectively. While ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line""  which had remarkably similar plots  both only featured significant periods of the lives of Ray Charles and Johnny Cash respectively, ""Walk Hard"" traces Dewey Cox from a precocious 14-year-old, who leaves his Alabama home with his 12-year-old sweetheart (though Reilly and his on-screen girlfriend Kristin Wiig are at least twice that age) after accidentally chopping his brother in half with a machete(which leads to his father constantly complaining that the wrong son died), right through to his final performance at 71. What happens in between is what makes this movie so hilarious. After leaving Alabama he makes it big with the country song ""Walk Hard"", is hired by a group of ridiculously stereotypical Jews, leaves his wife and their growing number of kids to tour the country, gets hooked on drugs (despite his black drummer warning him about the side effects, which makes Dewey want to do them more), starts an affair with Darlene (Fischer), throws tantrums (including a propensity for ripping out sinks and letting the water fly), has ridiculously large orgies, does LSD with the Beatles (which includes a nice ""Yellow Submarine""-inspired animated sequence), breaks up and reunites with Darlene, accidentally chops his father in half and reconnects with his fifty children and grandchildren before his final performance. Like all true artists, Cox manages to adapt to the times. While he starts out as a country singer, he has numerous career changes, including singing protest songs for midgets, nonsensical Dylan-esquire songs, a hippie phase  which culminates in a hilariously bigger-is-better studio recording (including Didgeridoo players, a massive choir and goats), before a rejuvenation inspired by rapper Little Nutsack, who samples Walk Hard in one of his songs. If you're familiar with ""Knocked Up"", ""Superbad"" and the various other frat pack movies, you'll know what to expect from ""Walk Hard"". While it doesn't have the underlying heart of Apatow's last two movies, it doesn't need it. ""Walk Hard"" is a straight-out parody, and, for the most part, it's hilarious. The songs complement the parody, especially the duet by Dewey and Darlene, which is full of lingering sexual references, punctuated by tactical phrasing. Reilly  who sung in ""Chicago"" (mostly remembered for his solo number ""Mr. Cellophane) handles the singing duties well. He isn't as good as Joaquin Phoenix  who sounded almost like Cash in ""Walk the Line"", but he still does well. Unlike ""This is Spinal Tap"", which was a savage satire of a fictional English Heavy Metal band, its band members and the ridiculousness of their lifestyles, ""Walk Hard' doesn't set out to make fun of Dewey Cox, only the absurdity of overly serious and pretentious bio-pics. ""Walk Hard"" achieves this goal, and manages to make it the best music parody since Spinal Tap, and one of the best parodies since the golden days of ""Flying High"" and ""Naked Gun""."
"zardoz-13","10","3","6","7 January 2008"," Flawlessly Funny Farce About Music Bio-Pics With Terrific Songs!
","You'll laugh so much watching ""Orange County"" director Jake Kasdan's comedy ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" that you might have to change your drawers. Kasdan penned this impudent, politically incorrect spoof with ""Knocked-Up"" & ""Superbad"" scribe Judd Apatow that mercilessly lampoons last year's poignant Joaquin Phoenix & Reese Witherspoon biography ""Walk the Line"" of superstar pop singer Johnny Cash. Unlike so many recent spoofs, such as ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie,"" ""Walk Hard"" contents itself strictly with shredding one movie rather than an entire year's worth. Surprisingly, however, Kasdan and Apatow not only manage to make the resemblance clear between ""Walk Hard"" and ""Walk the Line"" unmistakable, but also these two fertile minds drag in other superstar singers both dead and alive for added texture. The sheer brilliance of ""Walk Hard"" is how perfectly Kasdan and Apatow ridicule the conventions of the famous singer musical biography. Again, unlike second-rate spoofs that the wring only the most superficial jokes out of the hero's predicament, this parody goes deeper with its devotion to detail. ""Walk Hard"" takes us on a nostalgic journey through the rebellious 1950s to the psych-out 1960s, skewering musical genres like soul music, bubble-gun music, rock music, punk music, surfing music, and social protest music. The film charts its passage of time with repeated encounters between the hero and his band's drummer in a toilet abusing illicit narcotics with warm, willing, and wanton women. Moreover, Kasdan and Apatow transcend their satiric origins and forge characters that genuinely interest us for their own foibles rather than the synthesis of stereotypes that we've come to recognize over the years. For example, protagonist Dewey Cox brings to mind a number of famous singers, among them Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Ray Charles, and Bob Dylan.<br/><br/>""Walk Hard"" provides songs that mimic those Cash, Orbison, and Dylan classics, and the performers here deliver reasonably convincing renditions. Indeed, some of the humor, particularly the inclusion of lower frontal male nudity, may offend some unsuspecting moviegoers. Kasdan doesn't try to sneak a shot of male genitals past when you might not be looking. He displays male genitalia twice and draws attention to it without fear. Few mainstream American film releases have been this daring in this respect. Typically, only European imports have these largely taboo shots.<br/><br/>Talented John C. Reilly of ""Boogie Nights"" does a superb job as curly-headed Dewey Cox, the youngest son of a rural Springberry, Alabama, farmer with one older son and a younger daughter, who attains fame and fortune. ""Blades of Glory"" actress Jenna Fischer as Darlene plays the equivalent of Reese Witherspoon's June Carter Cash and she is delightful. Darlene and Dewey sing a hilarious duet on stage filled with double-entrendes entitled ""Let's Duet."" Like ""Walk the Line,"" ""Walk Hard"" opens at a modern-day concert tribute to the hero and the stage manager is rushing breathlessly around trying to find Dewey Cox. Eventually, he discovers him in a dark hallway, his guitar slung over his back, his head bowed deep-in-thought as he ponders his past, leaning forward on one arm braced against the wall. Dewey's drummer Sam (Tim Meadows of "" "") informs the stage manager: ""Dewey Cox must rethink his entire life before he plays."" Kasdan and Apatow tell their story predominantly in flashback. We learn that Dewey had an older brother, Nate ( as a child and as a grown-up dead man) who was a musical progeny as well as the apple of his doting father's eye. Nate lives a charmed life, risking life and limb more often than not with fires, runaway horses, until he meets his untimely death during a duel in the barn with Dewey. They are fencing with a pair of machetes and Dewey loses the sheath for his machete and accidentally cuts his older brother into two pieces. The adolescent actor appears to be buried from the waist down in hay so that he can be alongside his trunk-less pelvis and legs. Dewey's father never lets his surviving son live down this accident. Repeatedly, through the action, the father appears and reminds Dewey that the wrong son died. Repeatedly, the ghost of dead Nate appears to Dewey (rather like the ghosts in ""Stardust"") and lecture the hero. At one point, Dewey meets the Beatles during their sojourn in India. Dewey rubs shoulders with the Beatles and the filmmakers show that they know a thing or two about these immortal icons. Paul Rudd plays John; Jack Black does an amusing turn as Paul; Jason Schwartzman is appropriately goofy as Ringo and Justin Long scores as George Harrison and they introduce Dewey to LSD.<br/><br/>Kasdan and Apatow hit more often than miss with their jokes in this consistently funny as well as moving musical biography parody. The songs are incredibly flavorful and funny, too. Margo Martindale excels as Dewey's homily, obese mom, while Raymond J. Barry steals the show as his strident father. ""Walk Hard"" is strides beyond most cinematic satires."

","Personally I loved it. It worked as hilarious satire, and as a narrative. By the end I actually cared about Cox, something I have never really done before in a pure satire not directed by Christopher Guest. Most of this can be attributed to the great performance by John C. Reilly. It's his best acting ever, or at least since Magnolia. He embody's Cox. The performance is similar to those in This is Spinal Tap. It's both over the top, and filled with subtle naunces. Jenna Fisher is also surprisingly impressive as the love of his life. Her performance is even better than that of Reese Witherspoon in Walk the Line, for which she won an Oscar. The rolls are very similar, and Fisher's works better. This is one of the only satires I have seen that is actually better than the films it is spoofing, and I love musical biopics. It is far more entertaining, and in a way more touching. The cameo's are even more numerous than I expected. The best are of course in The Beatles scene. Paul Rudd in particular is perfect as John Lennon. All in all this is brilliant satire. It works in every way, and is one of the most entertaining and funny films of the year."

To me, it's as if the filmmakers wrote this entire movie while watching the DVD of ""Walk the Line"" and kept pausing it after every scene to rewrite it as an SNL sketch. Unfortunately (like most SNL sketches) the humor is lost after the first few minutes. I just wish I were able to change the channel in the theater the way I'm able to at home with the TV.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, watching this film, you really get the impression that this cast had a blast working together.

That pretty much sums up the film, with the exception of its only saving grace  the music.<br/><br/>While the film itself is little more than a cheap shot at every other musical biography, it provides viewers with many nostalgic moments of the industry's greatest artists. Dewey Cox - a fictional icon  is a hard rocker with a penchant for trying out different women; drugs and various styles of music.<br/><br/>His peculiar relationship with Hassidic Jews brings freakish absurdity to the film, but the comedic element of The Dewey Cox story is seriously lacking.

The rest of the movie was hilarious.The movie was pretty much a parody of Ray and Walk The Line, pulling segments from both. The majority of the movie was based around Walk The Line. Jenna Fisher is amazing, as is John C. Reilly. Tim Meadow's character was an excellent addition, he delivers one of the funniest lines in the movie with ""You Don't want none of this #$%#"" There is full frontal male nudity but its hilarious.

"mgoldhamer","9","3","7","7 January 2008"," Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story: Reflections of a rolling stone in a fun house mirror
","Walk Hard; The Dewey Cox Story; here in referred to as (WHTDCS) by this author is this years Forest Gump (1994). Concider, Forest Gump is mentally challenged, his best friend Bubba has a speech impediment, Lt. Dan is a double amputee, and his girl friend Jenny, dies of AIDS, all in the span of 30 years. The era is almost the same for both films as well as the violence, adult language, adult content, sexuality, drug use, political activism, rock and roll and racial equality issues. Granted Forest Gump was rated PG-13 and WHTDCS is rated R for male non-sexual frontal nudity, and a bit more funny, adult content but this film was made 13 years later, in actual time.The title WHTDCS, may be more offense to the American public but with a film titled Knocked Up (2007) the gloves are already off. Back to comparing both films; when the public watched Forest Gump, they laughed out loud but as previously stated, the main characters were mentally retarded, confined to a wheel chair, an alcoholic, suffering from a speech disorder, and dying of AIDS! Yet, the film viewing public more often than not found this film a comedy, is it not strange to laugh at those less fortunate than most! WHTDCS is very much like the cast in Forest Gump; Dewey Cox (John C. Rielly) has no sense of smell, his lead drummer is a drug addict as well as the rest of his band and Dewey is forced to leave home at the age of 16! Satire allows the audience to laugh at a sad situation like Forest Gump and WHTDCS. In the early 1960's Monte Python's Flying Circus hit the airways of Public Television in The USA, America had found a new comedy. It was great fun to laugh at The British! All of their silly walks, Spam, Spam, Spam, etc.,etc.,etc., but we were laughing at our English neighbors, not at ourselves. WHTDCS is grand satire at America, and Americans may find that too salty a meal to digest. Director Jake Kardan has made a very funny film, a pun unto itself, with actor John C. Reilly in the lead doing stand-up. Sadly the box office does not reflect the gross product of Dewey Cox, however hard, he may walk."
"zetes","9","3","7","23 December 2007"," Slight but occasionally hilarious
","After seeing The TV Set earlier this week, I was especially interested in seeing the followup film from director Jake Kasdan and producer Judd Apatow. The biopic is definitely a genre in much need of a spoofing, and I figured Kasdan and Apatow, with the often brilliant John C. Reilly in the lead, would produce a spoof with perhaps a little more depth than other films of the genre. But, alas, Walk Hard walks about the same line as the Hot Shot movies, somewhat below The Naked Gun and somewhat above Scary Movie. It's funny for the most part, but painfully two-dimensional. It does have some nice jokes concerning the history of pop music that might bypass the younger generations. I especially loved when Dewey Cox went through his Brian Wilson period. The recording session of his Pet Sounds-like album is just great. ""I need an army of didjeridoos!"" Perhaps the funniest joke of the film are the various music stars of the era whose personae are occupied by celebrities in cameos. I actually wish they had gone even further with this, covering as many musicians as they could. The moment of the film that made me laugh the most is when Frankie Muniz, the kid from Malcolm in the Middle, appears as Buddy Holly. The casting is truly inspired, and I just love the way every phony celebrity is called by both their first name and last name every time they are mentioned, like, ""Well hello, Buddy Holly"" or ""How are you doing, Paul McCartney?"" The entire sequence where Cox meets The Beatles in India had me holding my sides. That could have gone on for longer. There are a lot of other jokes that cracked me up, as well. The entire first sequence, where we see the obligatory tragedy that sets Cox's life in motion, is hilarious. The recurring joke where, whenever Dewey gets especially upset, he finds the nearest bathroom sink, rips it out, and smashes it on the ground is one that is close to my heart. It seems that there are at least two Oscar clips of actors or, more commonly, actresses, smashing dishes on the ground when they are angry. And, if you want to see something extremely rare, Tim Meadows is hilarious in another recurring joke, where Cox walks in on him doing drugs in a back room (a direct parody of Ray) and then joins him. So, yeah, there are some great gags. But then there are long dry stretches. And, as I said, the film is very shallow. It's content to be just a spoof, so, in the end, it's not all that memorable. But it's well worth watching if you're looking for some quick, easy laughs."

","Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007): Dir: Jake Kasdan / Cast: John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Raymond J. Barry, Kristen Wiig, Tim Meadows: A grand and hilarious masterpiece satire of the stability of musicians and the hassles of fame. When his brother dies in a freak accident, Dewey Cox aims higher and becomes a famous musician. An instant sensation leads to two wives, several children, and many trips to rehab. Director Jake Kasdan presents a comedy that mirrors Walk the Line. He previously made the entertaining Orange County but this is one of the more original concepts. John C. Reilly is hilarious as the naïve Cox who battles his feelings towards relationships and family under fame and drugs. Reilly portrays Cox from an amusing thirteen up to his seventies where he finally receives recognition. Jenna Fischer plays the June Carter Cash role who will become his second wife. Despite his lifestyle choices she remains the most current. Raymond J. Barry plays the father that regrets his son's very existence due to his favor over the deceased son. This is all concluded with a hilarious turnabout of realizations. Kristen Wiig plays whiny first wife Edith whose lack of support provides some of the best lines. Tim Meadows plays Cox's drummer whose running joke has him on every drug imaginable. A great mock bio pic that walks hard over fame, family and delusion. Score: 10 / 10"

","As an grown man, Dewey Cox waits behind the scenes to go onto stage for the performance of his life. While the introductions are being done, he finds a suitably dimly light corner, strikes a ""troubled"" pose and starts to reminisce about the life that he has lived that has brought him to this point. Fortunately for Cox the introductions are long as he needs time to start with his childhood and go through deaths, love, losses, betrayal, drugs, light entertainment, sex, more drugs, daddy issues and more drugs before he can perform with a clear head.<br/><br/>I rented this film without actually realising that it was basically a spoof on Walk the Line, which I fortunately had seen some months previously. Without knowing this or having seen that film, I would suggest that you are probably going to miss a lot of the gags since some of them are funny mainly because of their similarity to the ""straight"" film. It shouldn't be a massive problem though because it still does work as a comedy based on the rock biopic genre and as such is general enough to not require a great deal of knowledge. No, the bigger problem that most viewers are going to have with it is that it is just not as funny as it should be.<br/><br/>The length is part of the problem as it pushes the two-hour mark. Fine if the film has enough to make that work but this just doesn't. The plot is just a frame for the comedy, so that will not help engage; all that will really do it is to keep the viewer laughing as the film goes along. And there are laughs  some good ones and plenty that made me chuckle  but they are spread thin and are often the type that are amusing scenes rather than killer lines or sight gags. One is not better than the other but really this type of film needs both, the former keeping a firm bed of amusement to engage while the latter type delivers regular laugh-out-loud moments. Perhaps if it had been shorter then this wouldn't matter but this plus the running time leaves it baggy.<br/><br/>The cast try their best though and it was nice to see Reilly leading a film and doing a good job of it. The rest of the cast are second fiddle behind him but I did think that, laugh-wise, there were good turns from most of the main actors while cameos from Duffy, Ghostface and a few others added some laughs. That said though, Walk Hard is not a brilliant comedy so much as it is a reasonable one. It is rarely as funny or as inspired as it needs to be and the comparatively long running time makes this stand out all the more, leaving a film that is OK but never consistently more than that."

","An amusing satire that is full of outlandish performances and some fun moments, Walk Hard does struggle from time to time to handle its storyline, but for the most part, proves to be a worthy film for spoof lovers and music lovers alike. John C. Reilly gives a great performance as Dewey Cox himself, and is able to fully commit himself to his insane role in the best way possible. Tim Meadows is also able to steal the screen in each scene he is in, providing an equally over the top character, full of many quotable lines. The film can be quite funny with its take on music and its enjoyable satire, but none of the humor earns more than a chuckle throughout. The film does have a bit of a problem with pacing, and can at times feel a bit tedious with its story often going around in circles. It's music acts and songs, I will say, are quite impressive, and perhaps the strongest element in the movie as a whole. None of them seemed quite tiresome to me, and by the end, I had one or two of the songs stuck in my head. In the end, Walk Hard is an enjoyable but imperfect flick, with some shining moments, and somewhat of a pacing issue. However, if you enjoy a slow burn ride down a ridiculous musical valley, this is certainly the film for you.

","For the most part, this satirical music-biopic plays things totally straight, sending up the entire genre just by adhering to its strict formula while making each event overly melancholic and utterly absurd. 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007)' tells the made-up life-story of a made-up musician in exactly the same way that most films tell the real life-stories of real musicians. As such, some of its funniest moments come not when it's being silly but when it's being serious, playing directly into the tropes that we've all come to expect from a well-worn and, frankly, worn-out filmic category. It comes very close to being mean-spirited but manages to stay on the right side of that line by always aiming at the musical movies instead of the musical figures. Though it takes particular aim at 'Walk The Line (2004)' and 'Ray (2004)', it manages to parody basically every music-biopic to be released both before and after. This isn't to imply that it's always hilarious, however. While it's often funny - though, not always - and it pretty consistently makes astute observations, it does starts to wear a little thin towards its mid-section. Here, it can only ever be as entertaining as a generic music-biopic - which isn't all that entertaining - because that's exactly what it's presented as. I'll also say that the stereotyping of its Jewish characters, while clearly supposed to be poking fun at the more subtle stereotyping done by other films, is pretty problematic. Still, the picture is never dull and it manages to leave things on a very high note (the best joke of in entire affair, somewhat unfortunately, plays after the credits). It actually makes you realise just how much the music-biopic relies on its audience knowing that its narrative is (supposedly) mostly true, as the filmmaking and storytelling used to convey it are basic, at best. It also shows just how generic the genre really is, as it satirises basically every single entry in it. It's not always laugh-out-loud, but it is always enjoyable. 6/10"

The comedy beats you over the head with the lines and it's intentional and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments. The music is actually really quality too and adds to making it a great comedy rather than a good one. It shows the whole life of Dewey Cox and I for sure recommend it.

I found the script and film-making wonderful, as a satire on rock cliches. Within it are takeoffs on The Beatles, Bob Dylan, June Carter Cash (Jenna Fischer) and many more. <br/><br/>Even more amazing is that Reilly recorded 33 original songs for the movie with his backup band.

","I'm not a fan of farces, and to be honest, I'm not that crazy about John C. Reilly, but one thing you can be sure of, is that when I see Judd Apatow's name attached to something, I'll eventually see it. Walk Hard is a mocumentary about an Elvis Presley type persona, whose music spanned an evolved over a 50 year career. As styles changed, so did Dewey Cox, his outfits, personality, and his music, it was all very clever. I especially liked when he ran into the Beatles at a monastery in India. Walk Hard has some very funny moments, but this film would be nothing without John C. Reilly. It seems like he's in everything these days and most of the roles are quite forgettable, but Dewey Cox is easily his crowning achievement. Reilly is an actor I don't care for, in a style of film I don't care for, yet I was still very amused by the whole thing. The one negative I can give the film, is that is was exceptionally long for this type of film and it spent far too much time on the early stages of his life. The end of the film felt rushed to avoid it becoming a three hour movie, which to me suggests that maybe it should have been split in two. The inherit problem with comedies is that the longer they are, the more tiresome they become. While I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot, by the end I really couldn't wait for it to end. Farcical comedies are usually way out there and Walk Hard has some of that, but by and large it was an interesting take on fifty years of American pop culture. The film and it's star far exceeded my expectations and for what it was, I was impressed."

","Rather than point out what others have done well, I just want to add that the editing on this film is first rate. There are many good comedies that have lots of great scenes punctuated by not-so-good stuff. Marx Brothers films come to mind - classics without doubt, but stretches where you can go get a beer and not miss much; and most of the parody films of the last 20 years. Walk Hard doesn't let up. There's hardly twenty seconds without a whack to the funny bone. It may be just a raised eyebrow or a near-throwaway line that just happens to be perfectly placed. If there's a rating for Jokes Per Minute (JPM), this movie is one of the alltime best. And as a musician, this for me is one of the two best music business parodies of all time, the other, of course, being Spinal Tap.

Many of the actors are readily recognized from other roles in movies and TV, and went on to do other successful features and TV series...e.g. Jenna Fischer The Office.

","From Judd Apatow and company comes this certainly very likable movie that parodies standard Hollywood biographies of musical entertainers, taking particular aim at ""Walk the Line"" and ""Ray"" but also working as a skewering of changing musical trends over the decades, as its lead character Dewey Cox (an endearing John C. Reilly) is more than willing to move from one genre to another, and basically do whatever it takes to keep up the rock 'n' roll lifestyle.<br/><br/>Dewey Cox has had to deal with a tragic childhood incident which earned him the enmity of his father (Raymond J. Barry). The movie charts Dewey's progress over the years, as he ascends to stardom, becomes addicted to all manner of drugs, antagonizes the people in his life, and ultimately realizes what's truly important and puts his life back together.<br/><br/>The Apatow style of comedy is evident as always, alternating between sweet and poignant moments and very adult moments - there's even some nudity. Sometimes it gets a little silly - such as the animated LSD trip sequence - but mostly it's an enjoyable movie that goes far on the abilities of its cast. Reilly, who does his own singing, is well supported by Kristen Wiig as his first wife, Jenna Fischer as the backup singer who becomes his second wife (while he's still married to the first one), Matt Besser and former 'SNL' cast members Tim Meadows & Chris Parnell as his bandmates, and Barry & Margo Martindale as his parents. There are a lot of fun bits along the way, from the likes of Rance Howard, Craig Robinson, Harold Ramis, Jack McBrayer, Ed Helms, Gerry Bednob, David Krumholtz, Jane Lynch, and Simon Helberg. Particularly funny is the stunt casting of people like Frankie Muniz, as Buddy Holly, and Justin Long, Paul Rudd, Jason Schwartzman, and Jack Black as the Beatles! Nice cameos by real life music stars are a treat, as well.<br/><br/>There are enough laugh out loud moments to make all of this pleasant enough (at least this never gets truly mean spirited), and as a bonus the music is often genuinely catchy as well as amusing.

"brando647","7","0","0","25 July 2011"," John C. Reilly Shines in Over-Stuffed Parody of Music Through the Decades
","Here is a lesser known gem of the Judd Apatow's produced comedies. It didn't get the attention that 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, KNOCKED UP, or SUPERBAD received, but it's plenty funny. I honestly can't even remember this film going to theaters, so it must've snuck in and out pretty quietly without a whole lot of marketing. Apatow and writer/director Jake Kasdan bring the usual flavor of Apatow's comedies to this spoof of musical biopics that have flooded theaters in recent years. Everything from RAY to WALK THE LINE to Oliver Stone's THE DOORS are parodied. The film's musical hero is Dewey Cox, who takes up music after accidentally killing his brother with a machete and being shunned by his father. Dewey hits it big after his first major song ""Walk Hard"" hits the airwaves and the film tackles all of the most oft repeated staples of music bio pics: infidelity, drug abuse, rehab, and the golden realization in the end. Except here it's all done for laughs with plenty of quotable dialogue, a load of great cameos, and some surprisingly good music. It's not the most amazing comedy in recent years but it's loaded with laughs.<br/><br/>Just as with 2010's GET HIM TO THE Greek, music is a major part of the movie here and the filmmakers did not skimp out. They've gone through the trouble of giving Dewey Cox a wide selection of songs ranging from country to psychedelic and everything in between as Cox's style changes with the times. And they aren't just throwaway songs cobbled together without thought...most of the songs are actually pretty good, and nearly always funny. The crazy part: star John C. Reilly did all the vocals himself, proving not only that he should've been given leading man status a while ago (the man's easily funny enough to carry his own film) but he's got some musical talent (though I acknowledge it had to have benefited from some post-work). Reilly is great in this film and, while he's shown strength for dramatic roles, he really shines in comedy. He has a knack for the immature and goes wild as Cox struggles with the problems that come with his fame and fortune.<br/><br/>The film's got plenty of laughs. SNL alumni Tim Meadows provides some of the best moments as Dewey's drummer Sam, who acts as Dewey's gateway introduction into every manner of drug (""You don't want no part of this, Dewey!""). My favorite part of the film comes in the 60's when Dewey joins the Beatles (Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Justin Long, and Jason Schwartzman) in India for some meditation and LSD. I wish I could say the laughs were non-stop but the film suffers from some repetition that drags it down. Dewey's on-again/off-again relationship with the love of his life Darlene (the gorgeous Jenna Fischer) and his repeated trips to rehab begin to feel like a gag that won't quit and it makes the movie feel at least a half hour longer than it should be. It becomes even more apparent if you watch the admittedly self-indulgent director's cut. It all eventually boils down to a series of gags as Dewey experiences every major decade/fad in music. There's plenty to laugh at but I think the filmmakers tried to fit too much into one movie."
"Buddy-51","Null","0","0","20 July 2011"," reasonably entertaining parody
","""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" is a parody not only of ""Walk the Line"" and similar musical biopics – replete with the seemingly inevitable dead kid brother (see also ""Ray"") - but of musical styles and pop-culture trends as they have evolved over the past half-century.<br/><br/>The movie starts in the 1950s as a young backwater hick named Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly), an Elvis Presley-style crooner, takes the country by storm with his hit single ""Walk Hard."" From there it's on to fame as a Dylan-inspired protest singer, a turn as a disco-diva, and, finally, the wizened recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award in his 70s. And, along the way, of course, there are the inevitable bouts with drug addiction, the time spent in prison and rehab, a wife (""SNL""'s Kristen Wiig) left at home to raise the kids, a mistress (Jenna Fischer from ""The Office"") who's his one true-love and who stands by him no matter what, endless arguments with his managers and fellow band mates, groupies and orgies for the taking, furniture- and crockery-smashing tantrums, songwriter's block, stardom as a 1970's TV variety-show host – you name it, it's in here. There's even a hilarious encounter with the late-era Beatles, who seem well on their way to cutting each others' throats, let alone splitting up the band.<br/><br/>All of this is, of course, played for laughs. Written by Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan, and directed by Kasdan, ""Walk Hard"" is never more than passably entertaining, filled with as many jokes that fall flat as those that rise to the occasion. It's definitely not up there with the best of their work. Still, a 50/50 ratio isn't a particularly bad one as far as mainstream comedies go these days, and Reilly is so good as Dewey that he makes even the lesser moments more-or-less ignorable. There are also fun turns by Raymond J. Barry, Margo Martindale, Chris Parnell, Harold Ramis, Jane Lynch, and many others. Moreover, the music (by Michael Andrews) and singing (who knew you had it in you, Mr. Reilly?) are both terrific, and they alone are worth the price of admission."

","I've never been a fan of the gross-out comedies of Apatow and Kasdan. But I've admired John C. Reilly as a character actor ever since he was a small-town teenager in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE. And I'm a huge student of classic rock, having listened since the mid Seventies and also having read many books on the subject.<br/><br/>I thought WALK HARD might have a few cheap laughs about groupies and sex. What I discovered was that it is a triumph on every level. It is a comedy funnier than anything this side of THE BIG LEBOWSKI or YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. It is a country-boy makes good drama as moving and sincere as FORREST GUMP or SERGEANT YORK. And it provides an epic history of rock and roll from rockabilly to the disco era that really has no equal in any other film.<br/><br/>The cast of this movie is incredible. Not only is John C. Reilly performing on a Tom Hanks level as sincere, gifted, yet goofy Dewey Cox, he receives incredible support in every scene. Jenna Fischer plays the love of his life and she's every bit as stunning and compelling as Reese Witherspoon in WALK THE LINE (even though she looks more like Sarah Michelle Gellar.) Even the two little boys in the hilariously tragic ""prologue"" are believably innocent and carefree as they begin that tragic game of machete tag.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie goes far beyond the sex jokes, the blatant rip offs of rock decadence, and the imitations of famous scenes in WALK THE LINE and RAY. A lot of the humor is very subtle, like the ""serious"" way stars like Eddie Vedder pay tribute to Dewey's simplistic lyrics. ""When Dewey Cox said he wanted to walk hard, he made us think about how we wanted to walk."" In the same way, the Beatles impressions are funny, yet you really have to know rock history well to understand the Brian Wilson references as egocentric Dewey screams for ""50,000 djiridous"" to complete his unfinished symphony. The same with the Bob Dylan period. Dewey Cox handles reporters in a way both rebellious and shallow, which brilliantly skewers the self-importance of Dylan himself in DON'T LOOK BACK, and the phony reverence of unwatchable tributes like I'M NOT THERE. (""What do my parents think of my protest songs? What do your parents think of my protest songs, Mr. Time Magazine?"") But the most indescribable power of this movie comes from the fact that it is always character based. The machete accident at the beginning seems like a silly joke, but when a talking machete literally walks into Dewey's acid trip you can't help falling down with laughter, even as you recognize that something very profound is going on. The movie laughs at the basic premise of all biopics, that knowing a man's personal tragedy means you understand his work -- and yet they brilliantly weave that tragedy into all his work.<br/><br/>WALK HARD also mocks a lot of the feel-good premises of self-help therapy,that forgiveness is key and acceptance brings renewal. During the final montage, where Dewey sings ""It's A Beautiful Ride"" and reflects on all the happy and sad memories of his life, there's a couple of shocking images that are both screamingly funny and touchingly sad. When you see Elvis Presley pull a switchblade on Dewey, or his father shove a pistol in his face, you see how funny it is to expect a man to put a ""positive"" spin on his own life. Dewey has memories he's not ever going to share with his fans, but that doesn't mean the happiness in the song is fake. It just makes the whole story more complex, more lifelike, and yes, more funny than anyone would ever have dreamed! <br/><br/>WALK HARD is a one of a kind movie. I am not only going to buy the DVD, I want to buy the soundtrack too!"

","The wave of reverent, dramatic bio-pics of famous singers that has flourished over the last few years (""Ray,"" ""Walk the Line"" and others) gets a quirky skewering in this well-appointed lampoon. Reilly plays the title character, a young musician who is haunted (and blamed by his father) over the death of his promising and gifted brother. With the promise of success in the music world made clear after a successful local performance, he takes off (with his preteen girlfriend Wiig in tow) for a climb to the top. Naturally, it isn't long before all the clichés are trucked out including infidelity, drug abuse, discord with the band and so on. Various genres of music are explored as Reilly hits it big with rockabilly and then tries to continue to eke out a career in folk, psychedelia and even TV variety-level disco. Along the way, all conceivable incidents and situations happening with real life troubled artists arise in order to be parodied. Reilly, who plays his character from early teens on (a jab at those projects which expect audiences to buy middle aged stars playing their characters in youth!), is so committed to this characterization that it becomes realistic, despite all the silliness. Not only does he give his part all the passion, annoyance and stupidity that it requires, but he can also sing quite well and does so frequently! It's a rare starring showcase for him and he acquits himself admirably. Wiig, as his wife and the mother of (many of) his children, lends excellent support, though her character isn't particularly fleshed out or even interesting. Fischer fares better in a flashier role as a sultry female singer who joins with Reilly for a (hilariously entendre-filled) duet and ends up with his heart. Meadows has a role as one of Reilly's band-mates who introduces him to increasingly dangerous and addictive drugs despite protestations that he shouldn't be coming near the stuff. Sure to come off more amusingly to those who have seen real films of this type, it nonetheless stands alone, bolstered particularly by a raft of great original songs. It's shocking that none of the musical numbers from this film were able to land any Oscar nominations, especially in light of the utter garbage that seems to dominate the category each year. To go further, the numbers in this film are integrated into the film, not tacked on to the end credits in desperation for a nod, like a lot of others. Not as wild as, say, a Zucker Brothers parody, there's still a large amount of zaniness. One of the most outrageous sight gags includes Reilly talking on the phone to Wiig amidst the aftermath of an orgy as a frontally nude man stands next to him asking questions about where his belongings are! It's a taboo-breaking moment that may help get some squeamish folks past their body shame. Another enjoyable aspect is the wide variety of clothes, hairstyles and furnishings that denote the ever-changing eras of music. Several name actors pop up in cameos (some more successfully than others) including Paul Rudd and Jack Black as Lennon & McCartney, who take Reilly on an LSD-fueled ""trip."" Though the movie is not intended to be taken seriously, Reilly is solid enough with his character to at least allow a viewer to connect with the story while chuckling at the absurdities that pop up."

","Kasdan's 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' is a hysterical entertainer that spoofs biopics like 'Walk The Line' and 'Ray'.

I was only irritated by the scene where a crotch covered half the screen. That was pointless and not even the least bit amusing. But I was entertained by the loudness and over-the-topness of the movie. <br/><br/>It does a fine job of showing continuity in time. In a way it celebrates the era but also makes fun of it, like Adam McKay's splendid 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' (also produced by Apatow). The vivacious soundtrack contributes brilliantly to the atmosphere. <br/><br/>John C. Reilly is quite the excellent choice. The actor gets to display his comedic flair full throttle. It's hilarious how he mimics Joaquin Phoenix, Jaime King and Mick Jagger. Ditto for a sensual and barely recognizable Jenna Fischer who does a Reese Witherspoon as June Carter and adds her own flair to it and the Kristen Wiig who does a Kerry Washington as Della Bea. Moreover, cameos by Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Jason Schwartman, David Krumholtz, the hot Cheryl Ladd etc just add to the laugh riot. The camera-work and use of light is spot on.<br/><br/>'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' is a trip to non-stop laughing out loud with a few occasional interruptions but it also celebrates those movies to whom it pays tribute, the time, the glamour, the music and the changing culture. In a very subtle way, it also brings forth a few relevant issues, like how country music and jazz which were once nationally popular have become a select genre with a distinct fanbase and how many of the performers of this genre today have gained global fame by hopping onto pop and hiphop."

","This is an interesting comedy; it dips its feet into the waters of the most ridiculous, yet never really ceases to take itself seriously. Perhaps that's because the bio-pictures of which it is a spoof are themselves so insufferably self-serious. This one pokes fun at most of them, as far as I can tell. The hippy period of Bobby Darin is spoofed through a Dylan-esquire song by Cox, he shows up on acid at a kiddie party like Jim Morrison in ""The Doors"". But most of it is from the more recent duo, ""Walk the Line"" and ""Ray."" Unfortunately a lot of the spoof is pretty obvious -- he tears up some bathrooms in an excessive way, and he has a ""smell blind"" condition that troubles him. Also like Ray Charles he has a huge number of children, but this film actually shows them all.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly is the main element that holds the thing together and keeps it from being boring. He did a good job at conveying a rockabilly hard-ass and the character grew more appealing as he grew older. Still this is all in a formula outside of the one that the film is spoofing -- the increasingly obvious and by the numbers Judd Apatow sentimentalist approach, rapidly growing into John Hughesian territory.<br/><br/>The songs themselves are rarely funny in and of themselves, although that could be a plus -- like the famous ""Spinal Tap"", these are songs that you could *almost* imagine being real hits. I really laughed at the song about little people and Cox's advocacy for little person rights, so obviously an opportunistic ploy. Most of the songs could have been just a bit funnier though, and I wouldn't have minded. The film in general is more like to bring a smile or a chuckle than a good hearty laugh, so I would recommend it only with some reservations."

And such is the case with WALK HARD: THE DEWEY COX STORY.<br/><br/>With THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN and KNOCKED UP firmly under his belt (as well as PINEAPPLE EXPRESS and YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN), Apatow has shown he knows how to tickle the funny bone of young and old alike ...but mainly the young. Deciding to test the waters of music history, Apatow jumped headlong into the tempest and came out of it looking fairly unblemished.<br/><br/>The main thrust of the film's success is undoubtedly that it centers on America's musical past, dipping us into Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan (big time), Jim Morrison (watch out for the penis shots), Elvis Presley (love the hair), Tim McGraw (country?) and even Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.<br/><br/>The other big draw is its title character/actor Dewey Cox played by the oft-underused comedic actor John C. Reilly (TALLADEGA NIGHTS). Reilly plays second fiddle to no one this time, and holds firm his grasp on the character. Completely ridiculous lines roll off his tongue in effortless fashion (""The Siamese cat is a symbol of mobility in Ancient Egypt.""). He also is sometimes very physical in his comedy, running down the street in his underwear in true Jim Morrison fashion.<br/><br/>Other actors and actresses are fairly forgettable, however, with the notable exception being Sam (Tim Meadows, best known as a not-ready-for-prime-time-player on Saturday Night Live). Sam assists Dewey in his drug struggles, introducing him to the fairly benign (pot) to the deadly (Heroin). And watching Dewey go through withdrawals was hysterical from a medical standpoint (""I'm freezing!"" ""He needs more blankets."" ""I'm burning up!"" ""He needs less blankets."") <br/><br/>If you're an Apatow fan, you owe it to yourself to check out this musical farce. If you've been ho-hum on Apatow up until now, you still might want to check this one out."

","Normally we see Seth Rogen leading in the Apatow movies. Just recently he has broke onto the screen with Knocked Up and Pineapple Express. It is all well and good to see Rogen make a name for himself, but I found it to be a great decision to see John C. Reilly get a change to make a huge starring budget in this one. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story is a different approach in Apatow's film career. It may include drugs and sex like all of his other movies, but the main back drop is the life of a musician. With a different cast involved instead of the regular Apatow clan. You really find yourself laughing a lot during this movie, because you see Dewey Cox experiment with music through every single time period that a revolution of music happened. So if you are a fan of Judd Apatow and a person who does enjoy the work of John C. Reilly I would check this out."

","I didn't know what to expect when I first rented this DVD, but boy was I rewarded for effort. This was truly funny, and I found myself several times with head thrown back wheezing and hacking laughing so hard. It's a ridiculous sort of comedic quality that makes this movie work so you have to ""get"" that sort of humor to appreciate it. The part with Dewey Cox on the tour bus getting into a verbal altercation with his pet monkey nearly had me diving for oxygen. Although I loved this whole movie, I think they could have stopped at just showing the guys ass when he walked up to Dewey while on the phone. They didn't have to turn him around thus exposing his shriveled baby shrimp...a lil too much there, Apatow!"

","John C. Reilly plays Dewey Cox, a fictitious singer somewhat reminiscent of Johnny Cash, who takes the music world by storm from the 50's all the way to the present.<br/><br/>When Dewey was a child, he accidentally kills his other brother (in a pretty hilarious way), and his father never lets him live it down that he would rather have Dewey dead than his other son.<br/><br/>Years later, at a talent show (when he's only 14...yet it's Reilly playing Cox...so the humor is even more prevalent in the fact that a 40-something year old man is visibly playing a 14 year old), Cox steals the show, and also alienates himself from the older people in the community who think of his music as the ""devil's music."" So he goes off with his 12-year old girlfriend (Kristen Wiig, also visibly playing a 12-year old) and starts a music career. One year later he's a father and his now-wife is demanding he quit the music career. But he strikes it big with the song ""Walk Hard,"" which becomes a #1 hit and propels him to the international spotlight.<br/><br/>As the years go on and the hits keep coming, Cox is faced with turmoil (being introduced to drugs, problems with the wife, falling for his singing partner, the death of his mother), which leads him into a downward spiral to destruction...and ultimately restitution thanks to the help of the ghost of his dead brother who tells him what he needs to do to ultimately be happy.<br/><br/>Featuring Judd Apatow's all stars (Jonah Hill, Justin Long, Jason Schwartzman) in uncredited supporting roles, ""Walk Hard"" delivers in the comedic department as well as tells the faux biopic story of Dewey Cox in not just a comical...but somewhat dramatic...fashion."

","I think the movie contains a very different type of humor and that's maybe why people don't find it so funny, but I think it's a GREAT movie and very funny overall. The life of Dewey Cox touches you since we can all relate to situations in life that he lived through, the only difference is that he makes fun of those situations. There might be a few goofs in there, but every feature film has them, it's nothing huge to worry about.<br/><br/>Really good movie overall, good photography and I think they did a great job on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Great film, Dewey Cox is a great character."

","WALK HARD: THE DEWEY COX STORY 2007 April 8, 2008 1080p AVC Mpeg-4 Video / Dolby TrueHD Audio Directed by Jake Kasdan Starring: John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Tim Meadows, Chris Parnell List Price: $43.95<br/><br/>Reviewed by Ben Williams - Review Editor for Blu-ray.com 4/24/08<br/><br/>Synopsis <br/><br/>Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly) is your prototypical rock icon. He had a harsh childhood, suffered tragedy and overcame his checkered past to rise to prominence in the musical world. His story is cribbed right from the plot of Ray and Walk the Line and follows the same basic structure of those films - - to the letter.. <br/><br/>Video Quality<br/><br/>Walk Hard arrives on Blu-ray sporting a very nice 1080p transfer in the movie's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The movie will just about instantly leap off of your screen during the opening scenes in Springberry, Alabama. It's clear that this scene has been tweaked in post production to give it a colorful and idyllic feel. Fortunately, this is entirely consistent with the film's theatrical presentation and the entire film remains a faithful representation of the theatrical experience.<br/><br/>Audio Quality <br/><br/>I can't imagine that there would be any controversy over the audio section of Walk Hard. Presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround (48kHz/24-bit), the film sounds terrific. Additionally, Sony has provided a French TrueHD track as well as Dolby Digital tracks in both Spanish and Portuguese. The TrueHD track does a fantastic job of effectively portraying the film's many live concert sequences with abundant surround usage and crystal clear vocals. In a film where the joke is often-times the song itself, this is critical. If I can't understand what Dewey Cox is singing, then what's the point? Fortunately, this is never a problem and the sound does its part to move the story along. <br/><br/>Bonus Features<br/><br/>The folks at Sony have done an amazing job with the supplemental presentation of Walk Hard. This Blu-ray 2-disc set is completely loaded with extras. In addition to the huge list of supplements in this set, this Blu-ray release is also Blu-ray Live compatible. Those with the appropriate Blu-ray hardware will have access to an online portal featuring more deleted scenes, theatrical trailers and featurettes. <br/><br/>Tru-Blu? Walk Hard is absolutely worthy of your time and attention. This is a hysterical movie that belongs in the collection of any fan of well-written comedy. Walk Hard didn't do so well at the box-office, so there is clearly a segment of the population that isn't interested. I hope this Blu-ray release will present them with the opportunity to reconsider the film. Highly Recommended!"

","America loves Cox! In Columbia Pictures' new comedy Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, John C. Reilly stars as larger-than-life musician and songwriter Dewey Cox. Behind the music is the up-and-down-and-up-again story of a legend whose songs would change a nation. On his rock n' roll spiral, Cox sleeps with 411 women, marries three times, has 22 kids and 14 step kids, stars in his own '70s TV variety show, collects friends ranging from Elvis to the Beatles to a chimp, and gets addicted to -- and then kicks -- every drug known to man... but despite it all, Cox grows into a national icon and eventually earns the love of a good woman -- longtime backup singer Darlene (Jenna Fischer).

","I really enjoyed this movie. Dry wit, and some good one-liners. Simple but fun. The music was very good too which helped move the movie along without the felling of a dry patch in the running of the film. Happy day, I'd recommend it to anyone... but don't get me wrong, it's not Wedding Crashers or old school. I'm a bit glade Will Farrell didn't get this roll.. he would have been the obvious title role choice but it's good to see John C getting a lead in a comedy. He is good in this roll; he helps sets you up from the start, to come along for this dry humour laugh and a half. I always judge a movie by weather I'd go back and watch it again or when it comes out on TV, (this is especially true for comedies) this is one movie that I'd have no problem watching at least two or three times before I'd get sick of it."
"seawalker","6","0","0","20 January 2008"," Entertaining enough, but...
","Hmm... I must admit, I am a bit torn with regard to ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"".<br/><br/>The idea of this movie was fine. A parody biopic covering the career of singer Dewey Cox and detailing his struggles with fame, family and 'interesting substances'. As the film progresses you see his career develop through rock 'n' roll (psycho Elvis!), rockabilly, folk protest (a brilliant and incomprehensible Dylan impersonation), psychedelic pop (the best Brian Wilson/Beach Boys/""Smile"" mickey take of all time), cheesy family entertainment and the final unveiling of his musical masterpiece.<br/><br/>I liked the spot on musical parodies. I liked the surprising cameos from some very known faces playing musical icons (Elvis, Buddy Holly and the totally priceless meditating with the Beatles section). I liked the extremely game cast - Jenna Fishcher (Where has she been all my life? I don't suppose anybody has got her phone number, have they?), Tim Meadows (""You don't want to try this sh*t!"") and the grave and brilliant Raymond J. Barry (""The wrong son died!"") All good.<br/><br/>But, and it's a big but...<br/><br/>""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" just wasn't funny enough. Maybe if a more scatter shot approach had been applied a la ""Airplane"", ""Top Secret!"" or ""The Naked Gun"" (throw a hundred jokes at the screen and some of them will stick), the film might have been funnier? I don't know. As it was I would have to say that I came out thinking that ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" was entertaining enough, but was nothing I would be inclined to stay in to watch on TV again.<br/><br/>I got to thinking about John C. Reilly in the lead. He is a fine supporting actor, and a fine character actor, and he certainly tried hard, but he is not a leading man and especially not in a comedy. I came out of the cinema wondering what somebody like Will Ferrell might have done with the role and this is from not the greatest Will Ferrell fan in the world.<br/><br/>No fears, ""This Is Spinal Tap"". The greatest parody music flick of all time award still belongs to you."
"crazy_eddiek","9","0","0","20 January 2008"," ""Finchys a gag man, I'm more character based""
","Well it appears that Apatow can do both. Make no mistake this is a very gag based film, but there are plenty of laughs in there. The storyline gets pushed along and it does not gel together that well, but if you like stupid/silly/awkward gags then this should be right up your street.<br/><br/>For me comedy has to tick 2 boxes: quotability (basically how many scenes/lines/jokes are memorable) and longevity (how many times you would want to watch this) Whereas with a film like Anchorman you laugh more each time you watch it (due to the more character based humour and heavy ad lib) I don't think Dewey Cox will stand up to repeated viewings as well, although the one thing it has going for it in that respect is the songs.<br/><br/>I loved the scene where he is recording a new song and the backing band just come straight in with the words... there were a lot of little things which added together made this a very enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Yes people with a dryer sense of humour might not enjoy it so much and there isn't much to think about but for an evenings entertainment I can't rate it highly enough... so 9/10 then!"
"craigersk","9","0","0","13 January 2008"," Smart and Hilarious Slapstick comedy
","To be able to appreciate this movie you almost have to be a fan of slapstick comedy which in many ways has been a lost art form recently. If you're not a fan of the slapstick genre (i.e. Airplane, the Naked Gun series, etc.) then you will probably not enjoy this movie as much as someone that does. To be honest, I had my doubts regarding this movie. I was unsure what to expect and did not hear many favorable reviews, but I am very glad I watched it. This was a hilarious movie from start to finish. John C. Reilly was incredible in his portrayal of Dewey Cox and delivered a performance undoubtedly deserving of the Golden Globe nomination he received. Tim Meadows was also great in his supporting role.<br/><br/>Walk Hard delivers especially in its spoofs of the many eras of music from the 1950s to recent times. There are many over-the-top but very funny spoofs of Elvis, the Beatles, and Bob Dylan sprinkled throughout the plot. What makes the movie click is the fact that it does not take itself too seriously. It does not try to be anything else but a comedy. There are times when you may feel sympathy for the Dewey Cox character but usually it's done in a way that keeps its comedic integrity and avoids being a sappy moment. To appreciate the movie you also have to have a decent knowledge of history and the various time periods. If you don't understand how edgy and anti-establishment rock n roll was during the 1950s and early 60s,or know about the counterculture of the late 60s and early 1970s, you won't be in on many of the jokes which are era-specific.<br/><br/>This was a hilarious movie, unfortunately, it bombed in the box office. However, I bet it receives a cult following one day on DVD and may be Comedy Central similar to movies such as Office Space and Kingpin."

","I can understand how this film is a failure. It looks like a typical cookie cutter comedy in the same style of Talladega Nights, Anchorman and the new Will Ferrell basketball movie, but without the star power of Will Ferrell.<br/><br/>I had absolutely no desire to see this movie and was forced to sit through it.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is. There are gags, spoofs and a constant sarcastic dialog that has so much humor, you will miss it if you do not pay attention. Or you just might not get it. I feel for those people because they are missing out on a lot of laughter in life overall.<br/><br/>I would compare this movie more closely to Anchorman. The difference is that Will Ferrell is a walking joke with incredible star power and John C. Rilely is a bland hard to look at individual.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, John C. pulls this role off. He is great as the sidekick but there are very few roles that he can carry as a lead. For him, this is it and he does a good job.<br/><br/>The one thing that sets this film apart from many other similar comedies is the music and this is where John C. shines. Every song is almost a ripoff of similar song from a genre, but still great songs. The last time I have seen a comedy with great music that was 'original' and this good was the South Park movie, an often overlooked element to a very offensive movie. This element for Dewey Cox sets it apart from the Superbad's of the industry.<br/><br/>If you do not go see this soon, it will be on DVD shortly. This will be its time to shine and and people will be saying ""Wrong Kid Died"" and ""I'm Deweys 12 year old girlfriend"" around the water cooler at work."

"oneloveall","6","6","20","21 December 2007"," Another unique, but still generic niche piece benefits from musical context
","Although comedic ringleader Judd Apatow keeps inching further and further away from doing what he does best, opting instead to propel his line of talent into a brand name of sorts, he does show up now and again with some of the better gags (in a mostly underwhelming and self-conscious screenplay) throughout the rock-bio, high concept prank Walk Hard. Some of the music movie jabs may rub fans the wrong way for being a bit crude or distasteful, but for every third half-cooked rock clichÃ© parody the movie shamelessly exploits, one clever and unique joke rears it's head to keep seasoned comedy fans and music-heads interested.<br/><br/>In what might be quintessential ""friend of"" John C. Reilly's first headlining gig since his lead in Paul Thomas Anderson's relatively obscure debut Hard Eight, casting proves competent at least.

Kristen Wiig is funny as Dewey's wife who thinks he's not going to make it, even after he has had all of his success. Jenna Fischer is also hilarious.<br/><br/>John does all of his own singing which is good to see. My only gripe is that other characters that do sing (mainly Jenna Fischer's character) aren't using their real voices.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about the movie was all of the hilarious cameos. Frankie Muniz as Buddy Holly, Harold Ramis as a Rabbi in the music industry, Jane Lynch as a news reporter, and Jonah Hill shows up as well.<br/><br/>There is a hilarious running joke in the movie with Tim Meadows, John C.

","Walk Hard looked really funny from the trailers....it wasn't. With all the talented actors and writers working on this, it still wasn't very good.<br/><br/>Walk Hard follows the life of singer Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly). Reilly is a very talented guy, but he had nothing to work with. Even the jokes that could've possibly been funny were poorly executed and ruined. It's obvious that, since this is a parody of movies about musicians, might as well include every musician of each time period. The musician (or actors pretending to be musician) cameos mostly also fell flat, mainly because anytime a musician appears, the humor is based on exaggerated versions of the actual musicians, not jokes. Elvis was a ladies man jerk, Buddy Holly was young, the Beatles were hippie druggies. It's not funny making entire scenes pointing this out. The cameo actors got annoying sometimes too, but they were occasionally amusing. However, with the negatives, this was, at times, pretty funny. It was thoroughly entertaining, with very few lulls of boredom, though there were quite a few parts with no laughter.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an entertaining, thought not very funny movie.

He lives through the psychedelic 60's and the be happy 70's. It features some excellent song parodies. It has a a lot of sexual innuendo. It has ongoing drug references. Be warned, it also has nudity and male genitalia. It's definitely a funny movie, but no gut buster. Expect a steady smile throughout. Perhaps the most unexpected thing it offers is a series of cameos from other movie stars. It's worth seeing in the theater. It's worth buying, but not if you have young kids. It's worth renting.

I listened to an interview with Kasdan and Reilly and their love of the project was apparent.

I love Reilly and Apatow, but to me ""Walk Hard"" was a crass spoof on a number of decidedly unfunny events.<br/><br/>Most notably, I think that Apatow's ill-executed machete fight was a god-awfully tasteless way to address the tragic death of Cash's brother. We're not talking about Scary Movie (which spoofed fictional characters and events) or even real-life people who did themselves in with a drug overdose; Jack Cash was a real little boy who was pulled into a table saw while trying to help his father pay the mortgage, and he suffered in fully conscious agony for a week before he died. That haunting note you hear in Johnny's lyrics are the result of decades of nightmares, guilt and being made to believe he was a worthless child who had shattered the family. Jesus Christ...what would you sound like?<br/><br/>I'm not laughing. Are you? Or, maybe you think it might be funnier to be a blind, black, 15-year-old orphan in 1945, trying to put your life back together after the death of your mother.<br/><br/>If either of those things happened to most people in this day and age, they'd spend the rest of their lives eating themselves to diabetes, developing neuroses and whining that they were out of Xanax (again).Is it any wonder that Ray or Johnny developed serious drug addictions, or that they wrecked their lives and marriages with self-destructive behavior? These ""musical biopics"" exists for a reason; to teach us that anything can be overcome if you've got the will and motivation to do so. Personally, I find Walk Hard (while it does have it's moments) to be an incredibly insensitive and insulting example of humor gone wrong.<br/><br/>Hey...heard any good holocaust jokes lately?"
"kanegrundar","2","2","6","11 May 2008"," This movie sucks!
","I like Apatow's other works, but this movie was so uninteresting, I almost didn't even finish watching it. I do realize that it was a parody of other musicians' biopics (think ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line"") but seriously I could have taken those two movies and combined plots, thrown in a few mildly humorous moments and sold it to Hollywood. Apatow and Kasdan did nothing special here. There was nothing original about this movie. I felt like I was watching a crappy amalgamation of two great movies that I had already seen--""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line""-- which depicted the actual stories of two actual musicians, both of which are far more interesting than the fictional Dewey Cox. If you're looking for a great musician biopic watch ""Ray"" or ""Walk the Line"". If you're looking for a great Apatow comedy, try ""Knocked Up"" or ""Superbad"". Or ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". Or ""Anchorman"". There are so many better choices than this movie."

","The beginning of the movie was a great hit.. we laughed until we cried. The movie would have been just as funny w/ out the porn.. Why does all movies have to show naked people? I mean, get real. Do people think they have to put that in there to get people to watch their movie? Well, we got up and walked out. We didn't come to see porn. So, I'm very disappointed! My husband and I w/ our friends wanted to just go have a good laugh, how embarrassing that was to all be sitting there when a penis pops up on stage unexpected. For a long time. Not to mention the usual boobs and sexual body movements.Get real people. It would of been a very great movie, but I left disgusted!"

","I really enjoyed this movie...lots of sexual innuendo (more than I care for) but that is what Apatow is known for in his movies. It's too bad because it (along with the terrible Beatles impersonations) cheapen the spot on parody of musician biopics. Reilly is great although he doesn't make for a convincing 14 year old but that is probably the point! He's a great singer and while I don't think I'll be buying the soundtrack, they had a very talented group of songwriters crafting the tunes that propel Dewey Cox to the top of pop stardom. The film is unevenly paced with an emphasis on his early years and then little attention given to his actual music career once he becomes popular. A little too much of the focus on his drug addiction but maybe that is part of the parody factor as well. This is one of those movies that is good but could have been SO much better with some additional scenes to illustrate how his career developed instead of solely on his personal life.<br/><br/>I recommend this film but it's important not to have inflated expectations. It's got some really hilarious bits but don't expect it to be over-the-top funny."

","I can't believe it took ten years for me to finally see Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. Was it worth the wait? Probably not. This has Judd Apatow's fingerprints all over it, having co-written the script and served as producer. Long story short....overall it's awfully silly. I was hoping for a little bit more substance or bite, but that isn't to say it's awful. Walk Hard has some very funny moments, and that would include the Beatles segment which I found quite amusing. I'll admit quite a bit of the music was actually pretty good, including the duets with Darlene (Jenna Fischer). On the other hand, the grand finale number was a big flop in my book, and did we really need all those scenes with Dewey in his underwear? Fans of Judd Apatow's ""sensibility"" may like this more than I did."
"jboothmillard","7","1","2","14 April 2013"," Walk Hard: the Dewey Cox Story
","I knew this film was a film about the music industry, and I knew the leading actor, but that it is really, it sounded like a biography kind of film, maybe with some laughs in it, but I was pleasantly surprised when I watched and found out it was both. Basically singer Dewey Cox (Golden Globe nominated John C. Reilly) since childhood has no sense of smell, this is due to the trauma of accidentally cutting his brother Nate with a machete, and since then his father Pa Cox (Raymond J. Barry) constantly tells him ""the wrong son died"", but one day sent out by his mother Ma Cox (Margo Martindale) he finds something to aspire to. Meeting an Old Bluesman (David 'Honeyboy' Edwards) he plays a guitar and is a natural, and he wants to be a professional singer, at fourteen years old he gets his first break with a controversial song outside of Springberry, and he meets twelve year old girlfriend Edith (Kristen Wiig). The couple soon marry and have a baby together, she criticises Dewey that he will not achieve his dream to make it big, but he gets his chance when replacing singer Bobby Shad (Craig Robinson) at the last minute on stage, and he meets Hasidic Jewish record executives who want him to join them. He records a rockabilly version of ""That's Amore"", but one of them brands him talentless, but he has a brainwave when having a conversation with Edith, and he writes and performs his own song ""Walk Hard"", and it quickly becomes a big hit, and he enjoys the newfound rock and roll lifestyle. Dewey does also get introduced to marijuana by drummer Sam (Tim Meadows), and every time we see him with a new drug that he says he ""doesn't want to be part of"", he takes it, and through his excessive drug taking his attitude changes, and he is unfaithful to his wife, and worse comes when his Pa tells him that his Ma has died, and he gets him to believe it was his fault. He still has his personal demons to battle with, including cocaine consumption, and tries changing music styles, but then he meets backup singer Darlene Madison (Jenna Fischer), and together they make songs that become big hits, and in the process that become attracted to each other, and still married to Edith the new couple marry, of course this makes women leave him. Dewey ends up arrested for the purchase of drugs from an undercover cop, serves his time in jail, and goes through rehabilitation, and reformed at the beginning of the 1960's he starts making protest songs for campaigns such as the discrimination of dwarfs, and his new style is compared to Bob Dylan, he angrily denies his. Visiting India Dewey and his band take LSD with The Beatles - John Lennon (Paul Rudd), Paul McCartney (Jack Black), Ringo Starr (Jason Schwartzman) and George Harrison (Justin Long), which causes Dewey to experience a Yellow Submarine style hallucination, and he becomes obsessed with creating a music masterpiece, and the others despise his consistent abusive behaviour, so they break up, and Darlene leaves him again. He goes through rehab again, and there he is visited by the ghost of his brother Older Nate (Jonah Hill) who tells him to stop pitying himself and write songs again, and in the 1970's hosting a variety show, and doesn't get on with writing any songs, but Nate returns to tell him he needs to tell Pa he loves him. Pa and him look like they are reconciling, but it turns into a fight with machetes, and his father ends up cutting himself in half, but he forgives his son before he dies, and the death causes a breakdown, but when he gets over it he knows he must spend time with his numerous children. In 1992 Darlene returns to Dewey, and realising the importance of family rather than musical success he suddenly gains back his sense of smell, and moving to the year 2007 he has gained a new fan base with ""Walk Hard"" being sampled by a rapper, he is at first upset by this, but he is made with receiving a lifetime achievement award, and he finally fulfils his dream of a masterpiece song, ""Beautiful Ride"", apparently Dewey died three minutes after performing it. Also starring Harold Ramis as L'Chaim, Chris Parnell as Theo, Jack White as Elvis Presley, David Krumholtz as Schwartzberg, Frankie Muniz as Buddy Holly, The Hangover's Ed Helms as Stage Manager and Jane Lynch as Gail the Television Reporter. Reilly gives a really funny performance as the up and down and up again singer in numerous genres, mostly country, folk and rock, but he also proves he can actually sing and belts out some catchy tunes, the supporting cast members mock the stereotypical characters well also. This was obviously made after the last few years bringing out well received and awarded music based biopic films, such as Ray and Walk the Line, so this both celebrates and mocks those true life based stories, with some jokey songs and a well-crafted script mocking typical dialogue and moments in those dramas, a really funny and enjoyable musical comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for the title song, also nominated the Grammy for Best Song Written for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Very good!"
"Quebec_Dragon","5","1","2","23 May 2009"," Liked the concept and singing but the humor mostly didn't work
","Here's something you don't see every day: a parody of a music biopic, well in this case most of the recent ones but mostly Walk the Line depicting Johnny Cash. I found the lead's performance was quite good and was impressed at his singing ability (pretty sure the actor sings everything). I also liked his evolution through different time periods. However, the humor mostly fell flat for me and the running gags weren't even particularly funny. For example: the names of the famous celebrities he invariably encounters being repeated over and over. What did work better were the sexual innuendo jokes, especially the duet. Most of the best jokes are in the trailer that makes the movie look much better than it actually is. I think big American music fans from the fifties up to the eighties would get a lot more from Dewey Cox with all the references and inside jokes. The extras on the second disc are unbelievably good and funnier than most of the original movie. It almost made me think the movie deserved a better review and rating than I gave it. <br/><br/>Rating: 5.5 out of 10"
"rdorjewangden","4","1","2","23 November 2008"," Not funny
","This was the fourth movie, I've seen of Apatow and I didn't find even one of these jokes funny. The other movies I saw were Anchorman, The 40 year old virgin and Superbad. I know there are people, who think these movies are funny and they are able to laugh. For me watching these movies was a waste of time. Don't get me wrong, I like good movies and a good joke makes me giggle(there is no way to suppress it). The idea of making a parody on biopic, like in this case Walk the line seems to be a good idea. The question is how you do it. Definitely not like Apatow did it. The repeating of ""cut in a half with a machete jokes"" or ""the wrong son died lines"" don't make them funnier. Same for the drug jokes. They are not funny (maybe you have to smoke some weed to find them funny). As I watched it on DVD I had the ""pleasure"" to watch the extras, like ""Walk Hard-The real Dewey Cox"". Okay they got Sheryl Crow and other people in front of a camera to say things about the ""real"" Dewey. This whole thing is as funny as the movie and if you can laugh at lines like ""I love Cox"" (get it?), you're probably 15 years old and will have fun with this production. If not you better go watch a funny comedy."
"halvorse","4","1","2","1 August 2008"," Stale casting.
","So. Walk Hard. Not detestably unfunny, but fidget-inducingly slow. I was straining my ears the entire time for Anchorman quality humor but never really got what I was hoping for. It seems like this movie was really just a formality--a rite of passage, if you will. It didn't need to be a huge block-buster as long as John C. Reilly got a chance to prove he can sell tickets without the extra boost from WF. Hopefully there will be a return to form in their upcoming buddy comedies now that Reilly's proved himself a worthy, independent member of the ""Frat Pack.""<br/><br/>The thing that bothered me most about this movie was actually the casting... Judd Apatow really needs to broaden his horizons. Not that EVERYONE ever to appear on ""The Office,"" ""The 40 Year Old Virgin,"" or newbies from SNL aren't talented people, it just gets rather tiresome to keep seeing them all together working on the same projects. Codependence = stupid."

","Saw this last night on DVD for the first time, and I was in stitches. Maybe because I work in the music business some of the really ""in"" stuff hit home. Here are the parts I liked best;<br/><br/>1. The Blues scene, where Dewey busts off an authentic blues riff first time out on cutting his brother in half.<br/><br/>2. The way Dewey talks to rock stars, always being sure to use their full names and titles, as if he's helping out the audience. Jack Black as McCartney is classic.<br/><br/>3. When we are introduced to a ""fourteen year old"" Dewey, who looks an awful to like a 50 year old Dewey, although his band mates are teens. It's another example, like the cars in the Midget scene, where there is no attempt made to make flashbacks authentic.<br/><br/>4. The Brian Wilson ""goat session"". He had the Wilson beard, man-dress and the over-the-top production of the ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Smile"" sessions.<br/><br/>Many more, but in short, this is stands beside ""Spinal Tap"" as a scathing and hysterical look at the world of rock and roll."
"Ozzy2000","10","1","2","6 July 2008"," great satire of the ""Walk the line"" film
","I have just seen a really great comedy in which the whole cinema was belly laughing. This obvious satire of ""Walk the Line"" and themes of sex drugs and rock and roll stories in general is extremely funny and raunchy. This is the Dewey Cox story who is played by John C. Reilly. Reilly's performance gave me flashbacks of his role in Boogie Nights as an aspiring 80's Rock Star but this was a rich leading role.<br/><br/>I think its helpful to see ""walk the line"" but not altogether necessary as the ""rags to riches"" cliché rock star story has been put together very thoughtfully. I do not want to spoil this film with a detailed synopsis. There heaps of graphic drug and sex scenes so be warned. Dewy Cox befriends ""The Beatles"" , Elvis and very Music Icons along the way to the top. The Jewish humour incorporated into this film is great and there are guest appearances by Jack Black, Jason Schwartzman, Jewel, Lyle Lovett and heaps of other recognisable faces.<br/><br/>This film is must to see and you will probably watch it again on DVD.<br/><br/>I guarantee you will enjoy this film unless your anal retentive."

","I hate it when anyone on TV calls this movie a ""Bomb"" every time its mentioned. I think it gives people the impression that this movie was bad and thats why it didn't do so well at the box office. However, its just the opposite. I laughed my ass off throughout the whole movie and couldn't stop quoting it. Maybe it's because I got the music references easily and had knowledge of what was being made fun of. A group of teenagers actually got up and left the theater 20 minutes into it, I guess they were too absorbed in the shitty music of Hannah Montana and fall out boy to get the jokes. Anyone who knows anything about the roots of rock and roll will find this movie hilarious, I did! Fuc* all of you who hated it. I'd love to see what you think is funny."

","If you are in the mood for some bawdy, irreverent laughs, then watch Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, a spoof on Walk the Line, Ray and other literal rockstar slice-of-life clichés (pardon the pun; you'll get what I mean ;o)).<br/><br/>Shocking scenes arise as expected from co-writer Judd Apatow (40 year old virgin, Superbad, Knocked Up), and are tremendously funny especially in the beginning. As the movie progresses, however, some hilarity wanes, but impressive are the prosthetic make-up appendages everyone sports as the movie spans from the time Cox is 6 until he is 71 years old. <br/><br/>It's good that Oscar nominee John C. Reilly (Chicago, Talladega Nights) finally gets to headline a movie, after seemingly forever portraying the reliable sidekick or supporting character in his many, many movies.<br/><br/>From playing a mousy receptionist in the TV sitcom The Office and the mousy sister in Blades of Glory, Jenna Fischer turns in a surprisingly sexy and laugh-out-loud performance as Cox's back-up singer and second wife Darlene. Her comic timing is great and amply supports Reilly's antics because she plays her role so straightly. As an aside, she looks like Buffy's Sarah Michelle Gellar with all the makeup.<br/><br/>Nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Cox's anthemic 'Walk Hard', the melodic hooks of the rest of the songs are memorable, but the lyrics, suggestive or otherwise, prove the real riot. Also welcome are the cameos from Eddie Vedder, Jack White, Jack Black, The Temptations, Jewel, Lyle Lovett, comics Chris Parnell, Kristin Wiig, and bit parts for Jonah Hill, Frankie Muniz, Jason Schwartzman, Justin Long, Paul Rudd and others."

","I loved this film and laughed all the way through. My wife liked it, too, but she's so sick of me talking about it that she has forbidden me to mention it any more. So I'm writing this tribute here. <br/><br/>Silly jokes based on a deep knowledge of the history of pop music and thorough research into the musician biopic format. Silly songs with great tunes written by skilled professionals who nail their targets perfectly. And nudity just for the sake of nudity (Judd Apatow admitted as much in an interview). This film breaks no new ground--it wasn't meant to--it's a hilarious story told using a language taken from many earlier films--both funny and serious. And it succeeds admirably. The jokes are even funnier if you started listening to music and watching films in the 50's--there were many times when only the older people in the audience were laughing. Other IMDb reviewers disparage the repetitive jokes--I thought they were well executed.<br/><br/>After listening to the CD hundreds of times in my car (darn, I wish I could sing as well as John C. Reilly) I was overjoyed to learn there's an extended sound track on iTunes with twice as many songs, but missing the David Bowie Starman song on the original CD. Some of these songs didn't make it into the theatrical release but are still great.<br/><br/>I'm totally hooked on ""Beautiful Ride,"" the song Dewey sings in his triumphant last concert at the end of the film. Even though it has a lot of silly lyrics like the rest of the songs, I found it very moving and staged perfectly by director Jake Kasdan. And as in every other song John C. Reilly recorded for this project, his big voice really shines, Here's some of the lyrics for that song:<br/><br/>'Cause when all is said and done. When youth is spent and burned. You'll see what it's all about: Music! Flowers! Babies! Sharing the good times! Traveling not just for business! Accepting your mortality! This is finally what I've learned! <br/><br/>Thank you, Mr. Kasdan, for a great and continuing experience. I can't wait to see how you expand your comedic epic when you make my DVD!"

There are gratuitous shots that are disgusting and have absolutely no humor. (What's so funny about fully panned penis shots? It's completely unfunny and unnecessary.) I can understand that they are trying to parody movies like ""Walk the Line"". But there's a difference between ""Airplane"", ""The Naked Gun"", ""Hot Shots"", and this garbage--""Walk Hard"" is a story humorous only to the people that wrote it, and fails to connect to the audience. The aforementioned parodies that have become classics lampoon not only the movies they spoof, but the lives and pop cultures we live with. ""Walk Hard"" tries, but with no creativity whatsoever. The humor is cheapened by the second.<br/><br/>I was so irritated with this movie, I sold the DVD to a friend for $0.25. Not a good movie at all."
"MartinHafer","7","1","3","12 October 2008"," Very funny but also unnecessarily crude
","I loved John C. Reilly in TALLADEGA NIGHTS, so it isn't surprising that I'd give this film a look. Overall, it's a real mixed bag--with some hilarious comedy, excellent singing by Reilly but also an amazing amount of completely unnecessary crudity that would prevent me from strongly recommending the film. With only a bit of editing, this film could easily have been rated PG-13 and been a good film for teens as well as adults.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes of the film are probably the best, as you see a young Dewey Cox and his brother playing together. You just have to see it to believe it--especially the dreaded ""machete incident"". It was obvious that this was NOT a movie that was meant to be taken very seriously. I also loved soon after that when they showed 40-something Reilly as a 14 year-old. It was really stupid and confusing---and I liked these ridiculous aspects of the film. What follows is a decades long saga involving Cox--one of the dumbest, most selfish and self-destructive singers in history. During this journey, the Cox character incorporates bits and pieces of many rock-n-roll lives--with obvious nods to Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Brian Wilson and many, many others. I particularly liked the sequence where Cox hung out with the Beatles in India--the dialog was really goofy.<br/><br/>However, despite laughing repeatedly, the film also suffered from occasional lulls but especially from crudeness. Three separate times the film showed a closeup shot of a penis. There really wasn't any reason for this. It wasn't funny and it seemed to be included gratuitously. Additionally, several sex scenes were rather explicit as well. Had the nudity been excised, it wouldn't have noticeably harmed the picture and made it more accessible to teens--who should be a large audience for the film--especially since it does have a decent anti-drug message most of the time (showing what an idiot Cox became each time he used). As a result, I strongly recommend that parents act like adults and not let their kids see this movie. Even for a rated R film, it's amazingly graphic."

The thing that makes this movie far superior to other recent spoof movies is that it does have serious parts in it and also an excellent music track which is performed by the leading man. Other spoof movies are just stupid, this movie is intelligent. Some movies you watch once and that's enough for a lifetime, this movie is for collecting and watching again and again.

","The idea was spoofing many singers' bio-pics and lives, especially after a string of musical bio-pics within a few years earlier like Beyond the Sea (2004), Ray (2004), and Walk the Line (2005). Well, it sounds tempting. And I have to admit; the trailer got me. But regrettably, it was ugly. So abysmally ugly!<br/><br/>First of all, John C. Reilly, who's a very good actor, looks incredibly ugly, if not scary, as the title character. There was a love scene for him that I suffered from, and couldn't even understand, where he was totally unfunny, and with slow pace, no music, and low-angle--turned into killer horror! Throughout the whole movie, he does nothing laughable, and seems really cheap. By the way, don't try to search for anyone else. Save Reilly, the rest are cameos.<br/><br/>Comedy means smartness. A rule that this movie never heard of. Therefore its writers chose the ultimate easy solution; which is filth, disappointing every attempt to write a good situation or dialogue, resorting - instead - to absolute dirtiness that any mean adolescent could create, and while immersing into it, the whole movie turned into mean adolescent itself!<br/><br/>Actually, the script is jammed with many kinds of filth. Filthy jokes, filthy images, and even filthy meanings. For instance, the matter of addicting different drugs along the years exceeded being a running gag, to be some sort of drugs' glorification, as if no genius or success can be reached without them. This is not a parody inasmuch as publicity!<br/><br/>I really got fed up with movies that have nearly nothing but swearing, nudity, and drugs, while presenting themselves as comedies. These are crimes more than fun. ""Rated R for sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language"" will transform movies into hard porn, if hasn't done that already! It's clear that Hollywood in the last decades drives us to obtain entertainment from sewers, addressing dreadfully an animalistic side in us.<br/><br/>So as a comedy, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story didn't make me laugh. It did make me abhor. And as a comedy from Hollywood lately, it's another monster disguised as a pet. It's not a movie for me. It's a repulsive toilet, where nobody cared to flush once, to make an audience of repulsive toilets as well. The thing is, if I wanted something else, it's no where to be seen. Because big percentage of Hollywood comedies nowadays became trashy, or frank trash. And anyone with an atom of brain, or sensitivity, must flee to the old comedies, where intelligence, respect, and human were still part of the mix. For me, their worst is better than those saddening contemporary comedies."

Apart from the offensiveness particularly the stereotyping of Jews running the music industry, there are some worthy laughs. John C. Reilly can sing and work solo without his buddy Will Ferrell. I love watching him play the dim-witted musician without a sense of smell. Of course, I was offended by his brother's accidental death. He was cut in half during machete fight between young Dewey and his brother. His brother was the favored son. Dewey's mother is played by the wonderful Margo Martindale who also meets a strange demise while listening to her son's song on the radio. It's good to see Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell as his band mates who introduces him to drugs, alcohol, and sex. Christine Wiig plays his first wife.

","I can't exactly remember why I bought this DVD many months ago. I think I may have been taken in by the trailer or noticed that this was the product of the same man behind ""Superbad"", Judd Apatow. I do remember thinking how good it was that one of the most overlooked men in Hollywood, John C Reilly, finally had the lead in his own movie. Sadly, there was one thing I had forgotten. What exactly is the point in watching a movie spoofing the likes of ""Walk The Line"" if you haven't yet seen ""Walk The Line""? However I suspect that even if I had, it would only have been slightly funnier. It felt too bizarre and contrite to be properly funny, despite Reilly's cracking performance.<br/><br/>Reilly plays music legend Dewey Cox whose songs strike a chord with America in the early days of rock and roll. Cast out by his disapproving father (Raymond J Barry), Dewey finds himself on the road touring with his band and succumbing to a variety of temptations - drink, drugs and women all lead Dewey away from success on a road to Hell whilst his accidental murder of his brother Nate (Chip Hormess) continues to pray on Dewey's fragile state of mind. But through it all, his on-off relationship with backing singer Darlene (Jenna Fischer) is Dewey's best hope of tasting success once again.<br/><br/>Reilly pretty much saves this movie from being a complete wash-out. He is loving every minute of ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"", stretching each cliché to breaking point and gaining maximum comic potential from each scene. Sadly, the film's humour is far too scatter-gun in nature to be consistently funny - a few scenes raise a faint titter but by and large, this was pretty disappointing. Most rock & roll stories are, by their very nature, excessive so no matter what lunacy happens on screen (pet giraffes, shooting acid with the Beatles, 22 kids and 14 step-kids and more besides), it's simply too ludicrous to be funny. Reilly is also pretty much on his own among the cast as well - Jack Black and Paul Rudd's cameos as Lennon & McCartney were genuinely funny as was Tim Meadows as Dewey's drug pushing band-mate Sam but everyone else overacts or is pretty unmemorable. Speaking of cameos, there are a wealth of famous faces in there but none of them are funny (other than those I've mentioned) and the last time I checked, this was supposed to be a comedy.<br/><br/>I'm almost annoyed that ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" is such a waste of promising material and talent. It never seems to get beyond first gear, trundling along and minding its own business while this viewer waited for the mercifully short duration to go by. I did want to enjoy this but I simply couldn't - it's not funny enough and like other dreadful ""spoofs"" being released lately (""Dance Flick"" and the like), it feels too niche to appeal to most viewers. Perhaps if you've seen ""Walk The Line"" or ""Ray"" then maybe you'll see the funny side but if, like me, you haven't then I recommend looking elsewhere for a good old giggle."
"Antagonisten","6","1","4","24 March 2008"," It could have been better
","Honestly i have very little patience with spoofs like this one. The kind of movie that is both a spoof and serious at the same time. Sure it's a spoof of movies like ""Walk The Line"", and at the same time it's not all comedy, but rather adapts the same sort of style as serious movies, but with scenes of comedy thrown in. I thought it worked better in ""Walk Hard"" than it usually does, but it's far from perfect.<br/><br/>Starting with the good i can say that i always enjoy John C. Reilly. His comical timing and ability to stay serious while doing hilarious things is just great. Letting him be the star rather than the sidekick (like he usually is) is not a bad idea. Undoubtedly he has the talent to pull it off. The second good thing is that there are some scenes in this movie that are hilarious. Especially the scenes where Reillys band-member played by Tim Meadows tries to talk him out of using drugs (usually by saying how good they make you feel). Also a few of the songs are really great, good enough to be taken seriously in their own right.<br/><br/>The major problem i had with this movie really is the sort of episode-like structure. This is not so strange considering it's something the movie inherited from Walk The Line. It starts out when Reilly's character is little, and then shows a bunch of scenes from his career. The problem is that those scenes are far too uneven in quality. Some of them are quite good (like the scene with The Beetles), while other scenes are just boring and lackluster (mostly the childhood-scenes). In some instances the movie feels more like a line of sketches rather than a complete movie.<br/><br/>In the end i think it's a very thin line to walk for a movie like this one. Finding the balance between comedy, music, and serious scenes is difficult. Sometimes this is almost pure slapstick, other times it's almost as serious as Walk The Line. I enjoyed this movie, but i can't help feeling it could have been done better. John C. Reilly frankly deserves better. I rate this 6/10."

(BTW, to posters who mentioned how awful the casting was for The Beatles, THAT WAS THE POINT!!!!) Jake and Judd obviously have watched a lot of VH1's ""Behind the Music"" episodes.

And though I have seen some ""juvenile"" flicks that are funny, I did not find one thing funny, or even clever, about this movie. The jokes were forced, the dialogue seemed something out of a Ma and Pa Kettle movie, and every single stereotype came across as not funny at all.

Not to be a prude, but the heavy handed crudeness serves to mar the excellent work of John C. Reilly.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan need to go back and watch the Farrelly Brothers catalog. There is an art to mixing tasteless humor, political incorrectness, and making it all acceptable and hilarious. They aren't in that special spot where one overlooks the crudeness-which seems forced not funny. Reaching that ""spot"" can be like tap dancing around land mines, remaining funny to the extreme and tasteful enough that crudeness it isn't an issue, I see this as the ""acid test"" that separates the brilliant from the hack. While Apatow and Kasdan are certainly way past the hack stage they can still indulge themselves too much and fall glaringly flat on their face. It helps, as displayed here, there are moments of great sly humor mixed in-Yet it doesn't, overall, end up totally redeeming the faux pas committed.<br/><br/>I wish I could have absolutely recommended this without reservations. John C. Reilly really is up to the task and turns in a good performance in spite of the writing/directing lapses. I just keep wishing this could have been a Farrelly or a Leiner,Hurwitz, and Schlossberg (Harold-Kumar) project. They would have been able to keep the low-brow humor from being too pervasive."

My guess is Will Ferrell was too busy (I doubt he was too discriminating to walk away from the paycheque) so they made a Will Ferrell movie with his sidekick. In some respects I feel fortunate, however. By the time the final scene rolls around and they're splicing in retrospective clips during his farewell performance, it's clear they shot a million miles of film, and only the ''best'' stuff made it into the main narrative, while even more cringe-inducing bilge hit the cutting-room floor.

"estreet-eva","5","0","1","21 February 2018"," Frat boy humor in a high-concept package
","Some interesting decisions here from Judd Apatow and company. They start with just the essential choice to parody a modestly well-know music biography - ""Walk the Line"" which had come out only 2 years prior. Unlike ""Spaceballs"", the Mel Brooks parody of perhaps the most famous films of all time and one rife for satire likely the vast majority of film-goers won't even catch most of the allusions to Johnny Cash's story such as the death of his brother who haunted him his whole life. Also, Cash's name continues to carry artistic cache unlike a John Denver or even Elvis Presley so some viewers may have found themselves offended by the send-up of Cash's life story. Another interesting choice involves using a script made up of only jokes until the final 10-15 minutes of run-time when the film becomes very sentimental finishing on an incongrously uplifting final performance of a legitimate tune. The strategy seemed to be to launch one joke after another with the idea that enough will land to make the overall experience funny. While there is some sophisticated humor (Dewey's first wife played by Kristen Wiig promises to support his muscial career no matter what before nearly instantly trying to get a legitimate job for him in a slaughterhouse even after he has become wildly sucessful), for the most part - including the actual name of the film - it is a long series of racial, scatalogical, and genital jokes. There are many Python-esque absurdist moments as well particularly focused on fourth-wall breaking (much is made of John C. Reily playing Dewey at 14, 19, and 21). In short, probrably more of a party movie for groups enjoying some inerbriates."

","Is this a drama, parody, comedy or just plain silly? It's been a while since I wanted to write a review on a movie. I saw part of the R-rated version in one of the premium channels last month and so I watched it again this week from start/finish to really get the essence of what the movie is about.<br/><br/>Great to say that John C. Reilly, although he is mostly known for his goofy comedies (and usually teamed up with Will Ferrell), is a wonderful singer and musician. It is refreshing to see someone who can really play the guitar in the movie. Really folks, I watched his fingers and it shows that he really knows the guitar chords. That made the movie so real for me.<br/><br/>All the songs are terrific. The changes in the style of songs Dewey Cox sang as he goes through his journey conformed very well to the changes with the times. Kudos to the music composers.<br/><br/>And unfortunately, that is where it ends. Where the music delivered, the drama/comedy/parody plot destroyed it. It is anyone's guess to really understand what the writers were trying to do with this movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the movie would have been better off with more drama and mystery like ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" than the too much silly encounters with the celebrities. The writers tried so hard to copy the fictional character/celebrity encounter from ""Forrest Gump"" and failed miserably at it.<br/><br/>Also, the sub-plot to Dewey Cox's childhood that created his demons was so unrealistic. A simple plot there would've allowed the audience to capture the emotion and empathize better with Dewey's risqué and volatile behavior, much like the emotion he showed for the love of his family at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>There is one sub-plot that I thought was properly done: Dewey's exposure to the different paraphernalia and drugs through the years. That was a masterful stroke and funny because the audience can relate to it.<br/><br/>All in all, I did like the movie due to John C. Reilly's great acting and singing.

","I don't ask for much from a comedy. If it makes me laugh, I'm happy. This movie did not. There's a point about an hour and twenty minutes into the movie (in the Extended Cut) where the stage manager asks if Cox will be reminiscing for much longer, to which Cox's drummer replies something like, ""He's only up to the seventies yet."" I felt like Michael Corleone: ""Just when I thought I was out they pull me back in"". Nevertheless, I stuck it out to the bitter end and had a couple of chuckles along the way. However, a handful of chuckles isn't nearly enough to sustain this two hour 'comedy'.<br/><br/>On the surface, ""Walk Hard"" seems promising. The script was co-written by Judd Apatow (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"") and John C. Reilly stars in the title role. Unfortunately the film proved to be as hilarious as a swift kick in the gonads. My main problem with the humour is that it's incredibly stupid, obvious and repetitious. How many times do I need to see Dewey rip a sink off the wall? How many times do I need to hear his father say, ""The wrong son died""? It certainly doesn't help that the vast majority of the jokes are just plain unfunny. Cox accidentally chops his brother in half with machete? He goes 'smell blind'? Believe me, I could go on and on. Even if you're wise to all or most of the movie/music references the laughs are still few and far between.<br/><br/>The cast has some notable & semi-notable names but when even John C. Reilly doesn't deliver a solid performance you know you're in trouble. To be fair, though, I don't think that this film is a good fit for his talents. Also disappointing is Jenna Fischer and just about everyone else for that matter. The short Beatles segment (only mildly funny despite several in-jokes) is worth mentioning because it includes Jack Black providing the worst Paul McCartney you're ever likely to see.<br/><br/>The best thing that I can say about the movie (besides that it eventually ends) is that it looks pretty close to the movies it apes. The music, on the other hand, is hit and miss. The title song is completely forgettable though there are a few notable tunes, such as the innocuous 'Devil music' ballad ""Take My Hand"" and the politically flammable ""(Mama) You Got to Love Your Negro Man"".<br/><br/>In the end, I can't possibly recommend this movie unless your only alternative is to spend the time watching paint dry. Walk Hard? This movie crawls."

By the time the movie was half-way through I was already hoping for it to end soon. And by the time the final 15 minutes or so have arrived, this movie was pretty much terrible by todays comedy standards. Judd Apatow was only loosely affiliated with this project, so I won't bash him too much, but this movie is absolute garbage compared to things like ""Knocked Up"", and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"".

","From the wiseass mind that brought you Knocked Up, Balls of Fury, and the 40-Year-Old Virgin comes this parody biopic that's mostly based on the recent Johnny cash movie Walk the Line. With a whimsical, winning performance by John C. Reilly, Judd Apatow's mock tribute to hard and fast livin' rockers is a knowing smackdown (albeit gently) of the tried-and-true, rags-to-riches Horatio Alger story. Hey, they mock because they love.<br/><br/>Dewey Cox (Reilly) grows up in the Deep South, and owing to a family tragedy (not unlike Cash's, only much, much funnier), finds himself with a paw who doesn't believe in him (and, uh, no brother). So off to cut a record with his bandmates, played by Chris Parnell, Tim Meadows, and Matt Besser. (Meadows' character in particular is a hoot, always getting hooked on the next big drug). And then get married and father five or so kids. And then fall in love with a backup singer named Darlene (Jenna Fischer, who's a complete doppleganger for Amy Adams, I swear), who he naturally marries. While still married to the first one. And so on.<br/><br/>He even meets Elvis (poorly impersonated by Jack White of the White Stripes), The Big Bopper, and even Buddy Holly (an improbable Frankie Muniz). Oh, and he goes to India to rap with the Maharishi along with the Beatles, who are played by four recognizable names - but they're so unrecognizable that they need to refer to each other (along with Dewey) by their full names. (Seriously. The impressions are so bad that they sound like they were written by someone who'd merely heard mention of the Fab Four at some point and never read anything about them.) There's plenty of drug references and some nudity, but what I like most are the running jokes. As with the Cash flick, Dewey destroys a sink when he gets upset. Okay, make that six sinks. And he steps in as a last-minute replacement for an established act - in an all-black exotic club. Imagine a good ol' boy on a stage, cracking wise to rowdy black folk, and then he steps right into a race-laced tune! Reilly himself sings a lot of the songs (he even co-wrote some of them), and the man has some singing chops (remember Chicago?). He really has to, in order for the film to work at all. Sure, it's a comedy, but a movie about a bad musician isn't entertaining - kind of like a movie about a bad comedian. Such a movie would be funny in parts, but whenever the performer was on the stage, you'd just cringe and hope for the best. So Reilly, as Dewey, has to be spot on, and he is.<br/><br/>Despite a slowish first half, this is what you'd call an agreeable waste of time. The closing musical sequence (it's set at an all-star tribute to Dewey) is a real knockout - as it should be. It's reminiscent of the 35th Anniversary special staged to honor Bob Dylan back in the 90s, with various acts covering Cox's best (Jewel, Eddie Vedder, Jackson Browne, and Ghostface Killah all appear). But the final number, a solo by Cox, is a real heart - and show - stopper, and this more than makes up for the sluggish (even by the numbers, as far as parodies go) start."

That being said I don't think the film is a complete waste of time as there were some funny moments but no belly laughs that I have enjoyed with his other work. The film is overly long (okay I accept I was watching the extended version but that's only an extra 25 mins whilst I felt it could have lost around 40-45) and some of the jokes are repeated a bit too often such as the drug taking scenes (once was funny) which eventually I could predict happening. Some other reviewers have slated the way the music icons appearing such as Elvis and Buddy Holly constantly referred to themselves by name in the third person with one reviewer going so far as to say he knows who they are and doesn't need to be constantly reminded. This guy is missing the joke! The celebrities playing these people are so unlike their characters that it's necessary for them to remind us and its a knowing wink to the audience. The ""cameo"" by the Beatles is also highly amusing. This could have been a lot better but I think the combination of too many pointless characters given a large chunk of screen time (Deweys band and Darleen spring to mind) and the long run time, which seemed to mean lots of padding, lets this film down.

This is all done well with Reilly giving the title character a sense of child like wonder well in to his adult years. The spoof is handled well and with an admirable sense of subtlety that the makers of other American spoofs would do well to notice (and I suppose you would expect some screen craft to have passed down if you are the director from the Kasdan family).

Don't even start with 'Date Movie', its the most un-funniest thing you'll ever see in your TV screen. And the other film was just plain crap. I'm starting to think Uwe Boll is a better director than these two bloodsucking bottom feeders.<br/><br/>So anyway, this one was co-written by Judd Apatow, one of Hollywood's awesomest directors, and the actors are mostly from the Apatow gang so I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>While it is not the greatest of Apatow's films, it sure succeeds in parodying 'Walk the Line' and it is hilarious as hell. The script, though sometimes a bit absurd and just plain crazy, was very well written. Its what you get from the world's greatest director in the comedy circuit.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly portrayed music legend Dewey Cox like Will Ferrell would have portrayed it. The dialogues uttered by Dewey Cox were so Will Ferrell-ish. I am starting to think Will Ferrell would have been a better Dewey Cox. Don't get me wrong, John C. Reilly was awesome but Will Ferrell, I think was a better choice.<br/><br/>The funniest scene would probably be the Beatles cameo in India. Jack Black is awfully funny as Paul McCartney, Paul Rudd was spot-on as John Lennon, Jason Schwartzman was hilarious as Ringo Starr and Justin Long was pitch perfect as George Harrison.<br/><br/>Watch it.

","John C. Reilly does a credible job as a rock singer in this film.<br/><br/>This movie is really a take-off on the problems of the 1950s musical singers of the Elvis Presley genre. We see a young marriage falling apart, drug abuse, rising to fame too quickly.<br/><br/>Denny is never forgiven by his father due to the tragic death of his younger brother. In addition, the way that it is showed how the mother died some years after that tragedy was rather silly. Falling out of a window with a radio landing on top of her was pretty unbelievable.<br/><br/>Reilly, who sang his way to an Oscar nomination in ""Chicago,"" does sing well here again.<br/><br/>The movie is a good one as it shows the importance of family."

","Even when I wasn't laughing out loud, I was smiling during this movie. It is the most original spoof I've ever seen (I realize that is an oxymoron, but true nevertheless). Real talent went into the making of this movie. John C. Reilly was fabulous as the lead and the supporting characters didn't miss a beat. Whatever you do, don't dismiss the Special Features disc. It is as funny or funnier than the movie. Start with the things you'd usually watch but then watch the things that usually bore you. The Real Dewey Cox and The Making of Dewey Cox was very entertaining. All the deleted scenes were funny except for one. The two discs provide an entire evening of enjoyment."

","Jake Kasdan directs and helps Judd Apalow team up on this funny and irreverent story of the troubled life of fictional music legend Dewey Cox(John C. Reilly). Everybody loves Cox. Dewey was forced from home at the age of 14 after cutting his bother in half with a machete. He immediately has a wife Edith(Kristen Wiig)and houseful of kids. His songs shake the nation. Instant fame comes from his first hit ""Walk Hard"". He knocks out hit after hit. Along the way rubbing elbows with the likes of Elvis Presley(Jack White), Buddy Holly(Frankie Muniz)and the Beatles. His career has its ups and downs, but his faithful fans still adore him as he changes styles as the music trends come and go. This musical icon isn't shy of duplicitous marriages, realizing finally that his heart belongs to his back up singer Darlene(Jenna Fischer). Dewey will become a bigger than life superstar even as his hits struggle on the charts. He of course has taken every drug in the rock 'n' roll world and survived. And when he thinks of settling down, he reminds everyone that he has always 'walked hard'.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, the quirky soundtrack is enjoyable. Highlights are Dewey Cox(Reilly)singing: ""Take My Hand"", ""(Mama)You Got To Love Your Negro Man"", ""Guilty As Charged"", ""Darling"" and of course the title tune.<br/><br/>Other cast members: Tim Meadows, Nat Faxon, Raymond J. Barry, Harold Ramis, Margo Martindale, Jackson Browne, Lyle Lovett and Jack Black as Paul McCartney."
"jaybob","7","0","1","10 April 2008"," mild thumbs up--could have been better
","This film contrary to both the overly positive & negative reviews is neither that good nor bad.<br/><br/>This is a satiric,comedic,yet dramatic spoof of the rock music industry.<br/><br/>The music is great, There just was not enough of it. John C.Reilly gives a very energetic portrayal of Dewey Cox a fictional combo of many singers of the last 40 years,The writers have used every cliché we associate with biographies,to almost real good effect.<br/><br/>My praise is tempered because they resort to near slapstick & physical humour, which I never have cared for.<br/><br/>As I said above, the music & songs are first rate & John C.Reilly has a pleasant enough voice to do them justice.<br/><br/>The production credits are first rate & the acting by a large cast with good imitations of some of the greats in the music Industry<br/><br/>This is not a film for the youngsters due to the drug taking by many.<br/><br/>My rating is a mild thumbs up I wish it were a rave notice though.<br/><br/>Ratings: *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 7) IMDb 7 (out of 10)"

","to be honest i don't really lol - laugh out loud much at comedy's although I'm always viewing them but this film made an exception. i haven't seen walk the line on witch it was based but oh my god was this a hilarious film. especially the Beatles scene ""shut up Paul you big fat ****"" was just brilliant and i applaud the running joke of wrecking sinks, it got old but was really funny. other than the laughs the film has great songs, in fact i have only just ordered the soundtrack and brilliant cameos from jack black, Justin long, Paul Rudd, Jason swartzman and jack white. in total, i loved the film, and its given all my mates a hell of a lot of new quotes to throw about. so go see it."
"rjr443","8","0","2","1 January 2008"," The story of a singer's life and hard times, played for laughs.
","The show has a number of mild to moderate laughs--not enough to be rated hilarious by any means, but enough to keep me smiling through most of it. On the basis of the rather predictable script only, I'd rate it as about a 6, but the script isn't the chief charm of this movie. It's the strong and subtle performance of John C. Reilly, one of those anonymous character actors whose name you never remember but whose face you recognize instantly. Another actor might have been tempted to take the farcical elements of the script and run with them, playing the role manically from top to bottom. Reilly is talented enough to seek out the quieter moments and build his character around them. This gave the film's wilder moments more credibility than if he had played the role full bore. It's on the basis of the performances--his and the ensemble's--that I rated it as an 8."
