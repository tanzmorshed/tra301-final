","I have to say, the most sensible reviews are those that doesn't say ""10/10"". It wasn't easy to rate it, I had to think long and hard about this one before I could give it a seemingly justified mark.<br/><br/>Sadly, ""Bird Box"" is nothing revolutionary in neither the horror genre & the apocalyptical movie isle. It has a great cast, a truly great performance by Sandra Bullock, real good looking, big-budget-all-over cinematography, visual FX, shooting locations, action, makeup, etc., etc. Many aspects of a masterful filmmaking are on a high enough level - my only complaint on this matter is that there wasn't enough horror in this horror movie. A few moments of gore, mayhem and suspense fits the genre, but overall I'd describe ""Bird Box"" as an r-rated apocalyptical adventure movie that could easily have a lot of teenagers in it's audience. I'm seeing a lot comparisons with the recent ""A Quiet Place"" among the reviews, yet I'd like to try and avoid comparing these two, but, to all those who compare them, I say - ""A Quiet Place"" was a better horror movie (emphasis on ""horror"").<br/><br/>So why only 6/10, you wonder? Let me tell you why: the plot. It is so lousy in so many ways. Note that I have not read the book, but if the story there is as unpolished as here, I will definitely never read it. ""Bird Box"" leaves the viewer with a lot of questions and plot points that doesn't make much sense. What are the entities? There are no origins, no explanation for how and why it struck the earth, it's shown as extremely powerful yet, for whatever reason, it can't enter any buildings etc. From the start of the movie to the end there is no development whatsoever regarding the reasons for the apocalypse and the process of it. Why are some people not killing themselves when exposed to the entities but are killing others? Well, I guess because they needed someone to kill the protagonists, when the entities couldn't.. There is never an explanation, not even a subtle hint. The entities can make you hear voices of close people, dead people, yet, 5 years into the apocalypse, it still comes as a surprise to the main charachters, what a climax, eh? In the end, after the long journey, our main character finds the place she was looking for - a school for the blind. In the middle of a rainforest. Very plausible indeed. Also, who calls their children girl and boy for 5 years, only to deliver the scene at the end where she names them after the two now dead charachters. I guess they had to wait until the father dies, otherwise there wouldn't be the sentimental reason to name the son after the father. Also, the character development is pretty predictable throughout the movie & the 2nd half gradually becomes more... generic.<br/><br/>It might sound like I'm thrashing the movie, but, mind you, 6/10 is a good mark & I enjoyed this movie for its high entertainment value, but the depth here is shallow & the setting is an unpolished excuse for a story of a charachter's survival which brings almost nothing new to the cinematic history. An underwhelming yet entertaining thriller that will successfully reach a big audience for its too mainstream to be called anything other than a popcorn horror."
"Marc_Action","5","625","865","28 December 2018"," Not Understanding All The Hype
","The movie was OK. Definitely better than the Happening, and that's not saying much, but the Bird Box certainly did not live up to the hype.<br/><br/>In a post-apocalyptic world where a supernatural entity is making people kill themselves once they see ""it"", Sandra Bullock's character must make it through the forest to a safe haven with two young children in tow, all while blindfolded - so she won't see ""it"". That's the premise and it's not too plausible. Walking through a dense forest blindfolded? Yeah, right. Hell, some people wouldn't be able to halfway walk through the woods without tripping over a log with full sight, yet we're expected to believe she can navigate blindfolded just fine with two children in tow?<br/><br/>Anyway, we do get to see how Bullock's character got to this point via flashbacks, and quite frankly, those are the better parts of this movie. I think the best scene in Bird Box was when the initial survivors at the house in the city ran out of food and had to make a trip to the grocery store. Without giving away any details, this sequence is one of the few bright spots in terms of originality that you will see in this film.<br/><br/>Besides that, we just see survivors surviving and then getting killed off and not much else. If you're looking for: who, what, why, or how? Good luck, you won't find ""it"" here. Otherwise, decent cinematography and acting by Sandra Bullock, John Malkovich, Trevante Rhodes, and the little girl are the only things holding this movie together. It's worth a look. 5 stars."

","I have no complaints about the acting, production or story until it just ends. Far to many Sci-fi movies ending this way these days. I've even seen directors comments on these endings saying we wanted to leave it up to your imagination....

","I really can't stand loose ends. So many questions unanswered. Firstly, what everyone else has noted. What were the entities? Where did they come from and what did they want? Why some people could survive without a blindfold? What really bugged me, is how did they manage to change houses, blindfolded. How did they survive? What did they eat for 5 years? Electricity and water supply? Still working? Why did they give birth at the same time? What happened to the couple that stole the car? Did they make it? Did they crash? Show something!!!!
The movie did keep me watching, but once it ended, I was left with too many questions."
"danieltaller","3","859","1305","23 December 2018"," A 15 minute short film agonizingly stretched into full length.
","There are some fantastic short films out there that most mainstream viewers are never exposed to. That is what this should have been.<br/><br/>Instead, we are treated to a 15-minute story of content, stretched with filler of melodrama, useless over the top characters, and Sandra Bullock's very tired overacting like she's rehearsing in the shower.<br/><br/>This would have made a great short; instead it is bloated and just plain annoying.<br/><br/>Oh... and the end of the film - without spoiling it - there's not much to spoil. No answers are forthcoming, only that there's a temporary at best escape. It's called being in a small holed up community that's destined to eventually collapse. Not much of a happy ending.

"suppoost","5","564","868","29 December 2018"," Why?
","Why. Why. Why. Why. Just why?<br/><br/>Why do people find this film scary? I read on Twitter that people could not sleep for days after seeing this. Yah.<br/><br/>Why is there no explanation about the creatures or phenomenon, what they are, what are their intentions, origin? Or even ONE dialogue where people theorize about the situation?<br/><br/>Why can't the creatures or phenomemon enter houses while they are seemingly so powerfull? They can effectively dismantle society, forcing people to commit suïcide but you can not enter a building? Why is this even remotely believable?<br/><br/>Why are there infected people not comitting suïcide but, however, why are they malevolent to the uninfected?<br/><br/>Why use a genious actor such as John Malkovich and let him blatantly die in such a dull, anticlimactic and useless way? While he looks much bigger and stronger than Gary?<br/><br/>Why did John Malkovich even agree to that?<br/><br/>Why the arbitrary 5 years? Why not 3, 2, 1, 7, 10?<br/><br/>Why do they look exactly the same after 5 years?<br/><br/>Why do you only have the same pump action shotgun after 5 years and not at least a bit more arsenal? And even if you only kept the pump action shotgun, how did you upkeep and maintain an ammo supply for the rifle? While blindfolded?<br/><br/>Why is not shown how they eat, sleep, live, these 5 years? Only some arbitrary shots in a garden and a bed time story given by Tom.<br/><br/>Why is the overall situation outside not, or barely shown?<br/><br/>Why does the group which is roaming around outside have two identical grey cars? Why are they roaming around at all? Clearly they can look. So they can do whatever they want? Why bother going after harmless blindfolded people? And if this task is so important to them or the creatures controlling them, why is this not explained? Or even shown?<br/><br/>Why is Tom able to shoot and kill multiple targets while blindfolded while his enemies can all see clearly? He should have been dead in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>Why do Malorie and Olympia give birth at the same day and at the exact same moment?? REALLY?!<br/><br/>Why has the choice been made to make flashbacks the whole time, effectively altering the pace?<br/><br/>Why does Malorie while she lost Girl, crawling in the wet mud while blindfolded is able to find the little bell Girl dropped? Do you know how small these odds are? Really? Who writes this stuff? The official 9/11 report is even more believable.<br/><br/>Why are there no injuries AT ALL after the boat capsizes in a clearly lethal rapid where there are sharp rocks, currents pulling you under water and so forth?<br/><br/>Why do these little birds survive all these years, being mangled in this tiny box?<br/><br/>Why is there no character development at all? All the characters introduced by the film die rapidly. You don't get to know them and get even remotely emotionally attached to them, what's the point of having them in the first place?<br/><br/>Why is there no symbolic explanation for all the events occurring? Not even a religious one?<br/><br/>Why are there no other animals? Like cats, dogs and so forth. There is merely one useless shot of a horse.<br/><br/>Why is nothing really shocking? Jessica is hit by a truck. Malkovich dying instantly cause of two hits with a scissors not even close to his heart or lungs. Sure. Cheryl dying of sticking a scissors in the side of her neck twice. Olympia making a fall out of the window, and that's.... about it. Tom shooting himself in the head and the director cuts it off, too lazy to show it. If Stanley Kubrick can do it with Private Pyle in Full Metal Jacket, why not here? It is supposed to be a horror film, right?<br/><br/>Why are people, in the first place, even able to navigate with blindfolds on? Really? Finding a resort in a huge forest while blindfolded only by following bird sounds. REALLY? People should watch Blair Witch Project again.<br/><br/>Why is the bottom line of this plot that blind people and birds will survive? People should go and see Blindness again. Now THAT is a shocking film. Not this crap here. People should go and watch Coherence.<br/><br/>I can go on but I won't. 5/10 because I am a kind person. The film made me watch it through untill the end because the music and sound design was great, the cinematography was great and I kept hoping for some kind of symbolism or at least some clue about what the heck was going on. Maybe I am getting to old for this stuff, like Bullock."

","I didn't read the book before I watched the movie and I saw lot's of people on Facebook saying they had questions after they watched the movie but those who read the book said that not everything from the book could've been included into the movie. I've started reading the book and I'm only two chapters in and can see that this is true. I loved the movie but I'm already loving the book more. So judging by those who gave this movie scathing review, I'd say they didn't read the book and if they did and still didn't get the movie, that's sad on their part. If they didn't read the book, give that a try. I bet it'll change their perspective."

Without any answers, there still could have been scary or shocking moments, action, character development.<br/><br/>The problem is this movie is just pointless. There are no interesting characters, there are no scary or shocking moments, there is limited and dumb action, no character development, nothing. I'ts really just 2 hours of nothing.<br/><br/>I have seen reviews here before watching, but I thought there is so much hype, it can't be that bad. IT IS. I mean should this be a horror movie? Drama? Sc-Fi? I just couldn't tell, becuase it is none of those. It's just a bad movie.<br/><br/>To anyone with a little sense for the genre or movies in general, just don't waste 2 hours of your valuable time.<br/><br/>Also, I don't care that it's based on a book.

"MickeyTheConstant","3","249","403","28 December 2018"," Don't Believe The Hype
","After reading numerous, positive reviews, the wife and I tuned into this one, eager to see what the hype was all about. We were expecting something really scary and suspenseful but were very disappointed. To me it seemed like a rip off, of the vastly superior 'A Quiet Place'. In that movie we were really rooting for the family involved but in Bird Box I didn't really care. I normally like Bullock but in this movie I found her really unlikable and felt sorry for the two kids and others stuck with her. She shouts, winges and gives everyone pretty much a hard time. There is a point in the movie when the ever reliable John Malkovich is holding a gun or something and I just want him to actually finish most of those with him off and let the apocalypse take its course. They are all in his house moaning at him and the wife was very much 'it's his house and he let you in to save you so stop giving him grief or do one'. I had to agree with her. I really do like an apocalyptic movie but there are so many better movies out there that offer more scares and suspense. Worth a watch but don't expect too much originality or satisfaction at the end of it."
"parkerrodney","5","371","614","22 December 2018"," Full of Cliches, a variation of an old and tired theme, but watchable
","Bird Box
Bird Box is a suspense-drama with a touch of supernatural horror, however, the format is simple and full of the usual clichés. In this case a group of individuals are holding out in a house trying to ride out an invisible evil threat that is making people all over the world, violently kill themselves for no apparent reason. The movie is shot in flashback format where the main character, Molly, played by Sandra Bullock, is on the final leg of a trip where she is attempting to escape with two children. She is taking them by row boat down a river. During this trip she reflects on the sequence of events which got her to this point.<br/><br/>There is nothing new about this movie, as it embraces the usual clichés of searching for provisions, dealing with conflicts within the group, and watching fellow group members die, sometimes in a somewhat slapstick horror comedic sort of way. We've seen this so many times it's almost insulting to point it out. I bring it up because I consider this to be the first fatal flaw of the movie, lack of originality.<br/><br/>Matters only get worse as the movie is packed with the usual stereotypical supporting characters such as the gay guy, the obnoxious white guy, and the comedic chubby black guy. Also, there is the low esteem overweight and pregnant young white women, the old lady, and the black male protector who carries out his duties faithfully, but who also has an intimacy agenda as it relates to Bullock. These characters are what I would call disposable stereotyped characters because they're all temporary props, easily replaced vessels which carry the movie along to each subsequent bland cinematic destination. We know that for them, the future is as bleak as their lines and that each one will die at the prescribed time. This type of casting is insulting and easily reveals the shallowness of the script. These 2 additional fatal flaws ensure an anti-climactic end, because we have known since the opening of the film, that Bullock will live, and all we're doing at this point is watching to see how everyone else dies and if the ending gives us a sigh of relief knowing that we didn't waste our time watching it.<br/><br/>After an hour into the movie, it's five years later, we still have no idea as to the origin and the nature of the threat, and the group is whittled down to Bullock, two children and the protector, who is now her love interest (mission accomplished). They are just barely making it, when they receive an invitation for safe harbor at a compound. The climax comes however, when their safe house is invaded by the infected, and the protector lays down his life (as anticipated) allowing Bullock to flee down the river blindfolded heading to the compound.<br/><br/>The use of the supernatural bogey man of unknown origin and purpose is the ultimate fatal flaw because It no longer works. People can relate to fear, but supernatural fear which is randomly killing people for no apparent reason are not compelling plots anymore. Although there is a twist at the end, the twist does not make up for the structural flaws. Those flaws are self-inflicted by lazy and unimaginative script writing.<br/><br/>If we search for redeeming qualities of this film, it is the fact that it is well shot. It's not a cheesy B rated movie, and it has a few popular name actors who deliver quality performances. The scenes where Bullock must scold or caution her children are compelling and quite good, delivering the desired emotion one could relate to.<br/><br/>If you have insomnia, or nothing better to do, of if you're a Bullock fan, check it out. I stumbled across this and kind of wish I hadn't."

","The whole movie is a spoiler in itself. You know who will die and how they will die, if you've ever watched any b-rated movies in the 90's. All characters are empty stereotypes and there are too many holes in the story to not be noticed. I am surprised how none of the people had ever heard of blind people before in their lives. One of the characters gasps ""we're not going to survive if we can't see!"" and all of them have trouble navigating without sight but yet REFUSE to use a blind stick for navigating... apparently they don't exist in this world.
What does exist are invisible gyms and protein bars seeing as the handsome black fella (the pretty boy in the club who naturally gets to ""boink"" the pretty girl in the club and is- you know, the one who is not funny because he's pretty and therefore must be heroic) seeing as his muscle tone is equally pumped up after 5 years of no training in a world where food is scears..

","Bird Box has a fun concept and huge star (Sandra Bullock) that combined to make this one of the most streaming Netflix movies ever. It's memeable though not exactly memorable. In a year, how clearly will you remember the plot and the ending? How well do you remember it right now?<br/><br/>The movie is fine for a night of mindless entertainment. That's about it.<br/><br/>It features a problematic storytelling technique. The flashbacks remove some of what would have been the most suspenseful moments of the film. Instead of wondering what will happen and who will survive, viewers connect a few simple dots and figure out the answer. Suspense gone.<br/><br/>Many moments lean too heavily into the blood and violent imagery for effect. These tactics work to an extent, but they elicit cheap reactions. They are not earned, and they are not lasting.<br/><br/>Upon some reflection after watching, I found myself wondering, ""what is this movie about?"" A woman unsure if she can learn to love her child? I suppose, but what does the end of the world have to do with her plight? I couldn't find a clear answer."
"IMDbro","1","54","84","4 January 2019"," Obvious identity politics makes this boring and predictable
","SPOILERS! Things I learned watching this film: white men are toxic and therefore must be portrayed as huge jerks (Douglas) or completely evil (Gary). The only white man who is portrayed as good is blind. Men of color, however, are inherently good...Greg, who is gay and of Asian descent, sacrifices himself on the chance that they could use cameras to see what's going on outside. Charlie and Tom (both African-American) are allowed to express their masculinity and sacrifice themselves to save others. Malorie, the main character, is introduced as tough and pregnant with no man in the picture (because, you see, men are unnecessary). The other pregnant character loves her late husband and misses him, so of course she dies while Malorie makes it to the safe place with both children. The subliminal connection that you're supposed to make is that loving and depending on a man is weakness.<br/><br/>There is no inherent problem in choosing minority or LGBT actors for virtuous roles and white men for vicious or immoral roles. It's just that it's SO PREDICTABLE as to what's going to happen in the film. The second they let Gary in the house I KNEW he was evil. Why, you may ask? Because he's white, and he didn't mention anything about being gay.<br/><br/>To Sandra, Susanne, et al: making every aspect of your film bow to social justice undertones made your film extremely boring and predictable. For a film that relies on suspense to keep viewers interested, this is a major handicap. Why can't there be any surprises? Why must we see the twists a mile away? Your identity politics comes before your art, and the art suffers for it."

","Bird Box was an unknown entity to me, one of those films from Netflix I just slapped on to end the evening.

Well it's like that, except it actually has a great story, competent cast, great cinematography and incredible payoff. Okay scratch that it's nothing like The Happening.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a pregnant woman trying to survive during a global incident which is causing people to show erratic, psychotic and suicidal behavior.<br/><br/>It's a fantastically crafted little horror starring Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich, two veterans who aren't exactly known for that genre.

","For a world which has become so sight-orientated there are times when the sense of dread you feel whilst watching Bird Box is almost incapacitating.<br/><br/>Much has been said about how this is a 'blind' version of 'A Quiet Place' - it is most definitely not. The source material 'Bird Box' written by Josh Malerman was published in 2014. In many ways this film is all the more terrifying because of society's reliance on seeing the world around them. As you watch and come to understand (although not fully) the mechanics of the horror that is the basis of this post apocalyptic tale you find yourself wondering what would you do in a world where your eyes are your greatest weakness?<br/><br/>Yes, perhaps more could have been done to fill out the concepts of family, parenthood, and connecting. With a run-time of just under 2 hours the film does enough and manages to intertwine these themes with the base horror and makes you care enough to take the journey through the fear with Sandra Bullock's Malorie and the rest of the cast who perform admirably. The way the film is split over different time periods is not a clever gimmick as has been the case with so much output over the last few years. It simply layers on another level of dread as the film proceeds towards it's conclusion.<br/><br/>As is fitting a film who's protagonists are reliant on a life without vision, it is not full of bombastic CGI action sequences and instead wraps itself in a sense of horror that I found both terrifying and refreshing.<br/><br/>This is an excellent film in a theater or at home, with a story that will touch at a core vulnerability that makes many of us uncomfortable. Yet as the 280 million+ people around the world who are classed as having 'low-vision' or 'blind' already know' - if you have the will there is life to be had, sighted or not."

Sandra Bullock. Sensitive, emotional, strong, dedicated. Lead material. Leads. Not for the best.

The plot is 'artistically' spotted with segments from the past that are supposed to add drama and depth to the plot. It doesn't.
The movie can be watched from virtually any point without losing anything of value, which is actually quite an achievement.
Also, you can cut and crop the movie any way you want and put it together like in the books with alternative endings and still have exactly the same narrative.
All in all, if you can't sleep and really need to kill some 2 hours, it's alright.

","This movie is perfectly well acted and well produced in almost every aspect. It portrays the theme of blindness surprisingly subtle and more realistic then most movies. It doesn't have the ""I iron my pancakes""-flatness that is often found within the genre. So why do so many people still hate it?<br/><br/>--- :
It makes too many, too valid points that are pro-empathy. Wich is unusual for a most horror movies. A large subdivision of the horror crowd really hates that.
It provides near impenetrable reasons, that egoistic ""preserve-myself-and-my-family-and-defend-against-parasites"" behavior falls short in front of the multitude a threats that require different kinds of ""evolutionary fitness"". Even in an apocalyptic situation.
A movie arguing so well, that a live worth living, doesn't only include empathy as a core value, but actually REQUIRES it for the survival, makes them feel guilty. So they dismiss it.
After all, believing that ""helping"" is ""something weak and stupid people do, to preserve themselves"" is how they manage to live with themselves. When they're faced with a valid point of how altruism is a successful way of survival, they run out of ""weak"" or ""soft"" people to blame. So they get spiteful."

","If this were the first film of it's kind, it would still be unoriginal. The unseen monster is not a new idea in story telling, nor is having no ultimate meaning or purposeful intent. There are no spoilers here, that's the conceit. We can retitle this ""Don't look Mrs. Lot"".<br/><br/>Let's consider the qualities of the films makeup:<br/><br/>1. cinematography is adequate, like the work of a cameraman who has made films for television with limited resources. The multitudes of closeups and quick edits obscure the lack of uninteresting scenes, a trick borrowed from low budget television. I think the TV series ""Lost"" had better photography.<br/><br/>2. The sound is actually high fidelity. That said, it plays with the same intensity as it did in the last ten thousand horror films. It acts as a cover for dead scenes and pablum dialogue. In short, unoriginal.<br/><br/>3. The acting, which has been hailed as fantastic, is true hack work. Bullock and Malkovich could have phoned it in. Hack: ""A cheap, mediocre, or second-rate practitioner, especially in the fields of literature and the arts"". I would have preferred unknowns with potential, than reprisals of every character these two have played before. It must have taken them minutes to prepare for their roles.<br/><br/>4. The worst part is the story, dialogue and screenplay. Josh Malerman's book wasn't even that good to start with. The ""Bird Box"" was a first novel by a rock musician. Go figure. As I've said, the premise is unoriginal, the characters are thinly drawn, and the dialogue is just lubrication for a rusty script. ""Hold on, hold on,. . . hold on . . . jump please . . . jump . . . over here girls, "" You get the picture.<br/><br/>Overall, the comparisons to M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" are apt. It's equally drawn out and unsatisfying in the end. There is no there there. . .<br/><br/>Comparisons to ""The Quiet Place"" are unfair. The ""Quiet Place"" was far more engaging, had solid cinematography and a very original soundtrack to instill fear. Though that film wasn't too deep either, it's portrayal of family bonds and the fall of humanity were at least touching. In contrast, here we root for many of the annoying characters to die.<br/><br/>Lastly, there are alot of shill reviews about this movie. Shill: ""an accomplice of a hawker, who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others"". The glowing reviews appear canned and absurd, even if they enjoyed it as film fodder, their one paragraph enthusiasm is clearly insincere. I encourage you to be harsh in your ratings to counteract this ploy to raise this films overall score.<br/><br/>In the end, this horror film is a simulacrum: ""an unsatisfactory imitation or substitute"". Example: The ""Bird Box"" is a bland simulacrum of an original horror story.<br/><br/>This might has well be likened to a modern ghost story, with an unseen entity from beyond, not knowing where it came from or what it wants. Meh . . ."
"pascalembours","1","99","188","28 December 2018"," They think you are a moron!
","The people who made this film think you are stupid. They think you are stupid because the story ignores basic realities yet remains grounded in a mundane present. How about you grab two kids under each arm, and run blindfolded through a forest. What do you think would happen to you and the kids? The makers of this movie show the main character doing this and falling over just once, never bumping in a tree, getting stuck in a bush and the kids are all fine after being crushed by the main character. No pants with bloodied shins or dirty knees for the entire 2h film?!? Obviously, the people who made this film think you're stupid! No scraped hands? No bloodied foreheads? No broken legs? They think you're stupid! They think you're stupid because they try to convince you that going blind overnight is not a problem and can be easily be solved by simply relying on your GPS to get you and your car to the grocery store. They think you're stupid because the car gets back to the garage after a blindfolded drive to and from the grocery store without a hitch. In the mundane present of the movie, GPS' know where curbs and lampposts are located, it tracks street lanes, and maps while mall parking lots. They think you are stupid because this is obviously nonsensical horsedoodoo! They think you're stupid because they want to convince you the the GPS is a magical device that tells you where mall doors are located and where your house's garage door begins and ends. They think you are stupid because they want you to believe that a blindfolded woman in a boat with two kids can fight off and kill a grown man (not blindfolded) with a machete! So many more inconsistencies and wildly implausible (read impossible) scenes make it difficult to see this as a drama. It's more a comedy of errors.<br/><br/>They think you're stupid because the whole end-reveal is giving the kids names, and giving you an ending that resolves and reveals NOTHING! The movie is directed by a woman who has virtually done only romance movies - she should stick to that!<br/><br/>I watch tons of movies. I love sci-fi, end-of-the-world scenarios, and weird flicks that challenge the imagination. Bird Box is not that. It's just a badly executed rom-drama film that treats its audience as if they are stupid morons who can't think for themselves and will unquestioningly gobble-up whatever they are fed. It's by far the worst movie I've watched in 2018 and, at the risk of repeating myself, I watched hundreds of films this year.<br/><br/>I'm the redhead from the scene where Malorie leaves the hospital at the beginning of the film: I've seen an evil monstrosity -Bird Box- and I can't unsee it, I can't go back to the way things were, and I'm still pounding my head bloody against the glass wall!"

How can this be classed as horror or sci-fi... you didn't see any of the baddies, it wasn't explained how these baddies turned up, it didn't explain/show what the aim of he baddies was... It was boring and unexciting. The characters in the house were ridiculous and it was a like a failed attempt to get people of different qualities in a house to see how they would interact with each other. The gay guy and a husband, a neighbour suing them, an old woman whose presence was puzzling, the young guy and woman who bonked, the black guys, just a big mess of messy people. The little girl's acting by the way was good. The whole plot was ridiculous bordering on the impossible. I don't mean the baddies, I mean the actions of the people. For example, walking blindfolded in a forest, sailing 50 odd hours down a river, blindfolded... yeah right! Who the hell calls their kids 'Boy"" and 'Girl' for 5 years and right at the end, she decides to name them... Give me a break!<br/><br/>Now ""A Quiet Place"" that was film... and I think this is the film that people would immediately think about (or compare to) when watching this film. That film was good and the writer must have had this in mind. He failed mizzzerableeee!<br/><br/>I normally love Sandra Bullock's films but I gave this a 1. Sorry Sandra!"

So Sandra Bullock makes a journey with two kids to a place which she heard is safe. Nothing else. There is no reason given why things are happening or a sense of an ending. It seems like a Damien Lindeloff movie.<br/><br/>And don't believe Stephen King. For some reason studios like asking Stephen King if their movie is scary and he always says yes.

"benslammin77","5","80","156","28 December 2018"," Missed opportunity
","The story, theoretically, is pretty good.<br/><br/>How could they go wrong about making a movie about certain death from seeing invisible entities? The idea of making a movie about having to blindfold yourself whenever you walk outside or else you will die in seconds seems pretty cool in the surface, but when each death is expected, predictable and almost 'set-up', viewers will struggle to connect with characters as the characters seem to have many choices, but never choose the right ones.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's acting is impressive, as always.<br/><br/>The story, although the outline itself, even though cliche, works... sort of. Some of the scenes are dragged out and unnecessary. Even the name of the movie, ""Bird Box"" has almost nothing to do with the story (the birds freak out when the invisible entities are near; but if you keep your blindfold on, the need for the birds is obsolete). The premise gets your attention, a mother is warning what seems to be her children of the dangers of taking their blindfolds off; then it cuts back tot eh beginning of when the entities arrived to earth and what happens when someone 'looks' at the invisible entity.<br/><br/>My advice is to have zero expectations, especially of seeing the invisible entity (ironic yes, but not even an explanation of what they are, their purpose, how they came to earth, or anything).<br/><br/>This could have been a 15 minute TV movie or short. The idea and story are cool, but the movie makers missed the opportunity to have more mystery at the beginning (one of the first lines is the mother earning her kids they can't take their blindfolds off or they will die), explain more of the what, why and how if the invisible entities, and come up with a better name.<br/><br/>Overall, if you have more than 2 hours to kill, watch it. But if you are in graduate school trying to relax during the holidays, don't wait two hours watching this, take a nap or do something productive."

","Where to start.. I'm a real life movie encyclopedia with very sharp taste for quality movies and over the screen drama experience in general yet I don't let my high expectations ruin any movie experience so I judge it exactly as it is.. Luckily there was no hype or expectations for this one as I just heard about it.. However prior to watching it I came here as usually do to check the non spoiler reviews and ratings to decide it wether it's worth or not and immediately I was underwhelmed by the majority of the comments slating the movie with some redicolous scores to back it up and how misleading that was!! Almost every comment I read was too concerned comparing it to The Happening which was not a cinematic success yet I personally enjoyed The Happening despite its misfits.. Now the question is what defines a good movie?!! What is an entertaining movie?!! To me it's a movie that manage to capture and grab my attention from start to finish and for someone like myself who has seen it all and I mean all it takes quite alot to engage I have as I consciously and subconsciously go through all the cinematic elements of any movie and based on its budget and genre I decide where this movie stands.. In the process I don't consider only one or two elements as many people do when they evaluate a movie while ignoring the the most important aspects and ingredients that makes a good movie and the core of any good movie experience is the actual story line and how it is told and executed and here in this movie we have a quite engaging story that is extremely well acted and executed with a decent budget that provided me with the full experience and kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end and unlike many people I did actually like the ending.. My basic conclusion and advise.. Go watch it people and do yourselves a favour go to enjoy a true decent cinematic experience without any prior prejudice or over expectations and you will love it as Sandra Bullock shines in this one providing when of her best roles in quite some time in a high tempo Sci fi thriller that delivers from start to finish..

To me, the movie is just stupid in general and in many details.<br/><br/>If the thing called ""creatures"" is a government debt, then the movie makes perfect sense. Think about it: The debt is so horrifying that when you open your eyes and see what it will bring, you want to commit suicide. Only bad guys are untouched by the debt, because they are actually capitalizing on the destruction. I can live with this allegory."

","The beginning opens with Sandra Bullock screaming the rules of the universe at her children. Clever device for exposition.
Too bad it quickly devolves into a clunky mess of end of the world tropes.<br/><br/>There is almost no value in this movie other than that they hired a diverse cast to sit around a house and be totally safe from a demon creature that might just be noisy wind. Half of this movie is spent watching Malorie and Tom say flirty things to each other in a way that somehow lacks much chemistry, while John Malkovich (would be Trumper- ""make the end of the world great again!"" Get it! He's a jerk! We should write him off cause he has a gun and drinks) has a gun and drinks. There's also the alternate cast of the Walking Dead doing next to nothing and the awesome TSA agent from Get Out spouting exposition about Zoroastrian Apocalypse gods. But don't worry, it's not all bad. There is a bit of time where you think Malorie is gonna have a Sophie's Choice moment in the river leading up to the rapids which was nice to see that the movie was about to have ANYTHING to say about anything, but then when the hard choice comes, she makes a non choice and everyone's fine.<br/><br/>These are all the movies that this movie stole from that are better:
-This is the End
-The Road
-A Quiet Place
-Deliverance
-The Mist<br/><br/>It also stole from:
-The Happening (not better but at least you'd have fun drinking to it)<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's character has no pony in this race. She's an artist with nothing to say other than ""human connection is dead"" and then later when the other pregnant lady tries to make a human connection she walks out of the room. She refused to even name her children (but it's okay because one of them is adopted so she doesn't need to love it- but at least that would be interesting if there was anything behind it. See note about Sophie's Non-Choice above.<br/><br/>Dumb movie. Waste of money. Waste of talented actors. At least the M Night moment was about blind people and not that she was crazy. Would have been better if the blind people gouged out their eyes at the end in a delicious ""now you'll be safe for ever"" moment but hey, they had to get this out while you still remembered that A Quiet Place was a movie so you can make Bird Box/Quiet Place crossover memes."

","In all, not very engaging as a story. The idea of journey as blindfolded with two small blindfolded children is not compelling or thriller; it's anxiety-producing. Especially since the protagonist (Bullock) is basically unlikable in this role. The whole premise is preposterous: traveling in a boat blindfolded, driving a car blind, etc. Also, there's an element of child abuse with ""boy"" and ""girl"" who've spent their little lives with the Bullock character as non-entities, until the ending in which there is supposed to be some sort of validation of their presence.
I realize this is based on the book, which came out before A Quiet Place, but the similarities are undeniable, and one can't help but compare the two films. There were inadequacies in A Quiet Place as well, but it was a much more compelling film than Bird Box."

I find the movie really creepy and well done because it does such a great job building suspense. I've seen a lot of people who dislike this movie say it's boring because you don't see the monster and everything isn't perfectly explained. I don't think it has to be. I think building a world but leaving some details obscure is much better than using a CG monster. It's not made to be terrifying, it's made to keep the viewer on edge. Personally, I really enjoyed it, otherwise I wouldn't be reviewing it.

However, i usually just check the movie review but i only read the comments after i watch the film, i watched it and well, it's a very well executed movie i must say! the acting is good and convincing, the character development is well paced, the characters themselves are quite good and entertaining, overall it's a very nice movie.

Most people can't row a boat in a straight line even when they can see. Then there's the whole running through the woods debacle, mostly managing to stay on the path and avoid the thousands of trees.

"lindsayshannonjoyner","1","4","5","23 February 2020"," Bird Box: An Insult to the Thriller Genre
","When Bird Box first hit the scene in 2018, its online presence was hard to miss. Twitter quips, memes, and passionate testimonials to the greatness of the film soon surfaced, with some arguing that Sandra Bullock's performance would merit an Oscar nomination. Naturally, with the excitement surrounding the film, I was interested to see just how thrilling, emotional, and eventful it would be. Instead, I found myself in complete shock that anyone could posit that this film is anything more than a flaming, festering dumpster fire. Read on for my take on what I believe to be the worst film of 2018.<br/><br/>(If you don't want to read the entire review, scroll to the bottom to read my summarized critique!)<br/><br/>***WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW***<br/><br/>From the start, this movie is a total disaster. The way the film jumps back and forth between timelines is enough to give viewers whiplash, and it does so in a way that is completely in your face. Due to this, any ounce of nuance or suspense is gone from the start, giving way to a bland, boring, and predictable storyline.<br/><br/>The characters and their motivations are incredibly muddled throughout the story, specifically those of Bullock's character Malorie, Danielle Macdonald's character Olympia, and John Malkovich's character Tom. As these characters and others are relegated to a home in order to stay safe from the invisible ""monsters"", their relationships sway ridiculously between being friends and enemies.<br/><br/>The plot continues on to see the characters driving blindly to the grocery store (which somehow works despite the fact that there should be bodies and debris all over the road), fending off the mosters as they invade the home (managing to do so with few casualties), and Malorie and her children blindly canoeing down a treacherous river to find an entire commune of blind people who somehow managed to escape the monsters. Obviously this is a work of fiction, but this film pushes fiction to the extreme in the worst way possible.<br/><br/>Moving on, the screenwriting and dialogue of the film was cringeworthy at best, with the characters communicating in an incredibly forced and unnatural way. I found Olympia to be particularly obnoxious and one-sided, and did not feel a bit of sadness when she died (due to her own ignorance, no less). That said, Malorie was arguably more frusturating, as the complete apathy she displayed throughout the film felt formulaic and obligatory. The very fact that she named her children ""Boy"" and ""Girl"" was so cheesy it hurt, and her willingness to consider sacrificing ""Girl"" towards the end of the film obliterated any degree of reality the screenwriters attempted to convey.<br/><br/>What more can I say? This film is one of the worst I've ever seen, and upon second and third viewings I can confirm that it only gets more dreadful with time. I feel strongly that Bird Box will age about as well as an egg left out in the sun, rotting and festering with each passing moment. Utterly ghastly, this film is an insult to the genre it claims to represent.<br/><br/>TL;DR:<br/><br/>The Good: The birds were cute, I guess? I am genuinely struggling to find a single positive thing to say about this film.<br/><br/>The Bad: Would it be unfair to say that everything about this movie is bad? The acting, the screenwriting, the directing, the cinematography, etc. etc. etc... Everything about this film is vapid, unintelligent, and monotonous.<br/><br/>The Ugly: If I had to pick the very worst thing about this film, it would have be the plot. Awful is an understatement. The choices the characters make throughout are both incredibly senseless and incredibly predictable, a nasty combo. For this reason and so many others, I genuinely feel that the film itself is an insult to the thriller genre as a whole. In a genre that is already so oversaturated with disappointing films, this one manages to stand out as one of the worst, a difficult title to attain when the bar is already set so low."

","It's Christmas night and my family is scrolling desperately through Netflix for something new to watch. After rooting through the endless list of goobery Christmas films, we finally decided on BIRD BOX, the new horror film starring Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich.<br/><br/>First of all, I'd like to say how original the idea for this film is! Sure, one could draw similarities to some other movies out there (A Quiet Place, War of the Worlds, and unfortunately... The Happening are some films that come to mind), but overall the idea of a monster that causes you to kill yourself upon seeing it is a concept that has never been done before. It's creative and a clever way to scare the audience.<br/><br/>The downside to this, however, is that the execution is CERTAINLY not on the same level of creativity as the concept itself. The storyline is...solid, but is fairly traditional as far as the horror genre goes (it's the usual ""group caught in one setting during a disaster- tensions ensue"" that sort of thing). The second half is where things really depart from the usual horror conventions.<br/><br/>Second downside is the character writing. It is noticeably bad. The first 20-25 minutes have a character that exists solely for exposition, characters meet and become friends in a matter of days (could be weeks, but time moves strangely in this film), and two particular characters fall in love for no reason whatsoever. Fairly odd, but the suspense and drama will keep you interested, despite the characters.<br/><br/>Speaking of suspense and drama; there are scenes in this film that had me holding my breath! Won't spoil, but wow the writer of this film understands realistic horror and how mob hysteria works. Also, the sound design! Wow...incredibly disturbing. Not on the same level as a Lynch film, but we're getting somewhere!<br/><br/>Final, and shortest point, the ending is a little goofy. Again, won't spoil, but it's exactly what you'd expect out of a horror movie trying to have a semblance of a happy ending...it doesn't work. Would've honestly preferred a downer ending.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed THE BIRD BOX, and would rate it a 6 out of 10!<br/><br/>Thank you for taking time to read my review!"

All blindfolded and facing rapids and the birds in a shoebox. Sandra wears full make up and screams an awful lot. Everyone around her dies along the way.<br/><br/>Blindfolds?

","It doesn't ever explain what is causing the suicides. There you have it. Now you can skip this horrible movie and do something else. People that are giving it high scores must be millenials, folks who have never seen a good movie in their lives or the kind that amazes themselves with an all black canvas and those crappy modern art. It doesn't matter if the acting or directing is good or whatever. What a movie is about is storytelling. What we expect from it is a good story with well placed intro, middle and ending.<br/><br/>Onto the ""open for interpretation"" theme: yes, it is a thing, but this movie is far away from that. The reason is that it doesn't give any element for a minimum interpretation whatsoever. I don't need them to explain WHY that fenomena is happening to the world, but at least WHAT is causing the suicides. The ""why"" part you can theorize about, and that is what a movie of that kind should aim to. But to deliver and unfinished idea, some hidden thing that causes you to kill yourself if you ever should look at it, and never reveal it or at least why people would feel that urge? This is treating the audience like idiots that should accept any crap content and clap afterwards (unfortunately, this is the modern era and we are already living in the distopia saw in Idiocracy).<br/><br/>Moreover, the idea for the movie is not a new one. The Happening functions on the exact same premisse (sudden suicides), but at least it builds a nice story, some social interactions and gives a damn about explaining just what the hell is happening. Why? It gives you a hint. But the ""what"" is there. Bird box leaves you without anything. This movie is here to prove people will pay for an unfinished movie or idea only to be forced to complete it in the creators stead. And they will ask for seconds."

","In an attempt of creating a hopeless pastiche on Children of Men and Blindness this boring flick destroys all hope in a future for the post apocalyptic genre. It's pretentious, boring, pointless and awkward. It's really an embarrassment to watch. The worst thing this ""movie"" does is pretending to be serious, because it might have survived as a comedy. Because that's what it ends up being. It has no relevant allegoric message on the problems of society, the script reveals characters that are either horribly one dimensional, pretentious or outright stupid. Sandra Bullock is playing a kitsch artist with sociopathic tendencies, stumbling around in a world where a strange wind forces ""normal"" and ""ordinary"" people to kill themselves, because they witness some sort of ""truth"", while all the ""insane"" and ""crazy"" people are able to survive, because they thrive in this situation. It doesn't get more banal. All the symbols are worthless, the dialogues are gruesome and the photography is less than mediocre. You can see that everything is a film set. Badly lit. Boring. In the end it is revealed as a poor man's rip-off of The Road, but with an obvious and ridiculous happy ending. That I see people online wearing blindfolds and stumbling around on social media inspired by this bucket of waste makes me cringe. The future of film is grim if we're going to let blowhard hogwash like this slip through, even if it's in the graveyard of cinema: Netflix. Watch this if you want to fall asleep and wake up angry."

A guy shows up with a bunch of spooky looky drawings that have nothing to do with literally anything. And at the conclusion of the film literally nothing is resolved, the movie doesn't ""end"" it just stops. Utter trash, not to mention it's a rip off of a M.

","While most horror movies are filled with tropes, idiotic behavior, and unnecessary plot points-- this movie manages to check all the boxes with a giant red marker.<br/><br/>The source of horror for the movie never gets clearly established rules, and then the few that do get established seem to be broken for no reason at all. Characters are added to push the plot forward and each characters' complete disregard for logical behaviour is the driving force for every event of the movie. While I understand, some of this is necessary for the movie to work, literally every five minutes I was asking myself ""why? Why would you do that?""<br/><br/>While it was a bearable movie to sit through, and the concept was great, I could not recommend it to anyone. The writing was lazy and it clearly showed throughout the entire movie."
"iguth","1","8","13","27 April 2019"," Bird Box
","The Netflix original is better left as a meme. The movie is slow and all the humor is default Netflix. I never once became attached to any character and throughout the film and when I lost them it had zero impact. The concept of a monster that you can't see is interesting but silly. The trailer is full of moments from the first 5 minutes, all of which are the best parts of the film. If you want a movie that is like this one but better then watch The Mist."
"nmn34","3","8","13","17 January 2019"," Lawless Horror Movies Are Never Good
","They got a very good cast, an award winning director, and well received source material to build off of. There is a lot going for this movie going in, but unfortunately it loses something in the translation. The script is atrocious. Everything is done to the best of everyone's ability, its just that it isn't that good.<br/><br/>The discourse between characters is abhorrent and I can't blame Sandra Bullock or John Malkovich. They deliver their lines very well, its just that what they say is often head scratchingly stupid. For example, Greg (BD Wong) wants to try to see the creatures through his security camera, which is an acceptable line of thinking. It sets the precedent that you don't need direct line of sight for the monster to effect you. But its how he tries to explain his plan, trying to blind the audience with an overly sciency, not scientific, explanation about waves and heat distortion that hearing aloud makes his plan even less convincing. Then he looks at it through a regular camera and kills himself because that couldn't have been a stupider idea. This issue comes up constantly, nothing sounds right. Malorie (Sandra Bullock) starts talking to her sister about going out for drinks while pregnant after her ultrasound in front of her doctor, to which the doctor replies with a mildly miffed equivalent to ""I'll pretend I didn't hear that."" Tom (Trevante Rhodes) is written like a 80s cartoon character, he is perfect in every way and devoid of any reasoning. He is ready to help anyone without so much as a thought to self preservation and does so pretty much of his own accord. Douglas (John Malkovitch) gets it pretty bad, he is just engrossed with all the negative traits Tom lacks and painted to be the jerk of the group in spite of an impressive track record on being right. This culminates in the ""Make the apocalypse great again"" which is supposed to remind everyone that he is the callous jerk as everyone rolls their eyes at him, but its just so out of left field that it is blatant why it was written in. Its not a condemnation of him, they've already done that the entire movie, its an insult towards half the movie's potential audience. The sudden flash of elitism wouldn't have been half as insulting had the movie been written more intelligently, its like being called an idiot by a D student.<br/><br/>The monsters themselves have no rhyme or reason. There is never an explanation of what they are or where they are from. This isn't in itself a negative as left to the audience's imagination they can probably conceive of something better than the writer could have imagined. What isn't acceptable is that there is no explanation of what they can do. They give a bare minimum explanation that the sight of it will cause madness or suicidal depression, but that's it. Everything else is hypothesized but is then conflicted with new evidence. At first, the monster is thought unable to interact with the real world, and thereby can't open doors, but then shakes a car and jostles leaves. It has the ability to speak at the end, but it leaves a question as to why it doesn't do so early on from behind the door. There is nothing that explains why one person becomes suicidal and another crazy but infers at the end that there is a way to differentiate them from normal people through their eyes. This is never explained how nor the validity tested. So in the end, things happen and there is no explanation. You just got Happening-ed.<br/><br/>The worst is yet to come however as it seems they ran out of material and just shoestring whatever they had together in convenience and blatant plot armor for the final act. The plot is told through flashbacks that pointed out who wasn't going to make it like a red shirt on Star Trek, as the three survivors of the group, Malorie and the two children, raft down a river to sanctuary. Then come the rapids. The audience is aware that they are the looming threat by this point and we were left at a cliffhanger as one of them is going to have to navigate. Instead of what you expect to happen, they decide to go blind and immediately capsize. Making it to shore, Malorie must quickly find the kids and its far more anticlimactic than this sentence would lead you to believe. Still blindfolded she finds them in less than a minute and they continue through the woods as they rush to bring it all home. They don't care anymore, they open a can of cheap drama, and dump you in an unsatisfying ending where nothing is accomplished. This was the hook, the big event they were building up to, and its pretty much yada yada-ed. And to make it worse, the book handled it better by simply having Malorie take off her blindfold.<br/><br/>This movie would not have done well had it gone to theaters, had it been anywhere but Netflix it would have bombed. It tries to emulate A Quiet Place but somehow ends up feeling more like The Happening. It has short glimmers of hope and the cast did what they could, but the writing was just not there for them and they are left running from the wind."

Five people risk their lives to go on a supply run, drive around in a car with blacked out windows, go into a fully stocked grocery store and then LEAVE again. John Malkovich was right when he said they ""could live here for a year"" but then don't. The same character is banished into the garage where he, for some reason can look through a window in the door back to the house (who has a door to the garage with a window in it -NO ONE EVER), but cannot find the means to break that window or the door to let himself back in for safety.

","If you though ""A Quiet Place was suspenseful, you haven't seen anything until you watch Bird Box. A port-apocalyptic movie made for adults, it tells a story that pulls no punches. It doesn't try to hold your hand and tell you that everything will be okay. It shows you how the slightest mistake will cause someone to die, and it doesn't shy away from showing you the aftermath. It's visceral, it's violent and it's distirbing, the way the end of the world should be. My main problem with ""A Quiet Place"" was that it was too tame and catered to a sensitive audience that can't take any serious events in their movies. Bird Box was made for an adult audience, as everything about it is more mature, the stakes are higher, and the enemy is much more dangerous.<br/><br/>If you liked ""A Quiet Place"", but felt that it was made for a teen audience and could have been much better, then you will love Bird Box. It's like they took the movies ""Blindness"", ""The Mist"" and ""28 Days Later"" and made the best baby they could possibly make. Highly reccomended. You won't regret it."

The entity knows where they are the entire time yet lets them carry on like this for 5 years, until one day when it doesn't and attacks them, Rhodes doesn't make it. So Bullock and the nameless children go on a 40+ hour boat ride down a treacherous river blindfolded the whole time towards what they can only hope is a safe haven.

When it does try to be it's own thing at times, it comes off so contrived and cliche and I personally couldn't take it seriously. There are so many tropes and moments that are so familiar and unoriginal. The story is told in a somewhat interesting way and Bullock's acting is serviceable like always but it just lacks an overall originality which has become a trend in most Netflix ""original"" films unfortunately, aside from a few. I felt as though they tried to make this more of a testament/symbolism to being a mother than anything else and maybe that's why it's scoring so well among the average Netflix demographic. There are moments of set up atmosphere and intensity that never lead to anywhere where I guess you're supposed to use your imagination which I find pointless when watching something that is meant to show the culprits before your eyes in the thriller/horror genres. The suspense is empty when it's meant to be full. Overall this is just a long dragging attempt at being a clever thriller drama that doesn't deliver any originality but is watchable I suppose.

I think the most unsatisfying things of this movie are:
A) We never get to see the ""creatures"", I know it's part of the mystery and stuff, but at least we could have a quick glance by the end of the movie of something....al we see is leaves rising from the ground (and some drawing from one of the characters who actually saw them)
B) Most of the characters are cliche and don't really matter except from the protagonist couple. We are presented with like 10 people from who the whole importance is that one of them is also pregnant (boy, I wonder who are the two children with Sandra Bullock back to ""5 years later"" when the film starts
C) The ending. So they reach this blind people school, ok cool, blind people are immune to the creatures, so they are gonna stick there forever? is that the happy ending? will they have enough supplies for all the people forever in this house in the middle of nowhere? This feels like a really loose end, kinda like the author didn't know how to conclude the story

","This movie is so unbelievably bad that the only context that I could recommend it is as a ""so-bad-that-its-good"" movie. Even then its too long and too boring to worth the wonderfully bad moments of hilarity within.<br/><br/>Plot - I am extremely hesitant to say that this movie even contains a plot. The script is so unbelievably bad that its hard to believe it was written. I really don't want to blame the screenwriter, because he also wrote Arrival (2016) which was great. Both movies are based on books, so I'm just going to assume that its all in the source material. The book that this was based on must have been terrible though because wow this movie is just so unbelievably bad. I can't believe what I just spent the last 2 hours watching. Its like the writer completely failed to understand what makes horror movies scary. I mean if you're scared of wind, I think that you can get a lot out of this movie. Otherwise, don't watch it.<br/><br/>Characters - This movie is listed as a drama, as well as a horror/thriller (which it fails miserably at by not being even remotely scary) but the problem is that it doesn't contain any characters. All of the acting, from both the child and adult actors, is embarrassingly terrible. Honestly I don't blame them. No one is given anything to do. No one has any personalities, backstories, or goals. The weird, time skipping nature of the story doesn't help either. At no point is anyone developed in this movie. Also, sacrificing yourself, being pregnant, or screaming the f bomb all the time are not character traits. This movie is boring.<br/><br/>Visuals - This is what $20M burning looks like. This movie has no style or art direction. It just looks like garbage. There are way cheeper movies out there that look so much better. Also, the continuity in this movie is almost nonexistent. From shot to shot there are countless distracting visual errors.<br/><br/>I no longer want to talk about this movie or acknowledge it ever. Everything about it is terrible. Don't watch it. Its so bad."

I just finished the movie and it will definitely stick with me! (In a good way!) I noticed the parallels with ""A Quiet Place"", but Bird Box doesn't leave you with a bunch of plot holes or a lack of dynamic characters. I gotta say I wish we could have actually seen the creatures, BUT, in a way, it adds to the tension and forces the viewer to imagine what the enemy looks like and our imaginations can come up with some scary stuff haha
The ending was well done and earned by the characters (ever get to the end of a survival film like ""in real life these people would have died"") which just goes to show you that you've truly connected with the characters. Well worth the watch!"

Hard.<br/><br/>Sure, ""Bird Box"" isn't ""A Quiet Place,"" but non-book readers won't be able to tell the difference. Nor do they care.<br/><br/>This film lacked actual monsters and the characters face an entity they never see. Much less makes sense. Are the entities aliens or supernatural beings? The movie stays in the middle the whole time and never answers our questions.<br/><br/>Rules that seem to make sense get broken later in the film. Random twists and turns get added to build ""suspense"" but end up annoying the audience instead.<br/><br/>Though the lineup is great, the cast that lacks real chemistry. Each character is lazily killed off until we're left with Bullock and her two UNNAMED children. I guess the plot is so badly thought out they forgot to give them names.<br/><br/>Effects were alright at best. But cliched and don't deserve applause.<br/><br/>Finally, the namesake of the film, bird boxes, get introduced late into the film. The bird boxes themselves add little besides build suspense. The film does no justice in explaining if other animals are able to sense the antagonists either. What makes the birds so special?<br/><br/>.5/5.

","I'm not gonna lie part of the 1 star is because netflix doesn't let you rate movies anymore. It's declared, because I watched it and added to the viewer numbers, that the movie was successful. It wasn't. Its clear pretty quickly why the movie was dumped on netflix versus a theatrical release. The plot is nonsense and the script is overacted. Sadly John Malkovich is the worst offender. He plays a typical self-involved american everyman with no specific identity. Possibly the worst character for him to play. Every scene of him is just him yelling lines and looking ready to leave the set asap. I won't go into details but if you're the type that groans loudly whenever a actor does or says something both incredibly stupid and out of character this film is not for you.<br/><br/>I will also point out if you're a suspense/horror fan and understands that rules are everything you'll also be disappointed. I'll give you an example. Assuming you've never actually seen a monster and all that you've ever witnessed is people going crazy when they look at idk NOTHING then what exactly would you run from? and when? The answer is when the plot calls for it so you see idiots running from nothing in particular. If I'd give this movie a byline it'd be ""idiots running from nothing in particular for 2 hours"".

Anyway. Apocalypse is coming, with some mysterious things going around in the air, making the grass look funny. Looking at it and you die. Unless you're something very special and just go weird. Hey, so far right? In comes Sandra Bullocks. All made up in her fancy makeup, those long eyelashes anyone? Oh dear. She has also had a bit too many....injections with botox. Which means that she haven´t got the facial expressions that some might like to see. Not that she have to use any emotions, she is like a cold fish, and yes, her character is supposed to be somewhat freezing but just a little humanity, or just some expression in her eyes, anything! The eyelash extensions by the way - they last all through the movie, five years later and yes, they're still there! Yum, get me some!
Also, when I first saw those two kids, I thought they were animated! It was like yeah, here is Sandra Bullocks, and everything around her is animated. You know the movies... I think that there were a few characters on the side, so to speak, who were great and I would had liked to see some more of them but they kept killing them. Sad. Danielle Macdonald as Olympia for one. Beautiful character, well played too. And Charlie, played by Lil Rel Howery. I would had loved to see a movie with these two characters as leads.

Just how were the creatures able to mimic the voices (and have the intelligence) of people dearest to their intended victims? And finally, once Bullock had reached the blind school 🏫, how long did she and her two kids hope to hold out there till one day they accidentally had a glimpse at death?!?

Horriblly written, poorly acted, poorly executed and takes itself too seriously. It is laughably bad on all fronts. It is 'A Quiet Place' plot with no sight instead of no speech.

I don't want to write more than that. I thought the movie was great thoughout. Two hours felt like one hour. It was intense and interesting. Perhaps predictable as well but for this movie I didn't mind that.

","This movie was essentially ""The Mist"" with invisible monsters (evil force) that people can't look at (or they'll kill themselves), and a happier ending. The movie focuses jumps back and forth between when the evil force first arrives, and years later dealing with the destruction of society.<br/><br/>As per usual for films in this age, it's anti-white male message was pushed on the viewer from the get-go, and most folks won't even realize it when watching. The white male characters are either uncaring a-holes, selfish drug dealers, or infected by the evil, while the roles of all the POC are that of morally good people who do heroic acts of upstanding character. Also, it wouldn't be a modern-day movie if the script didn't include an interracial relationship between a white female and a black male. This aspect was totally unnecessary for the plot, and they could have used a white couple (or a POC couple) without taking away roles from other groups. POC were already overrepresented in the movie.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was pretty good and it had potential, but cultural Marxism propaganda ruined this movie, plus the fact they kept the evil force a complete mystery. The only things folks learn about it is you can't look at it, and for some reason it can't come indoors. They don't even show what the force is (likely to save money) other than swirling leaves. I'm surprised anyone is talking about this movie, as it wasn't that good at all."

","Did anyone notice the anti-white man sediment the movie brought on? All the characters in the house were good natured minorities with two exceptions: Felix (young, progressive-looking white man who seduces a young woman and steals the group's only mode of transportation) and Douglas. Douglas is the epitome of what liberal Hollywood sees wrong with white men. Aside from being old and bitter he's also rich and has a gun. Throughout the story the audience is made to hate the character for his snide comments. As our hatred grows we find out more about him: he's divorced, he's (presumably) Christian and he even makes a laughable ode to Trump in his drunken speech in the grocery store.<br/><br/>The other less obvious negative portrayal of the white man can be seen by looking at the characters that try to expose the group to the monster on the outside. The first encounter is with the white man in the grocery store. The next is the white man in the river. The most dramatic is Gary, who earns the trust of most of the group and then stabs them in the back in their time of extreme vulnerability.<br/><br/>If you didn't notice it at first, go back and spend 2 hours to notice the blatantly anti-white, anti-right-wing sediment draped all over this movie.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Malorie (Sandra Bullock) is an ordinary woman, who's just learned she's pregnant, who is suddenly plunged into a nightmare world of madness and mayhem, when people start suicidally throwing themselves to their doom. After her sister Jessica (Sarah Paulson) falls victim to this madness, she hauls herself into the home of Douglas (John Malkovich), a cynical man mistrustful of everyone, along with a group of other survivors. The story cuts between this and Malorie commandeering two young children to safety in blindfolds...<br/><br/>Horror films can't seem to get it right these days. They're either taking the cheap and easy route, overloading on jump scares and loud screeching, or they're trying to be too deep and cerebral, literally jumping from one extreme to another. And in the latter case, it's always at the crux of a really far fetched, far out concept, as is the case with Bird Box, the new Netflix film that seems to have everybody talking. The first thing that springs to mind less than five minutes into it is the recent big screen frightener A Quiet Place, a similarly over the top film that perfectly illustrates what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>For all its high concept pretensions though, it soon succumbs to the clichÃ©s all too easily, with a bunch of stereotypical characters all holed up in a remote location, and echoes of other horror fare, such as 28 Days Later..., also pervade. Telling the story in two separate strands, it all pans out too long and comes off as too long winded. Even the performances, from a mostly seasoned supporting cast, don't feel like they're really heartfelt. Even Bullock feels flat and awkward in the first half, although she does come alive a bit in the second.<br/><br/>It's all intriguing and diverting enough not to be a complete failure, but you just wish everyone involved had not tried to be so high handed. In the end, what seems to be some kind of Sixth Sense style twist rolls by, but if you can put it together in one go, you're a better man than me. Personally, I'd got to the stage when I just wanted to slap on one of those damn blindfolds myself and relax. **"

We have 2 hours of duration which really sucks because all the plot is explained on the first ten minutes and then the endless cliches start with no ending.
Sometimes it's like you've already seen this movie before because there's a lot of spoken sentences that brings to mind other apocalyptic movies, making you fall into boredom.
It was supposed to be a thriller but it really doesn't convince us, I had to try really hard to stay in the atmosphere of the movie and I was watching with my girlfriend, that's why I didn't shut off the TV.

","Well, ""Bird Box"" was one big disappointment due to the hype surrounding it. Like most ""original"" movies thrown to the public via Netflix, it was a complete waste of two plus hours and never lived up to the word of mouth that it was ""terrifying"". Perhaps in some other dimension this flick is scary, but not this one. Let's sort out the weak excuses here by the ten star reviewers, OK?<br/><br/>""Bird Box"" is another end of the world stories, there are many to choose from. BB's closest new cousin is ""A Quiet Place"" replacing not making noise with not looking at the whatever it is causing all the trouble. Both are based on books, with ""A Quiet Place"" getting the nod for getting to the public first. It in itself wasn't an original idea, based on a book called ""The Silence"" that came out some years ago. In that story, nasty little reptile-birds were released from a hidden ecosystem and devastated humans by their sensitive hearing. This idea appeared in the Fifties in the book ""Day of the Triffids"". At least in both those books we were allowed to see the problem, but in ""Bird Box"" we're expected to believe a woman with two children can overcome major physical trauma to reach a safe place that probably isn't so safe. Roll credits.<br/><br/>No real explanation is given for the whatever it is that causes immediate suicide in reasonable people. We never really ""see"" it, other than the not so special effects that indicate the whatever is adept at moving bushes in a forest. People invest in a story, so naturally they're unhappy when they don't get any bang for their buck. Myself, I went to sleep about 45 minutes into this silly movie and woke up about ten minutes before the end. I was better off asleep.<br/><br/>Silly, non-plausible, badly directed, and yet another TV outing featuring Sarah Paulson. She's great in AHS but does she need to be in everything? Yawn."

"JamesMcIrish","2","5","9","10 January 2019"," Just bad
","This film very quickly reminded me of ""The man from Earth"", which is not a good thing, since that is the worst film I have seen in the past decade or so. It has a very similar feeling of a single bad idea (clearly cherished by the writer), extrapolated out into a tedious, (poor) dialogue-heavy, low budget b-movie.<br/><br/>Like in that film, the script is so poorly written that it immediately makes the situation feel manufactured, particularly the way everyone gets a piece of dialog in turn, as if the scriptwriter was writing by just skipping through each character and assigning them something trite to say, one after the other, to give them their ""reason to be there"". The opening scene where Bullock's character calmly ignores the very obvious armageddon taking over the rest of the world and carries on her lighthearted chit-chat really sets the tone for how silly this film is, and how little the screenwriters understand (or manage to portray) how humans work in real life.<br/><br/>The lack of any story development, except a succession of increasingly improbable activities and events, makes this a story with no story-arc. In many cases it feels as if the blindfolds are mainly used as a tool to ensure there are no SFX costs to pay on this film.<br/><br/>And maybe I missed this whilst I was busy grimacing, but why exactly are they safe indoors but not outdoors?"

The characters are just as worse, not only is the main lead emotionless and inconsistent. She's a character that tries to be strong and independent by being needlessly mean and cold to many people. The rest of the characters fall into two categories. Needlessly mean/stupid or needlessly heroic/amazing-at-everything.<br/><br/>Horribly overrated.

"loganjhanselman","1","9","20","9 January 2019"," Overhyped and not scary
","I just finished Bird Box and was left disappointed.<br/><br/>When I first heard about it, there was plenty of hype surrounding it, and I'm a fan of horror movies myself, so of course my expectations were pretty high.<br/><br/>So, of course, I watched it, and I was left disappointed and I had a few questions as well, which I'll get to in a moment.<br/><br/>First, let's start with the cast. Such an A-list cast could've done better. First, you have Sandra Bullock who got her start in the 90s. Then, you have others like The Predator's Trevante Rhodes, Con Air's John Malkovich, Bohemian Rhapsody's Tom Hollander, and Rosa Salazar who's starring in the upcoming Alita: Battle Angel. Honestly, such an A-list cast could've been much better.<br/><br/>Then, there's the premise. Although it seems somewhat similar to that of A Quiet Place or The Happening, it was a perfectly good premise that was wasted for a film like this.<br/><br/>Next, we have the dialogue. Most of it was predictable or out-of-place. Plus, the profanity just felt thrown in there in order to avoid a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Finally, the ""creatures"". I was expecting a big creature reveal at the end, but the creatures were never shown. Before I go on, I understand why they weren't shown because the filmmakers wanted to add a sense of mystery, and they also looked ridiculous. But, I'd rather have a ridiculous creature than no creature at all.<br/><br/>Speaking of the ending, it was too ambiguous for my liking, and I wish it wasn't just hashed in there. A school for the blind? It's smart and all, but it just felt thrown in there.<br/><br/>Earlier, I said that I had questions about the film, so here they are:<br/><br/>-Where did Lucy and Felix go?
-What was the deal with Gary?
-Why did the eyes of those who saw the creatures change?
-How many creatures were there?
-Where did the creatures come from?
-Are any of Gary's drawings of the creatures accurate?
-Why did Malorie's kids have no names until the final scene?
-Where did those Marauders come from?
-Why was a great cast wasted in this film?
-Can I have my 2 hours back?<br/><br/>Overall, not that great of a film."
"my_method","2","9","20","1 January 2019"," Very Bland
","As a fan of both Sandra Bullock and this particular genre of film, I found Bird Box to be massively lacking in substance. Sure, Bullock does a good job of the character as she's a terrifc actor but the script just doesn't hold any substance to let her character really shine. The ""things"" people saw really should have been shown to the veiwer to enable us to engage properly with the threat. To merely see some leaves wafting around and hear generic 'spooky voices' feels such a half arsed attempt. There was a real opertunity to show exactly what (at least the main characters) were seeing. The children did a good job although I have seen many other films where the acting from children of this age has been far superior. Again, there were no stand out moments for either of them.<br/><br/>Finally, for there to be no explanation what so ever as to what happend just felt like such a waste. I can't imagine there will be a second film so we won't get any answers.<br/><br/>To summerize
1.Threat level didn't ever feel real or particularly scary
2.Group of characters were very generic, cool black guy, young stoners, grumpy old man, chinese guy, pregnant woman, wierdo.
3.A 'nothing' ending
4.Bullock the only reason worth watching"

","Bird Box is a mix between A Quiet Place and The Happening - not as good as the former but much better than the latter.<br/><br/>This horror film follows a pregnant woman (Sandra Bullock) and her group of companions as they struggle to survive after the arrival of mysterious creatures whose mere sight turns people crazy and suicidal.<br/><br/>If you were annoyed by the plot holes of A Quiet Place (a film I loved, but it does have many implausibilities), Bird Box will make your brain boil. A huge dose of suspension of disbelief is necessary to accept how these constantly blindfolded people can do things like drive around (using GPS, but still...), hike through a forest, navigate a river on a boat.<br/><br/>The film is well-crafted enough that the inherent absurdity of these situations didn't irritate me, although it did often feel like the (blind) elephant in the room.<br/><br/>There is a nice amount of tension, but the movie misses some major opportunities. First, we often hear the creatures but never get to see them. Now, giving us a full, clear look of the monsters would have been idiotic and broken the whole film, as no CGI beastie could have lived up to the main premise.<br/><br/>The moviemakers should have designed some kind of Lovecraftian/Gigerian eldritch abomination, resisting the temptation to show it in its entirety but giving us just some glimpses: an eye, a claw, a tentacle, scratches on a wall, footprints in the mud (think the first act of A Quiet Place minus the initial bridge scene).<br/><br/>There are some neat ideas - when the monsters are close, birds go wild and gravity seems slightly disrupted, with leaves and hairs floating upward - but the premise was screaming for more of this stuff. In fact, they could have gone full Lovecraft, adding details like constellations in the night sky being slightly off, weather out of control, people plagued by nightmares...<br/><br/>Also, the creatures never physically attack the survivors; they represent a constant threat, but a somewhat passive one. There is a chase in a forest which should be terrifying but is only tense...because we have no indication the creatures will *do* anything to our protagonists if they catch them. Sure, the concept of these monsters you can't even look at is creepy, but it's never going to feel as scary to our mammalian brains as something which is physically, actively trying to kill you.<br/><br/>Imagine Alien... if the Xenomorph could hurt you ONLY if you look at it. It's still a frightening scenario, but it doesn't quite pack the same punch, does it?<br/><br/>In fact, a group of victims introduced late in the film - when exposed to the creatures they don't kill themselves but turn insane and force other people to watch - feel more menacing than the actual monsters.<br/><br/>Still, I enjoyed the film. Director Susan Bier does a great job with the material she is given. Performances are solid: Bullock is excellent and her character feels believably flawed without going overboard; John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson and Tom Hollander are fine in secondary roles.<br/><br/>7/10"

This film started so calm and went down hill fast i wonder if the couple who stole car survived.
This film was good to watch but dragged out and ending with people outside was stupid. Iam not fan of sandra bollook she was so bad in speed2, but this is her best film since speed one. The performance of john malkovich was also good just wanted Douglas to escape garage and shoot that weird bloke Gary. Lil Rel Howery performance was good hes like the crazy black man in Scary Movie -Anthony Anderson i thought it was same guy but hes from getout and he was best actor in that movie. Did anyone else think Tom was come on to Malorie a bit quick and it looked a bit creapy hes sob story in iraq, i don't think that story could be true americans soldiers on school run .

The movie's plot had a great concept, but it was not developed into completed product. I do not need every sub-plot resolved, but this movie failed to resolve the most important component: what were the entities? Yes, at the beginning a character suggested they were ""demons"" but that did not explain why they only could control some people by seeing them.

The movie is good up to the 30 first minutes, then the story is pure stupidity and underestimates the intelligence of the people that is watching it.

"camvillarmarketing","1","4","7","26 December 2018"," It's inexplicable how anyone could think this movie would work.
","I really disliked this movie. A lot. Where to begin?<br/><br/>First there's the boilerplate ""suddenly all hell breaks loose"" plot trope that has been used in many zombie movies already. Something happens, we don't know what, a virus? Even the tv screens tuned to the news don't give you a clue. There's SOMETHING out there causing people to go crazy eyed and kill. And it happens within minutes! It's like this idea was pulled off a rack and plugged in as the start of the story. Unoriginal, predictable, boring. Why? Because you've seen it dozens of times in better movies!<br/><br/>Then there's the jumping back and forth throughout the entire movie! ""5 years ago"". ""4 years later"". ""Later on today, or maybe tomorrow"". It's lazy and annoying when a story can't be told in a mostly linear fashion. It's typically used to hide major deficiencies, and that is certainly the case here. And don't get me started on the ridiculously impossible idea that you can't look with your eyeballs while outside! Or even inside sometimes. The fools in this movie drive cars with the windows blacked out (they use GPS, duh!), they navigate RIVERS with their small children in the boat, they fire guns at threats without any idea if they are even close to hitting anything... the stupidity and implausibility of this major plot point cannot be adequately put into words.<br/><br/>And finally, the twist ending if you will, was just as flat and irrelevant as could be. Oh, and did I mention you never NEVER see the thing that causes people to become suicidal zombies? Unless swirling leaves and shadows passing overhead count.<br/><br/>No, this movie ripped me off big time. If you say ""but the acting was good"", you really have different reasons for watching a movie than I do."

This was better than 'A Quiet Place', which is similar in terms of 'horror'. Strong cast, Sandra Bullock is great with her emotions to a point I get angry. Yet I see why she is this way, to separate herself from emotions so she can fight for survival. The children are lovable and my heart hurt for them at times.<br/><br/>So to those who are disappointed, saying this isn't 'horror', well you obviously don't see the horror in living this kind of life and the intense dread this film provided.

","This movie does not take it's time to kick off! It gets straight into the action from the beginning, which I liked. I saw the trailer and was only half way through and just had to start watching before finishing the trailer, because it grasped my attention enough, to not want any spoilers. The performance from Sandra Bullock was what captures you to watch the movie, she expresses the emotion of fear to a high degree. I could really picture myself in the environment within the movie also. If this movie were ever to be a reality, it would be a world not worth living in, so for me, this movie scares me. This movie really gives you that, ""edge of my seat experience"" and *SPOILER* I don't know why, but the concept that the characters had to look at the ""entity"" or whatever it was, in the air.. that put them in a suicidal trance, was enough for me to hide behind my pillow at the moments that any light was close to their eyes within the movie. I really found the movie captured my attention, I actually had to pause the movie in the middle because I don't know why, but the thought of a world, where I was unable to see in fear of becoming possessed by something I couldn't explain, is apparently a new fear of mine. This is the only movie that has affected me for a while this way, I never get scared while watching movies and I have seen end of world movies such as World War Z for example.<br/><br/>I'm glad the movie does not have a visible entity in which you can visualise what it is that was controlling people to commit suicidal acts. This for me, allows the viewer to visualise and question, what is it that could be so terrifying to make someone go that insane? Some people may be disappointed by this. But I personally believe that if they were to put a face to whatever it was, then I believe that viewers would also be disappointed."

Particularly if told from the stand point of the survivors: if this truly happened, no one may have been able to figure out why and how it happened, but they'd figure out the bare minimum to survive.
Great acting. Great characters. The tension to me was more important than the number of actual scares. Great ending (what more did you want out of it? There was enough closure in this one).
Some of the secondary characters could have been a little more developed. Also, a minor point: Some criticized how Sandra Bullock was running in the forest holding two kids, and I agree that they should have made it a little more believable as a person running blindfolded typically would seem more careful and scared of slamming into trees.

The sanctuary for the blind existed long before the invasion & the blind can't see which can not be influenced by the creatures ""yet"". If that dont make sense then u need to stop watching movies to figure things out lol....<br/><br/>To me this movie speaks a lot of metaphors. 1 thing we all can agree on is the unknown mystery surrounding the creatures. The metaphors I'm thinking of were more like... Taking the ability to ""see"" for granted, but just as easily close the world around us only to shun the unseen. Till something drastic happens to the only ones we have close to us..
Malorie was closing the world out around her, but would indirectly paint her feelings for others to see. She watched her friend die left to survive out of the blue which will change anyone. In the case of this movie the will to live & protect the 2 kids gave Malorie a whole new perspective on life. I think she will be looking for revenge over the death of Jessica..... Now one question to leave in everyone's head.
Y and how did Dr. Lapham survive??? Kinda makes think was this some kind of science creation for the blind gone wrong, but a few bad apples in the business accepted the purge like after math. Another resident evil over lord lol.<br/><br/>Can u say part 2?
PS...... I don't think Tom should have died that way & was kind of lame! I think both Tom & Malorie should have hid the kids lured them into the house & killed them off together. Only to leave either Malorie or 1 of the kids to kill the last one that killed Tom at the last second of some sort bad timing."

"jblackn","3","5","10","28 December 2018"," High hopes, big let downs
","Let's start with the good. The story line showed promise. With all the suspense and drama a good movie starts with, and a plot that comes on thick with twists. Then it happened. The agenda of today's Hollywood. Although the cast is talented with only marginalized hints of B acting. The actual push to make the participants as diverse as possible (which, unless you live in a bubble in a big city on a coast, is completely unrealistic) and with political innuendos that can ruin any movie with potential. This movie does it. Imagine the most selfish a-hole in the movie is an adult Caucasian male who makes political references in negative forms and condescends on all the other characters. There is a small saving grace for this character, but the damage is done. 1/2 the audience is alienated. The female will be the hero, while anyone who isn't a minority in some form will be either evil or selfish or both. While all minority's will be sacrificial and caring in this cast. Every single evil person in this movie is Caucasian. Every single one. Except, of course, Sandra Bullock and two other supporting females. Even though the movie is ripe with diversity. It's a sad time that movies are so ruined by politics that you can't even enjoy a mental get-a-way with a movie anymore. I miss the Pulp Fictions, Breakfast Clubs and the Shawshanks where movies were just that. But back to the plot. The thing that bothers me the most of ANY good horror/thriller is what I call the ""Blair witch project effect"". They avoid the biggest thrill by never allowing you to put a face or body to monster(s) they all fear. That is the weakest part of the film. Fear of nothing is big these days and seems to be the M.O. of today's hot topics. Fear with no foundation is laughable but seems 50% of the audience doesn't mind. This could have been a great movie in respect to a fairly decent plot. The actors were good. But everyone is so drunk on the political poison that it ruins the party. Every. Single. Time. Thanks Hollywood. Smh."

"najresponso","6","7","16","27 December 2018"," An overhyped film with a story that brings you nowhere
","Due to the trend in different social media pages, this movie earned a lot of praises due to its, say, ""new"" concept. However, anyone who's watched Wahlberg's ""The Happening"" know that this is not something new. Anyway, I still gave it a try.<br/><br/>Let's start it off with the acting, Sandra Bullocks' (Malorie) performance is outstanding, as she has always been. I can almost see some Winona Ryder (Stranger Things) in her eyes and her acting. This is hands-down the best thing the movie has. The rest of the cast was meh.. except for like John Malkovich (Douglas).<br/><br/>Now the most frustrating part this movie ever had to offer is the most important story. It actually brings you nowhere. Too many angle that the story could interestingly turn into but it kept moving straightward into nothing. The movie only focused on the question ""who should die next?"". And to sum that up, we got a whole bunch of UNDERDEVELOPED characters dying! When people get killed I was like ""What was his name again?"". Really, characters were forgettable and their deaths won't even bother you. Movies really had to put on some character-development on their characters, its extremely important. It's one tool the viewers can feel some attachment to the film. But this film just kept on throwing in some new faces and kill them off later on.
The movie only focuses on survival, that's it. It's like 80% of the dialogue aren't important. The only important plot only appeared on like the last quarter of the film, and it explains why they're on the river at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Too many questions this movie left. We don't even know what these creatures are, why they came or what are their purpose. They just kept on going with full killing frenzy except for the psychopathic maniacs. We don't even know why they can't enter a house. The world this film made was too thin.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie has some great potential, but wasted. It lacks explanation. You remain in dark for the entire time and questions never get answered. The ending was a disappointment that added more questions to the already hundred questions you had when watching the entire film."

"SnoopyStyle","6","3","5","19 May 2019"," structural flaw
","Malorie (Sandra Bullock) harshly lays out the rules to two young kids named Boy and Girl. They are going on a difficult river trip. They have to stay quiet and can never ever take off their blindfolds. The situation begins five years earlier. People are going mad and killing themselves. Malorie is extremely pregnant and her boyfriend has left. She's at a checkup with her sister Jessica (Sarah Paulson) when she first encounters the happening. She escapes the chaos and finds shelter with various people inside a house.<br/><br/>This is a variation on The Happening with a touch of A Quiet Place. Here the thing about The Happening. I didn't hate it. Mark Wahlberg and the reveal almost get me to hate it but I like the concept just enough to overcome it. The mass suicide angle is good although the deaths in this one is much more kinetic and therefore much more harrowing. There are a few problem, the biggest being the structure. Basically, the flashforward structure reveals who are probably going to die. The movie should have started with Malorie laying out the rules but the audience cannot see who she's talking to. It should have played the movie chronologically after that. By revealing the final grouping, it sucks the tension right out of the movie. Along with that, there are issues with some of the characters' actions. Someone should be in the room with Greg ready to pull the plug on the monitor. He is basically performing an experiment and it needs someone else to monitor it. When the group decides to leave the grocery store, there is no reason why Douglas wouldn't want to stay. In fact, it would be easier to move the group to the store rather than the other way around. While I understand locking up Douglas, somebody is supposed to look through Gary's bag. At the very least, I would have tied up Gary and put him under questioning. When the girls start the contractions, somebody should release Douglas. They need another set of hands. Instead of braving the rapids, it would be safer to walk it, no matter how much longer it would take. Despite all these issues, I do find the concept very compelling and it pulls me into its world."

The whole movie is just too perfect in how things worked out for her. It was decent entertainment but not a very good movie. The only reason I rated the movie a 6 is because of the acting.

","Any movie requires some sort of suspension of disbelieve. Bird Box is riddled with so many bad plot points (actions people would never do or things in places they would never be) that the film is just ruined. The concept is decent but the writer absolutely blew it on believably. It is hard to believe the writing went through any sort of editing process. Like, if someone writes in a book that there is a horse on the moon, you as an editor are supposed to point out that that could never happen since there is no air there. So you remove the horse or you write something plausible to explain how it is breathing.<br/><br/>Now imagine about 50 mistakes of that level of absurdity in a movie. It was just too much to overcome.<br/><br/>It was a tense movie, kept me nervous here and there, but would have liked some explanation for why the things that happened... happened.<br/><br/>Bullock is a national treasure. She does well. Keeps you engaged in each scene. Most of the cast was actually pretty good, some interesting characters.

The amount of time dedicated to positive character building is limited and focuses around Sandra's boyfriend.<br/><br/>The plot is mostly filled with non horror based elements, which due to the settings and the hollow characters that have all been built up to be unlikable, is very dry. I don't care that the cars sensors go off, I don't care about the fat pregnant girls life story, or the old man explaining his motives, and the outside doesn't interest me because you know the film won't show you the monsters, the river journey is so unexplained and impossible that I used the river scenes to check my phone.<br/><br/>In order for a movie to be scary or to make you feel peril, there has to be genuine worry and stress exerted on you as the audience. To build stress and worry you need the characters to be worried and stressed...and they can only do that with reasons to be worried (tick) , risk of death (tick), a reason to survive (the kids of course) , a logic to the thing that is risking their lives so that the audience could relate and imagine themselves in that situation (.... No...) And facial expressions to show that they do actually care... Which would be hard if the supporting actors were pretty uninspiring...and the lead actress had Botox done...which would be bad because it would render her facial expressions flat and lifeless which would kill a horror movie. Oh Sandra.<br/><br/>The ending is pretty useless too and only stands to lessen the fear factor of the monsters.<br/><br/>Good concept, good visuals, poor execution of the other movie necessary components."

Something I wish the movie did was show us what the people were seeing like their worst fear that made them do what they did obviously I know what they were doing they want you as the veiwer to kinda imagine what they see use your imagination to try to see what they were seeing But overall that's my thought on the movie if you are gonna watch the movie don't think that's it's gonna be the best movie ever because your gonna be disappointed.

It is difficult to enjoy a movie when there are constant plot holes and the lead characters behave in an unnatural, unbelievable manner.
I feel sorry for Sandra Bullock - who is the only notable stand out in this b quality movie.

"mtrburrows","3","3","5","3 January 2019"," Wasted concept
","The idea behind the antagonistic force and the political allegory that Bird Box offers is compelling, but neither are expanded upon even remotely enough to provide a satisfying 2 hour experience.<br/><br/>The best word to explain bird box is ""confused"", with concepts and character arcs that are set up with no interesting exploration or payoff. The rules of the monstorous force are not established or explained, leading to confusing moments regarding how it affects humans differently and what it is actually capable of. The main character is established in an exposition-heavy 10 minute dialogue fest (which I somewhat appreciate for getting to the point, with some decent chemistry with the wasted sister character), but her inner conflicts never come into play to make her interesting until the very end of the 2 hour run time. This character moment is better than nothing, but it undoubtedly required more set up to be powerful in any way. Even the plot device the film is named after - the fact that birds can sense danger, doesn't come into play at all throughout the film, providing only a catchy title.<br/><br/>The characters of the film are mostly unwatchable, with rushed introductions and motivations, no subtlety, and even less originality. Sandra bullock gives the best performance she possibly can with what little character she's given, but none of the other actors stood out to me, all ranging from good to cheesily bad, with John Malkovich giving an awful performance this time round.<br/><br/>Overall, Bird Box is incredibly unsatisfyingly considering it's concept and early reception, which could have worked after a couple more rewrites that fixed issues with the characters, rules, and pacing."

Similar to A Quiet Place, it's a survival based thriller in which people can't open their eyes outside or they either kill themselves or become killers (it's hard to tell which will happen)<br/><br/>This means a lot of travelling blindfolded for supplies, safe shelter etc. It's your standard group survival movie with a twist and a few big names that keep that element interesting.<br/><br/>SPOILERS- The movie loses its grasp when we get to present day and only Sandra Bullock and her children are left. They are headed to a sanctuary which they eventually reach, live happily ever after, roll credits. The problem is there is absolutely no explanation as to what's causing this outbreak and why some people don't kill themselves when they open their eyes. It makes no effort to distinct between the two possibilities. There's some loose idea that it's demons of some kind, but nothing solid. It's not done well and is evident they ran out of ideas.<br/><br/>Worth a watch if you're bored, but I wouldn't go out my way to seek this film out as its ending is rather disappointing."

Either way, the story, direction, the journey and acting was pretty damn entertaining, keeps you hooked. I mean do I want to know the creepy aliens killed the world or whether handful of humans survived fighting them? I have seen it before, I know a guy called Tom Cruise!.. so yea I thought the characters and their journey was so relatable and real, their struggle was real. And, it also manages to be bit unpredictable for me (person, who has seen a lot of ""end of world"" movies ok!) on more than one occasions. So that's big thumbs up and I would totally recommend it.

","As this is a largish creature of some sort, what is its need to get people to kill themselves? At no point is the reason to get people to kill themselves ever mentioned or explained. ""It"" isn't eating people, so it's clearly not for food. Also, there is no biological need for an animal to cause fear to get you to kill yourself. Like lions or sharks, it would be specially evolved to dispatch you in the most calorie-preserving way possible, fangs, claws, teeth, beaks.
Fear (even if brought on by some induced delusion) causes fight or flight responses, not suicide. If it is giving off a chemical like a pheromone or energy such as ultra low frequency waves to induce this trauma, chemicals and ULF can't be transmitted over a video screen! (see the demise of BD Wong for that)
Whatever ""it"" is, it propagates too quickly for a large animal, spreading worldwide in too short of a time for something that is likely just about the size of a bear.

So, here goes...<br/><br/>The opening 30 minutes is a fairly captivating experience and builds a nice level of suspense that keeps you wanting more. HOWEVER, that is about as good as it gets as things quickly tail away when things start to ""fall apart"" for the main cast. From that point on, the movie is littered with unanswered questions, which really add nothing to the story!<br/><br/>To note a few - How can these powerful 'entities' that swarm the planet not enter buildings, but can kill you through through CCTV/recordings? Why are they here? How did they get here? I can only assume the reason for some people being immune is the reference to the mental asylum, and that psychologically ill people's brains can't be affected... who knows? What ever happens to the pair that steal the car, why are they even in the story? But, this is a common theme throughout the story as there is no real emotional connection to any cast member, as their deaths come quickly and fairly uneventfully (for an apocalyptic style death). Not to mention that only Sandra Bullock and her kids are the only ones on the boat, so you know everyone dies.. What to say about the ending, I mean, really? They make it to their idyllic compound, with all the blind people who can't see the entities... hoorah!

","Yes, it is similar to ""A Quiet Place"" in the sense that people cannot look instead of people not being able to make a sound in order to be safe. However, it is still a good movie in its own right. A movie does not have to be totally original or like no other movie in order to be excellent. The writing, the acting, the cinematography, the suspense, the terror, the unpredictably, etc are all on point in this movie. It has enough tragedy and death to make you sad but not enough to make you feel bad at the end of the movie. Every death, in some way or another, was unavoidable given the circumstances. When acts of kindness lead to death, you could easily see that there was no other way for the people to behave differently and still be good people or not lose their humanity. The ending of the movie was great or not unrealistic at all. The only thing that could make this movie better is a sequel in which it is explained just what the creatures were.<br/><br/>P.S. Someone said the character, Tom, made the dumbest decisions in the movie. I disagree. He made decisions any good human being would have made, especially one who had served in the military. Perhaps their real problem is that he was black and on top of that was romantically involved with Marjorie, who was white.<br/><br/>P.S.S. Marjorie was not too old to be a new mother, given her tendency to not connect with people or connect with them the right way and the fact she was around 48 or 49 when she got pregnant."

","Rather than bash other reviewers I'll just say what I thought of this movie, which is the point isn't it?<br/><br/>A fairly interesting, if unoriginal premise - unseen beings make you commit suicide when you look at them - starts off quickly, but unfortunately goes nowhere.<br/><br/>There are all the typical end-of-the-world cliches here folks. Do not expect anything new. The characters are the same generic group that you would expect and I swear they were yanked directly from the latest Dawn Of The Dead movie. The plot progresses pretty much as you'd expect with very little suspense and not even a single jump scare. While engaging, it never quite was enough to make me care about what was happening on the screen. And it moves slowly while it goes nowhere. When the end finally comes, it's pretty much what you'd expect and I even had a nice laugh at a very familiar hero name....<br/><br/>Worth a watch? Not really. There is far better fare out there for this genre that is better written, better acted and better directed. What should have been an average Outer Limits or Black Mirror episode is dragged out for over 2 hours and will leave you disappointed. Instead I would highly suggest watching an episode of the previous mentioned shows. Even an average one will only waste half the time this snore-fest will."

Where did they come from? What do they want? Okay, do we? I admit I fast forwarded a little, out of despair. I have not read the book this film is based on, so there's that. But there is nothing new here, and what is here is all too familiar. People gathered together during a something apocalypse who mostly die. And the people were stupid. And the acting was all fairly good. The children were good. Sandra was good. Good acting however, can't save this movie. I also had a problem with the flashback/forwards.

","Ok let's get one of the biggest things out of the way that happened with the release of this film, the comparisons to ""A Quiet Place""<br/><br/>Yes they share a similar premise with the most major change being that it's a different sense of the 5 senses (sight instead of sound), however it should be noted that the novel of the same name came out before A Quiet Place.<br/><br/>Ok with that out of the way, how is the actual movie?
It's ok, it's not great, and it's not as good as A Quiet Place, it suffers from a thin script in a thick concept, the character development is a bit weak and it doesn't really have an ending, it kind of just stops. However the mystery around what causes people to commit suicide and the followers is incredibly interesting with a better script would have served well with giving us more information of the followers of the thing. Another thing is that the acting is really good this is of course partially due to Sandra Bullock but the other actors do their jobs extremely well too.<br/><br/>Overall this film while not high art is good for a few viewings however it does suffer from some faults but I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Honestly this is more of a 6.5/10"

For example, guys wife burns herself alive while guy stands and watches from the window (doesn't really seem all that bothered by it). Bullocks Sister kills herself IN FRONT of her, however again, there is no real reaction just a bit upset. imo this is a painfully long story about some unknown supernatural identity which you never find out about that makes really corny actors kill themselves. Plus a bunch of totally unrealistic elements. Sandra Bullock rowing down a river for 48 hours straight with a blindfold on, on her own, she gets attacked and stabs the guy with a machete (blindfold still on) after wasting her bullets shooting. Goes down white water rapids with 2 kids called 'boy' and 'girl' (yep! Way to stretch the imagination there) with boat, tips, boat tips over yet they end up coming right up in shore and follow birds in the woods to a blind school (blindfolds still on) and end up living happily ever after!

No, the movie was a thrill from beginning till the end. Someone here wrote that the movie should be 15 minutes long, because nothing is happening. Plenty is happening. For once i didnt feel boredom.<br/><br/>Why some people doesnt like the movie? First I thought it is because noone explained what and where the main threat came from. But no, in the movie it is explained in the beginning that those are some demons/creatures that came here to cleanse the sins of people, by killing them all. Ok, fair enough.
Then i thought the end will suck, leaving me with no real conclusion to the movie.
Again no, they found a safe house where the children could grow up in somewhat normal conditions.
Also the cast for the children was perfect,especially the girl, she was so sweet and almost made me cry when she volunteered to navigate on the river, and risk her life by looking.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I really liked the movie.

","Boy, this has got to be the dumbest movie I have seen all week. Maybe all month. After suffering through the silly negative reviews recently of an average sci fi film, IO, I may return to that low budget Indie film and up my star rating just to balance things out with Bird Box, since we cannot issue negative stars. The premise, even with the greatest suspension of disbelief, was lame: looking at aliens made everyone go mad. So Sandra Bullock spent the whole movie stumbling around blindfolded and yelling at two little kids to keep their blindfolds on. only to find her way to a safe place, a school for the blind (duh). I wonder if American Humane (originally founded to protect children AND animals) was alerted to this child abuse on set. At least IO had some semi intelligent dialogue, although it was a fairly pokey film, but no gun play, machete slashings, scissors stabbings (John Malkovich got it that way!), squishing heads with cars, stepping into burning cars, jumping in front of speeding trucks, all of which and more pervade this waste of time, Bird Box."

"drqshadow-reviews","4","2","3","11 February 2019"," A Dark, Somber Re-Hash which Delights in Asking Questions without Answers
","Sandra Bullock plays a harsh, survival-driven mom in this big budget mishmash of several preceding genre films. Amidst a chilly natural backdrop and some violent, high-pressure scenarios, we revisit the awkward suicide device of The Happening, the heavy-handed sensory horror gimmick of A Quiet Place and the grim, dystopian parenting themes of The Road. A few scenes stand out, rare moments where Bird Box dares to set itself apart and try something different, but they don't last long and for most of the running time the thematic similarities are tough to escape.<br/><br/>Bullock's performance is similarly on-and-off. In the harsh opening scene, wherein she barks out a series of chilly, no-nonsense instructions to her two very young children, she's excellent. Stuck in an impossible situation, she hasn't the luxury for compassion nor softness, though her eyes bely an external poker face. Her role peaks in that first scene, however, and as the film staggers to its conclusion, she proves unable to cover for some very questionable screenwriting decisions.<br/><br/>Much of the film's most pressing questions go unanswered, left to vaporize in viewers' minds, and while that could be chalked up to atmosphere in the hands of a proficient writer or director, Bird Box is blessed with neither. Instead, it just feels lazy, especially when paired with an abundance of plot holes and silly coincidences. I appreciate what it was trying to be, but I don't really care for what it became."

It focuses on this flashback where the protagonist and a bunch of other undeveloped characters in this house under siege from the menace. It's at once very slow and forces way to many characters and ideas into a short space of time. It has too many coincidences, it demands me to admire a character who is actually too reckless to like and Sandra Bullock's character is just cold and annoying.<br/><br/>I played cinema sins and it scored 165. Even the present set part is wasted as it gets eclipsed by this arbitrary theme of maternity. It is completely contrived and unsatisfying. Even if you hated kids, if you had to take care of a couple you would give them names, even if you didn't think about it. You wouldn't call them ""boy"" or ""girl"" unless you were making a point.

So imagine my disappointment when I found out that this film was just another gimmicky horror flick that plays on one specific part of human nature (being able to see) instead of actually being a film. You've probably heard this by now, but this film is pretty much Netflix's ""A Quiet Place"" but only without the few things that made Quiet Place slightly above average. The acting is good, but other than that, there's nothing else. It's just an absolute bore of a film that at no point had my interest. Horror films that try and take something away from humans to see how we survive like being able to see or make noise are, in my opinion, lazy. Why not write something with the good elements of horror that people like without needing a gimmick and some semi-likable characters? Halloween didn't need a gimmick, Friday the 13th didn't need a gimmick, so why does this need a gimmick?

Sandra Bullock plays an artist with NO ties to anyone, although her sister comes by to visit and remind her that she needs to get a life. Sandra becomes pregnant, with no man in sight, and monster apocalypse happens. THIS (these?) monster attacks you by making you sui-homi-cidal if you see it. If you're ""good"" you kill yourself.

","I have been left disappointed over Christmas with some of the so called high profile series or Netflix top of the tree picks. Bird Box is a ""End of the World"" type thing without the Zombies or Aliens or Virus or Meteors or anything else visible that usually wipes us out. In fact as well as the invisible there isn't a lot great about what is visible. There is no Horror in something that you cant see or ever do see. People bumping around in blindfolds to protect themselves from something that you can't see especially if your the audience is new and novel and does not work. Having the perspective of the actor looking at the inside of a blindfold is nothing short of boring. I tended not to care about any of the survivors and most were quite unlikeable and carboard typie figures. The scene were they drive to the supermarket in a blacked out car and use the satnav to get there is laughable and obviously GPS has survived the worlds demise. Why this film incorporates a Bird Box is any ones guess, Hamster cage would have been just as fitting but I suppose the hamster cage would have sank in the rivers rapids,were as the Birdy Box never and the three little birds survived to tweet another day.......sadly.

No substance, no suspense, not thrilling and to be brutal but frank - literally no storyline. There is really no progression from the 1st minute to the 120th minute other than the fact they're now stuck in another building still helpless but with more people, in the middle of a forest with no amenities therefore giving a more imminent doom! THIS FILM DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.
Very unrealistic scenes, would a 5 year whom is capsised into rapids survive let alone survive whilst still holding onto a box of birds whom too survive. This child what, swam through treacherous rapids blindfolded WHILST MAINTAINING TO HOLD ONTO A BOX FULL OF LIVE BIRDS!
Also - why is there a school for the blind in the middle of a forest - ALSO - how was Malorie been able to run through the forest with both children, blindfolded and not run into one bush/tree? Also for like 90% of the film nothing really happens, there is void dialogue that adds nothing to the actual story & I sadly use the term 'story' very loosely as there really isn't one - there is legitimately no development throughout.

<ul><li>Something in the sky (that casts a shadow) makes you go suicidal crazy when you see it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>You can be affected via a video feed (huh, ok - not really sure how that works, but ok)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It doesn't make people already 'crazy', suicidal. It just turns them calm</li></ul>evangelists wanting you to join them by looking at the beautiful truth.<br/><br/><ul><li>It requires eyesight to effect you, simply being blindfolded keeps you from going mad.</li></ul><br/><br/>-----------<br/><br/>Unanswered questions;
<ul><li>Does crazy sky monster work at night? (Sort of the opposite of the movie Pitch Black?). It seems to require sunlight sky to 'get you'. Simply covering windows or your eyes is all it takes to not be affected. Does it work on a cloudy day? The movie never really address this obvious hole in the mystery.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What if you just never look UP into the sky? (where is seems to be) A good baseball cap could make for a great defense tool.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why do the birds not react to ALL people affected (like the Evangelists)? Whatever triggers them to react is inconsistent (and painfully convenient to the script.) The birds in ""Bird Box"" (canaries in a coal mine) are just a writing conceit so they could come up with a clever mysterious title for the film.</li></ul><br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>Extra rules (that I imagined) that would have made this WAY more interesting and they could have easily added to improve the story (and still not given away the mystery);<br/><br/><ul><li>Pregnant women are unaffected. (it seemed like they were going there with the story but never followed through)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Pre-pubescent children (or younger than 6 years old) are unaffected - as soon as they reach puberty they become susceptible to the crazy sky monster.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It can't affect you in extreme darkness so travel at night is the key to moving about in this new world.</li></ul><br/><br/>With the 'extra rules' - it would have evolved to a world where the pregnant women and children run things and sighted men are relegated to the darkness or blindfolded in the day, lead by the unaffected and making sure women stayed pregnant. (not so bad when you think about it)<br/><br/>About the movie - it was beautifully shot, had a number of respectable actors in it and was easy to leave on because you kept hoping something would make sense - but in the end it never does and you spend your time writing reviews that won't make any difference.

I would definitely say none of them are memorable though. I honestly can't remember any of their names outside of Gary. There really wasn't a lot of character development outside of the main character, and even that was fairly limited.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough and easy to follow. The movie was definitely not boring, but it wasn't nearly the thriller that people led me to believe it to be. The ending was not shocking by any means and was very obvious about halfway through the movie. I kind of got the feel of The Walking Dead, but with living people.<br/><br/>If this is your kind of movie, by all means check it out. It isn't terrible by any means.

-""Husband"" sacrifices himself to save the family and dies.
-It's a family of four: Woman, Man, Boy, Girl.
-You cannot see / You cannot make noise.<br/><br/>
Problems:
-It feels like a bad M. Night Shyamalan movie (ref: The Happening, which is basically the same story)
-The dialogue is quite laughable with Sandra Bullock. It feels like you're watching one of her old rom-com movies, specially from the start till you get to the car accident part. Maybe this is due to her mostly acting in those kind of roles. It was uncomfortable to watch to say the least.
-Character development is almost non-existent and silly, almost as if a child has done it.
-Many characters are unnecessary, and felt that they were created only to advance the story forcefully. Or at least they could've been introduced/developed better.<br/><br/>Basically lazy writing in general. It's almost as if the script didn't get a second opinion and somebody insisted on it as is.

","The (former?) A-list actors in this move, including Sandra Bullock, actually just make the movie more pathetic with their simplistic single dimensional characters. That they signed on to this project is baffling.<br/><br/>The script could have been made feasible and the movie maybe interesting if the globally marauding killer 'entities' were somewhat realistic, perhaps a little explainable through science and maybe had a little bit of a back story. Instead, our dopey writers give us some ridiculous magic nebulous invisible evil creatures/ghosts/alien/somethings that somehow turn rational humans into delirious suicidal psychopaths if a person merely glances in their direction. Thanks to leading edge Hollywood magic (swirling vortex of leaves) we can tell where the things happen to be (accompanied by some vortex'y evil wind sounds, of course). These magic entities however, cannot, for some inexplicable reason, go indoors, even though they appear to have come from another dimension or outer space or perhaps from across the river Hades (who knows!). So the few surviving humans can stay indoors (with window shades closed) and be impervious to the nefarious nebulosities. Well, until they must go outside to search for food. But the writers needed something more, something to bring it into line with the ever-popular Zombie/Vampire/Possession genres. A few of the humans don't self-annihilate but instead are infected and roam the landscape looking for survivors... so they can force survivors to look at the magic creatures.. and either die or if they are lucky, join them. Ugh. Children could come up with better more plausible scripts.<br/><br/>Along with the huge slide in the quality of Hollywood cinema, goes the quality of the viewer. Perhaps a nice break from the endless assault of superhero movies. But the vicious cycle of lowering the bar to try and find the beefiest cross-section of paying customers is killing modern cinema faster than a planet filled with ineffable mystery entities causing everyone to off themselves.<br/><br/>If you have any self-respect, stay away from this trash and seek out & support good cinema. It's going extinct.<br/><br/>And to the current crop of pandering Hollywood producers, directors, script writers etc... please find one of these mystery entities and look at them.

It was very well produced and completely my type of genre. Its the kind of movie that you kinda miss when its over. I thought the ending was very suitable too, unlike many others. My tip is to give it a watch, and i really hope you do, and love it as much as i did :)"

","I watched the movie immediately upon its release on N.....x and without having read any reviews first on IMDb.
My motivation was the media hype and in particular, high expectations of another stellar performance by Sandra Bullock after her spectacular role in Gravity.
Not.
I was not as much upset about her below radar appearance as stealthy as the invisible beings, most stars have one of those lapses in their acting careers, than by the storyline so full of holes envied by makers of Swiss cheese.
I struggled to comprehend the logic in one scene after another, to numerous to cite, that early into the painfully long script I just resigned myself to enjoy the acting. I patiently waited for Sandra to captivate me and take me along for a suspenseful ride instead of those birds, but at the end felt trapped as much as them in a black box, not seeing anything, just sensing a strange presence of something inexplicable.
And that's the point, how to explain such a movie that should never have been made."

","Oh my god, a tornado of excrement. Worse.<br/><br/>Starts off okay, has some promise. Pregnant Sandra Bullock sees TV people going crazy in Russia and shrugs it off. Can't happen here, she says. Maybe we're too stable, too grounded in reality.<br/><br/>Starts to fall down. Between one Starbucks run and another, suddenly everyone's infected. Nobody explains what / why / how / where or anything. Woman bangs her head bloody against the glass. Man falls on a spike. Wife calmly climbs in a burning car. Kid bangs himself dead over the head with a skateboard. Serious.<br/><br/>You just cannot look at these creatures without wanting to off yourself. But don't ask what creatures? Nobody has a whiff. Neither the writers, the director, or the cast. Take our word for it, they say. It's no good. We got some shadows and spookyish music to get you in the mood, but after that we just don't have a clue.<br/><br/>Still Sandra Bullock strong. Tough, more than macho. Fortunately all powerful malevolent creatures can't pass doors or news-papered windows. Otherwise, we wouldn't have a story; everyone would drink bleach in the first 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Hunkered. Behind the Sacramento doors that evil shall not pass. But food is getting low. And another pregnant woman knocks on the door. Please let me in she says. I've got a little bitty girl in my belly.<br/><br/>John Malkovich. No, no, no, he says. I'm just the merciless neighbor, but I protest.

Pregnant woman # 2 enters and forces pregnant woman # 1 Sandra Bullock to promise to take care of her baby if something happens.

Dangerous! everyone shouts, most stridently John Malkovich, but once gay guy house / shelter owner says ""it's only pixels"", everyone shambles on downstairs with a shrug to see if there's maybe a chance of nookie in the kitchen.<br/><br/>Falls down completely. 100%. The absolute absurd. Bust me with a granite crutch. Just moments after gay guy house / shelter owner declares that his system only shows the color temperatures of the outside objects, there he is, strapped into his desk chair for safety, watching regular black and white surveillance video like you'd see in any 7-11.<br/><br/>Naturally, he succumbs, and from there Bird Box just gets more ridiculous. Never mind consistency. Never mind believability that these unexplained malevolent creatures cause those who gaze upon them to instantly kill themselves except those who don't and instead drive around in gray Nissan sedans screeching tires in the middle of the forest. Never mind the ending. Bird Box suffers from a predictable Hollywood disease. It delivers what could be an interesting story with the assumption that the audience is only comprised of simpletons."

","Call me a sucker for almost any post apocalyptic film, Bird Box definitely won't be on any of my top ten lists. Sandra Bullock's acting is the only thing that keeps the movie afloat. While the movie is certainly gripping and nerve-wrecking, it is strictly attributed to the premise, a premise that we have actually seen many times over the years (you can't move, can't see, can't hear, can't touch, is can't smell coming up next or has that been done before?). Nothing is explained in the film, and the plot feels driven by convenience and not for cinematic purposes, the crazies, the voices, the birds, almost everything is there so the movie could keep going with no reasoning or logic. The ending is also extremely anti-climatic and convenient with a familiar face there to greet them."
"darthMisaskernew","4","1","1","29 March 2019"," Overhyped
","**I thought I posted this review months ago but for some reason it's not on my page. I'm not sure if it was deleted or if my submission just never went through or if my internet was bad or whatever. Here it is again**<br/><br/>Bird Box is really overhyped. I feel like the film was just very underwritten. I get that the monsters were never going to be seen and that's fine, but a lot of the other stuff just seems lazy. What happened to the two people who stole the car? Why was John Malkovich so forgiving to the woman who caused his wife's death? Why were some people brought to suicide but others enlightened or whatever? The script said that like those people had schizophrenia or something, but a lot of people were enlightened. Is half of the population schizophrenic in this film's universe? Because in real life nowhere near that many people would be alive. And are you really telling me Sandra Bullock and the buff black guy lived in total peace for five years before people came to their house? The big question I had is WHAT WERE THE THINGS? Were they monsters? Aliens? Demons? A military experiment gone wrong? Something in the air? Multidemensional beings? The funny guy from Get Out briefly hints that they may be some sort of Biblical demonic entity, but he's a fat slob who bumbles over his own two feet and is constantly being dumb so are we supposed to take his theory seriously? The rest of the movie is okay I guess but I don't really think the whole aspect was done well. There are a few good seens but there are tons of better and more logical ""a few years after the world has ended and we're the only ones left"" kind of movies, like A Quiet Place, It Comes At Night, I Am Legend, and Oblivion to name a few. Placing half of the movie on day one and then cutting ahead five years for the second half was a bad move, either pick one or the other."
"APRI6ION","4","1","1","25 March 2019"," A surprisingly uninspired, low-grade thriller especially considering its reputation and popularity.
","With the feverish hype surrounding its release I had been curious about Bird Box since it first hit Netflix, but the presence of the profoundly irritating Sandra Bullock had kept me at bay until I finally gave in. I wish I hadn't...<br/><br/>It's an intriguing high-concept plot that has elements of Lovecraft or Stephen King and the film does a somewhat efficient job of diving into the action without much delay but things quickly go south. Bird Box has little more to offer than a cast of laughably stereotypical characters divined from the greyest of cardboard and a host of jaw-droppingly predictable story beats. There is some unintentional fun to be had watching John Malkovich chewing on the scenery but this is essentially just a derivative star vehicle, which oscillates between dull and mediocre for two whole hours. With a better director at the helm and a ruthless rewrite of the script, a fun 90-minute B-movie could have been extracted; Sarah Paulson in the lead suggests a far more palatable film.<br/><br/>This will probably appeal to Bullock fans (I feel bad for you) and the undemanding, but for most viewers this will disappoint and bore in equal measure. Netflix continues to swell the ranks of a largely unremarkable catalogue of self-produced films that, 15 years ago, would have been relegated to a twilight slot on Channel 5 - sandwiched between repeat episodes of Hex and the Red Shoe Diaries. If the end of civilisation is your thing, there are countless better films out there.<br/><br/>4.5/10"

","Bird Box is quite fitting of a movie released at this time. It drips with 'viral'-reaction content like blindfolding and walking around trying not to hit things. And it's a poor re-creation of other horror movies where there's some psychological force causing people harm. And worst of all, by the time you reach the end, there's no resolution.

"ReviewSlayer","3","1","1","5 January 2019"," Emotionless
","So I did it. I finally watched Bird Box. Not because I was in desperate need to but mostly because I had become an unwilling member of an ever-dwindling community that was forced to navigate all of social media through a make-shift blindfold in order to avoid spoilers.<br/><br/>Here's my main problem with this film. There was a total void of emotion and lack of connection & realistic relationship contact from all characters. I don't know whether this is down to crappy writing or directing but it really noticed. It starts almost right away, in one of the beginning scenes Malorie (Bullock) & her sister Jessica (Paulson) see a news report on the TV about a mystery illness that's forcing people to kill themselves, seeing images of death and destruction & instead of trying to find out more about the issue they turn the TV off and say something like ""oh well it's in Russia"". They then have a discussion about a horse and Malories unborn child, joking around & seemingly unphased by what they had just seen. I guess you could argue that we see so many images of war & disease on the news everyday that we become desensitised to it but this was something different, something new. A mystery disease that made people kill themselves? Surely you'd show some sort of shock, disbelief, panic? But no, off they trotted to a doctors appointment.<br/><br/>The next example of this is when Jessica walks in front of a car after seeing the mysterious 'demons'. I get Malorie had just been in a car accident and was dazed, confused and caught up by the panic, but she showed no sign of well..anything really. She didn't even try to stop Jessica from killing herself. She doesn't even attempt to go towards the body, she just runs off in the opposite direction into the crowd. I know there's a scene a bit later in the film when she has a 5 second breakdown but it just seems a little hollow.<br/><br/>This happens again when then see Malorie fall to the ground amongst the chaos and a woman from a nearby house comes to her rescue after realising that she's pregnant. The lady then sees the 'demons' and climbs into a burning car whilst her husband (malkovich) watches from the window. Now I don't know about you but that for me would be a pretty traumatic experience. The most emotion we get from Malkovich in this scene is a slightly raised voice as he confronts Malorie with ""That woman was my wife, she went to help you"". The entire film is littered with these horrifying scenes but with little to no reaction from the group.<br/><br/>My thoughts whilst watching this film shifted mostly between ""Why is Sandra Bullock in this?"" & ""Seriously, how did they get Sandra Bullock?"". I get it, Netflix is the way forward and lots of A-listers are doing Netflix original films now but this really just felt like the producers/casting agent were in a meeting and jokingly spurted out Sandra's name as a wishful thought for lead actress and then when she actually agreed (without reading the script?) they were screwed with the remaining casting budget and just started picking names out of a hat from then on.<br/><br/>Apart from John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson & the little girl the supporting cast are terrible. They are either completely unmemorable and I have no comment on them or just so unnatural to acting that you remember them for all the wrong reasons. We have Lil Rel Howery (who I have never heard of but is apparently a comedian?) playing the annoying, cringeworthy character of Charlie a know-it-all, book writing, Apocalypse and demon ""expert"" who just happens to end up in the same house as our main character (eye-roll). The only purpose of Charlie is that he has the key to the supermarket and accompanied the rest of the survivors on a supply run before dying. All I can say is stick to the comedy Lil Rel because it can't be any worse than your lack of acting ability. We then have Machine Gun Kelly, ya know, that random rapper who had beef with Eminem for 12 minutes? How current I hear you cry. His character is basically as deep as a puddle with the majority of his interactions being ""yo we gonna die"" & shagging another character in the laundry room. This character being Lucy played by Rosa Salazar who I know only from the Maze Runner films, but thought she was a pretty good actress. Her small role in this film does her no justice. Apart from hooking up with MGK her only other slightly memorable snippet is her bizarre scream & overly disgusted comical face when Charlie dies.<br/><br/>The film is at it's best when Sandra Bullock is on her own with the two children. It becomes a gritty, survival horror rather than a predictable series of events poorly acted out by unbearable characters. Aside from Sandra the best performance comes from Vivien Lyra Blair who plays Girl. The scene in the boat where she offers herself up as sacrifice is one of the best in the whole film & full of raw emotion and talent. You can see the heartbreak in her face as she holds back the tears but resides herself to possible death to save Boy and Malorie. Take note everyone else! This is acting.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the film pretty disappointing. It never helps when a film is so overhyped before you get around to watch it because you want it to be as good as you imagine but it hardly ever is. Bird Box is one of those films. There's parts that had potential to be something special. The film should have cut the first hour and a half of pointless interactions with stupid characters and just centred on Malorie surviving with the kids after a catastrophic event. They could have incorporated folklore about the 'demons' and kept it dark and gritty with interactions between the best actors in the film.<br/><br/>But that's just my opinion.
I give Bird Box a 3 out of 10."

","I honestly don't know what I expected from this movie in the first place. The movie was the most intense and fun near the end of the movie when they were on the river. But the first half of the movie was just a boring mess. The ending was very weak and didn't answer the many questions we had about the unseen force leading people to suicide. They literally just enter a house for the blind where Malorie finally figures out real names for her children other than just ""Boy"" and ""Girl"" then the credits roll. A Quiet Place was a real thriller and was way better than this movie, let me explain.<br/><br/>1) In A Quiet Place, we know what the creatures are and we find out how the characters can defeat them. 2) A Quiet Place is an ""on the edge of your seat"" kind of thriller/horror, while Bird Box is just a ""Wow, I wonder how this character will gruesomely die"" kind of movie. 3) Bird Box has a greater focus on the R-rated deaths and language instead of the story and suspense. A Quiet Place strays away from the focus on how to make this movie for it's designated target audience and really focuses on how to make the story suspenseful and scary.<br/><br/>If you are a thriller fan looking for a great suspenseful thriller on Netflix, Bird Box is not the movie for you. You can save 2 hours of your time watching A Quiet Place or another good movie."
"capcanuk","2","1","1","2 January 2019"," It was ""ok""
","Count me among those who do not see what the hoopla is about this film.
It's an ok thriller, with some stunts, no special effects, and a few good acting performances..
It has a few shocking moments, but it also lasts 2 hours which is, in my opinion, for longer than the story could support.
A word of warning: do not go into this film expecting answers to anything. It's all ""left to the viewer's imagination"" (the bad author's get-out-of-jail-free card that gets used and abused far too often).
You'll never know what the actual threat is, nor where it came from, and the ending of the film is a bit of a let-down."

","After all the hype I watched this on Netflix with my wife. I like cross genre stories but only when the story arc is strong and themes are harmonized. The biggest failure here was the lack of cause and effect. When the humans turned into zombies and said the unseen savage entities were beautiful--that was incoherent. We saw nothing or beautiful in the unseen evil.This aspect reminded me of the Blair witch project with clueless characters running in the dark woods with web cams. The drama of Sandra Bullock's character fighting to save two kids was the best part of the film. Her personal transformation in the fight of good vs evil was muted by the
action. There was a lot of convenient coincidence in the story, like the OB GYN doctor appearing in the final scene in the big bird sanctuary."

So from the beginning till the end there can't be any boring minute in Bird Box.<br/><br/>A fantastic sci fi movie and I can bet with all my money that, if the main role was given to other than Sandra Bullock, the movie and the story would not turned to be this great.<br/><br/>This is a kind of a movie that leaves a mark.

And annoyed at the ""horror"" branding and ""scariest movie ever"" adverts posted all over the media.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Sandra bullock is an incredible actor, and does a good job with what she's given. The soundtrack is spot on. The locations are exactly what you'd want to see... But some of these books to film ventures simply do not work. And this is one of them in my opinion."

","The metaphor is propaganda - anti-exploration, the corruption of the physical, fear of the stranger (xenophobia), success of the blind, and final limitation of sight to enclosed safe spaces.<br/><br/>The film plays like the justification of neurotic psychopathology. The destruction of these tried and true heuristics renders the movie opposite the hero myth: true sight is not used to revitalize the crumbling or excessively ordered city by encountering chaos and learning, rather, this ""hero"" runs from the unknown with eyes closed until segregating the self away from new knowledge and the unknown for the sake of protecting the children.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is not how reality functions. Children learn and grow by taking as much risk as they can handle, keeping their eyes open, and not being overprotected. Narratives are strengthened by engaging the unknown and testing to find weaknesses. ""The good mother necessarily fails."" C. Jung<br/><br/>Great acting though."

And when I say natural course I mean, the back and forth it takes timeline wise.<br/><br/>Because while we start in the ""now"", the movie backs off and shows us the then and the inciting incident. Actually the then is a far bigger part of the movie than the now. But that should not take anything from your enjoyment, quite the opposite.

I found it just about right, with the timeline shift back and forth providing some much needed intrigue and mystery as the film develops. I have to say, this film has one of the more memorable and affecting opening sequences I've seen for some time and is played brilliantly.<br/><br/>The cast does a stellar job with what is ultimately a minimalist piece relying on tension building and dread, which they do admirably. A special mention has to go to Sandra Bullock who is terrific as Malorie, and Sarah Paulson who turns in an extremely brief but memorable performance that I was thinking about long after the credits had rolled.<br/><br/>All in all a very solid little movie without any bells and whistles.

"lewislow-18642","3","3","6","12 January 2019"," Below average movie with a topping of propaganda!
","There was an anti-white male theme throughout the movie. All the villains of the show were white males, from the mean old white guy (who is perpetrated as a Trump figure), to the psychos that saw the light. There was also a sentiment of white males not showing responsibility in the absence of Malorie's/Olympia's husband and that the black man has to selflessly pick up after them. Further pushing interracial marriage. Not to mention the entities coming out of Russia given the narrative against them...<br/><br/>Although they say ""Don't let the facts get in the way of a good movie,"" I felt like they left the logical reasoning and explaining in the books hands, which is rather lazy. Obvious pitfalls include the sustainability of a blind school in the middle of an apocalypse. The use of electricity, even though power after such an event would probably be gone in two days, unless they somehow got a generator and fuel to last five years. The fact that the kids wouldn't know how to swim at the river scene and the directors choice to name them boy/girl.<br/><br/>That being said, it made the story weak and left questions for the audience to find themselves in the book. I felt like the elements of the plot swung from agenda to agenda, building around generic stereotypical characters. Although bad, it was watchable if one has time to waste and curiosity to spend. Even if it was predictable.
Overall, below average 4/10, the propaganda pushes it down to a 3/10."
"indieBrit","3","3","6","12 January 2019"," Watch Birdman not Bird Box
","3 stars is generous because the first half is pretty good, exciting and scary. It started off quite promising and then descended into B-movie 1 star as the plot was unbelievable and the dialogue and acting terrible.
This was my first ever Netflix film and it was so heavily promoted on the front page of the menu with little alternatives and great hype at Christmas that it was the most watched film solely because of clever promotion.
Sandra Bullock isn't the greatest actress but she's better than this. Malkovich is a top quality actor and did this for the paycheck. I think this film is either great or a turkey depending on what you look for in a movie, if you look for quality then it's a turkey, if you are entertained by basic implausible horror then it may appeal.
It does tick all the correct Hollywood 21st century requirements: Female director, female lead featuring strong independent all-conquering woman, black and disabled actors, white male actors all dumbass weak or evil - so on that front a 10!
If you want a classic movie then I can recommend Birdman but spoiler alert it features a white male and 4 men won Oscars!"
"daniele-iannarelli","2","3","6","11 January 2019"," Awful and pretentious!
","I remember reading somewhere, that ""Hollywood's output is littered with trash films""... well yes, I agree, and this film is the latest trash offering in Hollywood's incessant litany of trash!<br/><br/>The film is full of flashbacks, with nothing clever about them... just confusion initiated by a director trying to be too clever, and winding up unsuccessfully so.<br/><br/>How some people, with obviously no taste nor sense of critical appraisal, can rate it so high (some gave it an 8, 9 and even 10 on IMDB...!) as to equal it with the likes of ""Gone With The Wind"" , ""The Apartment"", ""The Godfather"", ""Citizen Kane"", etc etc etc... is beyond my comprehension.<br/><br/>So, yet again, here we have another waste of my time. The concept of the movie has been done so many times in the past, but with fog, rain, zombies etc., and is furthermore filled with the typical shock-style clichÃ©s and predictability of similar low-grade movie efforts. The result? Terrible, intelligence-insulting, left-wing propaganda, clichÃ©d, slow, boring, daft and very predictable.<br/><br/>It hits a ludicrous level of unbelievability with silly scenes such as the trio falling off the boat and into the raging whitewater and coming up again with their blindfolds intact. In reality, there is no way their blindfolds would've stayed on... NO WAY whatsoever! Also (earlier) to ask us to believe the group were able to negotiate their way down the street to the supermarket in the car - totally blind! - is a completely silly ludicrous ask. Similarly, navigating the boat down the river- in effect, BLIND... oh for God's sake! Gimme a break from this nonsense!<br/><br/>What about the cop and the druggie just disappearing...! No explanation. Well, in that case, what was the point of them being included in the first place then? They gave no depth nor reason to the cockeyed 'story'.<br/><br/>Later, we're given no explanation whatsoever why the little boy and little girl haven't been given proper names... just ""boy"" and ""girl"". Come on! We're also asked to believe that the three love-birds, having been put through the mill, tossed and turned and battered from pillar to post... are STILL alive at the end, they survive it all! The director missed a trick here... if she'd made them parrots, you could say they'd 'survived to tell the tale'!<br/><br/>Neither is there any explanation as to what's going on. What are these demons/aliens? I think the reason is a political one... in other words, could the whole concept of the invading aliens be a projection of yet more left-wing, globalist, anti-white, political propaganda set to try and influence society? Hmmm... I'll say no more.<br/><br/>Rubbish movies often contain rubbish acting... well I wasn't disappointed, the acting wasn't great although it could have been worse. Even... EVEN John Malkovich was well below par. Maybe it was something to do with such a poor script, although his reaction to his wife killing herself was - let's say - a bit insipid and insincere... he barely blinked an eye to it.<br/><br/>So, no more than a basic 1 point on the rating scoreboard for that. A further score-point just has to be removed for an ending that smacked heavily of more left-wing political belching, promoting a multiculturalism homogenisation of society... and how nice we'd all be as one. Simple... guff!<br/><br/>Overall though, a completely, slow, boring, terribly clichÃ©d, corny, daft, unsatisfying, unsatisfactory and disappointing attempt at a movie.<br/><br/>If people are easily pleased and unable to give a sensible - comparative - appraisal... I give them my blessing, they can watch the film to their heart's brain-numbing content.<br/><br/>If, however, they have a keen sense of critical movie appraisal, and have great respect for the quality of *true* classics... I happily suggest they don't waste their time.<br/><br/>This film, a poor attempt at 'Hitchcockian' suspense, is testament to badly thought out scripting and directing.
Hitchcock will be spinning in his grave.<br/><br/>I paraphrase someone else who - somewhere - said: 'It would be better watched blindfolded!' He was so right!<br/><br/>THIS... FILM... IS... TRASH!"

The movie is a ripoff of ""a quiet place"" only this time you can't open your eyes. I guess the next one you will need to plug your nose to avoid smelling the aliens. Or maybe use unscented deodorant so they can't smell you. Or WHATEVER.

She isn't the greatest actress, she is aged and her voice and mannerisms are the same in every movie she is in.
One of Netflix's over-rated original content movies they hope will get their subscribers back. Much of the story was pretty predictable, I think that is why the first 30 minutes was the most interesting, seeing the dynamics of the original survivors, how they learned how to handle it, the human interaction and results. Some of their choices were so dumb though it was hard to believe. Should be a lesson to bleeding hearts what happens when you make pollyanna choices."
"lempkecoleton","4","3","6","5 January 2019"," Swing and a miss from Netflix
","(Softcore spoilers..no major plot points/deaths)
Another Netflix original flop. Aside from a few good series Netflix batting % for original movies is not good enough for the majors..probably not even triple A ball. And it seems to me like they run into the same problem every time. A plot which turns a blind eye to it's Mariana Trench sized plot holes that only looks good in a 15 second Instagram trailer mixed with empty characters who seem to act without any rhyme or reason. They do what they do solely because the plot needs them to. Bird Box is no exception to this.<br/><br/>We'll start with what Bird Box did right because it'll take a lot less time. Despite everything wrong with this movie the one thing it has going for it is that you want to know what ends up happening. Despite all the plot holes, and random character action you truly are interested in seeing how Sandra Bullock ensures her children's safety and escapes these monsters. The problem is, however, despite wanting to see the end you can't help but point out how much this movie has no regard for reason or logic within it's own plot which ultimately ruins the entire movie.<br/><br/>To better explain what I'm trying to say, I'll draw a semi-controversial reference to A Quiet Place. I'm well aware that bird box is based on a book that came out before A Quiet Place so, please.....save it. In A Quiet Place (Which I personally liked) there were parts of the plot you could nitpick and say ""I don't get why he would do this"" or ""why wouldn't they do this?"" Or even ""how come the monsters do this but not this?"". For me I personally felt like a lot of these things (admittedly not all) boiled down to nitpicking. You could apply the why didn't x do y argument to almost any movie so I personally felt some people were hard on A Quiet Place. The difference here is that in Bird Box picking apart the plot can't be simplified as nitpicking, it can be justified as reasonable claims or questions the movie either has no regard for or doesn't care to explain.<br/><br/>For example, they decide to paint the car windows black so they can drive out for supplies using gps. A creative idea on the surface, but even the most casual movie goer is going to point out the roads were riddled with abandoned and exploded cars when they went into hiding. There's a zero percent chance you could make it down the road, let alone out of your driveway, without hitting a post apocalyptic road block of debris.
Another example is the blindfolded river rafting scene which is 50% of the reason why people watch the movie to begin with. This might be the biggest example of clickbait I've seen in movie history. I've been whitewater rafting on the lowest tier of rapids there are. 13 out of the 15 people in the group flipped (more than once) and nobody was blindfolded. You cannot convince me they're making it down that river. Somebody is going to have to take the blindfold off ultimately getting everyone killed.
Finally, the movie gives no explanation as to why some people can look at these creatures and not kill themselves. Some people get to roam freely in a state of madness, while others are compelled to immediately kill themselves.
This combined with a cast of characters who are not fleshed out and act without reason or motivation other than ""the script told me to"" ruins any chance of this movie being considered anything other than clickbait by Netflix.<br/><br/>A Swiss cheese plot, and a cast of wasted talent ruin another Netflix original. Even though you won't listen to me because this movie is going viral..save 2 hours of your time, watch something else. And when you ignore this and watch it anyway and get let down just remember I told you so.
4/10 stars and I'm being generous."

","Well, at least the Cloverfield monster didn't show up.<br/><br/>Never thought (hoped?) I'd SEE a M. Night Shyamalan remake, but here goes. Bird Box is definitely his Happening Ver. 2 and though somewhat better than the unintentionally hilarious Shyamalan ""thriller,"" it's still a terrible idea and now contains even worse characters.<br/><br/>This is like one of those terrible SyFy knockoffs to feed off the Quiet Place bucks. This film's twist? Instead of having to be quiet, our antiheroes have to lose SIGHT. Well, of vision, continuity, logic, reason, brains and physics. Just to name a few.<br/><br/>Suddenly Death shows up and anyone caught looking at it wants to commit suicide. Survivors do their survival thing, such as hold up in once location, fight, have montages and come up explanations on why Death's at their doorstep.<br/><br/>The movie writes itself into a corner so it comes up with human slaves of Death who lure people to LOOOOOOK and this causes the survivors to LOOOOOOK elsewhere for shelter.<br/><br/>Honestly, the movie's not the worst I've SEEN, but it's way too long, too bleak, includes subpar and lazy special effects, was badly written, has huge plot holes, was hardly original and worst of all: Sandra Bullock, the anchor of the film.<br/><br/>My guess: Bullock has been on a kick late into her career to shed any decency she had left by playing bland, boring or downright disgustingly bad characters. She was possibly the worst part of Ocean's Eight and here, I hated her from minute one. And she never regained any sparkle in my EYE.<br/><br/>Yes, I understood her character and motivations. I pieced together her past and reasons why she acts the way she does, but damn, she is despicable and the whole movie falls on her shoulders. Even her enormously predictable character arc wouldn't save her. The movie's barely worth WATCHING, and she nearly brought the whole mess down. How anyone would want to be ten feet close to her before this Happening is baffling and following, it's even more torturous since there are so few humans to be around.<br/><br/>I hope they didn't set this up to be a franchise or TV series as it seems like they did. These original two hours are ones I never want to SEE again.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Shocked they didn't get Kristen Stewart to play the lead. She's always playing dour and depressing characters that people always seem to mysteriously flock to in movies even though in real life, no one would ever want to give them the time of day. I know I wouldn't. To either person."

","Really enjoyed this movie. Clever concept and Sandra is an amazing actress!<br/><br/>There are a few loopholes but I don't think one of them is the fact that some people are not effected by the entity as other reviewers have mentioned. Seems those who do not commit suicide are those who were mentally ill.<br/><br/>Other reviewers mention that they do not like the fact the viewer never sees the entity. I actually think this works really well as the survivors do not see the entity either.<br/><br/>Encourages the viewer to consider disabilities and mental capacity on a whole different spectrum."

","Watched this film last night with a sense of anticipation given that Netflix's marketing worked so well. Everyone it would appear has seen this film immediately, and raved about it.<br/><br/>The truth though? A decidedly average, televisual film about an end-of-times idea. The script is awful, I mean absolutely dreadful. Most of the plot points are incredulous, nonsensical, ludicrous. You simply, simply would not be able to drive to a supermarket via satnav alone or navigate a two day boat voyage blind - preposterous!<br/><br/>Having said all that it is still better than Jurassic World, Spider Man: Homecoming and Incredibles II."
"jadediamond","8","5","13","29 December 2018"," Great thriller
","I think most of the hate comes from Sandra Bullock's love interest in the movie being an alpha black male. The movie was an amazing thriller. It sucks you in as soon as the movie begins. The characters are interesting. The dialogue is funny and witty. This is the movie the Happening was trying to be. It's the end of times and an invisible force is causing people who see it to commit mass suicide. It's never explained. It's like you're dropped into the middle of the climax with no explanation of what's going on and the rest of the movie is about adapting and surviving in a post apocalyptic world where using your eyes in daylight can kill you and you must depend on your others senses to survive in the outside world. I enjoyed this movie, held my breath to climactic ending, and smiled at the simplicity of the ending which was perfect for this movie. I loved Sandra Bullock's character Majorie whose a sacrastic mess, is in denial her water has broken, and named her children Girl and Boy. She starts off as a strong character after losing her sister to the invisible force at the beginning of the movie and becomes stronger but also protective of her children who she learns she must not only instill survival skills of a mother but also give them the maternal love of a mother too. The children were good too and everyone got their moment to shine. Yet, if you need tons of exposition, a visible villian, and a Hollywood ending, you're not going to enjoy this movie. Sometimes stuff happens without reason or explanation, and you just have to deal with it. Survival of the fittest. Funny script, great cast, nice action, and nice ending. It has great rewatchability. I enjoyed this movie."

","Contrary to other reviews I don't believe it is a rip off of a quiet place.

"RubyMouse","6","5","13","22 December 2018"," Solid adventure
","A good and gripping start with a wonderful performance by John Malkovich, but a film that doesn't always live up to that initial promise. I enjoyed watching to the end though and would recommend giving it a go as it's much better than the last couple of netflix specials. The only downside for non-US viewers is the over botoxed, made up face of Sandra Bullock looks nothing like a person who'd lived in a post-apocalyptic world for 5 years would but I imagine we, in Europe, will have faces like that soon...."
"boris_unanimate","8","5","13","22 December 2018"," Beyond Amazing. More Than Advertised.
","So, apart from a star-studded cast of several Academy Award winners and a gripping story, this movie is what another supposedly marvelous popcorn horror flick - A Quiet Place - should have been. It's a story about survival and it's as intense as it gets.<br/><br/>Without wanting to spoil anything, this is truly about survival when something out of this world attacks. Is it aliens, is it Evil incarnate, is it sheer madness? In the end it doesn't really matter what's attacking the last surviving people in the planet. The story and how it unfolds as well as the consequences are dramatic and almost realistic. This had me in goosebumps in the end and, for once, the stakes were real and the terror palpable.<br/><br/>I love Sandra Bullock in this. I thought it would be a cheesy vanity project but it's a fantastic story, from start to finish. And finally, dumb decisions have consequences, and so do smart ones for once. Still, it's fiction, but it's gripping and terrifying at all times. Drama. Horror. Action. Just enjoy the terror. Best one so far on Netflix."

"cochrandarin","10","6","17","28 December 2018"," Wow, watched the day after Christmas and can honestly say it's THE BEST movie of the 2018 year!!
","I can't believe there are negative reviews about this movie. Let me take a minute to shoot them down; I see some upset saying it's a rip off of 'Quiet Place' with Emily Blunt and/or 'The Happening'...M. Night Sh/Wahlberg vehicle a few years ago.
Well, to put that too rest, this movie is head and shoulders above either of those movies....plot wise, acting wise, special effects, character development, overall creepiness, logic, etc. etc.
Some seem to dislike this because it doesn't give any real explanation for what the creatures/monster/ghosts/aliens/thingys are...huh? And I ask; Why should they? Has it occurred to anyone that the people in this fictious, horrible, Apocalyptic mess has no idea what they are, so why should we the viewer have that knowledge? I think it adds to the uneasiness of being in the same boat as the characters and not knowing what the heck is after you or what you are up against.
As far as the acting, Bullock is excellant, and in fact there really are NO bad performances in this movie. Tom Hollander, (you'll recognize as the weird, assassin guy from the movie 'Hanna' that pursues Saoirse Ronan) gives a chilling performance and ol Malkovich plays his part in usual convincing manor as the pragmatic, stay-alive-at-all-costs 'Douglas'.
The movie is BEYOND tense and has some scenes with little children in peril that might turn some off to it. But all in all, it's a great movie and it lived up to the enormous hype that I heard before watching. Thumbs way up!!"

The reason is alluded to by the guy who was going to write the book about the apocalypse, when he saw his friend at the grocery store who was ""a little crazy"". I'm pretty sure there's another hint in the film, but clearly it's the insane people that are taken control of by the entities and don't become suicidal.<br/><br/>I read someone else say ""how did those birds survive in that box for 5 years?"" Seriously...the birds were put in the box for the journey in the boat which was a little over a day. Come on people.<br/><br/>
As far as the movie not explaining more of the situation, it's a film from Sandra Bullock's character's perspective. Do we really need to know if the monsters are from another planet or some religious apocalyptic creatures? Would that make you care more about the character's story? Aye..."

"tonya-06735","10","4","10","23 December 2018"," A breathless 2 hour ride
","I read the reviews before watching Bird Box with mainstream media slaughtering it and actual film fans praising it.
A situation that I have seen before with such classics as Bladerunner, VideoDrome, The Man Who Fell To Earth, etc.
So I pulled the trigger last night and the whole family sat and watched it on the big screen.<br/><br/>In silence.<br/><br/>For two hours.<br/><br/>Very few films these days can draw the audience into a story but rest assured this is one of those films.
I was going to say it envelops you but it's so more than that - it's a mesmerizing experience that left us all breathless.
Bullock immersed herself in the lead role as the fiercely determined Malorie (which I will dare to say is a career best), protecting two children at all costs from a mysterious presence.<br/><br/>Brilliantly supported by two of my favourites - Paulson and Malkovich, Bird Box is a film I will remember and return to.<br/><br/>Directed by Danish Academy Award winner Susanne Bier, we found it an excellent character driven story with realistic FX rather than a film relying solely on CGI.<br/><br/>My advice is simply this - watch it and make up your own mind and disregard all the negative critics, this is a film made for film fans and not reviewers."

"huey2088","8","5","14","24 December 2018"," A psychological thriller that made me sad
","A lot of comments that Bird Box is a copycat of A Quiet Place or The Happening. The Happening was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and released in 2008. However, Bird Box's first draft was written before The Happening came out. So it would be safe to assume that A Quiet Place's writers got their inspirations from the two stories.<br/><br/>Bird Box is the better film than A Quiet Place which I also like a lot. AQP apocalypse is caused by aliens so there is no mystery there, only how to beat them in order to survive. The acting by Blunt, Krasinki and the children are superb. It does eventually become an action film where the alien is blasted into bits and less drama towards the end of that film.<br/><br/>In Bird Box there are no actual aliens but the ""creatures"" that come in form of an invisible force with angry or sad voices. It remains unseen throughout the film and only one scene gives a clue as how it looks via rough sketches. This naturally creates a lot of questions which is clever in keeping the audience guessing. There are already loads of apocalyptical films out there that have all the big answers reveal and they are rather cliche.<br/><br/>Bird Box deals with a lot of psychological issues. From the obvious mass suicide to who to trust to loneliness of being a single parent. The story of Malorie's (Bullock) sad childhood to how she treats Boy (Edwards) and Girl (Blair) she's protecting but not allowing them to be children for a second. And the scene that made me sad is when in the boat, Malorie almost chooses Girl to be sacrificed until she remembers the promise she had made.<br/><br/>It's a very over saturated genre and I am glad that Bird Box didn't follow the same silly predictable action pack gore fest formula. The two films may be similar but I undoubtedly prefer Bird Box over A Quiet Place because it is not only showing gore and cheap scares but there are a lot of thought provoking and deep themes to think about."

","Rarely do drama and horror blend as beautifully as in the apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic genre, and Bird Box is a perfect example of that. Since the movie focuses more on the emotions and relations among the group of survivors (of a never fully explained apocalyptic event) most charactes become relatable and appreciated - even the morally complex ones. Because of these relations set up between the charactes we as viewers also feel their pain and sorror when something happens to one of them.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is great as the pregnant woman caught in the middle of this strange maelstorm, and John Malkovic is amazing playing an enigmatic (and sometimes infuriating) cynic.

This movie was truly excellent. The best thriller/scary movie I've seen in years. It gave me chills, it kept me on the edge of my seat and kept the pace well throughout the whole 2 hours. The thriller part was not the only theme. There was a truly compelling emotional and character part to it as well. All in all, without giving out details, it was a well made movie and I would definitely recommend it.

The characters are written well, although there is the odd awkward script moment which spoiled a little of the tension.

Bird Box was an enjoyable film with some good acting, some nice tension no real heart in your mouth moments but enough to enjoy the 2 hours running time. I have given it 1 more star than probably deserved to counteract the people who've slithered up their own backsides trying to be deep & look like a film buff in their reviews. To me it didn't really feel like 2 hours which I think is a good sign. All in all cut the pseudo crap, not every film must have multi layered characters who make you feel a true connection with them on a personal level.

","We need more films like this. I found this movie had the perfect amount of suspense, horror and heart to it to make into a very entertaining movie. The cast was well chosen and amazing in the film, especially the kids! Even though they didn't explain the background on the creatures or what they even look like, that was okay. I find by not knowing it lets your own imagination come up with an answer; which in all honesty can be much scarier then the writers could have come up with. I also find this movie very original! I watch lots of horror films and I have never seen one based on not being able to look at the monsters. It was a cool idea to implement into a movie; the thought of living in a world blind folded is a very interesting idea."

Oh, the one bit that was good was a meaningless sequence where some old lady sits down in a burning car, that was fairly shocking but nothing amazing. Everything but the flashbacks to the house sequence is very substandard and boring. The house sequence is mediocre at best, except the 'bad guy' is the only person I actually agreed with, so it's irritating that nobody listens to him.

It is obvious that Netflix's only business plan is to crank out as much original programming as possible with a ""name-brand"" cast & crew. There is absolutely no regard at all for quality programming. Their money would be better spent on licensing agreements with studios that have programming people want to watch (you know, the stuff on Netflix that the subscribers actually watch)."

"ritera1","5","3","7","7 January 2019"," Gently but consistently fails throughout.
","I would imagine it was very much a money grab to take advantage of the zombie craze. The concept was a decent variation on the theme of such, but it soon stopped there. I've seen post-apocalypse done much better but even those were flawed.<br/><br/>Two very incomplete and short movies mixed together (part 1 and 2) that were very much entrenched in B-movie devices to satisfy a perceived need vs. having any creative conclusion. And it was just so very damn long. Despite the fact that the short version failed, I would have been interested in trying it as a far longer mini-series to explore the subject.<br/><br/>I am disappointed in Bullock's decision to do this, as she was also attached as a producer. Granted, I know that Hollywood has a phobia of older women, which is shameful. But this is Sandra Bullock, who had led many fine movies and always does a good job. But she had very little to work with and got lost in an acceptable but not remarkable ensemble. She delivered urgency and emotion when she had the chance, sure. But I wanted more from our ""hero"" who was far more dominant in the 2nd portion than the first.<br/><br/>Or was this a failed attempt to introduce an older woman as a ""hero"" of an action movie? I am all for that, sure, although I am a male in his 50s. There were element to fuel interest in the female demographic, especially considering the attraction from women to violent material like Walking Dead and Game of Thrones. But we introduce Bullock as an ambivilant soon-to-be mother and then drop that 'til the very last scene when she gives the children names and calls herself mother. She steps up as a hero, but not from a great jump. But many times she is usurped and does play the female-in-distress role.<br/><br/>What also added to my theory that it was geared towards a female audience was the casting of Trevante Rhodes as Tom, the love interest. I don't have any real issue with it but thought it was a cheap device to entice women as he was a much younger handsome black man. Did a fine job as an actor, too, for what he was given.<br/><br/>I found interesting the concept that mentally ill people welcomed the sight of the ""monsters."" But relatively little was done with it. And John Malkovich's arc was satisfactory when he sacrificed himself for the children.<br/><br/>The direction was very pedestrian, though. The scene of havoc before they were in the house was workable but not memorable. I guess we are also transitioning in film from real effects to computer-generated effects (explosions, fire, blood, etc) and it's not looking that good.<br/><br/>I've heard Netflix bragging about great viewing numbers. That this was a high-profile tentpole movie for them vs. the filler they often offer. But it was very much an unremarkable B-movie."

I do believe her acting was spot on, with her emotion, drive and character development but I felt that the film itself was dragging on with so many ""ugh"" moments and other moments that you wished that it was over soon.<br/><br/>And once you came to the end, it was like .... ""ugh"" are you serious!?<br/><br/>Long story short: Strange, invisible creatures are wrecking havoc across the planet and anyone that sees them commits suicide.

Night Shyamalan's The Happening and John Krasinski's A Quiet Place... okay, but Netflix didn't quite reached that ""Fear Factor"" we all hoped for<br/><br/>If anything for a chill down the spine moment was the events that were unfolding at the beginning of the movie, which included the ever awesome American Horror Story star, Sarah Paulson (Applause... Applause). I mean, after her death, the fear goes downhill from there, as well as the rest of the film with the story and acting... and that's it.

","There are so many movies like this one and they all focus on the same thing: one family's struggle to survive with world-ending events going on around them. They always end the same way as the family survives with or without at least one of them having to sacrifice themselves along the way. And how many of those movies also have some safe haven compound that they're heading for??? This movie ultimately disappoints because it's a well trodden path with few surprises. As another reviewer pointed out, this is a monster movie without a monster - at least not one that you can see. What it is, why it's happening - all of this goes unanswered which is deeply unsatisfying. The predictable conclusion about the family itself is no saving grace. At 2 hours and 4 minutes it was far too long because there wasn't enough plot to stretch it out. It's not quite as bad as The Happening - another movie about a mystery supernatural force causing everyone to commit suicide - but it's really not far behind. Best advice: don't waste your time with this one."

"zkonedog","9","3","7","31 December 2018"," As Much About The Characters As The ""Gimmick""
","It would be easy to dismiss Netflix's ""Bird Box"" as a ""gimmick"" film, capitalizing on the concept set forth by April 2018's ""A Quiet Place"". The major difference between the two films, however, is that ""Bird Box""--much to its credit--focuses more on the characters than the outside factors, making it an overall better, more visceral experience.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Bird Box"" tells the story of Malorie (Sandra Bullock), who is pregnant with her first child and unsure of how to transition into motherhood. Nearly at full term, Malorie's world is turned upside down by a mysterious plague, of sorts, that causes mass violent suicides and seems to be spread simply by sight (looking at a mysterious entity). Flashing back and forth between the present and the future, the film tells the story of how Malorie (and others) must overcome both the physical situation, as well as their own personal demons in order to survive in a world where sight is no longer an option for survival.<br/><br/>Much like ""A Quiet Place"" (which made sound the culprit), this movie has a great ""hook"" (sight is the enemy here) to base the story around. Every great film needs an impetus for the action to revolve around, and ""Bird Box"" has that with the inventive concept. Many scenes are legitimately tension-filled and throw many surprises at the audience.<br/><br/>What sets ""Bird Box"" apart from many of its contemporaries, however, is its ability (and willingness, quite frankly) to really build up the characters (especially Malorie) and have the story suit those needs rather than the other way around. It would have been so easy to just skate by on concept (which, for example, ""A Quiet Place"" does despite still being decent in its own right) and only focus on that, but thankfully director Susanne Bier makes it very clear that she knows how to intertwine the relationships/emotions with the intriguing plot. This isn't a movie about an apocalyptic plague/monster, but rather a character study that just happened to be set in much an environment.<br/><br/>For a streaming service--Netflix--that is often known for ""quantity over quality"" in terms of its original content, ""Bird Box"" is a refreshing experience in that it easily could have been released in theaters and likely made back its budget (and probably then some). This is one of the best films I've seen this year (2018) for the way it combines intrigue, suspense, character development, and emotion so seamlessly and entertainingly."
"AdrenalinDragon","2","3","7","30 December 2018"," Bird Crap Box
","I thought Bird Box was bloody awful. I mean, it's basically a bad hybrid of The Happening and A Quiet Place. There was so much ridiculousness to it. The two women just so happen to go in labour at exactly the same time while that guy messes up everything at the same time too? Did that seriously bother nobody else? They later find out the birds detect whenever that thing is close, so why do they need to wear the blindfolds all the time? So dumb!<br/><br/>The characters were getting themselves into peril constantly or not listening to instructions, the acting was weak (John Malkovich is probably the best thing in the movie, though), the flashback river sections in between were boring, the kids are never given names and are called ""Boy"" and ""Girl"" despite the mother keeping them alive for five whole goddamn years somehow. Everything was just so poorly contrived. Why bother having a bird box if you aren't going to use it?<br/><br/>Nothing is explained and the ending, well was that really an ending? Living happily ever after with the blind? What about those things? You never find out exactly what they are! Some of these points I could look past if the movie was entertaining, but it was just so dull. I can't even like it in a ""so bad it's good"" way like The Happening. This sucked bird poop!<br/><br/>2/10"

"christopheheyndrickx","10","5","15","28 December 2018"," Good all around thriller
","I think Bird Box is about the best Netflix movie I've seen yet.
(not that that's much of a reference..)<br/><br/>Is it fully original?
No, it uses the premise of 'Blindness' in combination with some
zombie-like action a la G. Romero and the 'unseen' monster/sense element from
A quiet place. It also made me think about the 'Mist' (the original movie/book,
not the horrible series).<br/><br/>But it is a movie that captures your attention for 2 hours, has an almost perfect
structure (moving back and forth between the river and flashback) and is original just for NOT answering every damn question people have.
Some negative critics point to the absence of an 'origin story'. Well, I would say that it is a plus. You don't know more than the actors. Some explanation is given
(ghosts, demons that show you your worst fears), but that is all.
It is genious in a way, as the people who see what the 'creatures' are... die.. unless they were mad beforehand. So, nobody in a sane mind can see the 'truth' and survive.<br/><br/>The violence/blood & gore are (for this kind of movie) quite limited. Suspense comes from the hidden dangers and the unseen element of the creatures.<br/><br/>I would give it a 9/10, but I gave it a 10, because this movie deserves at least a 7/10 rating."

"Leofwine_draca","6","4","11","23 December 2018"," Effective enough, although derivative
","BIRD BOX is a new sci-fi/horror movie from Netflix, heavily derivative of the likes of A QUIET PLACE and THE HAPPENING. The film stars an ageing Sandra Bullock as a rather unlikely pregnant woman who gets caught up in a weird apocalypse that causes people who witness invisible monsters to become instantly suicidal. She takes refuge in a large home with the usual assorted characters before going on a quest to find safety.<br/><br/>The major issue I had with this film is the narrative chronology, which is all over the place. The repetitive flash-forwards to adventures on the river really take you out of the flow of the main story. The earlier half is the better, with some sub-NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD shenanigans in the house and good performances from the likes of John Malkovich. I found the CGI eye effects to be a bit superfluous and the performances to be rather shrill at times, but overall this is an effective enough thriller."
"scottollquist","4","4","11","23 December 2018"," What a waste of Malkovich!
","Whilst the movie was watchable for the most part, there were some scenes that were clearly made just to add 20 mins to to length of the film, or just didn't make sense (the random dude that the pregnant girl lets in - wtf?)
What happened to the couple who stole the car?
Why didn't Mallory name her kids for 5 years & just call them 'boy' & 'girl'?
John Malkovich was the scene stealer and his demise was just stupid.
Too much for the viewer to have to assume and the ending was rushed and somewhat lazy.
Pacing was ok as was the general directing but this movie is not as good as a lot of people have said it is imo."
"mirwais-orbit","6","4","11","22 December 2018"," Effective but not consistent enough
","Bird Box isn't that amazing as its trailer and premise appeared to be. Don't know the book, never heard of it in fact, but I guess that, like all book adaptations, it may be more coherent on its narrative when the movie is not.<br/><br/>Sandra's acting is flawless, an Oscar performance for sure if the movie was better developed and with a wider theater release. It's amazing how she's getting better and better on each new movie. So, about that, no complains. She holds the movie entirely by her own, the same way she did with The Blind Side and Gravity. She's compelling since the first minutes, when the camera captures her minor mixed emotions while she prepares the kids for their blindfolded journey.<br/><br/>Surely the movie starts strong. It's shocking how things happen, in a very impressive way as in World War Z. I mean, it's believable in its fiction. The crazyness afflicting people on the streets were terrifying. The beginning of the movie have some resemblances to the beginning of The Last Of Us game too, plus all the emotional rollercoaster of fear it provides.<br/><br/>But when the story clearly divides itself between present and past, seems to me that the flashbacks doesn't do what it really should. Instead, flashbacks are there because the story couldn't hold itself only in the present and the difficulties to cross miles in the woods blindfolded with 2 kids.<br/><br/>It's so that way that the present time is always boring, lacking of hard obstacles and unpredictable enemies as people may expect. The direction isn't all that good too. The camera never delivers a desperate or claustrophobic feeling of the unseen. Director Susanne Bier opens the camera too much to show every step taken by the characters didactically, instead of doing the contrary, because most of the movie should be developed around senses, which is not, and very frustrating in that aspect. The sound could do so much more like it does in The Blair Witch, for example. A movie where characters are not blindfolded, but have no vision in the dark, making audience experience with them the terror of listening things, but never seeing them.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are all one dimensional, and their fate in the story is predictable as hell. Even when they could have been better played over the aspects of doubt, if that character should or shouldn't be trusted, the screenplay fails terribly and shamefully.<br/><br/>Plot holes are all around because the writers explain nothing about anything. There's just this imagination surrounding what's happening all the time. Malorie, for example... We can imagine that she has some social difficulties, some traumas or relationship problems with others, but we never know exactly why. Why is she going further with an unpleasant pregnancy? Why is she isolated in her home? Does she have been thru a sexual violence in the past? Only questions... Never answers.<br/><br/>The same about the unseen enemy. What is it in fact? An alien? A disease? Or just an unexplainable collective madness? Why some people can adapt to it and some cannot? Why was Jessica affected and Malorie was not?<br/><br/>Ok, I hate movies that explains everything, but here they never do it even with the basics necessary to immerse audience into the story.<br/><br/>We have no need to see or know what the enemy is, but we should had a moment in a victim's eyes to at least know why the despair takes them so deeply. What is that they see? Their worst fears? Their worst version of themselves? The horrors of the past or future? Why some of them claim it to be be beautiful?<br/><br/>So, for me, the movie is only interesting because of Sandra's acting, and because most of the time it delivers what it promisses, even if superficially, but it does. There are thrilling and impressive scenes that will make audience so desperate and affraid as the charcaters are, but that's all. Effective, but not consistent as it should.<br/><br/>Sometimes seems a waste of great ideas because the experience could be much more explored, but entertaining if you don't take it that seriously, even if the ending is too simple for all the post apocalyptical circus that was promoted."

","Bird Box<br/><br/>This is one of those rare movies where it's uniquely brilliant concept, is matched by its kill shot execution.<br/><br/>Judging from cinematic history, a superb concept, is much easier to conceive, than it is to execute on screen. Exciting conceptual Films regularly dwindle into the abyss due to heavy handed and clumsy film making. Take The Purge for example, taken from ground breaking potential, to mind numbing horror. Very rarely do the Inception's of this world come along, that can truly match the birth of an idea and the portrayal of that idea! Bird Box definitely achieves this!<br/><br/>End of the world themed movies are a dime a dozen but this is a whole new take on that premise. The fear of living in the dark(quite literally,) to go along with the fear of being chased and then to add fuel to the world ending fire, we have children in this gut wrenching disaster movie.<br/><br/>I say 'disaster movie' knowing people immediately think of films like Independence Day and Armageddon. Both classics in their own way but I very much enjoyed how grounded Bird Box is.<br/><br/>It's the story of a woman who's strong, assured and powerful but she has no idea how to love. Who could play such a part to absolute perfection?<br/><br/>Enter..Sandra Bullock!<br/><br/>For me, she is one of the most captivating actresses on the planet. She successfully elevated this film to another stratosphere. Her range as an actress has no limits and she humanises any role she takes her hand too. To connect us to every individual major character, in a story of outrageous concept like this, you need a world class centre piece such as Sandy Bulls. From the opening she hits me with an acting punch that has me immediately hooked, and from that point on I'm riding shotgun with her, in this journey of monumental tension.<br/><br/>So, as I rave about the work of Sandy, I ask myself, would this film have been anywhere near as good with her in the central role? Well her colleagues are not to be snuffed at.<br/><br/>John Malkovich, who in my opinion often over does it, gets it just right for me in this one, being just the right amount of crazy. Danielle Macdonald(currently staring in everything the world has to offer) shows that she is definitely one of the new, up and comers to watch on the streaming/cinematic circuits. Her moments interacting with Bullock could easily have been the equivalent of MGK challenging Eminem to a battle of lyrical prowess, but instead she rose to the challenge and matched what Sandy brought to the table.<br/><br/>As for handsome strong black guy? Emma certainly enjoyed him and my trip to the gym has been accelerated to the morrow! The child actors are frighteningly good and their presence definitely elevated the intensity levels.<br/><br/>So, would this film of been as good without Sandra Bullock? In my opinion it's a resounding NO. However, is The Dark Knight as good without Heath Ledger?<br/><br/>Overall, I think this film is pretty close to a modern masterpiece. As I said in the beginning, when a superb concept matches execution, along with a world class actress in the mix, then you're truly on to a winner.<br/><br/>A film this good, that will never see a mass release in the cinema, seems kind of a shame to me, but maybe I'm just an old romantic!"

"MauritiusVonMailand","5","2","4","14 August 2019"," Plot holes, wrong casting, poor direction
","I am perfectly aware that you cannot (and you shouldn't) compare a movie with the book behind the story. This is a fact.
However, this rule works if 1) the script make sense, 2) the casting is correct and 3) the director knows what he is doing. This movie failed in all of them. Let's me going a little deeper in each point.
(1) Script. This was a tough job because the book was already borderline. The original plot is about the appearance of mysterious events involving people going nuts (homicide and then suicide) for no apparent reason. The ""epidemic"" started in rural Russia and in few weeks it hit Alaska and then all the country (and countries worldwide). It took weeks if not months and was not a sudden event. This is important because in the meanwhile news reported that just before people goin' nuts, they claim to have seen something ""incredibly beautiful"", something that apparently you cannot withstand with your ""logic"" and that it ""cooks"" your brain cortex. The ""short-circuit"" effect seems delayed and/or negligible (at least in the short term) in people that are already ""crazy"" and in animals. This is not a minor thing because it explains why all the bad guys in the movie seems to behave normally while planning the worst. At a certain point you understand than the reason of this epidemic are ""creatures"" that are somehow not compatible with us; the book never explains who they are, why they here or even what they look like. The only thing we get is that they would never harm you directly and, apparently, they don't even want to. Whatever their intentions are, if you (or an animal) watch them too closely, you get nuts.
Any SF/Fantasy book need a suspension of disbelief from the reader and that's part of the deal. However the book is so stretched in the realm of disbelief that you keeping reading just because it is well written and the characters well analyzed.
The movie fails along all the line in some minor aspect (windows are not totally obscured, the ""voices"" of the creature, a love story that wasn't in the book, the raiders in the two black cars, no guns, ... ) and some major stuff. Which? Malorie raised the two kids all by herself (everyone else died in the very same day she gave birth to them) for 6 years. This is very important because most of the story is about her instructing the children since they were infants to use their ears and not the eyes to explore the environment. When she eventually decided to leave the house, the kids were perfectly at ease as ""radar"" once blindfolded. Not frightened and defenseless kids. No rescue mission from her when the girl adventured out of the boat. BTW, the river had no rapids and this make sense; can you really believe that a blindfolded person would survive that without even falling into the river? So many plot holes that even the NYT made an article on the issue.
(2) Sandra Bullock. Are you kidding me? Malorie is supposed to be a young woman (25-30) and not a 55 yo woman pretending to be a young mother. Tom,DIED with all the others and there was no romance btwn them. BTW, he was not black. This per se would be a minor point, but if you take into consideration that in the movie they decide to transform George (Greg in the movie) from the fully organized owner of the house (the one that posted messages in local newspapers at the very beginning of the epidemic to inform everyone interested that he had a safe place to share) to a dull gay character then you wonder why they did it. Should we think than every movie done in the US now MUST comply with an unwritten code for political correctness, even if they need to rewrite a character so that to transform a ""neutral"" one into something that fits with the agenda? This is more than a suspect if you see it happening in EVERY single mainstream movie.
3) the direction is confused, with few ideas and with poor logic. Again, how it comes that you see the the daylight everywhere in the house?"

","Well, this movie managed to get 5 stars from me only because it had an okay cast, and okay story, and most of all it made people try it out in real life.

"mwjkeane","7","2","4","7 May 2019"," Thought Provoking
","I just stuck this one on after the hype had died down and was pleasantly surprised. Yes the apocalyptic premise is way over-used and in this case formulaic but I found the cast excellent, the characters engaging and the symbolism striking.<br/><br/>Consider the pregnant mum not yet reconciled to motherhood being forced through circumstance to become the saviour of not only her own son, but also a relative strangers' daughter. Social media as a means for this entity to spread the chaos much faster. The Republican drunkard in Malkovic helping to ""make the Apocalypse great again!"" And of course the impact of humanity on our planet making an apocalypse of some sort inevitable.<br/><br/>I totally get people saying there were lots of unanswered questions, and it's a very long way from a happy ending, but it's really good cinema and worth a couple of hours of your life!"
"JGReviews","6","2","4","9 February 2019"," A lesser A Quiet Place
","I was very happy to see an A list actress in a film with a cool sounding premise released directly to Netflix. The film is a lot of fun in some ways, but it does suffer in the inevitable comparison to A Quiet Place. Clearly both films were made based on an intriguing idea of a future menace to mankind, but the threat in A Quiet Place just seems to make more sense and the filmmakers put their characters in more interesting situations. Still worth a watch to know what everyone is talking about."

"maccas-56367","6","2","4","20 January 2019"," I dislike unexpected visitors too, Douglas
","It seems John Malkovich's ""Douglas"" and I share the same views in regards to unexpected visitors.<br/><br/>Beyond that, ""Bird Box"" is a film that never quite reached its full potential. I can't help but think it could've been in Oscars contention had it been executed better and with more efficient editing. As it is, ""Bird Box"" is a bit too long and a bit too 'superficial' - with it often moving too fast for attachment to characters to develop.<br/><br/>I'd seen it all before. ""The Happening"", ""A Quiet Place"" - hell, there was nothing really to separate it from other movies in the apocalypse genre. The theme of parenthood was strong and helped give it (what I considered) a good ending - but damn, it took a while to get there!<br/><br/>Overwhelmingly bleak and depressing, with some disturbing scenes and aspects sure to shock some viewers - though I never felt truly ""scared"".<br/><br/>What's with so many films these days being so woefully depressive? No wonder society is currently plagued with mental health issues of epidemic proportions. Give me some Paddington!"

"ffaulkner","5","2","4","15 January 2019"," It's a no from me.
","With so much hype, I figured I'd give this movie a shot (and Sandra Bullock has always been one of my favorites). My major beef with this movie comes from direction style. Every single scene was rushed through and short. There was very little room for building a storyline. This would have faired a lot better as a short series, fleshed out over 10 episodes. That way a lot more substance could have been given to the monsters, the characters, and the overall storyline."
"farrellyfrank52","5","2","4","15 January 2019"," Don't Look Now!
","The successful premise of 'A Quiet Place' was in the conceit of silence, a cast-iron guarantee of evoking suspense. Seeing, or in the case of 'Birdbox', not looking, lacks this promise. This film has no suspense, no tension, we never doubt the Superwoman qualities of Sandra Bullock, her Lara Croft propensity to overcome horrendous adversity. She is locked and loaded, literally, against all odds, a female Rambo in an inexplicable dystopia. At worst, she will be martyred, and we might be filled with pity, but not terror, the proper pay-off in any horror offering. However, I liked the motherhood trope, her journey to acceptance and maternal responsibility, sadly only sporadically fleshed out. Some risible scenes tested the viewer's credulity: how our heroine and Olympia contrived to break water at exactly the same time, and of course the farcical jaunt down the breaking rapids of Colorado, blindfolded. Even Burt Reynolds in Deliverance needed both hands and eyes on the wheel. And who is their right mind decided to build that blind school there! I did admire the clever simplicity of the denouement, and kicked myself after for failing to see that real blindness must play a part. I thought the shoot out was unnecessary and crude, and reduced Tom's role to mere hitman for the heroine. The children did not behave like children, and were scarily robotic. These reservations apart, this film is worth the candle, albeit a cheap penny one."

It wants to be a thriller but it doesn't try to be scary or tense. It wants to be a drama but the characters are barely developed. The pacing is weird. Main character is completely unlikable, which is fine in a GOOD movie, but this movie WANTS you to love Sandra Bullock's character.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the ending.

"phignett@hotmail.com","4","2","4","10 January 2019"," Not scary, not very tense, not very interesting
","The film struggles to excel in the two genres of tense apocalyptic thriller (watch a quiet place for this as it is far better) or horror (watch Haunting of Hill House for a good scare with intellect) so it falls In The middle of the two where it's not too scary and not too tense.

"darkshadows1981","3","2","4","7 January 2019"," Sandra Bullock Delivers
","Sandra Bullock delivers a stellar performance as does her supporting cast. This movie does an excellent job at building tension and keeping you glued to your seat! The directors used plenty of symbolism, especially biblical symbolism if you pay real close attention to some of the surrounding circumstances of some scenes and not so much the dialogue.<br/><br/>The pitfalls though comes with the actual storyline and plot. The plot was severely under-developed and the screenwriting is some of the worst I have seen in a horror movie. The characters were introduced well, but there was one major problem. That problem was the poor development of the villain or entity that was causing people to go crazy or commit suicide. You get a glimpse of what the villain might look like from one of the crazies and a theory by one of the characters early on, but there is no definite background or confirmed appearance or backstory on the entity.<br/><br/>There are a few other movies that are very similar to this movie but with a much better plot and more thorough development of characters and villains.
I would not recommend wasting 2 hours of time on this movie unless you're forced to on a Halloween night and you need a mild horror film to show to people not capable of handling the more hardcore stuff."

Running through the woods and only falling like 1 time, and only running into 1 bush, most people trip on roots in the forest when they are looking at the ground? Seriously, most people can't even make it to their own bathrooms in the dark. I guess if you can get through the fact that this is EXTREMELY far fetched, then, I guess you might enjoy the 2 hours of watching...

"derangedxzombie","4","2","4","6 January 2019"," Overall disappointing, questions unanswered
","What started off with promise and good atmosphere. What proceeded to build tension and the notion your guesses of what everyone is seeing will finally pay off with some form of answer, ends up being 2 hours of wasted time. A large factor used in horrors is not knowing, or keeping something hidden from the viewer (keeping them guessing) but not necessarily from the characters in the movie or show. However with no reveal or any form of answer, it becomes a cheap scapegoat for writers to not have to create a clever answer that is waiting at the end of the 2 hours. So instead of seeing if your guesses were correct or having the 2 hours sat there pay off, you're left feeling like you've just wasted your time. Even legendary horrors like Hitchcock's Psycho didn't have to show violence and left it to the imagination (possibly also due to higher censorship decades ago) but you still knew the facts or were given substance to work with. So when you're watching a horror where it's possible there is no real antagonist then it's pointless.<br/><br/>Save your your for something better spent than this disappointment."

The other characters came and went, none of them standing out in anyway.<br/><br/>Even the ending is a straight up clone of Day of the Triffids. The huge number of stolen and unoriginal plots devices would have been cool if they were paying homage and putting in references for fun but they were not, this is just lazy, B grade film making done to generate a bit of money, nothing more.<br/><br/>It's a watch once and delete movie. This one will not be remembered and the fact that it has been nominated for awards genuinely just confirms that the current day awards programmes are corrupt and worthless to the end viewer.<br/><br/>There are dozens of other horror / sci fi movies with the same plot and most fo them are better than this.

I must admit, though, she did pull it off pretty well and I might just (finally) see a different side to her. There's just so many plot holes here that the film is not as believable as 'A Quiet Place'. Ok, so the creatures make people suicidal, but for what purpose? Annihilation? Are they aliens? The corpses are being left to rot, so why would the creatures kill them? Or could this indeed be biological warfare? Why do some people find what they see ""beautiful"" while others commit suicide? What's the difference here? Why do the ones who find it ""beautiful"" and becoming sort of a cult group, want others to ""see"" it as well? What is their ultimate gain?<br/><br/>The film leaves me with way too many questions and ultimately feels like a blend of 'A Quiet Place' meets '28 Weeks Later"", only nothing here is justified or even remotely credible.

Never have I watched a movie that was so hyped up, that turned out to be so bad. The cast was jam-packed with big names from Sandra Bullock to Sarah Paulsen, but yet the only memorable performances were by the 2 kids that were only in half of the movie and barely had any lines. The utterly stupid decisions made by many of the characters in this movie was mind numbing, but when these pointlessly stupid decisions got these characters killed, it was nice not actually caring about them because of the lack of character development which made me not care about these characters. Another thing that irritated me was the lack of creative storytelling with the backstory of the outbreak. Just coming out and telling you what's going on seems lazy to me. Above all else though, my biggest problem with this movie was the lack of an intriguing theme. Compared to A Quiet Place, which I feel is a valid comparison, Bird Box is just inferior. AQP had a very interesting and relatable theme (the lengths you will go to protect your family) and the only theme I could grab from Bird Box was that if you aren't blind, you're gonna die."

Sadly, it's not enough to carry this ridiculous concept of a movie that requires a suspension of belief that goes well beyond normal boundaries.<br/><br/>Don't believe me? Fine, I want you to get in a car and drive to your nearest grocery blindfolded. Then, I want you and two children to row miles down a river to an unknown destination in a boat... blindfolded, dropping a child in the water and retrieving them, all without ever taking off your blindfold, AND arrive at the unknown destination, yes, blindfolded.<br/><br/>When you've accomplished these apparently basic tasks that virtually any human could easily do (blindfolded), then you can explain to me why blood would flow out from under the closed door of an industrial freezer.<br/><br/>Ludicrous, ridiculous, and absolute nonsense movie. Sorry, but you lost me at driving to the grocery store blindfolded."

In terms of story, nothing really happens. There is this cliched ""end of the world"" plotline and this single parent saving her children (Reminds me of any other apocalypse movie). And of course a Bird Box (literally, a box containing birds). Well that's it. That sums up the whole film.
I don't really think there was any need to have made it into a feature length film."

","Let's start by saying that this is based on a book. All over the world, people suddenly start to see ""something"" that will bring emotions that will lead them to commit suicide. So basically they have to be blindfolded in order to survive.
Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock, so I honestly liked it. The acting is quite good, the kids on the movie did a great job. The film builds up a tension that keeps you interested... Howeveeeer... I have read the book and the story is very well constructed on the pages and has a lot of important insights that the movie just didn't bring, they made some bold changes, especially the ending which I honestly did not understand why they decided to sort of change... the end in the book is kind of the climax for me, so I think they should have left the end as it was in the book.
So that is basically why I'm giving it 7. Perhaps if they kept the script a bit more faithful to the book they would have succeeded in making the audience connect a bit more with the character and the story.
I would still recommend this movie and also recommend the book If you like reading."

","I haven't watched many Netflix Original films. However after they shoved Bird Box down my throat on the Netflix homepage for weeks, and they made that ""45 million accounts"" claim (is that good?), I decided to see what all the hype was about. If this film is any indication of the quality of Netflix Originals as a whole, then holy @#$% am I glad I've steered clear of them.<br/><br/>Bird Box is based on the 2014 novel of the same name. I'm sure it's a lovely novel, but this movie is hot trash. The premise is that there are some demon spirit  appearing all over the world that cause people to commit suicide when they look at them. All hell breaks loose in a matter of minutes and a handful of survivors manage to barricade themselves in a house. From here the story drags on between this past event and the present day where our protagonist Malorie, played by Sandra Bullock, is trying to get to a safe haven with her kids. The gimmick is that they have to wear blindfolds so they don't accidentally see a demon and kill themselves.<br/><br/>Opposite Sandy is Trevante Rhodes as her love interest Tom. The age difference is glaring since Sandy is well into her 50s and Trevante hasn't even hit 30 yet. To make it even less believable, Malorie is pregnant. As all the other surviving housemates inevitably fall, poor Tom gets stuck with this stern-looking old white woman because she ends up being the only one left. Kudos to him for making the best of a bad situation, because I would rather have gone outside and looked at the demons than deal with that @#$%. John Malkovich plays Douglas, a man who is perpetually upset and likes to yell a lot. Machine Gun Kelly also makes an appearance as a useless piece of %$#@ that nobody wants around, which is fitting.<br/><br/>The most frustrating thing is that it's never explained why the demons drive people to suicide. There is a meager attempt to make sense of it in the beginning of the film when Lydia, played by Rebecca Pidgeon, starts talking to her dead mother after looking at the demons and then proceeds to go sit in a burning car. I'm not sure what exactly we're supposed to infer from this, but I am sure that I don't care.<br/><br/>To make it even more complicated, there is a subset of the population who can look at the demons and not kill themselves. These people essentially become disciples for the demons and attempt to make others look at them. There is probably some subtext here that I'm missing, but I just don't care enough to try and uncover it. My only takeaway is that I wish I had a blindfold on while watching this piece of @#$%."

","If you are going to set up a story against a gigantic backdrop of a mysterious global phenomenon, i'd like to think of it as a metaphor for something. Maybe a mother's fear of bringing children in a chaotic world, or a woman's struggle to find connection with her loved ones. The birds in the box should have had some subtle sublime significance at least. Instead the story unfolds into a relentless, and somewhat pointless action adventure. The writing was bland (Mother? don't go!). Sandra Bullock held it together enough to sit through it all, and a couple of scenes with little Vivien Lyra Blair was poignant. thankfully i had a ""fast forward 10 seconds"" button to skim over the dreary bits, and used it liberally over the second half of the movie. Skip it. It's not worth your time."

","OK let's start with a positive comment, I did want to enjoy this movie but as it progressed I found myself having to force my involvement and enjoyment.<br/><br/>Sandra B did a reasonable job with a pretty basic role, her character ( an Artist) wasn't really fleshed out or developed much and the attempt to portray her as a bit of a shut in ( reclusive / reluctant) to venture outside herself and her home was a weak attempt to develop her character as someone who would be suited to surviving a claustrophobic world from behind a blindfold.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy her bland approach to parenting which was basically shouting lots and being pretty mean to her young family, which didn't feel like a parent wanting the best for her family more a poorly developed character attempting to act as stressed and pressured.
Plus her need to be repetitive in her dialogue also wore thin after a while.<br/><br/>As the story coasted along I felt myself thinking surely the outcome isn't that the radio message regards safety and sanctuary isn't a place full of people who are visually impaired so safe from the Aliens... guess what it was I was 100% correct.....

","There was parts of this movie that I liked, the acting was really good, the first scene was intense and made me feel the gravity of the situation when I saw those young kids thrust into such an intense and life or death situation. Then they time jump to 5 years earlier and it's pretty much downhill.
The entire concept of multiple story-lines of consecutive events doesn't work because of how you know that everyone is going to die except Sandra Bullock because the movie shows you that. You have no reason to be attached to these characters because you know they'll die at some point soon.
The should've put the focus more on the relationship between Sandra Bullock and the kids, because the entire river plot line in just a metaphor for motherhood after all. They could've given the kids actual personalities and possibly had an interesting dynamic of how the girl's relationship with Sandra Bullock and the boy is affected by her 'mom' clearly disliking her (or at least liking her less).
Bird Box also wasn't shot well. I don't mean it was bad, it just felt pretty bland and uninspired. Even ""The Quiet Place"" had more creative cinematography.
These are definitely not my only complaints but I feel the others are mostly just nitpicking.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt that it was an okay movie that had unused potential. I don't think the director was right for this, she hasn't done anything of this sort before (as far as I can tell, I may be wrong) and I feel that her style did not fit.

","It would be a lie if I told you that I didn't watch it with agony till the end. But this is not because I was anxious about whether our favorite characters would survive or not, but because I wanted to know what this ""entity"" was.
The sad thing is that when I started watching the film and realized how complex it was, I said ""I hope it's not one of these movies with no ending, no explanations and no logic"". Funny right? You started watching something that is really weird and prototype and you just want to know what's really happening and no one ever explains to you the only thing that makes this film different from the others: the ""it"" that makes you suicide if you dare to see it.
But what is it tha you see? We know that it has a shade so it has to look like something. And yet, is it a virus? is it an alien? is it some kind of biological experiment or a mutant? Is it even God? And why does it exist? what does it want? In fact is it good or bad? And why do some people survive from it? why do some people like it? why do some people want to make you see it? How many are there? And last but not least why does it make people kill themselves?..
I know I might be strict but I hate movies with no logical explanations. And on top of it, I have to say I feel kinda fooled. Maybe that's because the only thing that made this film unique is the fact that people are blindfolded and have no sight, so clearly we-who are watching it-have no sight, and it seems like filmmakers took advantage of it so that they din't need to put much effort in this scenario. That's outrageous.

","When I heard that the adaption of the Novel BIRD BOX by Josh Malerman will star Sandra Bullock, I was a bit conflicted with the idea. Sandra is a great actress no doubt in that, but I thought she would not be convincing enough.
I saw BIRD BOX yesterday and I can gladly assure you that this is the best performance by her in a long time. Specially a scene where she emotionally breaks down in the end. The director has competently crafted this movie into a taut thriller that will never bore you in its 124 minutes runtime. There are some good old suspenseful moments in there. The best part of this movie apart from Bullock's performance is that it never gets boring or repetitive. There are some time jumps that raise some plot holes and plausibility issues. Also some decisions certain characters take are dumb. The performances all over the board are brilliant though. The children gave good performances too just somethings they did were odd. The pacing was good too. One problem some people might come up with will be regarding the entities or the creatures. It did not bother me much. Overall the movie was entertaining enough for me to like it."

I didn't think it was terrifying but don't know a film that is (discounting watching Salem's lot as a 13 yr old). If you don't have any sort of expectation going into the movie and discount the ever present hype that surrounds movies these days you might like it. I thought the story was excellent. There were a few plot holes which isn't unusual but I thought it was a solid movie and a gripping story. I particularly liked the young actors that played the children.

I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The river and woods and locations are just incurable and the setting and scenery is marvellous. It looks running and takes you to a wonderful magical view that is also bleak, dreary and depressing.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Sandra, but always feel she is overrated and not great at serious. Here she proved me wrong. I thought she put in a great performance. Sensitive, yet an aggy miserable woman and selfish too, but with heart and emotion. I thought she was Stirling.<br/><br/>Just enjoy. I did. Brain off fun entertainment, slightly disappointing ending perhaps, but I still thought the journey was a fun and bleak rise.

","When something becomes popular, you see these over the top critiques and reviews come out en masse - Bird Box has immediately become pop culture so there is a backlash. The 1 and 2 star reviews aren't fair, but I will say that the movie does leave you wanting more. That is, there are too many questions left unanswered and it is unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Who or what are the creatures? Why aren't the insane affected? What do people actually see? Why can't they enter homes? Some answers to these are hinted at but never resolved.<br/><br/>Personally, I hate when movies leave everything up to audience interpretation as if it is some form of clever art - if I wanted something abstract to try and interpret I'd go to a modern art gallery but for a movie, I want things wrapped up.<br/><br/>But all that said, it is a pretty enjoyable ride, the acting is great and the whole vibe is well executed, just fell a little flat in terms of story arc."

In fact, I loved it. I know people can't help but to compare this to A Quiet Place, but the plot is really different. And also Bird Box was written years before A Quiet Place was written and released. But since people compare, I also have to say that this is scarier. I think being completely silent is kinda easier for me, but the inability to see and also those invisible monsters or whatever they are makes it harder to survive.<br/><br/>I also kind of like it that the monsters true forms aren't revealed. Keeps things mysterious and up to your imagination on what the victims actually saw.<br/><br/>Then there's the acting. Everyone is simply fantastic, even the kids. Sandra Bullock gave a fantastic performance. Sarah Paulson is actually my favorite here though.<br/><br/>The setting was good, I love the shots of the boat scenes.

It has also confusing lines (at least for me) as the psychos which are able to watch without commiting suicide (I didn't get how was that possible) but overall it is a great movie who can beat as storyline/acting 80% of the movies in Cinema right now you pay more than a month of Netflix contract for."

But being a mom of a 5 year old I couldn't stop thinking while watching, that this movie is an amazing metaphore of what parenthood is all about.
Having children make us so vulnerable. With every single important decision in our lives, just like Malorie says, we need to keep our children in mind. And, just like she said again, you let your kids into the world knowing that they might die any time, but you still find strentgh to live with this knowledge, to raise them, to be happy and never forget that you can loose them and it is your job to protect them, no matter what.<br/><br/>I don't know, guys, to me this level of the movie was so strong and Sandra Bullock's acting reflected it so vividly, that I kinda forgot to care about the mysterious creatures and what their agenda is. Isn't it like this with the real world? Does cancer have a secret agenda? Do car accidents have an agenda? Does war have an agenda? They don't.

","I went into this not expecting much. The negative reviews helped me to lower my expectations, which meant I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.
The storyline is in a similar vein to Stephen Kings novel 'Cell' -note I said 'similar', it is in no way the same. But the basic principle is there, except in this story, it's about what the individual sees. We never see what it is that causes the disturbing behaviour, which I note a lot of people have complained about. However, I think this would cheapen it-there is no feasible way to bring to the screen what this 'creature' is without turning the film into a tacky joke. Some things are best left to our imagination.
There's plenty of suspenseful-watch-through-your-fingers moments and you're never entirely sure what turn the plot is going to take next. Overall I very much enjoyed it, and I struggle to understand the negative reviews. But, each to their own"

Also, 90% of the other actors are not on the same level as Sandra, it's like they spent the majority of their talent budget to hire her and had to resort to C list actors for the rest of the cast.
For a similar plot but done way better, I would recommend the 80s horror movie ""The Prince of Darkness"" by John Carpenter.
I commend Sandra Bullock on her performance, but she deserved a lot better material than this movie which feels more like a made-for-TV movie. I am puzzled why she accepted to do this - is she tired of doing great films with the likes of George Clooney, Tom Thanks, etc? lol She needed a break from working with A-list actors? Who knows.

This film actually captured the survival horror / disaster epidemic correctly. The creatures / supernatural force hunts by sight, not by sound which can be easily manipulated. It reminded me a lot of The Last of Us video game with a mix of 28 Days Later and The Happening, where just one infected individual can rapidly infect others.<br/><br/>Some of the only criticism I have is that is just has the typical dumb/naÃ¯ve woman that screws up and potentially costs everyone their lives and the alcoholic jerk that is only concerned about himself. However, these characters were essential to the progression of the film. I also thought that it was very unrealistic that for going downstream on a boat for over 3 days blindfolded and they don't really run in the potential danger with crashing the boat until they get to a point with rapids.<br/><br/>I was expecting the cop and the drug addict that took off with the car on their own to come back later as psychos / hunters, but we never see them again or find out their fate. Overall this film kept me engaged even though it was 2 hours and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I was hoping that it had a dramatic ending and wouldn't have the typical happy ending, but that is almost all Hollywood films nowadays.

Fine, but when this was pitched, everyone rushed out due to having to breathe the offensive and odious waste smell caused by the flatulence of Bird Box."

"rudygerst","2","3","9","26 December 2018"," Take the worst aspects of: The walking dead, The Happening and A Quiet Place.
","What a terrible, terrible movie.
Sandra Bullock portrays a really unpleasant character, very difficult to root for. The beginning of the movie, where everything goes crazy, is ok, but too similar to the happening. But in The Happening, at least we had some kind of explanation, as lame as it turned out. In Bird Box, the writers just don't bother. It's implied this is some kind of demons, whatever.
In the end of course, nothing is resolved, because that would take creativity. I kinda hate this kind of movie where the world goes to an end, and we follow a tiny bunch of characters until they get to safe place. It seems like a happy ending, if you forgot that the world is still crazy out there. Anyway...
Dialogues are boring and endless, just like in the walking dead. And characters act stupidly, just like in A quiet place.
By the way, this is a rather long movie (>2h). I would recommend not to waste your time on this one. Really not worth it."

Rather than becoming bogged down in complex (and completely ridiculous) explanations and back stories to the apocalyptic ending, Birdbox focuses in on something far more believable.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's performance as Mallorie is stunning, with the whole cast portraying believable, real people.

"timothyrobertcooke","6","3","9","24 December 2018"," The Happening
","Better than The Happening, but why the cop out with no explaination? If you are going to base a movie on ""something strange"" at least try and explain where it came from."
"tristeange","8","3","9","23 December 2018"," Not a bad movie, all-in-all
","This isn't a bad movie, all-in-all. I felt that many members of the cast did an excellent job and were very believable in their (slightly overdrawn perhaps) characters. The sets were nicely done. The special effects were not cheesy, and while the plot seemed to spend a long time focusing on the interplay of characters in the first house, it still kept my interest. All of this makes the movie certainly watchable...especially if you, like me, have a bad cold and are looking for something new and interesting.
Now for the cons. Sorry that I'm being nit-picky here. I KNOW it's hard for an author to write a believable story; it's much easier to pick one apart. However, I've seen other movies based on a similar concept (sound), but I had a harder time suspending disbelief that people could somehow function in a post-apocalyptic world without the use of vision. The ""string"" method used by the heroine to retrace her steps was clever, but I live in a rural area, and walking through the woods and avoiding snakes, holes, and fallen limbs even WITH eyesight can be a challenge. I have had rather poor vision since childhood, and it would be slightly dangerous for me to take a walk even without my glasses, and even sighted people often get lost. Just one wrong step and you'd find yourself sliding down a hill, stepping on some dangerous piece of debris, or smacking into a tree. Yet somehow these people are walking through woods, getting a boat into a river, planting a little garden (!). Could it be done? Possibly, but it wouldn't be easy. Just flip over that boat and there's a good chance a snake is going to be underneath it! Driving the car seemed equally unbelievable. With all the debris on the road, the car would have had a flat pretty quickly, and what's the chance that a random car would have all those proximity warning lights? Okay, okay....nice house, wealthy family probably has a new car, etc.
There is also a matter about the blindfolds. They would have to be just the right fabric. If the fabric is too loosely-woven, you may be able to actually see through the holes in the fabric. Again, I have rather poor eyesight. As a child, I found it funny that looking through the small holes in loosely-woven fabric actually helped my eyes focus a little better. Maybe that's just my vision, and that wearing a blindfold might actually be WORSE for me in such a world.
Finally, the ending just dropped the ball a bit. Okay, they're in a school for the visually impaired. Great place to be. It's full of people. Great. Where's the food to feed all those folks coming from? Where's the water coming from? What happens when the ""bandits"" attack? There are still the same basic survival problems that the people faced in the house. Who are the monsters and what exactly makes a person one of their minions, anyway? (We get a hint of this, but no solid answers.)
So, to sum up. I really DID enjoy this movie. I felt that acting was VERY well done, and I'd watch it again."

"mariacamilabarriosl-77892","6","3","9","23 December 2018"," Too long of a movie and not that good

"apryla-58795","10","3","9","23 December 2018"," It's about the Journey...not the destination
","This was great. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that really pulled me in and held my attention. I love when I finally hit on a good movie, but it's frustrating because they are few and far between.<br/><br/>I have not read the book this is based on nor did I see The Quiet Place so I was in a position of being able to have an open mind when watching this film.<br/><br/>The main thing many people don't realize or seem to be able to accept is that movies based on books will NOT follow the book to the letter. It's just not possible to film a movie the same way a book is written. Often times the book is just simply an idea and only a basis - the movie could go off in a hundred different directions. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad film but it can cause dissatisfaction to those who have read the book. That dissatisfaction turns into a critique of the film and the two can't be judged the same. It's not fair to the film when someone goes into it with a closed mind. It just taints the experience.<br/><br/>I had an open mind so I took this movie for what it was. Sandra Bullock plays an artist who is basically one step away from being agoraphobic. When the movie starts she is heavily pregnant. Her sister (played by Sarah Paulson who was wasted in this role) brings groceries to Sandra and says that there is some weird thing happening overseas. People are committing suicide en masse and no one knows why. Sandra blows it off and says that it's not ""here"" so she doesn't need to worry about it. There is also talk about the man who got Sandra pregnant. He's no longer in the picture.<br/><br/>Next scene shows Sandra and Sarah at the doctor's office getting a sonogram. Sandra is very removed from her feelings and is ambivalent about her pregnancy. The doctor tells her that if she decides not to keep her baby she could opt to put it up for adoption.<br/><br/>Next scene shows Sandra & Sarah leaving the doctor's office. As they are walking out things start to get weird. A woman is violently smashing her head into a window. Sandra is struck with the realization that whatever was overseas is now taking place where they are.<br/><br/>Sandra gets in the car and tells Sarah to get going quickly. They head out but car crashes are happening and people are walking into traffic. Sarah starts driving erratically and Sandra is trying to stop her. Sarah crashes into a car and they flip over. When Sarah gets out of the car she walks in front of a bus and gets hit. After that it's mass chaos and Sandra is stunned from the accident and slightly in shock from seeing her sister die. Someone grabs Sandra and tells her she needs to keep moving. She stumbles along and keeps falling until finally a woman runs out of a house to help her. The woman starts to help her but then looks up and says, ""Mom..."" and then proceeds to get into a burning car and die.<br/><br/>A man (Trevante Rhodes who was great in this-his teeth are like chiclets they are so perfect and white AND his biceps had their own starring role in the film!) comes along to help Sandra and he leads her to the house the woman came from who was trying to help Sandra. After some initial resistance they are allowed to enter the house. The house belongs to B.D. Wong. John Malkovich is inside and his wife was the one who helped Sandra before dying-so he appears to despise her on sight.<br/><br/>We are introduced to a cast of characters who largely served as nothing more than a way to progress the story. They were picked off one by one and since we aren't given an opportunity to get invested in them we feel nothing when they die.<br/><br/>Sandra and Trevante form a bond almost immediately. They survive and continue on living for several years by making due with the resources available to them. They raise her son and a little girl who was left in her care after the Mom died shortly after giving birth (the Mom was one of the group of people who found her way into B.D. Wong's house. During her stay she asked Sandra to promise that she'd take care of her little girl should anything happen to her. Tom Hollander got to the room after she gave birth and ripped down the stuff covering the windows and she got exposed to the light without her blindfold and killed herself).<br/><br/>There is something in the atmosphere that causes people to commit suicide when they open their eyes. We never see these entities. They are more like a presence. Sandra, Trevante and the kids wear blindfolds when they go outside.<br/><br/>One day they hear a man over the walkie talkie asking if anyone is out there. Trevante answers against Sandra's better judgement. They find out there are survivors but they are about a two day trip away by boat.<br/><br/>Sandra, Trevante and the kids set out for the commune. Before they get too far a band of people who can somehow survive without blindfolds attempt to kill Sandra & company. Trevante tells Sandra to go on ahead with the kids while he tries to slow the group down. He tells her he will join them as soon as he can. Things go sideways and Trevante ends up dying. Now Sandra must go on the journey with the kids without Trevante.<br/><br/>For the rest of the movie we see Sandra and the kids as they are in the boat and also flashbacks of when they lived together in the house before Trevante died. The scenes are intense and keep you glued to the screen.<br/><br/>I won't go into the rest of the film because the ending doesn't matter. People don't seem to get it...the movie is not about the destination. It's about how Sandra was able to keep her family together until they got to the commune. You see her struggle and fall apart briefly but ultimately she pulls herself together to get her children to safety. Look at it like this...there are unseen dangers facing us every day. Even though we can't always see what can harm us it doesn't matter. We do what we can to survive (no matter what we encounter) so we can keep our family intact. This film showed that perfectly.<br/><br/>I think Sandra was great in this. I have liked her ever since Speed. Yes her face is starting to get a little too close to resembling a Dark Crystal character but she still looks fantastic.<br/><br/>The little boy did not have much expression throughout the film so I can't say he did a good job but the little girl was great. I sure hope they weren't scared of Sandra while they were filming because she did not seem to be handling them with ""kid gloves"".<br/><br/>This is not your typical Netflix drivel. This is more like a big screen film and I think it was very well done. The only issue I had that was out of left field and a bit contrived was when the doctor just so happened to be at the commune when they got there...um ok how?<br/><br/>MGK spoiler-he is on screen for about 5 minutes...has about 5 lines, a sex scene and then we never see him again. It could've been anybody in that role.<br/><br/>And finally here's a big spoiler for you...you do see what the creatures look like..they show you very plainly through Tom Hollander's drawings. It's called ""paying close attention"". It was all laid out on the table.<br/><br/>Sandra just say no to any further cosmetic enhancements but definitely say yes to more acting...you are beautiful and talented. Nice job."

","I just finished watching this movie, prior to watching it I looked at the scores it received on multiple sites as well as a variety of reviews and went into the movie with an open mind. This film lacked character development as my number one gripe. Secondly, the format of beginning with the present and using flashbacks through a majority of the movie spoiled it within the first few minutes. The concept of a mysterious ""thing"" causing mass suicides would make a bigger impact if the characters had been properly developed. Since you have no emotional attachment to a majority of the characters their deaths just add to the body count. I also feel that Sandra Bullock's character wasn't consistent in her personality. Yes, I understand that she changes as the story progresses but I'm talking about her attitude changing from scene to scene making it unclear where her character's head was during a majority of this movie. I definitely wouldn't suggest this film to anyone."

"regexfan","6","2","5","16 January 2020"," Why do some people want everything to be ""explained"" to them all the time?
","How have human beings become this dumb? Seems like in this day and age, you can't make movies that don't show and explain everything anymore. People don't even trust their own imaginations/assumptions, or people just don't have imaginations anymore. One reviewer said ""If I wanted to imagine my own ending I'd just imagine the entire story!"" except that he can't. You can't even use your brain to imagine an ending to a ridiculously simple movie, how can you imagine the entire story? Now, the movie itself, to me, was nothing to write home about. It's a post-apocalypse movie, post-apocalypse movies are like zombie movies, they are not to be taken seriously. They usually don't have sensible plot, they exist just for the sole purpose of entertainment (other than to make money of course), not awards season, and one viewing is enough. Just ignore the hype around this movie. Don't expect anything groundbreaking or original. Yes, some characters did do stupid things like characters in post-apocalypse/zombie/horror movies always do, but it's tolerable. If you can sit back and enjoy it for what it is, you might as well be entertained. I think if you watch it with this mindset you won't be disappointed UNLESS you are the type who want everything to be shown and explained to you all the time. In that case, no, you won't get an answer to where the young couple who ran away with the car ended up in, or whether they made it alive or not."
"xhuliano-39816","8","2","5","26 December 2019"," That's a good movie
","So, let me shiw my poiont of view from the hole movie. First of all,if you are searching for some scary movie with explanations,sich as who is he and why does he do that etc, dont watch this one. But if you are asking for a movie with meaning, a movie that shows human relationships in ""survival mood"", a movie that makes you realise how much can a human being love his life and even more how much can a human being love other people's life,thats what you want.
Also,i think that the movie has the appropriate ammount of explanations.
Spoilers following:
First of all only crazy peole tend not to kill themselves. Why(?) Because you don't need to know and you cannot know, that's why is a mystery for five years.
The wonderful realistic part is that 2 or three people can't find out a lot of right conclusions. You need more of them,and a lot more of different stories. And finally the right persons who will make the crusial step forward.That's the beauty of it. We believed as humans in stupid things for so many centuies, like earth being flat.
Second, in the movie the Reason that is considered to be responsible for all the mess is a creature. But that's,in my opinion, a wrong conclusion, such as these i am referring to. There's no creature, there is something like a virus,a mental virus that somehow is soread throught the air. If you see, you get it. And in the final scene was very obvious what was happening. The more the light that is hitting your eyes directly,without passing anything, the more the virus can take over your mind. That's why when you have a piece of frabic in your eyes that has some little holes which light can pass through, you hear voices. If you cover yor eyes completly you hear nothing."

It follows Mallory (Sandra Bullock) through two time eras separated by 5 years. The first era is the start of the crisis where people begin to commit suicide and act mindless. The second time zone, 5 years later and current, is her attempt, with her two children to escape the mayhem to a place of safety. The story unfolds at a perfect pace and the character build up is not overdone, just giving enough understanding to give some clarity.
Sandra Bullock is perfect as Mallory and the rest of the cast give strong performances. The story is original and the nature of the enemy is never explained. It doesn't have to be. It is filmed through Mallory's journey so the audience doesn't know any more than she does.

Great performance as usual from Sandra Bullock. I've heard people say she is not a good actrice. But every movie she is in becomes a hit. She reminds me of Sylvester Stallone in one way: all the people who laugh at her ""pathetic acting"" have watched her movies a thousand times. Sandra, like Stallone, is no genius actor. The secret to their success is simple. They have both mastered one character perfectly. Stallone has mastered the character of the innocent-tough-guy who manages to fight his way to victory; no matter how formidable the opponent. Bullock has also mastered one particular character perfectly. She is great at playing the innocent woman who manages to survive a horrific situation; even thought all the odds are stacked against her.<br/><br/>The director of this movie knew what he was doing. Bird Box once again affirms that NOT SHOWING the monster is much scarier. The fellow who made this movie, unlike other modern horror directors, understands how to create tension.<br/><br/>I was pleased that the obvious political messaging in this movie was not thrown in my face.

"thewakenarrative","8","2","5","13 January 2019"," Take off your blindfolds for this review
","Bird Box (Beware there may be spoilers) The memes have run wild with images from this new Netflix thriller. Sandra Bullock is our hero and begins the movie blindfolded, leading 2 small children, also blindfolded, out into the woods and down into a hidden canoe to forge the river. Her demands are clear ""..under no circumstance are you allowed to take off your blindfold. If I find that you have, I will hurt you."", and she is not kidding.
We jump back 5 years and learn how this land of blindfolds comes to be. Sandra, Malorie, is a bit of a loner artist, who is pregnant and going to a doctor's appointment with her sister, Jessica, played by Sarah Paulson. Everything is fine until people everywhere begin committing suicide, for no apparent reason. Jessica is driving Malorie home when she too becomes overtaken with whatever this force is, her face turns to sadness, and crashes the car. When that doesn't do that trick, she jumps in front of a moving garbage truck. Something terrible must be in the air. If you see ""it"" you will commit suicide.
Jumping ahead again 5 years, the story continues through the lives of Malorie, her two children, and her significant other, Tom. It follows their struggles and their perseverance to survive in this new world. She also carries along with her two pet canaries that possess the ability to sense the dark presence. With a powerful M. Night Shayamalan composition, this movie makes you cling to the unknown. It surrounds the viewer with an overwhelming sense of anxiety like you are blindfolded yourself, leaving you gripping your seat for the next scene.
How could this possibly end up, is there any hope? Who strives in an environment where sight is outlawed - the blind. However, there may also be outlaws that bring vision to the darkness.
Best names for children: boy and girl - no gender equality here
Scariest non-villain: Douglas - played by the talented John Malkovich, but what a douche

A bunch of characters just randomly getting killed and then Sandra getting trough a river just to arrive to a school of the blind, IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST.<br/><br/>Look, the quality and scenery of this movie was there but the plot is soooo predictable and tbh faulty of logic, also pretty unoriginal. Every character and scene is just a means to an end, it's pretty boring.<br/><br/>Oh, I also forgot to mention that because the directors decided to show the scenes for the river at the start of the movie you pretty much know everything that's going to happen, that's how pointless this movie is."
"edgardorivas","6","2","5","10 January 2019"," Not Really Scary
","I really didn't know what to expect watching this film. All I knew is it had Sandra Bullock and it was getting popular. So to kill time in the afternoon I decided to give it a try. Now I get scared easy, like pretty easy, last horror film I watch was The Shining(1980) and it gave me nightmares that night(I know pathetic). The movie starts with Sandra Bullock getting an update of her pregnancy at the hospital and all hell breaks loose. The movie does a weird transition from the present moments and story of the very beginning of the apocalypse. Bullock's acting as always nailed it on point, she's very talented at what she does. Everyone else ehh not so much, and even Machine Gun Kelly is in it which is strange in itself(he's not good in the film either). The actual monster is never seen because it's invisable apparently, but you hear it's presence. It has to be the least scariest creature ever. It also ends very abruptly with lots of questions wanting to be answered about the creatures like: why does it turn some people insane to kill others, or why birds aren't affected by the creatures and why does it affect those watching video of it also? Not scary and a lot left to be desired."

","This is a very watchable well made film with an interesting story.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call this a 'horror' at all, but as a sci-fi it is well worth watching.<br/><br/>Bullock probably isn't the first name one would think of for this genre but she does a good job of playing the main character, and even the two kids put in a believable performance.<br/><br/>It may not be a genre buster but it is certainly worth watching."

"kiowhatta","5","2","5","7 January 2019"," Another decent movie ruined by PC characters
","Great movie, trite genre, but done well. Let's get past all the shallow what was the presence,who was the best performer what did it all mean and talk about what is the REAL insidious perverse infection that is slowly sterilising what many are calling the golden age of T.V.
It's name cannot be uttered, for you shall be shouted down.
It's name is MISANDRY. Yes that's right, hatred of boys and men.<br/><br/>Wha? I'll explain. In ACT I Sandra bullocks character gives us a appalling acount of her father and she and her sister laugh it up. set up No 1.
Bullock is diconnected from her child and is thinking of discarding it because it might be a boy and she hates them. (because all men are stupid and evil).<br/><br/>Next we find ourselves in the survival house beginning ACT II. Malkovich plays the spiteful, misanthropic, hateful owner of the house (who's redeeming feature is he let's his gay friend die at the computer).
eventually Bullock and Malkovich the strong male and strong female lock horns. We know Malkovich's unflinching refusal to trust anyone new is a sound option. But he's an A**hole. Bullock on the other hand is in her own way a misanthrope too, but she gets the 'strong but nice' tag.
Eventually it is the tatooed idiot who leads the woman astray, the last stranger in (a man ) is actually a conduit for the 'demons', and Bullock is saved by 'Mr U.S.A.'
I liked his character, but his was way too buff, sugar coated the Iraq war, and according to Bullock, poisons the children's minds with storytales and hope - which make him BAD.
Look, you don't need an analysis of the rest, it's a sad commentary on what used to be a medium that ultimately treated everyone as morally ambiguous, not good and evil.
I have been aware of this social trend for over twenty years and now it is infecting our screens everywhere in every way.
My fear is not the Apocalypse, it's the systematic dialectical destruction and villainising of men.
Even the young girl who would be born 'soft' of the sweet chubby woman is miraculously formed into hardened feminist steel, while Bullocks own boy hardly gets a word in.
You'll say I'm crazy (or worse - I'm a misogynist), which has become shorthand for any type of criticism or even analysis of the unbalanced, untrue portrayal of gender in film, and it's gathering pace.
Next time you watch a Western film, watch how the subtle underlying messages about ( and this is what it boils down to): ALL MEN are perpetrators, ALL WOMEN are victims."
"intrepidami","5","2","5","7 January 2019"," I have a brain so the huge plot hole ruined it for me.
","Maybe this movie could become the next Rocky Horror audience participation movie! Where somebody figures out appropriate things to yell at the screen. Like when Douglas suggests they stay at the supermarket...the audience could yell YES YES YES. Then they argue about not doing that and again ..NO NO NO.<br/><br/>This movie is like an encyclopedia of used movie tropes and stolen things already seen.The one movie they should have copied was Dawn of The Dead that solved the supplies problem.<br/><br/>Because with the scenario of being holed up, blindfolded and trying to scavenge these people should all be dead within weeks without having a large food source found. Why don't you try it. Have somebody watch you for protection, get blindfolded and try to just make it to your next door neighbors house front door. Then think about having to do that, 3 times day and successfully break in, find food and make it back to your house. Without dropping everything 12 times and such.<br/><br/>Food is required for survival. There just was not enough food available to survive even a few months, for 2 adults, 2 growing children, and how long before the house population was finally whittled down to just that. Have you ever seen a family of fours groceries? Even trying to ration. You've got a woman who needs to nurse 2 children. close by house scavenging ...they might have lasted 1 months total. With him out scavenging 2,3 times a day.<br/><br/>Remember that Castaway movie with Tom Hanks. How does he survive? He become adept at fishing. We're shown this. Otherwise the viewers would be wondering how the hell is he surviving?<br/><br/>This HUGE plot hole could have been easily solved. All they needed to do was make Douglas a survival nut with a basement full of long lasting food supplies. Or a neighbor house was owned by one. ""Mr Wilson was one of those survival guys, I'll bet he's got a few years of rations, we need to get to his house"" But unless they found a large food supply the survival longevity makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>This gets compounded by a factor of 100X with the ending. What are ALL these people eating?<br/><br/>Leaving the water still running was a cute touch, because apparently somebody figured out without that they'd die in a week. Of course it was ridiculous, but showed somebody had a few brain cells.<br/><br/>This is by far not the movies only flaws, but if they all starve to death, there's nothing else to continue with."

","Whilst the central threat is vague and unexplained, the characters in this react fairly realistically to it - some want to help others, some are just scared, and some are only concerned with their own survival. The film nicely charts the survivors development of strategies to cope with the situation, and adds in a nice curve ball with the idea of ""collaborators"". The idea of birds warning of the danger gives the film its name. Sandra Bullock is excellent, as are the other performances. The film is tautly played switching between the present and the backstory, maintaining tension in each storyline."

They get into a bunch of situations. It's really great entertainment, tense and a bit jump scary at times.

"chilichilipepper","7","2","5","4 January 2019"," My honest review.
","I don't know if anyone really reads my reviews so I include a 'disclaimer' of sorts at first. Really, I rate on a fair scale. 5 is average (as in was ok but nothing special), I very rarely give out 1's or 10's because very few movies are perfect or complete crap.<br/><br/>TLDR: Overall this is a really good movie that I'm surprised came from Netflix Studios and wasn't released in theaters. It's a slow moving suspenseful movie with amazing acting and a good plot, and the ending is kind of a let down, but also fits into the entire narrative of the movie. Almost rated this an 8, but point deducted for some problems with the pacing and the ending. 100% worth watching though!<br/><br/>So anyway, it seems like most of the reviews here are divided into three categories. Those that 1star said ""Ending sucked"" or ""No Plot"",those that give it 10 stars and call it a masterpiece without really explaining anything. or those like me, that give it a fair and unbiased review. So here we go. 7 stars because this is an above average movie that almost made me want to give it 8, but just missed.<br/><br/>Acting - Just amazing. Really don't need to say more than that.<br/><br/>Plot - The plot is rough at some points and the ending is kind of a ""um what?"" moment, but overall the acting makes the plot / script work in a way that at least makes it enjoyable.<br/><br/>Directing / Camera work / cinematography / music- Again, all are just amazing. It actually shocked me that this was a Netflix film and not released in theaters. Simply beautifuly shot and it's amazing what the director got out of the actors<br/><br/>Pacing (just including this since a lot of people complain about it). The movie is a slow burn for sure, the pacing IS a little scattered but overall, the flashbacks are well placed and in general, it's not great but it fits the theme of the movie."
"whitemanfromtowne","3","2","5","4 January 2019"," Was not impressed.
","So I downloaded and watch this film called BirdBox aka the Happening 2, and I can safely say that I was not impressed. Literally it's a happening of a alien life force that is destroying mankind, thru gazing upon, what you never see or never know exactly what it is, because the story never divulges that premise of what is causing the occurrence (very nonsensical) and Bullock and her child and the child of the another women who fell under the happening (which causes when looked upon, alters a person's perception and hence, they end their own lives) dies and Bullock and the children now have to survive by seeking refuge at a place where they must travel to, against all sorts of hostel elements, to reach their destination. This story is doable, but the script is so similar to the Happening, which I found non impressive as well. I watched it and deleted it, because it was a film, I would never watch again, unlike the films in my enormous film library that I watch over again that are highly enjoyable."

"ellisjohnson-71892","6","2","5","3 January 2019"," Great suspense and tension but abysmal ending
","The director of this film (Susanne Bier) clearly studied other films of this genre to know how to successfully create a tense and suspenseful atmosphere throughout the duration of the film. Since the 'creatures' are not seen in the film, this really helps the audience's imagination picture various ideas of these 'creatures'. However, my only problem with this film is the ending feels rushed and vague which doesn't tie up any loose ends of the film. Therefore, this leads to the whole experience and atmosphere of the film being subdued by this abysmal ending which could of been improved. I feel that this film could've got a much better rating if this ending was thought about more. A brilliant film with a sub-brilliant ending"
"wihe","8","2","5","3 January 2019"," Watch and think simple
","The purpose of watching films other than getting logic out of it, I believe is to get entertainment out of it.<br/><br/>I personally think Bird Box did a good job.

"alybgoss","9","2","5","3 January 2019"," Those rating less than 9 don't get it
","I've seen a lot of reviewers on here that seemed to enjoy ""A Quiet Place,"" yet didn't find the horror in ""Bird Box"" enjoyable. This movie is PLENTY horrifying, just more in an apocalyptic nightmare scenario, other than just blood and gore. Could you live in an apocalypse, without being able to see?<br/><br/>So spoilers*********<br/><br/>The entities didn't force certain people to kill themselves, because those people were mentally ill. Just as the blind were unaffected, because they couldn't see, the mentally ill people found beauty in the darkness, and recieved the message that they needed to force others to experience the it, as well.<br/><br/>The ending is at a school for the blind, which is quite beautiful, really. The birds in the vines, that cover the school, alert the people with sight that something is wrong. Malory caught on to this early, and the ending was a beautiful testament to the saying ""life finds a way.""<br/><br/>As for the fillers, they're all important, leading up to the event where Malory takes Tom (previously Boy), and Olivia (previously Girl) down the river.<br/><br/>Why didn't Malory name the children? I think that it's a very complex answer, that involves deep psychological aspects. My own opinion is that she didn't name them, simply because she felt that keeping them nameless allowed her to distance herself from them, as a form of protection. They call her Malory, and she calls them Boy and Girl. In the end, she names them and calls herself their mother.<br/><br/>The only thing I can agree with the naysayers, here, is that there's no explanation or backstory to explain where the creatures come from, or why they're here. I think the movie tried to explain it as ""demons and beasts"" in a religious context, and that it was a final judgment scenario, but that did fall through the cracks, quite a bit.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an excellent movie, and deserves to be recognized as such. It may not be a brand new concept (I'm sure most of us saw ""I Am Legend,"" here), however it did have refreshing aspects, in a time where we're getting live action Disney remakes, left and right. I'm not usually a big fan of Netflix's original content, I only have a subscription to watch shows and movies I've previously enjoyed, but ""Bird Box"" was an enjoyable movie. You're allowed to have your own opinion, I just hope to see more fresh ideas out there, rather than movie-makers that thrive off of a nostalgic infused fuel."
"derek-07606","6","2","5","3 January 2019"," Fun movie but the book tells a much better and coherent story
","I don't want to be one of ""those people"" and I don't expect a movie to be as good as a book but the story of Bird Box is given a misjustice from this movie. The book has character identities, relationships, storylines, etc. that are completely different. For example, Tom isn't a musclebound stud in the book, he is an older father-figure that the house respects and is like a father to Malorie. This is something you would think should of been preserved and not changed THIS MUCH for a movie. Malorie also just doesn't crash in front of a house. There is an entire (and important) story on how she finds and gets accepted into the house. The monsters are also talked about and explained in a deeper sense and not just ""the spooky thing outside"". As a matter of fact, you start to understand where they are from, why they are here, and what they are. Something the movie totally skips over but obviously important. There are many other examples but I don't want to ruin it if somebody wants to read the book. Bottom line though, it's changing the story too much to be what the author intended. The last movie I have seen that jacked up the story this much from the intention of the book was Starship Troopers. That's going back a long time.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it's ok in it's own right. It's fun and well made with decent acting. It's a good showcase of what a Netflix movie can be. The movie wouldn't feel out of place in theaters. Just don't expect anything profound, sit back, and have a good time watching it."

","To me, a lot of the Netflix original movies feel churned out. They're well produced and it's not bad filmmaking at all, but something is missing. Maybe the Netflix executives discourage the filmmakers they work with from taking risks? Whatever the case may be, their movies don't feel very passionate. Bird Box fits into this mold. The best way I can describe this movie is ""decent."" With all the good ingredients they had to work with (top actors, strong production value, etc), it's disappointing that the filmmakers behind this made something with such a flat affect.

Some are just driven crazy and attack others at random but others embrace the change and see it as the new reality, forcing others to take off blindfolds.<br/><br/>In the early stages, survivors including Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich take shelter in a house, only venturing out when supplies run short. They discover that viewing the entities even through CCTV footage results in suicide. The survivors are divided about admitting newcomers as they suspect that the change has resulted in new normative behaviours in humans who survived exposure to the entities. Birds give an early warning of the entities approach.Later Bullock s shown travelling down a river with two children as she seeks a supposed sanctuary.<br/><br/>A pretty savage aftermath to the fall of civilisation is portrayed in Bird Box, the suicides begin in Europe before they spread to America and presumably the rest of the world. There are three fears, seeing the entities and being changed, being attacked by the psychotic changees, being forced to change by those who now worship the entities.<br/><br/>Susanne Bier has turned Eric Heisserer's script into an intriguing new addition to the Post-Apocalypse genre. 8/10.

I'll save you the trouble though you never get to actually see the movies antagonist in the end which was a big let down because I was hoping for some sort of physical representation. The film actually plays out as a semi-thriler with more focus on the relationship between the kids and malorie which isn't bad but didn't do a great job of getting me to care what happened to them.

The virtue signalling is blatant in this film, every minority is heroic and self sacrificing, the fallen are all white, the gun owner an angry man mad at the gay who again selflessly sacrifices himself as well.
So the only lessons were accidental, the cultural messages being put out by this set are pushing society to self destruction, and even as they are damaged themselves, they try to take others down with them.

","I'm only comparing it because just about everyone online is doing the same, but remember when A Quiet Place displayed relentless tension with a PG-13 rating and made great use of its cast in a contained setting? Well Bird Box has big great ideas with an even better cast, but chooses to rarely explore those ideas and talents to its full potential. A post-apocalyptic film based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Josh Malerman, focuses on a mother and her two children who navigate the terrifying landscapes of a world where a certain 'presence' is able to manipulate your brain into killing yourself if you look in its direction outdoors. Just reading what I just typed out could either make the film sound incredibly stupid or incredibly scary. It's neither. Director Susanne Bier establishes a creepy mood and tone throughout, but never follows through with any true horror or scares.

","With all the hype around ""Bird Box"" I had to move it up my Netflix list before someone spoiled it.
Somewhere a movie producer for Sony or Disney just got themselves fired for passing on this and allowing it to wind up at Netflix. It was oddly reminiscent of ""A Quiet Place"" which grossed $350,000 worldwide, and Bird Box was a much better film. This is easily the best original movie Netflix has produced and clearly should have found its way to a box office."
"danielmjholland-519-797372","9","2","5","30 December 2018"," Excellent pacing
","This films sits between the horror and the action genres. It navigates this really strongly as an adventure. The switching between the past and present is not a style I normally like but it works very well for this film.<br/><br/>The point of this story is not the invisible monsters or who makes it. I can see why some people may be thinking that these are the important parts because most films of this style hyperfocus on those things to build the tension. The problem with those stories is that they are very shallow - either the characters you most identify with live or die and well, that's about all there is to it. What makes this film so much stronger is that really it's all about Bullock's character arc. She goes from considering letting go of her own child for adoption to being a mother of a child that isn't ever hers.<br/><br/>This might seem trivial or trite but I think that we should celebrate this type of film more. It is about looking down the barrel of human nature and understanding how it works by looking at how it reacts in unusual situations. Bullock's character softens and at critical times you can see how she is not just trying to do the right thing because it is expected of her, but because she loves the children. And whilst the final part of the tension is a little forced, you can see from her pleading (and some excellent acting) what the children mean to her. She doesn't change the story - the story changes her.<br/><br/>There are a few elements that let the film down a bit, but you often find this in film adaptations that struggle to get all the narrative into a faster paced medium. But one thing that should be celebrated is that all the characters act as intelligently (or more so) than you expect of them. Especially in the 'present day' sections which they have had 5 years to hone their survival skills. Small touches like this really add to the immersion, especially when in so many films characters have to act incredibly stupidly to advance the plot.<br/><br/>In summary it doesn't matter from the opening scenes that you can work out things that have yet to happen in the film, and it doesn't matter that we never really understand what the enemy is. What matters is how people act in trying times, and the story of the lead character's development."

","I read somewhere that 45 million people viewed this film. You hear statistics like that and think it must be pretty good, right? Well, it's basically Night of the Living Dead...a bunch of desperate characters trapped in a house while the world collapses outside. You have the stern older white man that no one listens to (to their detriment), the heroic black male, the no-nonsense older woman, and the nerd who's totally unprepared for the apocalypse. Oh, and to update the formula for the new millennium, the asian guy and his ""husband"", so it's basically the united nations in a sprawling mansion while unseen creatures, that you never see, ravage the planet. I'm wondering why the voices didn't follow them all the way on the trip, why wait until the last second when they're at the sanctuary. Why were some humans immune to the creatures. It's a frustrating and pointless trip with a lame payoff, much like The Happening."

About the only developments are that the characters figure out that you can't look outside or go outside without a blindfold. Other than that, I don't see the point of the movie at all. The movie drags on and just doesn't go anywhere. The acting was good, and maybe with a plot this would have been a good movie."

This movie had characters that were interesting. I really liked the lead. Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job here making you believe her. She is really touching as a mother, and there is something so relatable about her choices. She makes sense. That's so important in these films that have really unbelievable premises to begin with.
This movie actually made me cry.
I loved that there was not such a terrible ending too. I mean everyone dies , but not everyone. And that's so rad.
I am still going to a movie to be entertained after all, and when movies don't do anything you want them to do at the end when you're so attached at that point to the characters and their outcomes- it sucks.
Like if Game of Thrones kills off Jon Snow and The mother of dragons and they don't live happily ever after raising their baby and Cersi doesn't die- I'm going to really hate the best tv series ever made. All because it ended badly.
This one is good entertainment ! And worth a watch. That's really all we can ask for in a movie. Right?"

We're simply asked to not question the origin of the epidemic, other than the fact that it can be avoided by not seeing- we don't understand why psychopaths and other mentally ill don't get affected, and we never get to see what a person that gets affected see.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie abruptly ends when they arrive at the school for the blind- there is no closure, simply a very shallow ending trying to brute force something about the beauty of the world when apparences are ignored.<br/><br/>PS: yes, all the strong characters in the movie are kickass women, and all the men are cucks."

You instantly connect with the movie's main character, which is one of Sandra Bullock's best performances. Also, it's nice to see a great movie that does NOT get ruined by terrible child actors - the kids in this movie do an excellent job.<br/><br/>I consider myself pretty picky and often stop shows or movies on streaming services halfway through from lack of interest, but this one had me pegged from the beginning to the very end.

My husband really liked the movie and he couldn't believe it received any negative feedback.<br/><br/>So the complaint I heard was that it was really confusing and didn't make sense, so I read up on the plot of the story to get some background information beforehand to understand the movie more. The gist of the movie/book is that there are monsters out there and if you look at them, it will drive you crazy and suicidal. However, without giving too much away, it doesn't drive actual crazy people crazy. That's pretty much all you need to know, but you would've figured that out without having to research beforehand, so I don't get what was so confusing...<br/><br/>It's a good thriller and I'm so glad we didn't listen to the naysayers and actually watched it.

If you liked those youll like this. Its a bit sloppy with a few things, but good acting and dialogue and tempo.

The creature still exist there's no way to kill it unless you can't see it simple. If your inside it can't get you also simple. If you were crazy prior to the events of the creature exsisting then you can see cause your still crazy. It's the red room from hill house on steroids an ominous presence that makes you see what it wants you to see so it can kill you also simple. You don't see the creature cause it's an Ominous presence with no corporeal form also simple idea to grasp. If you don't get the movie or the ending your a bird in a box. The acting was great the whole way through my only complaint about this movie was Sarah Paulson was under used.<br/><br/>By the way this movie isn't A Quiet Place rip off it can't be the book was out before that movie and A Quiet place ripped of Hush with the no sound aspect and Hush did it better. Also the creature in a quiet place I've literally seen in another horror movie where the creature goes off sound as well so that's 2 things A Quiet Place ripped off.<br/><br/>All in all don't listen to the hateful review watch it and love it or hate it on your own.

I was excited for a quiet place a lot and i found myself being bored. Bird box to me was a better version of a quiet place. Does it have many plot holes and unanswered questions? Yes. Regardless i enjoyed it. I liked the premise. I liked how they never really showed the monster itself. Gives a glimpse of it through that crazy dude's drawings but leaves its mostly upto our imaginations. I also loved how the monsters could take the voices of their loved ones unlike the ones in a quiet place which was only sensitive to sounds. Just made it all the more creepy. People need to stop being so harsh. What let me down perhaps was the ending. I expected smth more dark. Still very enjoyable. Can sandra bullock please do more movies. I missed her so much."
"Kristamw","9","2","5","28 December 2018"," Intriguing
","Though a bit reminiscent of The Quiet Place, Bird Box holds its own as it literally navigates a river of the unexpected. Who can be trusted? Very few people as it turns out. A seemingly biological warfare of some kind is rapidly plaguing the world. Sandra Bullock and a small host of characters find comfort in one another as they staying inside a house keeps them safe. Of course, it's venturing to the outside, where they must keep themselves blindfolded, that presents the greatest risks as they seek food and help.
Character Development/Writing Quality: Excellent, compelling, shocking, with a sense of urgency that propels you forward with frantic and breath-taking motions.
Values: The family unit is highly praised as is the claim to hope and perseverance, no matter how difficult or terrible the adversity.<br/><br/>
Content (sex, language & violence): There is some language throughout. One scene briefly shows a couple having sex, but the door is quickly--and literally--shut after about a second. Another scene shows a suggestion that a couple has been intimate. There are several instances of violence where people hurt themselves or others; most of these scenes are fueled by surprise rather than graphically portrayed.<br/><br/>
Scare Factor/Suspense: Pretty up there at times, you are never quite sure when to expect another breakout from a new guest.<br/><br/>This was an engaging film that kept you engaged throughout."

","Can't help but feel like we've seen this all before......oh wait, we have 'A Quiet Place - 2018' and 'The Happening - 2008'. And both were done better. I had high hopes for Bird Box but I believe I succumbed to all the hype surrounding its release. The first 1/3 of the movie was decent but it quickly went flat after that. Sandra Bullock did a good job with what she had to work with but some of the selections of supporting cast are questionable. The absence of any hint of resolution to the plot is both confusing and frustrating. So yes, this movie leaves you hanging at the end and in a BIG way. In typical Hollywood fashion, all the diversity and inclusiveness boxes get checked with little regard as to how or even if they contribute to the overall script. Keeping with the Hollywood agenda, they manage to work in the old and tired narrative that all white men are self-serving and bad while people of color and women are virtuous and good. Of the 5 villains in the movie, all are white and 4 are men. It proves once again that the movies coming out of Hollywood now, regardless of which studio releases them, are all written from within the Hollywood liberal, utopian, fantasy world."

"jetmoviereviews","8","2","5","28 December 2018"," The Happening and A Quiet Place Had a Baby
","...and the baby is beautiful. This was a fun movie. The reason I am mentioning those two films is because of the similarities between them. In this movie, the creature (or whatever it is) makes people kill themselves, like in The Happening. Instead of being quiet, though, (like in A Quiet Place) you must be blind. While there are similarities, I don't think it is trying to completely copy the films. It's just using similar ideas.
Sandra Bullock is amazing in this movie. The whole cast is great, including the kids. You care about all of the characters (for the most part) and are left on the edge of your seat wondering who is going to die next. The storytelling is phenomenal and makes it easy to keep track on when the plot jumps back in time and back to present day. Whatever the creatures look like we don't really know (if they even have a physical body), and that can kind of be a let down for a big monster fan like I am. The ending also felt a little underwhelming to me, with it not really giving an explanation for the creatures or anything. But that's okay. Not all movies have to answer all the questions. That's what makes it fun. Overall, I think Bird Box is a great addition to the horror genre, and is very entertaining. Netflix, for the most part, does a very good job with it's original movies. I highly recommend this film."

I really enjoyed the suspense and thought it was well acted throughout. I've read a lot of reviews saying ""it's been done before"" but haven't they all? An original movie is a rare thing these days so as far as entertainment goes this was easy to watch from start to finish. There are some uncomfortable scenes but nothing overly gorey and there are some plot holes ie time line but they're easy enough to fill in. I would class this in a Sci-fi suspense/thriller as opposed to a ""Horror"" but overall a great movie especially if your into the apocalyptic/end of days genre."

","I did not like the movie, Pleasant to watch Sandra Bullock, that's all. There is not much creative element to the story. It's unfortunate that all these movie production companies are going after quantity and leaving quality behind. Actually, they feel like they have to because they are all racing with each other. The plot is full of whats and whys. No question is answered. Reminds me any other movie that has a catch and run movie regardless of the context. In this one, they are only running from flying leaves and hollow voices. The name of the movie is another sore spot. Just watch it and get it over with. Included in your package $7.99 a month :)<br/><br/>Driving down a busy street in downtown, filled with fastfood restaurants, this is the same feeling when you look at all these streaming services. They all try to offer something different and something unique. When the demand is this high, you need to find more screen-writers, more story-tellers, more producers.

","Let me just say that I'm in no way shape or form a movie critic, I can only give you my personal opinion, which is: this was a horrific movie. Here's why.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with fairly high expectations. I read some great reviews, there's an amazing cast. What could go wrong? Well, quite a bit as it turns out.<br/><br/>Halfway through the movie a feeling of 'ok let's move things along' snuck up on me. I got this feeling that it was time to get some information to move the story forwards. It didn't come, nor did it through the entire film.
In spite of OK acting, which is what you can expect from top names as these, Bird Box lacks any depth to the story and leaves you with a whole bunch of unanswered questions by the end. It explains nothing, just takes you along for a 2 hour scare ride. And 'scare' is being generous, a few ruffling leaves don't really do it for me.<br/><br/>Unanswered questions for me include who were the entities? What did they want? Why could some people walk outside without blindfolds? How did they survive for 5 odd years? What happened to the couple that escaped the house? What's the deal with Gary and his drawings? What about the groups driving around? Why couldn't the oh-so-scary entities enter houses?<br/><br/>Other things are just hard to believe. You expect me to believe that the sanctuary blind school was more than a 2 day travel, yet they could reach each other on that walkie? The entire boat flips, but the bird box somehow makes it through?<br/><br/>And then the ending.. which just left so much to be desired. They somehow make it to this place and bang, that's it. happy days.<br/><br/>Poor plot, very poor depth to the story, poor ending. Bitterly disappointing. 3/10."

","REVIEW - BIRD BOX<br/><br/>Netflix Original<br/><br/>Recently a film came out called A Quiet Place which used creatures who hunted by sound so a family surviving used the sign language they had learnt to survive and communication because their daughter was Deaf.<br/><br/>Bird Box uses a loss of another one of our senses to explore the subject of mother and child love and survival.<br/><br/>Imagine something when seen makes you want to take your own life, this is the premise for this film but it touches on so much more, a mother who is unsure realising that she does indeed love her children set against trying to survive whilst being blind folded.<br/><br/>Jumping back to 5 years ago we see what happens initially and what led up to where the family find themselves now.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is as with A Quiet Place, we don't know what the creatures are, where they have come from or why they are doing what they are doing.<br/><br/>One thing I did find confusing was that some people after seeing these creatures didn't have the urge to commit suicide but went around looking for those in hiding, working alongside the creatures. An excuse for this was touched upon but personally I felt this didn't work, it would have been far better to have those working with the creatures to be people with partial sight (no spoilers).<br/><br/>In essence a rather surprising good film which ramps up the suspense.<br/><br/>There may have been a twist at the end, watch the young girl and her blind fold on 2 occasions but as with A Quiet Place I hope they don't decide to make a sequel.<br/><br/>Rating 9 out of 10"

","I'm doing my best to not rate this movie against the book but it's very hard. This movie falls short on intensity, horror, and character building. The characters seemed to fall into typical cliché roles. The premise is interesting and while it seems rushed and doesn't give details or follow through on individual situations the actors and acting are great, the special effects were pretty good. It was entertaining and worth the watch.
Having said that...<br/><br/>Bird Box the book is an intense, gruesome, scary, page turner with excellent characters, probably one of the best horror novels in recent years. It's unfortunate they didn't do better to follow the story from the actual book which was amazing.<br/><br/>I've seen some reviews mentioning The Quiet Place.... But while they seem to have the same type of Scifi, unexplained, post-apocalyptic theme it's not really fair to compare. Bird Box the movie begins...at the beginning and doesn't just focus on survival but gets pretty tangled up in the social aspects of strangers that are forced to cooperate to get by."

","Well, I have an interpretation for this movie. He hides a riddle. What happens on the screen is action, death, a strange alien force and very good and well played characters. But the film wants to communicate something else. The riddle is this: what terrifies an ordinary person, is fun for a madman and does not matter to a blind man? This question is there, all the time, unspoken, between the lines.
And the answer is: the meaning of life. The character played by the amazing Sandra Bullock is in a situation so deprived of meaning that she can not even give a name to her son.
The film is also about the anguish of parenthood in a world without meaning. How to bring our children to reason, to a safe world, where they can make plans for life? How distressing it is. The way is tortuous and we seem blind heading wherever we think is best.
A must see!"
"CryptoGuy","3","2","5","23 December 2018"," Lazy and tired story
","Nothing new here. Keep moving. Bird Box is a lazy film being passed off as a meaningful horror film. The premise is ridiculous and I'm all for ridiculous, but if you're going to establish rules in a fictional world, you better stick with those rules. There are as many holes in this film as my sock drawer. Hindsight is 20/20, but these problems could have been easily resolved if a little more time would have been spent on the script.
Acting is well done considering the poor character development and motivations. Unfortunately, that's all you get with this film - actors doing as well as they can regardless. Actors don't just make a move good. You need so much more. 10/10 reviewers are hyperbolic fanatics and 1/10 reviewers are Netflix sourpusses. Truth is, Bird Box is a good B movie, nothing more."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","2","5","23 December 2018"," Nicely twisted and creepy
","An innovative apocalypse film that many unfairly compare to ""A Quiet Place"" because it has the similar plot that you have to give up on one of your senses in order to survive. The origin story however is older and thus it was not really stolen.
Anyway, to get this out of the way the film is thrilling, twisted and offers several good performances. First of all Sandra Bullock is great and convinces. Its an interesting character and thankfully not as one-dimensional as you would expect. She is like a lion mother and thats how powerful her performance is. Great job. Trevante Rhodes was fine as well, he can do better tho but he felt like the good soul within the chaos and that was somehow relieving, thanks to his friendly and good hearted charmes. Sarah Paulson unfortunately only had a small role but very effective and she commands the screen wonderfully. John Malkovich had the perfect character for him, however it was too much ""on the paper"" that did not hurt his performance at all, but the role was more of a cartoon. I really liked Jacki Weaver who had some good moments.
The score was great and fitted the atmosphere and mood perfectly. I really loved some of the cinematography, especially during the scenes on the lake. Great work. Generally nice screenplay that offered a lot of depth and concentrated more not he characters, their bondings instead of sole on the happenings and the solution for the happenings. Another strike for Netflix."

"williamdeanauthor","10","3","10","30 December 2018"," Strong direction, script and cast. Gripping!
","I rarely review-only when something surprises me by being abysmally bad or startlingly great.
This movie was fantastic!
An outstanding performance by Sandra Bullock with a very strong supporting cast. It has some similarities to A Quiet Place, but not much. This movie is much more introspective and character based. It really relayed the feeling of such a dramatic cataclysmic event and the terror of trying to fight for survival without the use of your eyes.
I can understand how some people were disappointed to not get any explanations about the creatures that caused the catastrophe, but that didn't bother me as I thought it was quite clear at the beginning that we were going to experience everything as Sandra Bullock's character did, and with the complete shut down of services, it would have seemed unlikely if she just happened to bump into one of the few people on earth who might have had a clue.
In general the movie made the situation very real to me though I did notice that power and water continued to function long after they should have shut down, but almost every story has flaws and I allowed them that... they earned it with a strong plot and sub plot and engaging, well-constructed characters. I think the only other thing that felt contrived was the quick evolution of the Marjorie's romance with Tom, but it's a very minor point, really and I felty it was pretty much smoothed over by powerful acting.
Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this movie. I think it's the best Netflix has produced so far. I highly recommend it."

","Taken for what it is, it's a rip-off of A Quiet Place (which is also horrible, don't let the reviewers here fool you, A Quiet Place sucks!). There's an unidentified threat around, some ""creature"" that no one knows what it is or where it came from, and it will either make you commit suicide or become insane. Dumb decisions are made, people get killed, hero survives. Okay, a bad horror movie, with a bad ending.<br/><br/>Then you pay attention to the news reports, and some activist-ish lines here and there, and you realize the ""threat"" is an alegory for political position. Then it starts making sense. Which is worse, as a matter of fact, because the movie becomes a dumb leftist rethorical statement. Of course those who embrace the creatures are insane!

","An analysis of the film...and a review-; (SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>This reminds me of They Live. The main character in that film was the ""one who can see."" He went a little crazy...<br/><br/>""She opened the door because she liked the feeling of being outside the door."" Jim Morrison! Do you concur? When that guy opened the window and holds the woman's eyes open and asks ""Do you see it?"" In the scene, there is the sunlight blaring through the window, shining on her face, in her eyes. It kills her. The light is the truth, and maybe it is also emotion. Reminds me of vampires...the light kills them...vampires have higher senses than humans, just like Vulcans in Trek, but the light is overbearing. Many people shut down and rather not feel and rather not see the light clearly in order to avoid the pain, sadly. ""To become vampire is to heighten all of one's senses."" -Dracula, AKA ""Little Dragon."" The vampire is the failed god/goddess. Fallen angel.<br/><br/>Apathy seems to save rather than kill. Ignorance is bliss. I have my days when I shut down but overall I am a truth seeker. I haven spent a majority of my life deciding to take the blindfold off and not hide behind comforting lies. I seek unpleasant truths. We gotta fly from the bird cage. This film is an absolute masterpiece in my opinion. I can't stop thinking...<br/><br/>What saves the sighted people is the birds. Nature...the ability to see the beauty of Earth and not be distracted from seeing it. The natural world is where it is safe to take the blindfold off. Masterpiece of a film, 10/10."

Typical response to a thriller; and by the final scene, I was crying. The acting is pretty good throughout. I loved the character, ""Tom"", a lot.

","I don't normally write reviews but I just read some of them & thought they were a bit harsh.<br/><br/>It seems some people like to be spoon-fed every little detail & plot point when they watch a movie. ""Why didn't it explain this? Why didn't it show that? Why were some people affected differently?"" etc... ffs!<br/><br/>It's a movie about an unseen terror which makes people want to hurt themselves & others once they see it. That's pretty much it. What we get to watch for a couple of hours is how a small group of people choose to deal with the situation they're in. Some of it is predictable, yes, but people are generally quite predictable & clichéd in real life, too.<br/><br/>I personally felt the acting, special effects, cinematography, sound, etc... were all very good. Reason enough to watch the film.<br/><br/>On top of that, there were elements of other movies I've enjoyed over the years which could be found in this. The Crazies, Dawn of the Dead (remake), The Happening, Blindness, World War Z, The Mist, etc...<br/><br/>As a father of two young boys (6 & 3), I also found the scenes where Bullock's character struggles to keep the two 5 year olds safe (in the boat, in the woods, etc...) particularly distressing as it was all too easy to imagine how my own kids would be wandering off in different directions & constantly wanting to remove their blindfolds.<br/><br/>In summary, it's a decent enough way to spend a couple of hours if you're into this sort of genre (post-apocalyptic, horror, science-fiction). If, however, you're wanting to watch something with a clearly defined start, middle & end, & with every last detail explained to you, then save yourself the potential anguish & maybe watch something else."
"harrylosborne","4","2","6","13 January 2019"," Not just a victim of the hype
","I'm not personally a massive fan of Sandra Bullock and her movies to begin with, but I tried to watch this with an open mind; regardless, this is a film with a lot of star power and budget... and not much else. Netflix's exceptional ability to promote mediocre films may bring them some serious revenue, but hasn't translated into many quality end products. The eventual disappointment of wasting 2 hours of your life watching this travesty is beyond insulting.<br/><br/>An interesting (if slightly saturated) premise of fearing an entity you cannot see made the underlying plot intriguing, but is not explored fully enough, nor given any sort of satisfactory conclusion. This hidden menace is a constant threat, but lacks any substance, meaning no true fear can be felt by the viewer. Without spoiling the film, know that plotholes and unfinished storytelling will leave you with more questions than when you started.<br/><br/>Acting, on the whole, is good enough, along with some impressive CGI and grusome-enough death scenes. Bullock herself embodies the role well, but certain decisions and actions will have you shouting at the screen for something to begin to make sense. John Malkovich also provides some decent charisma, about the only person in the film who's character seems to make any sense. Bird Box is a 4 purely due to the redeeming qualities of acting and visuals. Not much else is on offer here, and as with nearly all horror films the end product is beyond disappointing."
"matthewssilverhammer","3","2","6","12 January 2019"," Good for memes. Bad for movies.
","The beginning of M. Night Shyamalan's infamously despised The Happening gave us a promising premise about people mysteriously committing mass suicide. The rest of the movie is a slog of non-suspense, but that initial idea was a decently Hitchcockian. Bird Box does it's best to pick up that seed-of-a-concept and run with it, at times managing slight engagement through momentary struggles. Mostly though, all it manages is making me wish I had a blindfold on myself to keep from having to witness more Happening-esque levels of cinematically boring stupidity.
Like Night of the Living Dead (only much worse), Bird Box is largely interested in the individual toll of a worldwide disaster. Instead of buckets of blood and gory terror, it focuses on the smaller thrills. Unfortunately, it rarely succeeds, continuing Bullock's sad career trend of being in technically popular but undeniably subpar projects (Minions, Ocean's 8, Blindside). The rest of the impressive cast, who all deserve much better, are sequestered within didactic exposition, atrocious flashback storytelling, oddly lit Sharknado-looking cinematography, and good-old-fashioned overlength.
If nothing else, this proves the undeniable impact Netflix has on our collective viewing habits. If we had to get dressed, go outside, drive our gas-guzzling car, spend $30+, and sit through 20 minutes of trailers, Bird Box would be just another non-existent 2018 horror movie (Strangers 2, Truth or Dare, Slenderman). But because Netflix spits it right into our living rooms, we don't even have to put on pants to watch Sandra lovingly yell at her kids to, ""NOT LOOK!"" for two hours. Need we not forget, though, that true thrills come from creative tension and natural stakes, not just mysterious noises and random violence."

"MNKim1967","8","2","6","9 January 2019"," No One's Fear is Exactly the Same...
","The Bird Box is essentially a movie about what you would do when ""faced"" with your ultimate fear; not only has your boogey-man come alive, or worst scenario unfolded, but, it's been weaponized, and, if you look at it, it will compel you to kill yourself, so, what lengths will you go to to save yourself and your loved ones? I read a lot of reviews, and a lot of people seem to be caught up in the specifics - what do the ""entities"" look like or what are the people seeing, etc., and that's part of the premise - they're not going to look the same to anyone; it's about what each individual imagines (remember imagination?). The ending seems to be a bone of contention, too, and, basically, that's because it's not an ending, it's a beginning."

"ryanmitchellnpa","8","2","6","3 January 2019"," I disagree with the negative reviews
","The reason we are left unanswered questions is because the director wants us to be blind just like the characters in this movie. We don't see the creatures because the characters don't which further entwines us into the story and makes us feel like we are really in it. The whole point of the movie would be pointless if you saw the monsters. I think people need to do research before they post a brain dead review not knowing what they are even talking about.<br/><br/>Yes it took inspiration from a quiet place but the whole point of film is to influence others and create content that will be appreciated which for me it certainly is. People need to stop expecting to be spoon fed everything and just deal with a bit of mystery. If you don't like this movie then I'm sorry but you have no idea about film, get back to watching the happening for Christ sake."

","There are a lot of reviews here that talk about the multiple loose ends, and I agree with them, but I don't think that the movie is awful just because we don't know what the beings are, where they came from, or why some people are immune to it. We do get to see some kind of gist of what the creatures look like from the drawings that were shown, but that adds to the ultimate mystery of what those things are.<br/><br/>I think of this story as a slice of life story, where they are regular people stuck in the mess and they don't ""conveniently"" know all about the situation. Just like if a regular person was going through this, after some time you'd know the basics: don't open your eyes, etc. I found that I didn't end up caring where the beings came from or what they looked like, but more about the characters.<br/><br/>If the movie was to also explain where they came from, what they look like, etc. it would be a way different story. The people in this story aren't scientists who need to figure it out, they are random people who need to deal with it and survive.<br/><br/>This story is looking at the aftermath and the toll it takes on people, either in the biggest or smallest ways, than it looking at who, what, where, and why."

"jtindahouse","8","2","6","2 January 2019"," A well-made, creative and tense little film
","It's rare that a simple Netflix film blows up as much as 'Bird Box' has. It is everywhere at the moment. Everyone is talking about it, memes are everywhere on social media and the consensus seems to be that it's a pretty good film. And I would agree with that. It is a pretty good film. Not earth-shattering or game-changing or possibly even that memorable. Just a very solid, well-made, extremely watchable and enjoyable little film.<br/><br/>The film is told in two timelines. There is the here and now where Sandra Bullock's character is trying to lead two children down a river to safety, and a flashback timeline showing the origins of the event that has taken place. Obviously, without me even having to point it out, the flashback scenes are by far the most interesting part of the story for the majority of the film. There's an amazing cast on show, every character is unique and fascinating in their own way and even though the majority of it takes place in a single house, it is never boring for one moment.<br/><br/>Films like 'A Quiet Place' and 'Bird Box' being huge successes in 2018 leads me to believe we will see more of this type of horror in the future. It's creative, reasonably original and fun to watch, so I say bring it on. 'Bird Box' is an excellent film, however I would advise you not to buy in too much to the hype beforehand and make your own judgements on the film. Enjoy."

Who the enemies are or why it's happening and why some people turn into this way and others turn into something else. Like guys, not every question needs an answer. I agree some movies do these things in the attempt to string the unknown factor into play a lot more than it needs to, but Bird Box actually played the dynamic between the unknown and what we find out really well. If you felt the movie didn't give you answers, then the movie went over your head and you didn't get it..<br/><br/>It's a solid 9/10 for me.

","I don't know if online movie ratings were ever really trustworthy, but to me at least it seems that some years ago you could actually gauge whether a movie was worth watching based on them. It's very frustrating that I can't do that anymore. The trailer for Bird Box was intriguing, but poor reviews almost made me skip it. I'm glad I watched it out of curiosity nevertheless, as it was an exhilarating and moving experience.<br/><br/>I liked the story, acting, pacing, music, cinematography... everything, really. The movie is very gripping and suspenseful, and the mother's distress for the children as well as her own emotional issues feel very realistic and moving. I liked that I couldn't see what was coming, it felt as anything could happen (well, almost, since the cuts between present and past made some outcomes obvious, until the finale when it's all just present). Speaking of the finale, that scene with the children in the boat before the rapids was absolutely heartbreaking...<br/><br/>I had no problem with the decision to leave the creatures' origin a mystery, in fact I was glad no explanation was given (well, unless you count Charlie's explanation in the beginning). I'm equally glad the creatures were left unseen, except for the madman's drawings which you can choose to trust or not. I'm a bit on the fence with the concept of mental illness giving a kind of an immunity. It portrays people with mental illness in a folk tradition kind of way, as raving lunatics with an almost otherworldly aura, instead of just sick people. Also, how ""mad"" to you have to be for the ""immunity"" to take effect? Downright psychotic? Is severe depression enough, how about mild? Also, the showing of a possessed or similar state by the altered appearance of the character's eyes is a really tired cliche."

A writer can paint a picture much better than a screenwriter or a director can, so they get an ""A"" for effort.<br/><br/>I really can't say anything negative about the movie other than stating the obvious, that the book was better.

","It's not fair and this movie is from a book from 2014. However, the premise to both A Quite Place and Bird Box stories is similar. Therefore, it does allow comparisons between the two.<br/><br/>Both films involve forces that aren't explained and really it is fine that they aren't. Both also deal with rules, that let's face it, are full of logical inconsistencies. Which, being a horror film, I am also willing to accept within reason. Actually, A Quiet Place comes far closer to pushing the inconsistencies too far than this film. Acting and technical skills are both fine. So, why does Bird Box fail?<br/><br/>Family issues are at the heart of the films. Bird Box just never works at that level. Bullock just never sells it. For having had kids for five years, she still seems clueless and would terrify them more than anything. They would all die. We're supposed to be happy that she finally learns to love them at the end. However, it just never feels natural.<br/><br/>Next, the characters in Bird Box are paint-by-the-numbers. You have the appropriate demographic spread. They check off all the boxes and you are waiting for the death box to be checked as they die. It is made all the more predictable by flashing forward to the last part of the film.<br/><br/>In the end, it is all uninspired and pedestrian."

","One of the majestic things about a Lovecraft novel is the mythology it builds. We don't actually see the monsters (heck, we have no way of really imagining them), but they are a solid background, not an excuse.<br/><br/>Bird Box tries to put us in a lovecraftian universe where seeing creatures will drive people mad. Unless you are already mad, which might put you in a cult like adoration. So far, so good. But you never get any really mythology building, except for some weak ancient-religion-I-searched-on-the-internet crap by a throwaway character. You are never really afraid of the monsters, because they are simply not there. It looks like the writers wanted to created scary creatures but, failing to do it, decided to pull a ""what if we never showed them"" plot device.<br/><br/>Malkovich is, obviously, perfect, and Sandra Bullock pulls some good acting.

With actors/characters I more or less liked. After a lot of talk and pretty pointless characterizations, the showdown happened. First, in the flashback (which was one of the only parts I truly enjoyed, with the pre-apocalypse sequence at the beginning), and the current timeline, where the movie begun (which I didn't really enjoy or thought was captivating). And finally, the story concluded on a new age/religious underline, that was too predictable to be genuinely satisfying. This counting out the countless times the director tried desperately to move me, and such.
I thought it was somewhat entertaining, but mostly boring and plain. I haven't read the book, but I'm pretty sure it's better, and less drawn out. I hope..."

","Hi,<br/><br/>Avert your eyes if you don't want the plot, but not ending, spoiled (no pun intended).<br/><br/>First let me get a purely childish and slightly sexist remark out of my system - Bird Box, where I come from is a euphemism for a lady's private parts. I'm sorry, but I had to say that because I like a lady's private parts and have spent many o' time hidden under a blanket - much like the characters in this film... the difference being, I had much more fun under my blanket.<br/><br/>As others have said, this is much like A Quiet Place and is kind of an 'End of Days' drama wrapped up in a mystery (of sorts) that is never really solved. Sometimes that is a good thing, but dependent on execution, it can be a bad way of writing and/or filmmaking.<br/><br/>If you leave a trail of breadcrumbs for the audience to follow, that ends up leading to a bakery with no ingredients - well, you're going to have to do some re-tracing if you itching for some carbs.<br/><br/>The McGuffin in his is a fairly decent one to use, but is no different to many films that have come in Bird Box's stead - only, it gets a little confusing as to what they are actually running from, as the filmmakers probably assumed that it would be scarier if you didn't see it... (and artistic/symbolic)... enter Jaws twanging on a violin.<br/><br/>Bird Box is based on a novel, and while I haven't read the novel, one shouldn't have to. By that, I mean, I feel that there is some element or plot-point that is missing whereby the audience is given a snippet of information about what the protagonists are really dealing with.<br/><br/>This is an important factor in a film of this type, as otherwise, one will perceive that it was created off the cuff to serve the agenda or message of the writer. And this film, feels exactly like that.<br/><br/>It is set up well and Sandra Bullock is solid as ever - she gets a lot of stick for being wooden - I don't think you'll be surprised to know that whilst she has moments of high-jinx drama and some sturdy acting; she doesn't carry her role as the protagonist as well as say... I don't know... the great Sarah Paulson (who herself has a small part to play).<br/><br/>Act two focuses mostly on the characters and their interactions, but falls short of a few similar films that handle the moral dilemmas that rear their ugly heads when people share the same space during a tragedy/accident. It is here where John Malkovich attempts to steal the show as other characters dote around and pretty much appease each other. It is worth noting that Mr. Malkovich is terribly underused here and his significant skills in acting are cast aside for his ability to play a complete d***.<br/><br/>Act 3 comprises of the journey (which is interlaced throughout the first few acts) and goes on and on where we are slapped in the face with prescient dialogue from an earlier scene, that has special significance here. That being, love and hope conquers all.<br/><br/>The conclusion doesn't feel like a conclusion at all - it feels like a literal moment of 'I seeeeee' - in that... the kind of game that you would play with a child to pacify the little dribbler. It doesn't really resolve anything and it only serves to add to the agenda of the writer - who may or may not have a message, but by the end, I didn't really care... I just wanted to know what was going on and how this all happened.<br/><br/>Which brings me to this final point - this feels like a pilot to a serial; or at least, a desperately seeking serial.<br/><br/>I can't help that Netflix are releasing as much as they can - see what sticks - and look to create a serial from it in the future. It is a torrid strategy if this is true as a lot of these types of films feel as such.<br/><br/>So... in this modern age of big media - if you are short of time and don't want to watch a half-baked film; then do not watch this.<br/><br/>If you have a few hours to spare on a film that does little to challenge you - then give it a go, you might like it."
"mikbanerjee1","5","1","2","21 May 2020"," The Book Was Better in Every Segment!
","An adaptation of Josh Malerman's superhit Novel goes by the same name ""Bird Box"".
Lot of expectations were due because of how successful the original book was. But things unfortunately turned up sideways.
Although It tried its best to standout on its own, gave all the efforts to match up with the level of the novel. But certainly failed to impress upon so many aspects. Let it be the CGI, The sound design, the characters. They all seemed unfinished and hurriedly written. Except Sandra Bullock's role as Malorie, I couldn't care for anyone else. One dimensional characters who haven't got any sort of depth don't do well when it comes to Sci Fi thrillers. That's a lesson everyone should learn. The asthetics are necessary and must be neatly executed; I agree on that but it doesn't mean you can blatantly ignore the rest of the parts. Sound Design left me enraged because of how little it provided even in the most tensed moments. Sound plays a huge part in mystery thrillers, if not done properly it can disrupt the whole ambience. That's exactly what happened! It miserably failed to generate a proper vibe or atmosphere accordingly! I have read the book before and I can say the book was so much better in terms of narrative decisions and clever approach to suspenseful moments. It brilliantly builds up the tension and leave you restless until the end comes. Unlike the film where the screenplay looked loose on many occasions and didn't provide thrill/tension in a consistent manner.
The two kids and their abilities are well demonstrated in the original novel but the makers somehow thought of doing otherwise. They put so much attention to other unnecessary short tenured characters and never really took the roles of those two kids seriously. Disheartened to see such an unprofessional approach towards a potential strong point of the plot. The hype is obviously exaggerated and trust me, who have read the book already, they don't need to see it. For those who haven't yet, Read the book. It's a lot better experience as a whole."

","Bird box was one of the most hyped netflix movies of 2018. And tbh, it does deserve that. It's an entertaining and creepy thriller that pulls you at the edge of your seats, wondering what would happen next.<br/><br/>But there's one thing that left me and I guess, most of the viewers disappointed i.e. THE ENDING. In the novel, the ending was darker and tbh much realistic and accepting
But, in the novie the director decided to show us an optimistic or so called HAPPY ENDING and that ruined all the efforts. Especially, I was disappointed that they did'nt show the monsters or the forces that were making the people psychotic and murderers. I waited too long for the monsters and their purpose. All these things are not clear. But anyways, it was a good watch, if you're into a gripping thriller genre."

"richarddillomes","7","1","2","5 August 2019"," Maybe you'll need a blindfold while watching?
","If you have seen 'A Quiet Place' early this year, 'Bird Box' kind of run along the same concept except instead of staying quiet they need to blindfold themselves in order to stay alive. If you read my review about AQP, I pointed out that it reminded me of a 'Black Mirror' episode 'Metalhead' released a year ago. Considering the short timelines in between, it is possible that these three just coincidentally showed up one after the other (BB is based on book that came out in 2014.) While it is derivative, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad movie, it's just that you can't help but compare and point out the weaknesses and usually the last one to come out gets hit the hardest. And maybe that's why I don't get all the hype about it, because I've already seen two earlier versions of it.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock as expected delivers, playing Mallorie, a hesitant mother that took on the responsibility of looking after two kids when she wasn't even ready to look after for one. She effortlessly exudes the struggle between keeping the kids alive because she's still a decent human being or to just leave them behind as the excess baggage that she sees them as. Sarah Paulson as per usual was great, you can see the fear in her eyes, trained well having been in American Horror Story for many seasons now, and she would've made a great stand-in for Sandra if she refused her role for the second time. Lastly the breakout star here is young actress Vivien Lyra Blair. Sure she was annoying every time she didn't listen to Mallorie, but that staring scene when she was told to go to bed but she wanted to hear the end of the story, and the scene when she knew she was going to be chosen against her will, I felt those.<br/><br/>Now the ugly parts. The build-up was there and I kept waiting for the denouement but it never came which left me hanging and with more questions than answers. Where did the entities come from? Why did it have a different effect on others? And don't get me started on the way they handled latter part of the river scene. Another matter to consider is since we don't get to see the antagonist, the clear and present danger we felt early in the movie was never validated. The Director said they specifically did not show the entity as it is different for each person but I read that they shot a scene that shows what monster Mallorie would've seen but she kept laughing at it that they decided to drop it altogether. And the decision to not show anything at all for me I feel was part of why the movie didn't make such an impact on me. It left me with nothing by the time the credits started rolling.<br/><br/>For now there is no indication yet that a sequel is in the works but I wouldn't be surprised if they make another, and then we can see if they can really offer us something new and save the first one by association."

"Endless_01","7","1","2","7 June 2019"," An interesting inclusion in the genre of terror.
","Bird Box is a movie based on a novel with an interesting and curious concept to carry out, taking the main idea of fear of something incomprehensible, but above all, imperceivable, thanks to the fact that they are unable to see their enemy, this monster or creature, this strange entity that has the ability to kill them with just a second inside the eye orbits of these people. A creature that is impossible to see, the fear of something that we cannot even defend ourselves.<br/><br/>With an interesting idea the movie starts, developing at a slow pace, but solid, with good performances by the cast, especially Bullock, which gives an interesting perspective to the tough girl but able to open her heart to those who deserve it, both their care and love.<br/><br/>The film is directed in a good way, with quite interesting and entertaining moments, although a narrative structure based mainly on flashbacks and memories that end up becoming a bit of overexposure, however, it gives a good idea about the main plot and the first days of the disaster. After this, the final act concentrates mainly on the present and takes us through the most tense moments of the film. Although it remains stable with all these aspects, I think it fails a lot in the logical aspect or at least the logical narrative, also becoming a little slow with the development of the 2nd act of the story, and I must say, that the movie really,is not scary, it can be tense and somewhat exciting, but I never had a sensation of terror while watching it.<br/><br/>Still, it was very entertaining and worthwhile for horror movie lovers."
"elgabote","6","1","2","4 June 2019"," a couple scenes fell into cliche but overall good movie
","I do like this kind of movie premises, I found it similar to ""The Happening"" or ""Blindness"" and other apocalyptic stories that are not zombies.
With these kind of movies I find that the explanation of the events is not necessary really, what's interesting is the situation in which the characters are and how they act. So the strength of the story will be on the characters themselves. Then you can have some good cinematography to back up a creepy atmosphere and the ending to give a twist or shock.
Here I found pretty decent characters, good cinematography and an ok ending, none are great, but it does the job of keeping me interested, not annoy me with extremely stupid behaviours (there was a scene which I found quite silly near the ending, and was quite important, with the main characters, but...) and not disappointing me with an awful ending.
Still, it fell a bit bland in the end, and as I said, everything is ok, but nothing exceptional. It definitely had potential for a better movie."

","This is an edited review from one posted by this viewer over three months ago. At the time I gave this film a thumbs up, but I was not completely fair and did not offer the review in my complete format. This was because of having previously viewed Krasinski's, ""A Quite Place"". After writing hundreds of reviews this was the first time I can recall ever comparing two films directly. That is why it was unfair. This viewer has always treated films / series as individual works of art. Hence follows my review. Bier has helmed an exceptional thriller. Excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, score and acting. All the artists involved deliver superlative performances. In particular Bullock and Malkovich stand out. The plot revolves around a women named Malorie who is independent, content with solitude and pregnant. Right from the beginning we learn that an ominous presence has created a world of madness, destruction and suicide. We learn that there is however a safe community from the presence that is accessible by river, but it is unwise to involve children in the trip. We then flash back to five years earlier when the chaos is just beginning around the world and then hits home. This ends up landing Malorie at the home of Douglas, who seems to know that danger is eminent. The plot then flashes back and forth between the trip down the river and the time spent at Douglas' home. Random individuals seek safety at the home, one being another pregnant women, and the individuals collectively determine that sight is the key to the presence driving people insane. As people come and go from the home danger always seems to follow and Douglas' self preservation is constantly being tested. On a blind trip to a supermarket an incident occurs which tips off Malorie to the fact that birds can sense when danger is near. Both Malorie and the other women deliver their children, a boy and a girl. Eventually a visitor arrives and Douglas' instincts are confirmed. This individual destroys the safe haven leaving only Malorie, the two children and Tom left. Some survivors of the presence have embraced it as beautiful and have become psychotic wanting all to experience the beauty. An encounter with these individuals leads to the film focused completely on the river, as now only Malorie and the two children known as boy and girl, and have been navigating at this point for nearly two days. During their journey the three remain blindfolded and carry a box with birds in it to warn them of the presence. Their travel down river includes an encounter with a psychotic embracer of the presence, gathering supplies, running into an obstacle which overturns their boat and finally the treacherous rapids which are a indicator that the safe community is just beyond if they can get past the rapids. The plot is crisp, unique, clever, thrilling, sublime, poetic and has a powerful ending. This is one of the best films Netflix has dropped. It is memorable and a magnificent film in it's genre."
"ArmenPandolaITSJUSTAMOVIECOM","7","1","2","22 April 2019"," BIRD BOX or how to make a hit horror movie.
","BIRD BOX<br/><br/>Netflix's Bird Box, directed by Susanne Bier (The Night Manager TV series) and written by Eric Heisserer (Arrival) from a book by Josh Malerman, has created a sensation. While Netflix never releases audience numbers, Bird Box seems to be a hit. Of course, 'hit' must be in context. Hit shows on the major networks like The Big Bang Theory have upward of 18 million viewers. In-theatre only movies have more viewers - Black Panther sold over 70 million tickets.<br/><br/>The consensus is that Bird Box had 26 millions viewers (compare that to the Golden Globes with 18.6 million). Whatever the numbers, Bird Box is a hit, generating not only viewers but buzz: Is it a joke, this 'thing' or 'no-thing' that causes people to kill themselves? What makes this story go? Not the characters who have no or little backstory, or the simple plot: if you see 'it', you kill yourself.<br/><br/>Bird Box, for the 300 million or so who have not watched it, is about a woman, Sandra Bullock (I am not using character names because, as I said, the characters have no backstory and, in fact, the movie uses the 'public perception' of the actors to fill-in for character development, like casting John Wayne in a western - you know who this guy is based on who is playing the part), who is pregnant but without a husband or father of the child who left, apparently, soon after he did the deed. Her sister, Sarah Paulson, wants to help her since Bullock is not a happy mother-to-be and is even told by her doctor that most mothers end up loving their child. Bullock is so unconvinced that she doesn't want to know the gender of the baby and, in fact, she ends up calling it ""Boy"" (and a same-age girl she ends up taking care of, ""Girl"").<br/><br/>The movie is told in two simultaneous parts, five years apart. So, we see the world-wide epidemic of suicides and how it quickly infects the California community where Bullock and Paulson live. There is no explanation, suddenly, people start doing crazy things - banging their heads until they die, driving cars into other cars, stabbing themselves. These scenes of the 'beginning' of the epidemic are interspersed with scenes from five years later when survivors Bullock and her son and ""Girl"" are in her care as she tries to get them to safety. The key to survival is being blindfolded whenever outside and not looking at 'it.'<br/><br/>The buzz reminds me of the public's reception of Rosemary's Baby almost 50 years ago. That movie saw newly weds, Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes, move into a Manhattan apartment. Cassavetes is an actor up for a big part. He gets it when the actor who was selected, suddenly, goes blind. Soon after, Farrow gets pregnant and is stuck at home getting unwanted advice and help from an elderly couple who live next door. It turns out that they are a witch/warlock pair and her husband sold Farrow to these demons so that her child could be the new Beelzebub. It's a thrilling and scary movie, a roller coaster ride through the terrors of pregnancy and a parent's worst fears realized - little Johnny turns out to be a devil, literally.<br/><br/>Just as in Bird Box, the characters in Rosemary's Baby were not fully drawn. The young couple seem to have landed in Manhattan from the moon, no family and very few friends. There are really only 4 characters in the movie - the young and elderly couples. The plot is not explained very much - yes, a few minutes are spent on talking about witches and warlocks, but nothing that makes any impression other than that they do exist.<br/><br/>And that is how to have a hit 'horror' movie. One exciting scene after another, keeping the audience occupied with visuals that are arresting and moments that are shocking. In Bird Box, John Malkovich plays his stereotypical angry, bitter, suspecting character. Trevante Rhodes plays the guy we met in Moonlight. There are other stereotypes you will recognize - happy, overweight pregnant woman who is actually a lot better person than we think, odd couple 20-somethings who end up in bed (well, doing it but not actually in ...), sympathetic looking guy who turns out to be a monster, unsympathetic guy who turns out to be right - you've met them all before but not in this movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a fun 2 hours. It comes to a kind of conclusion, just like Rosemary's Baby. And at the end, Sandra Bullock gets to go on another scary, dangerous, thrilling ride - this time in a boat not a bus, but it's the same ride and the same plucky Sandra who survives.<br/><br/>FOR MORE GREAT REVIEWS GO TO:

","I enjoyed the movie, and the acting was superb BUT...<br/><br/>The book was better. A lot of Malorie's bite was removed from her character. She was a lot stronger mentally & physically in the book.
They shoehorned in a romance between her & Tom that did not exist in the book. It wasn't bad but it definitely fell flat for me.<br/><br/>Also in the books the children are diligently obedient because they are 100% aware they WILL die if they deviate from their mother's orders. Tom just messes this up leading to Girl almost dying in the movie.<br/><br/>Also in the book, there was never any question that Malorie was the one to Look. Never. She loved both equally and couldn't do that to her children. She even had a plan to jump out of the boat and let herself drown if it came to it.
The sheet was a nice touch for the movie.<br/><br/>And yes, I am aware the book had some pieces you could not put into film. Talking about blinding the babies, hitting them as babies with fly swatters till they learned to wake up with their eyes closed, and showing the early Sanctuary people with burnt out eyes would've been upsetting to most people.<br/><br/>However I am grateful they left out their... idea... of what the creatures looked like.

","Though the concept does prove to be interesting, you can't help but feel it come off as at least a bit generic. What could have been something new, is only a different version of something we saw only this year (i.e. A Quiet Place). That being said though, the film doesn't fail to entertain, even with it's dull tone and down attitude. What Bird Box does best is portray it's moments of suspense, especially when good actors are there to help with it. Sandra Bullock is by far the best actor in the film, and we wish most of the supporting cast could at least try to be as good as her. In the end, Bird Box feels like a missed opportunity to shine on something new, but even though it didn't give us what we wanted, what it did give us is certainly tolerable.

","I enjoyed it. It wasn't too scary, which I like. Dark humour via Malkovich. Interesting premise that held my interest even if you kind of knew the ending because they told you from the start.<br/><br/>The review section is like - as I think Americans would call it - a dumpster fire. Wow. So much bile and vitriol. It's a movie. Chill.<br/><br/>It never poses itself as an intellectual affair, and you do not need to demonstrate your intellectual prowess by dissecting the movie.<br/><br/>No I don't need the all the answers. Mysteries are fine. These reviewers are probably the people that will then go watch ET and go ""WHY IS THE ALIEN HERE? HOW DOES THE BIKE LEVITATE?"" etc.<br/><br/>Breathe deeply, and relax. Watch it, enjoy it. Enjoy life."
"pronoun36","3","1","2","11 March 2019"," I'd Rather See the Entity
","Starring Sandra Bullock as a soon to be mother, Bird Box centers around a chaotic series of events caused by the presence of a malicious entity. If you see the entity, you kill yourself. Simple enough, yet not really. For some reason, every character in the film has a nervous breakdown when the entity is present, when in reality, all they have to do is not open their eyes. Nevertheless, every character in the film reacts in this over the top manner when they have to set foot outside their place of shelter. As you can probably tell, I was not the biggest fan of this film. While the concept is intriguing and some of the performances are fine, particularly from Danielle MacDonald and B.D. Wong, the film succumbs to the unfortunately typical issues you can almost expect with any bad horror film. There are about a million safer possibilities alternative to the decisions the characters make, the entity is not scary, and Sandra Bullock's character I found to be especially unlikeable and cowardly. Towards the end of the film, she makes a decision that reflects poorly on her and on the film as a whole. This character defining decision was the cherry on the sundae of my reasons for disliking this film. There are much better survival horror films out there, including 2018's A Quiet Place, that I would recommend seeing over this film."
"kwstas-97843","5","1","2","6 March 2019"," Lots of potential. Lazy writing.
","I think the title says it all. This movie kept to my seat and I was eager to watch what would happen next, until the ending came. The movie made absolutely no effort to give us even the most rudimentary of answers. What are the entities? Where do they come from? HOW do they work and why do they attack? What's their endgame?! What happens to the couple that runs away? What happens to the old man locked out on his garage?<br/><br/>I'm giving it 5/10 because technically speaking the movie was solid and the premise was great. But it had great hype for nothing and in the end didn't meet expectations."
"sapiens22","8","1","2","2 March 2019"," Mediocre reviews serves no justice.
","Let's start with pointing out what this movie is not - ground breaking spectacular gem.
But for what this movie is, it's a nice enjoyable ride. A movie about cosmic horrors plaguing Earth, a story depicting survival and relationship struggles of those who have their sanity retained, while mass psychosis plagues the Earth.<br/><br/>To people complaining about the lack of actual monsters - you see this story from the survivor's point of view. You are kept in the dark just like the survivors.
It was right decision not to visualize with cgi the cosmic horror entities - that would have made the movie feel cheesy and lame.
How do you expect to be immersed in the story if you're forced to look at monsters that don't make you feel the same way how characters of the movie feel when seeing them? The answer is you don't feel immersed, it would only break immersion.<br/><br/>The acting was good. Development of characters felt satisfying. The story was intriguing, keeping in mind you observe it all from survivors point of view."
"youraveragecouple","8","1","2","28 February 2019"," Not meant to be an alien invasion movie or anything like. About human perseverance
","I get the idea of knowing what is happening. The idea of having the perfect mix of people get stuck in a house after an attack. I watch movies. This movie was not that and not meant to be that. It is based more on a reality. Let's say something crazy liked this happened. You are driving and your sister/wife/husband saw something that made her want to commit suicide. They did. You run into the next house. At this point do you look for the Brain, The basket case, the princess, the criminal, the jock? No...this is not a John Hughes film. Reality...you get what you get. You deal with it. Sure they had to add some characters, but the entire plot of this movie is perseverance of a future mother and then actual mother. At no time does she, or will she, know what is causing this. She could give up, give up one kid, or move on and hope with little to hope for. Again...human perseverance. The outcome has no major closure for sure, but it give solace that she endured everything and kept her two kids alive. Why does everyone need to have that closure? How about reality. If this happened in real life you would never get the movie script you believe every movie should adhere to. This movie was very uncomfortable. No doubt. It is not one to bring the kids too. However, real world situation like this is not one to prepare your Kids for. In1983...""The day after"". About nuclear war hitting the USA. Scared a nation. They didn't have hero's either...just reality. This movie simply has a minor scare factor that leads into a woman wanting to live and have her kids live too."
"youraveragecouple","8","1","2","28 February 2019"," Low ratings seem mostly from those that want closure
","I get that, but this movie isn't so much about some invasion or government experiment as it is about the human response to such. I get that many people want an explanation (hello millennials lol). They want it in the ever popular Walking Dead. I did also when I first watched this movie, but it will never happen. This is more about real life. What if this happened. In 1983 (I believe) a TV movie came out called The Day After. About nuclear war. At the time there were not many answers, just the after math. It scared a nation to say the least. Now I am not saying this is the same, but it is along the same lines. Not everything has an answer. Sometimes it is just about the survival of the people involved. This movie is about that. Decisions that are made (kids in the boat), choices made along the path. The always wondering why. Keep up hope? Etc...it is not as much about what ever did this, but more about how a person reacts. I get the some will demand a who did it type thing, but many will understand it is more than that. Human Perseverance!!"
"masonfisk","8","1","2","26 February 2019"," SIMPLE & TO THE POINT...!
","The current hot topic on the internet is this horror outing starring Sandra Bullock. When the world goes tits up (in this case a mysterious force causes people who're are exposed to it, mainly if they lock eyes on it, to kill themselves off while the ones who survive are insane anyway prompting them to attack the survivors, who've taken to blindfolding themselves while outdoors, exposing them to the entity so they can share in their group vision) a band of humans (Bullock & her 2 small children) try to reach a sanctuary at the end of a raging river to avoid the madness which has overtaken the planet. Wildly imaginative & horribly prescient, this end of times scenario would make for a great double bill w/last year's A Quiet Place, another doomsday affair predicated on another hampered sense (in that film loud noises) which humans have to embrace to survive. Keeping things to its most bare bones in terms of cause & affect (we never see the creatures or find out from whence they came), this nail biter is the closet thing the States will have as a true amalgamation of a J horror film (even though I remember a film from 1984 called Impulse which had people acting out their wildest fantasies overnight). Well worth the watch & hopefully a harbinger for things to come as Netflix starts exacting quality over quantity."

","I expected this to be rubbish judging from the reviews but I found it enjoyable and engaging. Not perfect but for a film if this type it was really good. I found the end a little lacking and simplistic but I really engaged with all the characters. Would like to have known what happened to the couple who stole the car. Tom Holland was really great. Sandra B played it all rather Sarah C from Terminator - 'tough love' mothering but I bought it. There were some emotional parts which worked for me. You had to suspend disbelief a fair bit e.g when the boat over turns and kids who would have never learned to swim miraculously survived; ability to drive via use of Sat Nav alone; fact a school type safe haven was seemingly in the middle of a remote forest (where do they get their food?) etc etc - but a good engaging movie."

","The movie had an interesting concept I will give it that, and that really makes me wish the movie was good, because I think it could be a really interesting movie. Unfortunately it was not good. As you will see in a lot of other reviews, this movie got very boring very quickly, and it just dragged on. It was a 15 minute short story dragged into an excruciatingly long and painful 2 hour movie. The story is just dragged out, and not very interesting. The characters aren't very interesting either, and we don't really get to know them. The plot could have been so much more interesting, but they never explain what's causing people to go crazy, or why it's doing that. It's just some thing trying to kill them and that is all they tell you. There's no depth to the plot, no explanation, nothing. It's very bland and simple and it ruins the movie. The acting is ok, nothing special. But it just goes on and on, and the ending leaves so many unanswered questions, basically nothing is explained. Don't waste your time."
"Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta","Null","1","2","18 February 2019"," Unseen idea, you never see the enemy, pretty sad at times but watchable
","This movie is a good one, but even though they are of the same genre as A Quiet Place, this movie does not really create a unique atmosphere as A Quiet Place did. In that movie you didn't want to make any noises at all and tried to be silent. Here the idea is similar, but obviously, you can't stop watching, but on the other hand you kind of hope they will or maybe will not show those monsters. You are not sure and in any case you are alright with it.<br/><br/>The movie still is definitely worth watching and has interesting plot which reveals itself slowly, or rather we have 2 timelines at once, both interesting.<br/><br/>However, I feel that sequel would be good because even though everyone is safe, it might be temporary, so I'd make a movie where we kill the monsters for good."

I personally really liked it.<br/><br/>The acting is good, i really got sucked into the vibe of the movie. The music was really fitting.<br/><br/>It is compared to ""A quit place"", but i immediately started thinking about ""the mist"". The movie after the Stephen King Book.
And in comparison to these two movies, i think it's good that you don't see the creatures in bird box. In my opinion a movie can get a little fake after showing stuff like that.

"LennyO92","5","1","2","5 February 2019"," Falls Short
","This movie is about a mother (Sandra Bullock) and her experience during an apocalyptic event wherein people commit suicide when they see an entity or being with their own two eyes, causing survivors to just put on blind folds to prevent being victimized by this entity.<br/><br/>The Good:
I think that the movie delivered its share of thrill. The beginning scene was excellent in that it set the stakes for their perilous journey, as well as introduce our main character and what kind of person she is.<br/><br/>Though I'm not a big fan of this format (alternating between real time and flashbacks) since it removes some of the thrill from the events in the house, it was done well enough and it made sense as to keep the pace going near the end.<br/><br/>The focus given to the relationships of the people inside the house was also a good thing about the movie though some characters may have been a bit one-dimensional. I also enjoyed seeing the growth of Sandra Bullock's character. Through the threat of losing her two children, she was able to move past her hesitations about being a mother and show them that deep inside she actually cares for them. Exceptional acting by Sandra Bullock, by the way.<br/><br/>The Bad:
I just had so many questions about the apocalypse that they were experiencing that I hoped would get answered later on in the movie but never were answered. The danger and the threat of death was there but I wish I just knew more about what they were up against. What started these events? What were these entities? Why were a certain subset of the population seemingly immune to the effects of these entities? I know that sometimes, some questions have no answers, but I think a good movie should leave you with less unanswered questions than you started with. A Quiet Place was able to do that for me despite the mystery surrounding the aliens. I think this is because of the sufficient exposition given to the aliens at the beginning of the movie. Bird Box differs in that it never reveals anything certain about these entities so they could practically do anything with them narratively. The ambiguousness of Bird Box's unseen antagonists is one of the movie's major weak points.<br/><br/>Another one is the ending. The ending was so predictable in that halfway through watching the movie, I already could tell where they were going with this and jokingly blurted it out and surprise surprise, they really went with that ending."
"naaarfDE","5","1","2","3 February 2019"," A wannabe A QUIET PLACE
","BIRD BOX is a wannabe A QUIET PLACE - but instead of effectively and coherently establishing the rules of it's world, the script makes them up randomly along the way. There are hardly any scenes in which the impending conesquences are palpable. It's never clear what's actually at stake."

As suspected Sandra Bullock half ass acted her way through another movie. Just rewatch the scene in the woods towards the end again if you think I am being a hater. Where is the emotion. Don't defend it and say anything about ""well she has to be strong and tough because she just lost her man and now is alone and can't show emotion.""

So I had the good fortune of not being exposed to the hype and going in blind... sorry I couldn't resist. I wish I could get as into this movie as everyone else but it was just really average in my opinion. I had no complaints about the cast, especially the little girl who was absolutely adorable and managed to make me feel genuinely nervous when she was in danger. Chalk that one up to me having daughters. Honestly the rest of the movie was kind of just a bore, the creatures get absolutely no info given other than their modus operandi. Mystery is always great but it would be nice to at least see the creatures that are so dangerous they've brought humanity to it's knees and make the survivors have to give up their most important sense to survive. But no, the most you get is the drawings that Gary does before going on the out of left field murder spree. It's never explained how some people see the creatures and live and become crazed servants. Maybe it's just me but I like SOME answers. Hell I'll take a news broadcast like Night of the Living Dead or a comment about a mysterious portal opening up to spew out a bunch of fog and eldritch horrors. Instead we get long scenes of people talking, arguing, having ridiculous petty problems, being mean to cute kids, and having awkward sex. Also with a sprinkling of brutal suicides and a sappy feel good ending that seems a bit at odds with the nightmare world they tried to establish. It's not the worst movie I've seen by a long shot, just one you have to accept getting absolutely no answers from. If that's something you can over look then you will probably enjoy it."

","Wading through zombie-style post-apocalyptic movies to get here, this movie starts out fairly fresh and draws you in by the premise, initial pacing, and John Malkovich.<br/><br/>But to me it feels like a bit too simplistic premise the screenplay writers took and then just brainstormed away on and put together without any kind of pruning of ideas or critical thinking.<br/><br/>This movie had a good cast and high production values, everybody involved (except the screenwriters..) clearly knew what they were doing. Why couldn't they have put a bit more (or a lot more...) thought into the plot, and maybe this could have become a movie you didn't want your 2 hours back after watching..<br/><br/>You quickly become accustomed to the ""horror"" in the movie and drawing it out for 2 hours is far too long without a more involving plot. Also Sandra Bullock hits a one-note performance, though I'm pretty sure this is not her fault.<br/><br/>Others have complained about underdeveloped characters - while I agree with this, you don't really expect more from a movie in this genre and it's not the main problem with the movie by far.<br/><br/>If you didn't like this movie or want to avoid wasting your time, I recommend Tremors (1990) instead for a lesson in how to develop characters that do not act like complete idiots, be creepy and lighthearted at the same time, have a (relatively) self-contained plot and of course features Kevin Bacon."

-- A loud-mouthed bald white male who is an unending string of a-hole quips, so, of course, he would also seem to be a Trump supporter (guessing from his paraphrasing of a well-known Trump campaign message). This man is the token Angry White Male that the media loves to talk about at election time.
-- A white guy who is a crazy escapee, and tries to kill them, even the babies.
-- Oh, and a monster never shown (is it white too? I'm surprised that one of the characters doesn't just come out and say it).
--- Midway through Sandra's efforts to save herself, she is attacked by, what? Oh, yes, another crazy white guy, but this one is also a redneck. Even better use of stereotypes.<br/><br/>The producers spared no insult in this movie, and crammed in as many as they could. For instance, now:<br/><br/>The Good Guys
-- I love this one: an Asian male, who just happens to be gay, and also a really nice guy. Being a good guy, he sacrifices himself to save the others.
-- A black teenager who is all-wise beyond his years, and already understands what is going on, when no one else has a clue yet. He is also a hero, when he sacrifices himself to save the others.
-- A black male who is the de facto protector of the group, calm, intelligent, caring, and thoughtful. And seriously ripped. I think he sacrifices himself to save the others. (See a pattern here?)
Oh, and he hits on a very pregnant Sandra Bullock. Does he eventually nail her even though the world is ending right outside the window? ---of course he does.<br/><br/>Now, Bonus Stereotype Fillers
-- This one is recklessly obvious (well, I suppose they all are really). We also have a heavy-set white woman, also very pregnant, who admits (as she should), that she doesn't really know how to do *anything*, because people have always done everything for her because... wait for it... she has been ""privileged""! Did you see what they did there? She's white, and admits that she has been privileged. There you go, there is your token White Privilege persona. Whoa. Mind. Blown.
-- Last and least, there is a teen couple (sadly, not same-sex), who are white, stupid, and think only of themselves. They also give us a sex scene, because, well, why not? At least in slasher movies, you know that the kids that are screwing are going to meet a terrible end, because they screwed around. Fair enough. But this sex scene was thrown in for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>It truly saddens me that the producers were unable, in the time allotted, to install a wheelchair-bound transexual character. But you can this stereotype victim would be heroic and sacrifice themselves to save every else.<br/><br/>I was so incredulous with the characters in this movie that it was impossible to actually enjoy the good parts. Personally, I grew tired of Hollywood cramming a politically-correct agenda down my throat many years ago, and clearly they are not close to being done.<br/><br/>This movie was so patently patronizing that there is little point in listing the long list of plot holes and outright lack of intelligence. It was bad enough to start with."

","Bird Box is a late night horror drama and will keep you glued from the very first scene to the last minute of the movie. The story is nothing extraordinary but bit different than a usual horror drama. Few critics say this could be a 20 minutes short film rather be a 124 minutes movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie describes no character can see the monster if anyone sees that monster even on tv or camera the person gets infected on eyes and commit suicide on immediate effect and this movie also carried this phenomenon for viewers as well. The plot is scattered, and some characters can see the monster and force others to see that, and there is no explanation (!) The story makes you glued to the end for an explanation, and suddenly the movie ends. The movie does not have a proper ending, and I feel like as a viewer I have the right to know the closure.<br/><br/>Sandra was terrific as usual; she comes back on 2018 with Ocean's Eight and Bird Box after a long break and her acting on Bird Box reminding me her acting on the blind side and the proposal. I would suggest you watch this movie without any high expectations."

The plots were different The Happening plot made some sense. I only gave it a 4 cause the kids did an outstanding job, the adult actors eh but did ok for what the dialogue was.

"joebloggscity","4","1","2","31 December 2018"," Bird Box - Blindness is the crux of the story, and I can't see the good points in this....
","With the change in consumption of media over the past generation or two, there is an inevitability and need for Netflix etc to make a good stab at making films. I've seen a couple of Sky own movie productions, and they were both best left to the sidelines. This is the first Netflix movie I've seen, and in reflection it's a mixed bag.<br/><br/>We have basically a film that is really riding on the back of the success of A Quiet Place, this film follows a similar underlying story and really you will love it or it will all pass you by. For me, it was the latter, it didn't work on me despite very much liking A Quiet Place. The film swaps sound for blindness, and reminded me a little bit of an old film with Julianne Moore called Blindness but it's not as grim, although this is still grim. Your colleagues are as big a danger as the enemies.<br/><br/>The acting is what keeps this going, with Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich doing the bulk of the work but ably assisted by most others. However, they can't keep afloat a storyline that doesn't grab you.<br/><br/>Shame really, as it is well filmed and does show that Netflix when they get their hands on a good script may unsettle the major players one day.<br/><br/>It's not the worst of movies but it's nothing great either. Some will find it worthwhile, but it wasn't for me."

","While the movie was entertaining, thrilling, and was filled with great performances, I can't say that I loved this movie like so many social media warriors. ""Bird Box"" was very predictable and underwhelming. I'll have to say, I didn't hate this movie. There were parts that were pretty intense and then other parts that would drag, the latter being most of the movie. It takes place in a 5 year period where no climax seems to take place. Bouncing back from the present to the past making the past plot a little easy to see what was coming. Other than being filled with great actors and great cinematography I can't say this movie left me in awe. Other than the fact the main characters had to be blindfolded, this movie brought nothing new to the post apocalyptic table. While I respect this movie, as I see so many have loved it, I can't help but think that it's a great story, lousy script, and poorly executed. Again, I enjoyed this movie for the entertainment and glad it's free to watch on Netflix, because if this was in the theaters I probably would've walked out."
"mannin11","4","1","2","28 December 2018"," Must I FORCE myself to be scared?
","America loves zombie apocalypse movies and this is another variation on the theme. Good acting fails to make up for genuine thrills in this outing and one sits there thinking""I guess I'm supposed to be scared in this scene."" A Quiet Place, to which this movie has been unfairly compared, is genuinely scary, this one is an acceptable manufactured outing, graced by a major movie star (Bullock) and by a way-too short turn by the wonderful Sarah Paulson. The initial premise -- that anyone who opens their eyes out of doors will go mad and commit suicide -- could be an allegory for anyone who follows Trump, but the real world is scarier than this invented version. Shades of Charlton Heston's Omega Man or Will Smith's remake I Am Legend (which blew it for a sequel when the producers filmed a second, cheesy ending that killed Smith off) come to mind that provided much greater thrills and chills. If you want to see an incredibly scary, beautifully realized forever-classic example of a zombie apocalypse movie that will nail you to your seat in excitement watch the dazzling South Korean movie Train To Busan, with myriad twists and turns and characters you really care about. (When will Hollywood buy it and totally destroy it in a dumb as a brick remake? I beg you, watch the original!) Bird Box can only be described as a halfway decent effort in the horror/zombie genre that fails to rise to the occasion. READ MY LIPS: WATCH TRAIN TO BUSAN!"
"A-90","4","1","2","28 December 2018"," Shame...
","First off, let's get real about the premise. While 'monsters who make you want to commit suicide' may be a novel concept, this is basically a zombie move without the blood and gore.
But that's not what bothered me about this film; I actually quite like a classic zombie, run from the evil, must survive scenario. And I enjoyed the bulk of the action, the characters were well portrayed. I'm ok with leaving realism at the door with these things too, although Bird Box maybe did take it a little far... I don't wanna drop spoilers but my ultimate snort was at Tom's impeccable abs and biceps after 5 years of starvation and running from evil.
The ultimate shame here is the lack of explanation. There were hints at something deeper, cell phones seemed to set people off, people they loved came back to them, those with mental illnesses thought the monster was beautiful... however, we were just left with nothing. When it's a full-length feature film, that's just lazy.
I've read a few reviews commenting it could have worked well as a short and I agree. Shorts are all about the power of suggestion and it could have been truly terrifying.
Alas, it wasn't to be and instead we have a mediocre zombie rip off. Shame."
"scottj_nz","4","1","2","28 December 2018"," So they were?

","Undoubtedly great acting and lots of suspense. A well crafted piece, and surely a strong addition to the genre. But: yes, it will feel like you have seen it all before. Monsters, but not real monsters in a sense that the idea ever gets more of an explanation. Apocalyptic and as usual the real fright comes from the evil in people and the real test is courage and how humane we can remain to be in such situations. Frankly, quite boring and if you know that there won't be any sort of understanding in the end, equally annoying to watch. Just compare it to Black Mirror, where a great idea can actually lead the story, not like here, where everything is quite predictable and too much driven by typical plot elements..."

","Birdbox is a very Intriguing film. Unfortunately though no actor in this movie could save how poorly written the movie was. What could've been a terrifying and ultimately disturbing movie turned very quickly into a clichÃ© mess of a film. Sandra Bullock's character was well acted but poorly written and the rest of the cast was the same.

","Kind of a knock off of A Quiet Place where everyone can't see instead of making noise. Characters are bland caricatures, but Bullock's acting is well done. The monster had promise but nothing is revealed on where it came from or what it actually is. Lazy writing. The anti-White drivel is apparent here. Every single one of the ""bad guys"" is White (all but one being male), while the two protagonists (White woman and Black male) are overly virtuous and competent who always know what to do in all situations. Obviously they develop a love interest. There are hints of Bullock being a lesbian even though she's a single 50 year old mom with two small children. Oh yeah, there's even a dig at Trump with the drunk White jerk male shouting ""Make the end of the world great again."" I feel more emphasis was put on the Leftist slant than actually making a good story."

It is NOT a movie that was inspired by another. However, the movie does have some differences that, overall, make it less enjoyable if you have read the book.

","Bird Box is yet another representation of why Netflix literally rules entertainment. This is the type of quality film that may not have survived the box office although it's one of the best movies I've seen this year but Netflix lets film-makers and cast and crew create and create they did. Bird Box is one of the best post apocalyptic films I have ever seen. It isn't entirely a unique premise, blending I Am Legend with The Quiet Ones and The Road and a handful of others. But this film is powerfully acted, uniquely terrifying, brilliantly directed and the cinematography is exquisite. Many people commented that they didn't like the ending but you know I loved it. This film is so intense and dramatic and you almost expect it to have this bleak ending that I was relieved and felt empowered by the ending.<br/><br/>
Sandra Bullock is astounding in this role as she goes through a character arc as diverse as the film itself. This character has so much depth and back story and you begin to understand her even the elements you don't like about Mallory. This is a tour de force for Bullock and she looks amazing and she drives this film flawlessly. John Malkovich is equally as good and the only hard part about watching him is that his role is too small. He also gets a great back story and an interesting character and has amazing on screen charisma. Trevante Rhodes, Sarah Paulson, Jacki Weaver, Danielle Macdonald, Lil Rel Howery and Tom Hollander all deserve mention for their performances in supporting roles. Vivien Lyra Blair and Julian Edwards are superb as boy and girl, the young children Bullock will do anything to protect. The cast is so good together and the way the film wraps itself together just gives you an incredible insight to these people and the bizarre experience they're having.<br/><br/>
Director Susanne Bier absolutely makes this film her own. Apparently she is known for making films that focus on familial relations and this film proves that. It's almost a secondary theme to have this apocalyptic unstoppable creature as we see these people trying to desperately fight for what they believe in. First Netflix has The Apostle and now Bird Box, two of the best films I've seen in a long time in this genre as well. 10/10"

To me it was clear that the dark figures and nightmares that people would see were specific and personal ONLY to them. That's why the filmmakers never showed us the visions or creatures, duh. Because each terrifying vision was unique to that person (this was explained by the wannabe novelist regarding demon mythology and apocalyptic predictions). And the people running around without blindfolds where already mentally insane so it didn't impact them the same way. The birds were the warning beacons.

With this particular film however, the meme's, and all the endless chatter on social media pushed me to watch mainly because I didn't want any spoilers to ruin it for me. So the other day on a particularly dark, windy and overcast morning (perfect weather for this film btw) I decided to give it a go not expecting much because Netflix movies in general kinda suck. The cast is impressive. I'm a big Sarah Paulson fan so finding out that she was in this film was definitely another draw.<br/><br/>I found the acting to be quite good and I'm surprised more people aren't raving about the beginning because pretty much from the start I was hooked. It was creepy as hell. I felt as though someone had a vice grip on my heart. There were slow moments, but if you're anything like me you appreciated those moments because the rest of the time it's intense! This film did remind me a lot of The Happening which was a horrible horrible horrible movie. I was left feeling frustrated and confused with that film, but for some reason I really enjoyed Bird Box from start to finish. There were still a lot of unanswered questions in the end, but somehow, unlike The Happening, it all seemed to have a point. This film scared me and I love that! But it also had unconditional love, survival, sadness, loss, and even a little humor. I also really appreciate that it was birds that warned of these things/creatures being nearby. Birds and all animals really are pure of heartband can sense things more than humans.<br/><br/>I can't really put it into words, but this film was everything and more for me. Sure it's very similar to a couple other movies, but all in all Bird Box stands all on its own. It's something special. I hope this is a sign of things to come from Netflix."
"schillin128","8","2","7","5 January 2019"," People do not understand Cinema Anymore. Movie was a thrill ride!
","I really want to rant on all these fools who gave this movie less than a 5/10, but first here are my main points.
The Good - This movie had strong performances, great suspense, & thrilling moments. Cinematography was on point & had a non-linear story so we as the viewers can understand how Sandra (Mallory) got to the point she's at. Definitely worth a watch.
MY RANT - People just annoy the F out of me these days b/c everyone thinks they're a damn movie critic. And even so, most movie critics are getting paid to speak, which just shoves bias in our faces all day long.
HERE'S MY POINT: People are expecting too much these days, plain and simple. If the story/plot doesn't perfectly fit their mold or what they think it should be, they tear it to pieces with no regard to the work that goes into the product. As an amateur filmmaker with content on YouTube, I know this all to well. People have a hard time letting go of reality. The concept of ""Suspension of Disbelief"", in which peeps can't just sit back & truly imagine the world/concept/situation they're being introduced to.
I MEAN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! You don't have to know where or why the incident came from and/or why it's happening! That's what keeps us guessing & wondering. Most times when movies do explain, they just ruin the story. Just like the zombie apocalypse... you don't have to explain why it happened, it just is. Now deal with it and try to survive the best way you know how. Some say they don't like the coarse nature of Bullock's character. Her rough character is what keeps her alive & moving forward, besides a few other good reasons that are about 4 ft. tall.
A CRITICISM AND WEAK PROBABLY AT THAT - The one thing I'm dinging this movie for is the sense of urgency when these ""things"" finally make it to you. Sure we understand that if you open your eyes and they're in front of you, you're done for. And that they can try and trick you with the voices of those you know or have known. But other than that, I'm not so sure there is a reason to run from them. They can't physically harm you (however it could shake a vehicle, but never got inside nor could it open windows and so forth); so at some points when the characters are moving fast & tripping and making mistakes; my thought is to just slow the hell down, keep your wits about you & move along. The only problem with my criticism includes the ones (I'll call them ""The Touched""), in which are humans who are possessed by these things. (The minions) for these entities, trying to get what few normal humans are left, to take off their blindfolds and ""SEE"". That changes things tremendously, cause that's a whole other threat in itself. This movie had some great concepts going and although similar to ""A Quiet Place"" & ""The Happening"", it managed to make itself unique. Oh and for some of the reviewers who don't know what they're talking about, the main survivors were in BD Wong's house, not John M.'s... losers. you didn't even watch the movie. Stick to your Hollywood B.S. blockbusters if that's what you love so much. Check me on the ZMAM Show on YouTube if you want to see more. Later."

","ImdB will never cease to amaze me, or at least the people that review the movies won't. I totally understand that we all have a different taste and opinion but sometimes it just doesn't make any sense. That you don't like this movie I'm fine with, but that you score it the lowest possible is just ridiculous. There are thousands and thousands worse movies, how are you going to rate those ones? You just have to stay realistic. I, on the other hand, liked Bird Box as there was suspense, mystery, good acting and the cinematography was also good. For once a movie stayed interesting and that without showing monsters or whatever. I'm not a big fan of open endings, quite the contrary, but here you have an ending that makes perfect sense so I don't see what the fuzz is about. For this genre Bird Box deserves to score more than just 'good'."
"wizic-54352","6","2","7","4 January 2019"," A Mystery Box
","Overall thrilling film. The directing was creative, all-star performance from the cast, especially Sandra Bullock (as expected) and the pacing kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Like many have pointed out, the film doesn't provide all the answers, but I'd much rather have that than excessive exposition. I see this method as ""The Mystery Box"" approach. It's much more enthralling to wonder what's inside an unknown box rather than rip it open and spoil the suspense."
"saptesh786","8","2","7","4 January 2019"," Seeing is dying
","Just saw so-called 'Bird Box' movie. It is a good movie, in spite of many views giving lower ratings and higher questioning. As me, the viewers must ignore all weak points of the movie and enjoy only with its horror genre. They will definitely enjoy a good thriller. I admitted that many questions are unanswered here if we think deeply rather than an entertainment. Many situations have no logic. Do not compare with ' A Quiet Place' . Performance of Sandra Bullock is brilliant. The scene where all house people are going to take groceries and essential items from supermarket through a blind car (with black colour glasses and operate on GPS) is really thrilling and horrifying experience. Also river side journey of Sandra with two children in a single boat is scaring situation. Loneliness atmosphere with fear of unknown entities' attack when opening of eyes is very frightened experience. You can feel this while seeing movie. These two parts of the movie are highlighter. But end is not as expected it has not much climax, perhaps second part will have more thrill and impressive end. However, go and watch the thrill and horror. Recommended by me with 8 stars."

WOW! Sandra Bullock was AMAZING as a Mom trying to save her Babies. The entire Cast was really incredible. Lots of Big Name Stars too.

Was SHOCKED to see such a low score. My only guess is that people didn't know what they were getting themselves into! Seriously, for this genre of film, this was a FANTASTIC MOVIE. It did remind me slightly of A Quiet Place. Only in the sense that it touches all categories but Comedy too. If you like a touch of ANXIETY & Supernatural in your films, then you'll LOVE this.

","Bird Box has the same feel as A Quiet Place but has much less plotholes. The quality of acting is also much better overall.

That's makes her character growth more plausible and her desperate trip to the santuary more understandable.

","Whomever compares this to ""A Quiet Place,"" knows nothing about the book. I would compare the claustrophobia to maybe, 10 Cloverfield Lane, and the mysteriousness of the ""monsters"" to The Myst or perhaps even the beginning of Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Either way, this movie, while not exactly following the book, is a pretty good adaptation. It's creepy and claustrophobic and the characters are questionable which makes the entire movie crawl under your skin as much as the book did.<br/><br/>People complain that seeing Sandra stumbling in the woods gets old, but if she knew where everything was she would be an omniscient character, which is preposterous. I am not generally a big Sandra Bullock fan, but here she pulls off an excellent portrayal of a terrified lady trying to protect the children.<br/><br/>I am also not a fan of Netflix material, because generally their stuff is just... bleh. This movie was not. They have done a fantastic job making the viewer feel pinned down. I do, however, wish they had much more closely followed the book, but then, I suppose, there would have been no surprises for me.<br/><br/>Good job! I actually can't wait to sit and watch it again to pick up on things I missed the first time around. I am also tempted to read the book again because it is far more claustrophobic than the movie.<br/><br/>Read the book. Watch the movie.

I own a small business, keep a roof over head and have worked countlessly in effort of ""survival."" I tell it like it is. I am firm in Truth with my children and from the opening scene alone, Sandra nailed what a mother in that situation would emit. No BS. Listen or we are screwed. I could relate, hence, the movie had me glued immediately.<br/><br/>There were times where the movie felt light, but the desire and will of what a mother will do for her children, was beautifully portrayed by Sandra. The overall message of the film was scripted so simply, you must have senses other than the eyes to witness it.<br/><br/>Emotion filled movie had me on the edge of my seat.

It left a lot of questions unanswered but I'm guessing its because they plan on having a part 2. The little actors who played her children in the film were great as well.

","I was kind of excited when I saw the trailer with Bullock, but it ended up being what I'd describe as a more visual version of The Happening. They still focus a lot on crazy tree shaking for effects, but then they introduce the people that try to force you to open your eyes and that creates some violent encounters.<br/><br/>All in all it's fairly predictable and mostly unrealistic. The production value is up to the standards of Bullock movies, and the acting isn't terrible by any means - but well, maybe I'd say that you'd have to suspend your realism much like you would with Home Alone. Those two criminals would have been dead or in the hospital after one or two of the events that happened to them - much like how there is literally no way Bullock's character would have made any kind of significant traveling movement with no sight plus two children."

","I almost didn't watch this movie because of the bad reviews. I do not like horror movies (the typical ones that only involve cheap thrills); so when I read some reviews - the disappointments that this is not that type of a movie, I was encouraged to watch it. Also, I do not miss a movie with Malkovich, even when he is in a supporting role.<br/><br/>Having said that, I enjoy movies that make you think and this movie is one of those. That is, of course, if you view it symbolically - transcending the sole reliance on what you see on the screen and whether it is plausible. Interestingly, I think that is the key message of the movie. If you take the actual interactions and occurrences more metaphorically and contemplate their meaning, you will enjoy the movie more. The dialogues with Malkovich are brilliant and funny even.<br/><br/>The main themes I took from this movie are:
<ul><li>People are too reliant on the physical and visual, taking things at face value, which often works more for their detriment than betterment. (Themes also include diversity, gender issues)</li><li>Helping others is a strength, not weakness. These kinds of virtues are becoming essential if humanity is to survive challenges: empathy, altruism, including respect for nature (the birds - which was my personal favorite).</li><li>Motherhood - from denial to overprotection. This was, I think, the key message. ""Listen to and do what I say"", no questioning, keep your eyes shut. In this case, it was explored from a positive view. Succumbing to external temptations may be dangerous. This especially addresses the dynamics between children and parents. ""All I have done is for the children's best interest"" is what Sandra's character says at one point (paraphrasing). She went from rejecting the reality of having a child to selflessly caring for other children as her own. Thus, the movie expands also on the concept of family, beyond bloodline. People should be careful who they listen to; and knowing who is doing things in your best interest is not always visible/obvious.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, challenges are transformative and can be overcomed with kindness.<br/><br/>And the present real life pandemic-induced challenge could not have been a better time to watch this movie. Some scenes are scarily resembling present experiences with food shortages, etc. It's like the movie predicted some things... or is it expected human behaviour in such circumstances, so it is not surprising that it happened? In some way, the movie criticizes that too.<br/><br/>Also, after watching Black Mirror, nothing is enough of a horror to me anymore. So, if a classical horror is what you seek, this movie is not for you. If you survived Black Mirror, this one will be a light entertainment. Nevertheless, I found nice messages, though not that mind-bending.<br/><br/>Perhaps, you may find more themes this movie explores, if you keep your mind open, that is, outside the box, while having eyes wide shut. :)"

","The movie as all movies are, a visual to show and relay an experience in visual form, of things or people reacting or just moving along a given situation or circumstances in a scene. A good movie, stands out by actors or actress who portray these characters in realistic fashion. For this, Bird Box is a good movie as good and believable acting carries in an admirable fashion of the story of normal people overcoming conflicts and fear to survive a life threatening situation of an unknown deadly force. It's this experience that we get to enjoy in this movie that makes it a good movie, regardless of the ending or explanation needed."

","How did so many people rush to watch this Netflix offering when it was just a play on the already trash talked M. Night Shyamalan offering The Happening?
That's not to say this movie is bad, it's just that we've seen this before, only this time we aren't even given a ridiculous reason as to why it was all happening (no pun intended).
There were so many missed opportunities here not least that this could have easily been better delivered as a tv series rather than a movie, which in turn could have delivered those all important answers to the burning questions this film left us with.
I so wish they had switched the sister roles around and had Sarah Paulson play lead instead of the almost forgotten Bullock.
I guess the worst offense here is the lack of reveal of the 'monsters', moving leaves and formless black smoke does not make anyone tense watching. It didn't even need to be a full reveal straight away, glimpses, reflected moments in the eyes something to provide some sort of pay off.
Coming in at a not so healthy second for worst offender was the saccharin ending but I guess Sandra had to have her happy, cheesy string ending.
I had this rated at a 7 but realized after typing all this the movie hits a decidedly average 5 !!"

A bit mad because I totally want some answers, but I have to think about the tension and the stress throughout the film. Bullock does a good job. In general the cast is okay-ish.

I think it is a very thrilling film. The story has a dim atmosphere. I wanted to close my ears so many times, because the sounds of wind, footsteps, and rustilng of leaves kept me in suspense. There is one thing that I don't get the meaning exactly: The last scene. I don't understand what they want to tell us by depicting that the mother and two children get safety at last.
To sum up, it is an interesting horror film including mother's love to children, and I enjoyed it a lot."
"Roger2019","7","1","3","9 July 2019"," Flawed but not awful
","I've scrolled and expanded for a good while now and was surprised no one's appeared to have mentioned H.P. Lovecraft. I haven't read, but understand that the invisible threat is dealt with quite vaguely in the book on which this film is based, too. Curiosity kept me interested during the build-up, and when the excellent Tom Hollander (of whom I can also see no mention among the reviews, although his appearance is short but sweet) shows up I was hooked, leading to, it felt, an admittedly flat ending.<br/><br/>Regarding the antagonists, if you enjoy your Lovecraft then the idea of gigantic invisible (or at least disorientating or phsyically painful to look) creatures with godlike powers and the ability to control minds, induce madness upon sight and generally ruin your day is not, although certainly far-fetched, without precedent, and thereafter the unseen threat is a lot easier to enjoy, and saves some time hunting around for explanations. The sketches that Gary (Hollander) spreads out on the coffee table fits in with the whole Lovecraftian monsters idea pretty well. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos rarely translates to film well because of the problems visualising the monsters, which are by definition illusive, and when described in any phsical detail, really kind of silly.<br/><br/>It is fair to say that the stuff the characters manage to pull off while blindfolded is indeed outrageous, but all-in-all the pacing, acting and tension make for an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>Just remember to think ""Great Old Ones"" from the get-go and it's perfectly palatable."

1. The blind car driving scene that is almost ridiculous
2. ""Slight"" similarity with Dawn of the Dead (1978)

Luck is the dominant factor in the movie, e.g. the journey in the river would have been another movie itself if it were real, but, in the movie, it's just a series of fortunate events.

"milenkne","3","1","3","23 March 2019"," A blind rip off
","This movie has taken ideas from other movies, but sadly it completely fails.
""The Mist"" - a group of survivors must remain in the enclosed space because ""something is in the mist!"" (What a great line and a great movie!). They barricade themselves, but must go for a supply run. Includes a religious person as well.
""World War Z"" - sudden outbreak and the mayhem on the street (loved it in both movies).
""I am Legend"" - a radio communication is established with a survivor compound. You just need to go there.
""Walking Dead"" - bad guys survivors fight good guys survivors. Also, endless fillers with every character's sob story about their late fathers or something of that sort.<br/><br/>Now, what's worst than a rip off is that Bird Box simply doesn't deliver. No answers, no explanations, no ending, no sense, no logic. Generous 3 stars, mostly based on cinematography."

","I understand the film enough to know I enjoyed it. I love the mystery and not having everything explained verbatim to me makes it better. We live vicariously through these characters, we feel what they feel, their fears, sadness & dread. I think for those who didn't enjoy the film, maybe they need to have their hands held throughout a film & have all that's happening documented & explained in detail or else they don't get it. This is a movie that forces you to think, to have an imagination. It disarms you, it engages you & by the end it changes you. It's a film that will stay with you & seep into your subconscious. I appreciate a plot that challenges me without insulting my intelligence & this film does just that. It's twists & turns kept me on the edge of my seat & frankly I didn't mind the auspices ending. Everyone wants a dramatic, Hollywood type ending - this film ended with questions which to me was exactly how it should end, keeping the mystery alive & staying true to what the characters knew. Bullock knocks it out of the park here, she holds her own as you'd expect. This film is a shining moment for her & she's exceptional here."

It is about some sort of weird bio attack or mind attack so people start killing themselves as if they are seeing some ""creatures"" By the way, no real creatures are shown in this movie.<br/><br/>The good..<br/><br/>It does lead audience into what is going on with the main character and her kids.
So, it shows a flash back and forth.. However.<br/><br/>The bad<br/><br/>The movie basically has two chapters. Before babies were born and babies grew up. The part I still don't get it, how would the kids grow up when they were just helpless with two people. No car, no food, they can't really get out. and all of a sudden, 5 years later, the kids grew into 5 years old.... unbelievable!<br/><br/>The ugly<br/><br/>There are plots that don't explain in detail. First, the two characters that took the car and ran away. I thought they would have come back, but it just lets that them disappear with the car. Second, the bad guys who can see, where did they come from? There is no purpose of what they are doing... i was like, they are just killing people?<br/><br/>The bad ending..<br/><br/>Well, it may seem like a surprise, but it is not enough to satisfy audience.

"geekhead","8","1","3","2 February 2019"," A bird in the box is worth two in the hand... or a good thriller for adults
","Being a Sandra Bullock fan, I enjoyed this movie immensely but that's not say it didn't have its faults. Maybe the novel was filled out a bit more. But when a movie keeps you interested from start to finish, that's worth something.<br/><br/>The movie evolves around specific conditions the antagonist is creating, which acts as the plot device, but is never explained. Where did the antagonist come from? When will it leave? The movie is not a look at the longer-term answers to these questions. Though it does span 5 years, it focuses on one mother trying to survive under these threatening conditions with her two children, who she is trying to get to safety. That's it. It does not explore the villain. That seems to have frustrated some people who mistakenly think the movie is about the villain, instead of this one mother's personal journey and her character arc.<br/><br/>Her journey (without giving anything away) does have a beginning, middle and end, in that the question of ""does she get her children to safety"" is answered. That wasn't enough for some viewers and I get that, but that WAS the point of the movie and is the central question the plot was designed to answer. Not ""who is the antagonist"" ... in fact I don't remember a single character asking anything about the antagonist, (""where did it come from"" or ""what do you think it is"") so that should have been a tip-off it would not be explored. And to be fair, that could be seen as one big hole as it's the first thing people would reasonably ask. Instead everyone was just focused on survival, but that worked for me.<br/><br/>The movie built great suspense, almost Hitchcockian, especially in certain scenes, and only lagged a bit in couple spots, but that changed quickly. It was also a bit long, but all those things are why I gave 8 stars vs 10.<br/><br/>Since the ending only answered the personal journey of the Mother and not the longer term questions, I can see how it disappointed some. But overall it was filmed well, acted well, kept my interest, and was a very different kind of movie.<br/><br/>If you're tired of car chases, shoot-em-ups and other overdone normal fare, you might just enjoy this mostly gripping movie."

I can understand there are people who dislike pretty much anything and can hardly get amazed about anything anymore. I usually avoid those comments as they have nothing relevant to add. Some mention the ending was disappointing. I don't think so, but I'd say see it and judge yourself. I would wonder what the future holds for all survivors.

","A mass epidemic strikes Earth which makes people go crazy and commit suicide, but only IF they are not blindfolded and SEE the mysterious phenomena.

The reason for the apocalypse is what makes ""Bird Box"" standout and, thankfully, there are no zombies, yet it's the least of these for a couple of reasons.<br/><br/>For one, I didn't find the dramatic dynamics of the group all that captivating, but it was okay. If you're a fan of Bullock you'll probably like this movie more than me. I appreciated Rosa Salazar as Lucy, but her role isn't that significant. Meanwhile Rhodes and Malkovich are effective.<br/><br/>The concept behind the mass crisis is where the movie fails. It's sort of explained and yet it isn't. There are too many inconsistencies and what appears to be plot holes. It's basically a bunch of malarkey and reflects lazy writing. People on message boards debate back-and-forth ad nauseam, but the movie's too nonsensical and meh to make it worth the effort.<br/><br/>The film runs 2 hours and 4 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Monrovia, La Puente, Santa Clarita, Smith River, Scripps College and Los Angeles).<br/><br/>GRACE: C"

","I watched the Movies because of the memes!
Yes.
So now the Plot is told within ten minutes, but the Film is stretched into more than two hours. I waited for it to become horrifying and scary so that I won't sleep at night, as the reviews told me. But the only terrifying thing was Sandra Bullock not giving love to her, at least one one of them, children and calling them boy and girl. Of course not bonding to the children, means it is easier to let them go if they die, seems logic .. but in a world full of mystic winds that makes people kill themself, a bit of love and affection may helped them to develop.
Anyway the movies leaves us with lots of questions: most of all where the suicide storm came from and where does it go?
It seems the writer of the story made themself an easy job for creating just the middle part of a story. Shouldn't there be.. a beginning .. and an ending? Other things questioned me too:
Why was this gale of dark thoughts especially strong in the forest? Why should these birds stay next to the blind school on the trees, build up a mystic trail for others and not.. like fly alway? Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Why do the blind ones have endless food rations and resources?
In the Flashback: Why did they not use sticks or canes and a blindfold to go next door - if they are neighbors for ages they surely know the area by heart! Why take a car to the supermarket first?
I found the brutality very strong and often looked away. I had the feeling a good story doesn't need so much gruesome deaths. The hard ways of killing themself shook me a lot and woke me up between endless scenes where characters made stupid decisions and the repeatatly river montages."

"theduggan","5","1","3","16 January 2019"," Leftist propaganda for 2020
","I went into this film not knowing anything about it other than there was a fair bit of hype. There were fine performances and a decent story in the making with a terrifying horror told in past and present.
Unfortunately, it was cliched and riddled with stupidity. It didn't have a good ending and we are left wondering what it was all about? What are the ""creatures""? You are given nothing.
The film is a vehicle for leftist propaganda with 2020 in mind. It is obvious from the start that they portray white men as angry and cowardly (Malkovich). The single pregnant mom (bullock) is strong and independent. The gay asian man is compassionate. And then there is the hero (Rhodes) who is the complete anti-thesis of Malkovich. Malkovich is a drunk asshole who says they need to make the end of the world great again. An obvious reference to Netflix idea of the typical Trump supporter. To further underline this Bullock tells him that her father was an asshole too.
I actually like Rhodes performance. He is the good guy, a vet, a sensitive caring supportive brother and uncle. He turns out to be the only flawless character.
The problem I have with it is that they make such a point of portraying all white men as evil killers or the obligatory asshole. Malkovich doesn't want to let any strangers in as they cannot be trusted. This is a reference to Trump and the wall.
Ultimately, all of Malkovich concerns turn out to be valid despite his character being such a dick.
Fast forward six years and we have the ideal couple with their two happy children. Even so Bullock is shown to be the destroyer of dreams and Rhodes, in his best Obama, gives a speech about children needing hope otherwise they don't have a future. Shortly thereafter another bunch of evil white people turn up and Rhodes sacrifices himself to protect Bullock and ""boy"" and ""girl"". Yep, Bullock doesn't name them.
After this the film just gets stupid. Another hillbilly Trump supporter appears to underline the evil white man theme. By this point Netflix do not care. They have made their point. The Netflix generation have subtly been programmed to reject Trump, because after all, in the previous two hours we've been educated."
"jessefelt","5","1","3","14 January 2019"," A sadly missed opportunity.
","Bird Box appears at first glance to be an attempt to cash in on the success of A Quiet Place, however the timing does not support this idea. Neither does the existence of the original source material that this movie was based on. A Quiet Place, however, is a significantly better film unfortunately.<br/><br/>I think the biggest issue with this film is that it destroys any sense of tension right off the bat with it's present day/5 years ago flashback method. The moment any other characters show up on screen you already know that they die because you've already seen the future, leaving the viewer in a state where none of the characters matter, even if they are well acted. Everything else being equal, if they had simply told the story in chronological order, I might have given this 6 and a half or even 7 stars. Unfortunately, the film ruins any suspense or surprise it could have had.<br/><br/>The acting is solid to good. Personally I'm a fan of Bullock and I feel she pulled of the character well, even if it was a generally unlikable character. Malkovich turns in a pretty standard Malkovich job, playing the typical insufferable genius trope character. Still a trope, even if they hang a lampshade on it.<br/><br/>Trevante Rhodes puts in a good performance. It's just unfortunate that the character is pretty flat and meets a completely predictable end. I would have liked seeing more of the character interaction between Tom and Malorie. They could have easily removed the silly ""totally not intelligent zombies"" and just focused on actually showing us the relationship growing between these two a little more.<br/><br/>Danielle Macdonald did a good job of playing the sacrificial lion. I really liked her character. She came across as genuine, even if she really only existed to die and provide Malorie with the tools to grow.<br/><br/>By contrast, Sarah Paulson serves as the sacrificial lamb, and seems to turn in about as in depth job as one would expect from someone who knows their character is gone and forgotten by page 10. She's not bad, but she's not good. She's pretty much just there until she dies.<br/><br/>The last of the characters who are more than just set dressing, we have Tom Hollander playing the obviously evil wolf in sheep's clothing. I don't have a problem with his job on this character, so much as the existence of the character at all in this form. Maybe it's a result of the aforementioned dead giveaway that everyone dies, but this character's actions are so blatantly obvious that I just sat there waiting for it to happen, surprised they managed enough restraint to not just do it i the next scene.<br/><br/>I think this really pinpoints the second major reason why I am rating this film so low. The script is just so obvious and trope-filled. Nothing about it is unpredictable, and that just makes it boring. It's one thing to follow a formula when making a movie, but this just comes across as lazy and uncreative. I don't know, maybe the book is just a bad? I had never heard of it prior to the movie, so I can't say.<br/><br/>The characters are all pretty flat and one dimensional, none of them particularly memorable outside of the performance quality of the actors. There is honestly zero earned character growth, with Malorie basically being a terrible mother from start to 30 seconds before finish, when she suddenly turns into a warm and caring person for some reason. Maybe the book goes into more detail about WHY she is so detached and cold toward the children, and at a logical level I can completely understand the intention behind the character, but the character we get in the movie never comes off as deep enough for it to hold water. She flips a switch at the end of the film with no development or growth of the character prior. It's just... POOF, literally 30 seconds before fade to black.<br/><br/>The camera work was good, if fairly standard fare. I can't really knock a film for having standardly executed camera work. It doesn't make the film any more memorable, but it also doesn't detract from the film. It seems to have been done by a pro... and nothing more.<br/><br/>The big evil feels a little.... convenient as well. It is presented as some deep mysterious force, then suddenly it affects some people differently and turns them into smart blindfold zombies (or religious zealots, you choose). Then later we are shown that not only are these people affected similarly, but they can apparently turn off the freaky eye job in order to infiltrate the resistance. It all just feels contrived, especially when at the end they check the eyes to make sure Malorie and the kids are safe. We are also shown at the end that this mysterious force can cause physical damage to things in the world, as they knock over trees chasing after Malorie. This really causes one to wonder why it doesn't just come through the door, or easily breakable glass windows instead of playing this long con with crazy people smart blindfold zombies?<br/><br/>Lastly, I feel like I have to point out the completely flat ending that not only does nothing to resolve or even hint as resolution of the baseline threat in the film, but a huge continuity error actively interfered with the ending in a way that made me THINK it was going somewhere actually interesting, rather than just the sappy saccharine happy ending we got.
That moment was after Malorie falls down the hill on their way to the commune at the end. When she crawls back out she finds the bicycle bell that Girl had on the ground and picks it up. She then proceeds to call out for the children until she hears the bicycle bell being rung by Boy. Immediately I thought ""where did he get the bell from? she JUST picked it up seconds ago?"". I then started to wonder if maybe they were going to work in a twist where this is all in her head, she opened her eyes after falling, and they are giving us a peak at what people see right before they suicide or go crazy pants. For the first time in the film I felt like it could be something interesting. And then we got to the school for the blind and everything is happily ever after.<br/><br/>It's not a terrible film. It is, overall well made, with the technical parts of film making done adequately. But it is a lackluster, poorly written and ultimately forgettable film that fails to live up to the slightest level of tension that it purports to deliver.<br/><br/>(seriously, I mean, a school for the blind, in the middle of the woods, only accessible via the river? And how ""poetic"" that it's a school for the Blind. In a world where seeing gets you killed! HA! it's deep and meaningful!)"

At least let the viewers know the how they suddenly appeared out of nowhere. If the creatures really appeared as the things that the watchers were most afraid of, then at least show the ""things"", show what the watchers saw before they committed suicide, in that way you don't have to actually show the real form of the creatures. It's like a horror movie without the actual horrifying factors to see. What about Felix and Lucy? Did they die? Did they find a way to survive? At least show us how they ended up, where they stayed and how the died etc. And for the ending, I was hoping that Rick has figured out a solution to keep the creatures away but it's not really solved. They're all gonna have to hide in that school for the rest of their lives.

","The idea that you can only pass an adventure with blindfolds, I still find original! Any unknown force, lets people drive mad. So they commit suicide. No one knows where it comes from and how to fight it. Pregnant Sandra Bullock can barricade herself into a house with a few other, few survivors. Interpersonal drama then plays out and you can't trust anyone anymore. For sure, it's a bit reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan's work The Happening. The unknown force is not declared in great detail either. It's just there. The story is rather exciting, like the typical meeting of different people and how they have to come to terms. The only antidote is: Just don't look! Add to that the unique trip in a small boat with children who have all attracted the blindfolds. This is pure excitement and horror! I mean, how are we going to behave? The actors are heavily selected. Especially Bullock's counterpart part John Malkovich. Malkovich already has a tremendous screen presence.
The effects are simple and only targeted. Director Susanne Bier prefers to keep the focus on her performers rather than the strained disasters. Unfortunately, the conclusion remains open: You don't know how to contain the power. Are Bullock and the other survivors the only ones who had adopted the Blindekuh method? Why can the force affect people, even through the computer screen, but not through an open fireplace? Conclusion: An exciting and captivating story that has more interpersonal dimensions than on effects"

That said, it's well shot, visually good and an interesting idea, however the characters are flat and uninteresting, the whole idea of the constant blind folds could be negated if the characters actually thought about things. What the films suffers from is story telling, it just doesn't really manage it, the flash backs stunt the flow of the film but are needed because with out them there would be no reason for this film to be 2 hours long, they add very little other than to take the tension away. The ending is very much an English essay ending, (you know when you've written enough words do you can end it 'and then they woke up and it was all a dream') answers no questions but doesnt leave you wanting any answers either, you'll just turn it off and carry on with your day."

"southdavid","5","1","3","4 January 2019"," Bird Brained
","Like the rest of the world, I too watched Netflix's film ""Bird Box"" over the festive period. Whilst I'd say it's unarguably the best of the prestige 2018 releases that I saw, given the state of some of the others, that's a little like damning with faint praise.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is the star, playing Malorie, who's in her later stages of pregnancy when the world's population is enveloped by a mysterious compulsion to take their own lives. By luck she makes it to a suburban house where it becomes apparent that the suicides are caused by a mysterious entity and if you see them, the compulsion will overtake you immediately. Thrown together, the makeshift team must find a way to survive, including finding food, all without using their most useful sense.<br/><br/>So what works? Sandra Bullock does, her commitment to the physical nature of the role is admirable, as is her willingness to play a reluctance towards motherhood, even before the situation unfolds. I love Sarah Poulson. She too is great in what is essentially an extended cameo in this. The premise is an interesting idea and much of the early execution is good. There's some excellent horrific imagery in those early scenes too, as rakes of people off themselves as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, then the film breaks down a bit. I've not read the source novel, but not knowing it was a book previously, I felt like the film was a premise without much of a clue what to do with it. The films flashes back from Malorie's perilous blindfolded trip down the river to her time in the house immediately following the outbreak. All of that is fairly standard Zombie movie stuff, barricading the door, deciding whether to let outsiders in, and internal mistrust. Eventually they have to make a run to get more supplies, and here's where the logic starts to breakdown. Rather than the simple act of wearing a blindfold and breaking into next door, they decide to paint the windows of a car and drive to the supermarket, they complete the journey, using the Sat Nav to guide them. They manage to get there and get in, load up their shopping carts and I'm thinking, well that was the easy bit, finding the car, loading it and getting back to the house again are the real interesting bits, but the film just cuts to them back at the house. The river trip is another logical issue. The whole trip takes about a day but one point, near the end, they understand that they have to navigate some rapids - which will need someone to look. They eventually decide to risk doing it blind..... but THEY DON'T HAVE TO STAY IN THE BOAT. Get out of the boat and walk the 10 minutes, keeping close to the river and they'll accomplish the same thing in a much safer way.<br/><br/>I do think it's good when a movie leaves things to the imagination - and I'm OK with the fact that you never see the reason for the suicides properly, in fact the actual reasons are only ever speculated at, but the films lack of logic, dull last twenty minutes and middling supporting performances blindfold this one from the start."

","Honestly, I have zero idea what some viewers saw. Bird Box is literally The Happening with blindfolds . It's every Post-Apocalyptic cliche ever conceived crammed into a needlessly long run time. This movie is a medium budget Sci-fi Asylum film with an A-list actress. There is nothing else I can say besides the fact that if you've ever seen or read or played a post-apocalyptic--anything... then you've already seen this movie."
"scb_coldsteel","6","1","3","3 January 2019"," And entertaining but ultimately unsatisfactory psychological horror film
","So I saw Bird Box on Netflix. I normally do not get too excited about Netflix originals, but I do like Sandra Bullock plus I had a few recommendations from some friends. Overall it was a bit of a mixed bag of a film.<br/><br/>The concept of the film is quite interesting. A unknown entity is causing mass suicides across the planet. The meat of the film is a psychological thriller showing a group of people trying to survive in the apocalyptic chaos. The film itself takes place through a series of flashbacks demonstrating how the world fell apart and just what a ""bird box"" is for.<br/><br/>The film had a very strong beginning. I genuinely enjoyed the setup of the film and wondering just what was going on. The film does a good job of initially building tension and intrigue to craft an atmosphere that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I also really liked the way the film handled the ""bird box"" monster entities. Some people may not be satisfied, but ultimately they served more as a MacGuffin to push the narrative along.<br/><br/>There were also a number of gruesome kills in the movie that came out of nowhere and felt genuinely shocking. There were a few smart underlying concepts regarding loss, alienation, grief, and depression that the films touches on. The movie did a good job with Sandra Bullock's character as well. I really felt attached to her and her emotional struggles as the film went along.<br/><br/>The acting was solid all-around. Sandra Bullock is a great actress and she does her best with the material even with its flaws. Same thing with the supporting ensemble cast. I really don't have a complaint about anyone's acting. I will say there is no reason for Machine Gun Kelly to be in this film though. His character or story arc added nothing to the film.<br/><br/>Ultimately though the concept is more interesting than the execution. The film felt very reminiscent of A Quiet Place with elements of the Mist and The Happening thrown in for good measure. Bird Box was certainly better than the Happening, but felt like an imitation of better films. This does not mean it wasn't entertaining. It certainly had its moments of intense horror and psychological drama.<br/><br/>It does seem like the film was trying too hard to go into many different directions. Is it a smart psychological horror film? A gory monster flick? A meditation on human nature in the face of chaos? A survivalist tale of female empowerment in the face of dread? It just felt like the film never really found its voice with so many narratives.<br/><br/>There were also some glaring pacing issues in the film. There was entirely too much filler in the film. It really could have been shaved down 30 minutes or so to make a tighter presentation. The film really began to lose steam halfway through. This of course being a shame considering the strength of the introduction. The middle dragged on, while the conclusion felt rushed and unsatisfactory. The movie fell short of its initial setup with a forced and anticlimactic ending. I won't go into any details regarding the plot holes, but there are a few head scratchers throughout the film that really hurt the internal believability of the film.<br/><br/>Overall I liked Bird Box for what it was. It was a well acted film with an interesting concept that dropped the ball on execution. It certainly isn't a classic horror film, but it's not a bad Netflix original either. I would recommend a watch for anyone that has Netflix, but don't expect to be blown away.... and yes the memes are better than the film. A 6.25 out of 10."
"DrDarkness","5","1","3","3 January 2019"," Strong cast can't save an average movie
","I was positively surprised to see Sandra Bullock stepping out from the darkness after not seeing her for such a long time. I've always loved her and same goes to John Malkovich. When the movie started and I saw them together I thought ""wow, I'm so happy I get to see them together, and the movie seems promising too!""<br/><br/>But I'm sorry to say that the plot of this film was average at it's best. Everything else was from okay to great - the director Susanne Bier does a decent job and personally I have nothing to complain about her work. All the actors, even the small kids, do a fine job.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? The plot, the whole story. It had a promising hook with pretty unique monsters. Without saying too much I'll just state that I was perfectly fine with the way the story dealt with the entities - that's not the problem. The problem was unimaginative and dull story with lukewarm twists that you could foresee from miles away.<br/><br/>In my books this film goes to category B-, a movie which I will never watch again because it would be too damn boring."
"lonkozz","5","1","3","3 January 2019"," The ending ruined it
","The ending could have been so much better. Had it been something ""Shutter Island""-esque, with the blindfolds being a metafore for blindness throughout the movie and the whole monster thing an actual illness only inside Sandra Bullock's head or at least something close to that, it would've been a solid 10 for me. You get thrills and all this build up that something will twist the story, yet nothing ever does. And really what happened to the 2 guys that stole that car? A movie with huge potential and a mediocre ending."
"david_rudy_lee","8","1","3","3 January 2019"," Interesting Look at Fear and Connecting
","This was a film that was recommended to me by a couple friends who wanted to see what my thoughts were on it. I decided to give a viewing as part of my year-end review and because so many people seemed to be talking about this film. The official synopsis is five years after an ominous unseen presence drives most of society to suicide, a mother and her children make a desperate bid to reach safety.<br/><br/>We kick off with a woman talking to two children. She is Malorie (Sandra Bullock). The two children are Vivien Lyra Blair and Julian Edwards. She tells them that they have to do exactly as she says and be absolutely quiet. The other thing is to not take off their blindfolds, no matter what they hear. They go down to a river and get into a boat. They are looking for a group of people and hear over a radio telling them where to go.<br/><br/>It then cuts to five years in the past. Malorie is a painter and is pregnant. Her sister is Jessica (Sarah Paulson). She is bringing groceries and informs her to turn on the news. There is a report of people committing suicides in Romania and Europe. They head to the hospital for an OB appointment. On their way back, whatever is causing this hits the city. Jessica purposely gets into an accident and Malorie seeks refuge in a nearby house.<br/><br/>The house belongs to Greg (BD Wong). With him is Tom (Trevante Rhodes), Cheryl (Jacki Weaver), Lucy (Rosa Salazar), Charlie (Lil Rel Howery), Douglas (John Malkovich) and Felix (Machine Gun Kelly). They learn that if you look at whatever is causing this, it makes people commit suicide. These people have to try to find a way to survive, which includes getting food and ensuring that the windows are covered. They will also have to decide who else to let in and who else might be dangerous.<br/><br/>All the while, we see in the present where Malorie is taking the two children down the river and the difficulties of surviving when you have to remain blindfolded.<br/><br/>Now I will say, this film was quite interesting in that it really is like a combination of A Quiet Place and The Happening. I think this film does better with taking the best part of the latter film and actually making it much more interesting. It is quite terrifying that looking at this creature will cause you to commit suicide. It gets even worse when you have people who are deciding to help these creatures as well.<br/><br/>The film does have some deeper meanings behind it as well. In the first scene with Malorie and Jessica, we learn that Malorie has issues with connecting with people. She is showing this in her painting, but her father was absent and her boyfriend who impregnated her is no longer in the picture. This is prevalent in the reveal of the names of the children, as well as a conversation she has with Tom. It is something that many women go through, especially right after childbirth, in normal circumstances. Having to deal with it while the world is ending makes it that much more amplified.<br/><br/>Going from there, I thought the dynamic of the characters is interesting as well. I will go deeper into the acting a little bit later, but I think we get a nice mix of characters in this film. Seeing how people react to situations like this is quite believable and it would actually make people do things they might normally not do.<br/><br/>The film though I did think was a tad long. I don't think there was really a pacing issue though. It is edited together very well where we are seeing things in the present and then we are given part of the past which fills in ideas, concepts and what is happening. I thought that aspect was good. I read some people thinking that this film should have ended at different times, I disagree. I think how it ends is fitting and wraps everything up. I just wanted more of bleakness to the ending would be my only gripe.<br/><br/>Something that really blew me away was the acting. Bullock was pretty solid as the lead in this one. She is interesting as a broken and flawed character. She is facing being a mother, when she really doesn't want to be, but seeing the changes it makes within her is interesting. Rhodes I thought was solid as the male lead who is trying to help her. Malkovich is great, which is nothing new. I was a big fan. Paulson and Howery were solid in their own ways. I thought the rest of the cast was pretty good for their roles. I was glad to see an appearance by Pruitt Taylor Vince late in this film as well.<br/><br/>The effects for this film are quite interesting. The creature is something that can make or break a film. I've always said that if you can't make it look good, hide it as much as you can. This film does that and I think it is better for it. I would have been upset if they would have given us a CGI monster that looked cheesy. We do get some solid effects with people as they kill themselves or those around them. These look to be practical, but if they were CGI, they were well done. The film was also shot beautifully.<br/><br/>Score for the film really didn't stand out to me, but I don't think it really hurt the film either. What I really wanted to touch on here is sounds that the characters hear. One of the ways these things try to get people to look is by masking their voice as their loved ones. We hear it faintly like ghosts and I thought that helped make it feel eerie. It had a couple moments where I kind of thought the person might be there and wanted to see if they'd check or not.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this film has been really divisive on social media. I was quite intrigued to see where I fell. I thought that this was a pretty solid film. It took aspects of other films, but didn't really do a whole lot differently with it. I did like seeing someone take one of the major concepts of The Happening and doing something better with it for sure. It has a strong cast that did good. The effects were fine as I had no problem with hiding the monster and the wounds looked real. I like some things they did with the sounds of the film. It does run a little bit long, but I did think it was enjoyable. I would say this film was good."
"travmonroe","6","1","3","3 January 2019"," Don't buy into the hype, and don't be fooled by the hate.
","Why, why, why do some viewers insist on having everything in a movie explained to them?! Sometimes you are required to use your own imagination. Not all movies will spoon-feed you every little detail.<br/><br/>This movie is decent, not terrible. Yes, there are things that are highly unlikely to happen, like running blind through a forest, and navigating a river blind. And even finding two kids from a capsized boat blind. These are all improbable, but hardly unforgivable being that they are set in a movie.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is about how the ""creatures"" were made out to be so dangerous even to those in blindfolds. We'd already learned that they can't physically do anything to anyone, they can't open doors or lift blindfolds. So why did Mallory have to pick up the kids and run around so much in the trees when all the creatures can do is make noise and blow leaves?<br/><br/>I found the earlier scene on the river when Mallory is telling Boy and Girl that one of them is going to have to look to be _extremely_ powerful. What a situation to have to be in, what a choice to have to make. That it didn't come to pass saved me from completely losing it while watching. It's not very often that a scene in a movie can evoke an emotional response like that from me. I'd give an extra half a star just for that if I could."
"big_hair_x","8","1","3","3 January 2019"," Satisfying
","Over the last year Netflix has released a number of films that are right up my alley, with weird supernatural events being the cornerstone of them all. Most of them, whilst being lavishly put together with an intriguing hook, good performances from great casts, and oftentimes wonderful imagery and ideas, suffered from having poor or even non-existent endings. Thankfully, in this reviewer's humble opinion, Bird Box did all that it needed to do.<br/><br/>I think this was a story about the characters, not the event. Yes, I can see why a lot of people were left wanting in regards to the ""creatures"" and their origins, but I feel those questions were answered by the drawings laid out by one of the characters at one point. Those images were very similar to the kind of imagery evoked by H. P. Lovecraft. That ties in very closely with the events happening in the film, so I drew my conclusions based on that. I guess if you're unfamiliar with Lovecraft you may miss that reference and be left wondering, so I suppose in that sense the film fails.<br/><br/>Even so, the performances were mostly great, the story was fairly solid, and whilst it did feel a little too long at some points, I felt it was still very satisfying to watch, especially since Lovecraft has seen surprisingly little love on the big screen. I'd recommend it, with the suggestion that you look at it as a character piece, with people trying to survive a disaster, rather than an in-depth look into the how's and why's of the disaster."

","So, it turns out that there is a real revelation that will occur someday. There are, to date, 2 movies that are foreshadowing it. Either each individual author understands the significance of what they've written, or the latter is just copying the former. But that is irrelevant.<br/><br/>The two movies I am aware of are:
In the Mouth of Madness
Bird Box<br/><br/>(Side note, The Happening is not relevant here, because the suicides in that movie are from chemicals, not ""new knowledge"", as is the case for the two movies I listed above)<br/><br/>In the Mouth of Madness requires one to read a book, where the information is injected into the mind of the reader. They go crazy processing it. Some commit murder/suicide. Others just commit suicide. Others try to warn the safe ones not to read it, or go to ""the movie"". What is the new knowledge?<br/><br/>In Bird Box, there is a visual presentation which causes everyone who sees it to commit suicide. Except for individuals with corrupt minds already, who become murderers, and facilitators to get the visual presentation to those that try to shield their eyes from it. What is the visual presentation?<br/><br/>Movie #1: Knowledge. Movie#2: Visual proof.<br/><br/>This is the Last Days, when our sins are displayed directly on our faces. You will see them written all over on everyone, they will be like scarlet on white linen, right on your skin. And when you look in the mirror, you will see them on yourself too. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br/><br/>So, a day will come, where new knowledge will cause mass panic, and yes, suicides. A blindfold wont save you from it, because it is on you. All WILL see it.<br/><br/>""Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."" -- Rev. 14:12"

Fits right in with some recent cool-concept suspense movies such as A Quiet Place, that focus on family-building elements to encourage more investment in their characters.<br/><br/>Some scenes could have done with a little more commitment to the idea though, and really played on the inability to see. Kind of ruins it in the parts where we can see what the characters can't.<br/><br/>Good to see more A-list actors willing to go to the small screen, and I've always been a fan of Sandra's massive Bullocks."

When I watched the film, I saw it change a bit as usual.The movie takes 2 hours and it's hard to fit a big book in 2 hours.So in my opinion if I actually had a series rather than making movies I think it would be more like and really cool.Had a very long and immersive story for the film.In fact, a universe like TWD does more people in the world.or if it would be 3 series, but this would be risky in terms of viewing.

"kjproulx","7","1","3","2 January 2019"," An Effective Post-Apocalyptic Thriller
","When looking at movies like Avatar or even direct remakes of classic movies, it's a fair criticism to hate on it for being unoriginal, but in the same breath, there's also an argument to be made for why it also worked so well for audiences around the world. Familiar storytelling has been around since the beginning of cinema and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Netflix's Bird Box is another example of this but done in an effective way. Taking the world by storm in the online community, this film has received quite a bit of praise by fans, and while I don't believe it's particularly that great, I did have positive viewing experience with it. This movie does many things right, but it stumbles quite a few times along the way. Here's why Bird Box may be worth your time, but also why there are plenty of other movies worth seeing first.<br/><br/>The world has been overrun by a disease that has turned people into zombie-like creatures. With weird, unseeable figures making people kill commit suicide, the survivors have turned to wearing blindfolds to stay alive. Survival movies have been around forever and it's very rare that one does something new for the genre, and while Bird Box doesn't really do that, it tries to. Sadly, this movie is going to be compared to 2018's A Quiet Place, due to the fact that instead of not being able to look, that film was about not being able to speak or make a sound. On top of that, the ambiguity of A Quiet Place has been lost here and it really does feel over-explanatory on quite a few occasions.<br/><br/>Bird Box begins with the main event having already happened and follows Malorie (Sandra Bullock) and two unknown children characters. I would've loved to see a survival film with these three characters for the full two hours, but the majority of this film actually takes place in the recent past, showing how this situation came to be. While that may work for some viewers, this was the main aspect that almost had me disliking this film. If it was just going to keep cutting away in order to beat the audience over the head with an explanation I would've been upset, but it does focus on the past more than the present. For that reason, I ended up becoming a little more forgiving, as some of the characters leading up to the present were very likeable.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock delivers a great performance here and held this movie together even through its weak moments. Joined by incredible talents in performers like John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson, and Jacki Weaver to name a few, the true standout of this film was Trevante Rhodes, in my opinion. Ever since his breakout performance in the Oscar-winning Moonlight, I have been rooting for him to become an A-List star. Even though that hasn't happened for him yet, I believe his time may still come. I think he's a very talented actor and his screen time with Bullock leapt off the screen.<br/><br/>In the end, Bird Box isn't going to be remembered by most people as one of the best movies of 2018, but I can definitely see why people are loving it. It's a film that explores multiple genres at once and makes for a very enjoyable experience overall. I admittedly haven't seen the majority of Susanne Bier's work, which is mostly due to the fact that they're foreign movies that I have yet to seek out, but I have seen her previous American film in Serena, which was quite bad in my opinion, so Bird Box was a very nice surprise. I had a very good time with this film and I will absolutely be seeking out this director's previous works. I recommend a watching this on your free time, but it's not something demanding to be watched."

The movie is entertaining however the end could've had more action. The movie plays with our biggest fear which is fear of the unknown so that's what makes it good. You never see the demons/entity's at all so it's up to the viewer to use their own imagination. As far as the little details of how they survived for 5yrs or how they can walk through the woods with a blindfold on, how the electricity/water still works... does it really matter it's a Movie for our entertainment.

","It was dificult to rate it at first, and, as always, I tried to compare my opinion with other by reading some other coments.<br/><br/>I saw about, ""what did they want?"" ""Why could some people had no problems with watching the creatures?"" And then, those person rated badly the movie.
I mean, according to me all of that was answered, for example, people with mental disabilities were capable of seeing the creatures, etc. Etc. But behind that, a movie doesn't earn the right to be considered a good one because ""it answers all the questions"", on the contrary, it's great if it leaves you thinking and analyzing.
People is used to not-to-think, then when the watch something that doesn't have all the answers, the get frustrated.<br/><br/>Not touching themes about photography, direction or production in detail, I can surely conclude that besides what I've said before, Marjorie's, Tom's and Douglas performance was really good, and the point of being a story soooo simple with a good level of suspense, left me with a really good opinion about the movie."

","First of all, lets compromise about this is called Internet Movie Database and we're all reviewing the movies not 'novels'. Also let's make another deal with the ones who claim that 'an original addition to the genre' about that this movie is not promising anything sensational. (Whether if it based on a novel or not) Idea of a having banned of one of the sensory abilities and forming a thriller around this idea doesn't seem intentive to me. In other words, this movie is just another constrained attempt even tough the creators (of 'the movie') possibly sought an originality. ( I however don't think they had a stab at it in the first place unlike some of the rewievers' opinions)<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie can not get a 'D' in terms of logicalness either. No one ever try to mention the intractability of logic in a thriller/horror, before a movie intents to pull wievers into its world it has to carry the disquiet of reasonableness up to some point. Unluckily we can not see this fear in Bird Box. The mist (2007) for example (which carries many similarities with it in my opinion) was much more successful in order to reach the goal in terms of both originality and reasonableness in its own.<br/><br/>Above all, I don't even want to mention about dozens of cliches and easy-to-predict scenes which I'm tired of seeing.<br/><br/>In the end, unfortunately, let aside all the hype you hear, Bird Box is not more than a mediocre horror/thriller."

Sandra Bullock was good, not great. She also used too much make-up to try and make her look younger than her 54 years. The names of the 2 children were ridiculous and really no reason for it. For being blindfolded they certainly knew where they were going at all times, easily finding a convenient door to safety time and time again."

","The opening scenes lure you in, but it starts to drag a bit. Kind of a mix of ""Night of the Living Dead"" meets ""The Happening"". The saving grace is the acting. Sandra Bullock is great. Malcovich is Malcovich as usual. The others do ok. Not sure why they needed the blindfolds if they had the birds to warn them anyway? Wasn't that the whole premise and title of the movie?Seems like they could have taken a peek every now and then without a problem. Also the ending where she loses and finds the kids in the rapids of a river and again in a thick forest only to miraculously wind up on the very doorstep she was looking for is a little ""unbelievable""
It was enjoyable to watch however, just lower your expectations."

","Being a Netflix production, I did not have high expectations due to their track record for feature films. Luckily, I enjoyed it for the most part. I have read other reviews comparing it to ""The Quiet Place"" with similarities being that of the sensory, don't make a sound; don't look at anything.<br/><br/>Budgetary wise they are similar too, $17 million and $19.8 million for ""Bird Box"". I think the main difference would be in the casting, score, director, etc. Some familiar names were in the cast other than lead, Sandra Bullock. John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson, etc.<br/><br/>Comparsions aside, I enjoyed the simple storytelling in contrast with the ambiguious nature of the narrative. Not mind blowing, but watchable nevertheless."

","I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't find it to be like all the other end of the world type films (The Happening, Maze Runner etc.) in that it was rather creative. All of the acting was superb, the cinematography stunning, and I give props to all the actors for working blind. With that being said, I had trouble understanding why this movie was getting so much positive attention, and then has a poor review. In my personal opinion I believe the reviews come because of the end of the movie. I was all for it until they arrived at the compound. That just opened an entire can of questions in my end. Where do they get their food? How are they outside and not getting attacked? Why DO the birds know? Why did it take Rick five years to reach out over the radio to offer people a safe haven? Questions not answerable I suppose. I would recommend this movie as we did thoroughly enjoy it, though it made us sad in some parts, and puzzles in others."

even you are struggling .. DO NOT impact negatively ... you can cry, you can keep trying, you can also fail again but DO NOT spread negatives waves ...

","I enjoyed this film from start to finish, with some important exceptions which I will get to.<br/><br/>Bird box tells a compelling, interesting story in a well-paced manner. The film is driven by its characters, all well-written and masterfully portrayed by the cast. Their interactions are believable and add to the story for the most part, but the film gets bogged down in places with unnecessary and boring interactions, mostly artificial and bland romance scenes. MGK's character was surprisingly good, as well, for the limited time he is on screen.<br/><br/>I was worried there would be overuse of SFX, but they are used sparingly and only in meaningful ways throughout the film.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's character develops meaningfully throughout the film, and the most beautiful, well-written moments occur through the development of Mallory's relationship with her children.<br/><br/>Other reviews have complained of an unsatisfying ending and ""the logic of the film."" Without giving anything away, I found the ending satisfying. And you'd honestly have to look hard to pick apart the ""logic"" of this film."

Most of the horror is suggested and it really works. Thanks to Sandra Bullock's performances, you care for her character and worry all the time. The movie boasts appearances of interesting actors too such as B D Wong, John Malkovich, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and Sarah Paulson. They all have juicy parts to play, and I love every scene they are in.

"dalejennings-07005","5","1","3","29 December 2018"," A slightly above average thriller
","Bird box is worth a watch but is nothing to rave about. This movie is nothing new and at times quite predictable, you can see it's heavily influenced by the happening and a quiet place. Sandra Bullock carries this movie by giving an excellent performance with the material she was given. I think John Malkovich was kind of wasted in this movie, as he's an amazing actor but he's limited in what he had to work with.
This movie is advertised as a horror but there weren't any scary or jumpy scenes, it's more of a post apocalyptic thriller.<br/><br/>This movie would have been better off made into a tv series, as they could have developed characters/story a lot better and not skip into the future missing plot points. This movie had the weirdest plot with regards to disability, it was as if the people who have some form of mental illness could walk around outside with their eyes open killing people, wheel spinning around in cars and doing evil acts. Why???? Just because they're mental?????? It's never explained.<br/><br/>There's many plot holes in this movie like how Sandra bullocks love interest Tom is built like Arnold Schwarzenegger, with I'm guessing no access to gym equipment and living on limited food for 5 years. And also what are the chances the two women would give birth at exactly the same time?????<br/><br/>Bird box is worth a watch but nothing to get excited about. If you want to watch an amazing post apocalyptic thriller which is suspenseful, with great acting and story telling, then I'd recommend 'a quiet place'."

In Bird Box this doesn't happen, the characters act in a reasonable way, but the plot break it's own rules so people can die. All the deaths, and I said ALL OF THEN could be avoided if the script wasn't dumb.<br/><br/>This took me completely out of the movie a couple times, made me get a little bit uncomfortable even tho the theme and the tension were making me enjoy the experience.<br/><br/>I would recommend the movie, it's, like I said, pretty fun, but it's not a top grade horror."

","Even if it didn't come out in the same year as A QUIET PLACE, the similar, if to be fair, based on a prior book, Susanne Bier's BIRD BOX would still be a disappointing effort. Replacing sound with vision as the sensory device, BIRD BOX falls firmly in line with a long line of apocalyptic survivor tales, complete with the small isolated group of fellow 'survivors' who end up battling each other as much as the outside force.<br/><br/>The major issues here are less about familiarity and cliches (although there are plenty), but, with the movie's lack of forward momentum. The strict flashback structure actually lessens the impact, rather than enhances it (not to mention that it treats the audience as if they have to been spoonfed each and every detail). The cast is game, lead by Sandra Bullock, Trevante Rhodes and John Malkovich, but, it's an unsympathetic and uninteresting lot (Malkovich is the only one seemingly enjoying himself, even if he could do this one note role in his sleep). Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is serviceable, if undistinguished -- as is Salvatore Totino's lensing. BOX may have fewer overt gaping plot holes than QUIET, but on virtually every other count the Blunt-Krasinski film is superior.<br/><br/>BIRD BOX has a few effective moments and a couple of striking individual shots, but, it never adds up to much more than a humdrum addition to the end of the world filmmography; Certainly, nothing worthy of a project pairing a Director with a Best Foreign Film Oscar under her belt (IN A BETTER WORLD) with an Oscar winning actress (not to mention Malkovich)."

Would I recommend the film? Without a doubt."
"taka-loves-tokyo","4","1","3","29 December 2018"," Two major issues. We have a better movie to watch.
","I don't understand why some people think this is a good movie. Probably they don't use their brain while watching a movie. (Sorry)<br/><br/>One issue is in the first 15min. They start the movie with a scene of the three, the main character played by Sandra Bullock and two kids. Then the movie go back to five years ago, the time nothing has happened yet. Then, about eight people decide to hide in a house, including pregnant Sandra Bullock. So it's obvious that all other adults will be GONE. To explain this apparent thing, three-fourth of the movie time is used.<br/><br/>It's like that a movie ""mist"" starts with a scene in a car with four people. That movie didn't spoil itself like that. It seems so stupid. The composition doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>If people know this is a survival type movie, the ending is usually either survival or death. That being said, they wasted a large part of the movie by this awful layout of scenes, and nothing left to watch.<br/><br/>The second issue is its unexplained convention about the effect on people. Most people become suicidal, but some people don't go suicidal under the influence of the ""creature"". And those who can see the ""creature"" play a major role in this movie, but nothing explains what divides these two groups of people. Does it indicate that prisoners or ""bad people"" don't become suicidal? If so, that's a very outdated sense of sin and crime.<br/><br/>In short, the majority of the movie is wasted for already revealed plots, and the cheap ""happy"" ending doesn't ensure any safety against the creature and other people who don't go suicidal but kill others.<br/><br/>This movie wasted time of great actors and actresses, so don't waste your time as well by watching this movie."

I mean to be fair on non Netflix... it has actually been classed as a thriller. I guess the main thing that has ruined this for me is the way everyone less has acted on the internet. One of the main reason I'm selling point of this is because there is nothing on normal TV or no new films out to watch apart from this with very good actor in. Watch able... but, just watch the happening again at least you knew or had some idea what was happening with the beings that were attacking them and where the attacks were coming from and why they were happening.

"Ginsengjin","8","1","3","29 December 2018"," Entertaining movie especially if you're a fan of post apocalyptic/zombie genre
","I do agree with some of the critics saying that the movie was too long. They definitely could have trim down the run time in certain places but overall I was hooked to the screen to see what happens next. The biggest strength of this movie is Sandra Bullock whose performance was just as good as her role in Gravity. She portrayed the complexity and flaws of her character amazingly well although character development could have been a little better. The setup of Bird Box feels very similar to Dawn of the Dead by starting out with a group of survivors and it all feels familiar but originality of the premise adds enough suspense to keep the audience guessing and wondering what will happen next. The movie is certainly not perfect and the ending feels a little shallow but it has enough resolution to feel satisfied. I'd recommend it for its entertainment value."

Tom is a stereotypically honorable man in the group which I did not mind at all. Well played as well.
Sandra's character was phenomenal and complicated but almost shallow. You knew she meant well with her tough love.

","After seeing all of the hype on Instagram, I decided to watch this myself. A lot of the reviews were half ""I loved it!"" and half ""It was awful."" I actually think it was pretty good. It didn't take too too long to get to the action, and Sandra in this film is very into her character. In fact, I think everyone's acting was solid. Yes, the plot of an unseen force that makes people commit suicide is basically the same as The Happening (the author of the Bird Box novel was inspired by that film so that's why), but Bird Box has an added layer of terror since you can't rely on sight, probably the most important sense we have. Where it falls short, however, is the lack of explanation for most things and plot holes. I found myself asking why and how a lot so it was a bit unsatisfying in that regard. Other than that though it was a nice apocalyptic thriller and I'd recommend it to someone who likes the genre."

But there's no reason or explanation or context, which would be fine if the action or tension were sky high, but they're not. It's simply a film about a journey, that's not scary enough to be a horror, not action packed enough for an action movie, and not thought through enough for a sci-fi."
"bigalexk","7","1","3","27 December 2018"," A decent post-apocalyptic film...worth a view.
","I saw this last night on Netflix and I thought that it had some good moments. The scenes of mass suicides and people killing themselves in very graphic fashion though are a bit much and I wouldn't recommend this for young kids, it had lots of profanity also. Having seen A Quiet Place recently, I would say that the two films do have common elements like alien forces decimating and hunting the human population and young mothers struggling to survive with their children against all odds. At least in A Quiet Place, we get to see that the invaders are hideous, slimy, vicious looking creatures reminiscent of ALIEN but they can lured by sound and be killed with human weapons and that gives humanity hope in that film. In Bird Box, we never get to see what the invaders look like, they never directly harm humans, they make humans see with their own eyes their inner most fear and this drives them to kill themselves in the most horrific ways possible . This makes the creatures/invaders in Bird Box far more invincible and dangerous. Humanity has little hope of survival in that film...how can you kill something that you can kill you the instant you see it."
"james-allen72","7","1","3","27 December 2018"," Ya gotta show the monster!
","While ""Quiet Place"" committed the ultimate sin of fully disclosing the monster's appearance in the first couple minutes of the film, thereby nullifying the mystery and reducing the terror by a huge margin and I appreciated that ""Bird Box"" opted to swing the opposite direction in order to optimize that terror, the audience does demand SOME satisfaction-even if you leave it until the very last shot. We've GOT to see the monster! Bird Box NEVER shows it-not even once! The only ""glimpse"" we have of it is of what could be wind rustling wind in its' wake. We also get to see Gary's sketches of the monster. (spoiler warning) Gary presumably has seen the monster and is infatuated with its ""beauty"" and is compelled to sketch it-often. He pulls out his collection of sketches before starting a new one just prior to attempting to doom our band of survivors by pulling the parchment paper off of the windows and confining the bird/warning system to the freezer and urging everyone to ""look at it"" and show the newborn babies.<br/><br/>In the end, though it seems that ""Bird Box"" DOES show the TRUE monsters, which, incidentally, like ""The Walking Dead"", are merely humans. In ""Bird Box"", however, these humans have seen the monster, but instead of being compelled to commit suicide, they think that it is the most beautiful thing they have seen and are compelled to share the monsters' ""beauty"" with everyone else-forcefully, if need be. This started me thinking about the nature of these people, to be honest. Being secular, myself, their compulsion to share with everyone something which may in fact be fatal to them sort of reminded me of the way some religiously-devout followers go about trying to share ""The Good News"" or ""Show The Light"" to others they believe to ""need"" those experiences. I spent much of the movie wondering if the book hadn't actually been written as an analogy for religion-perhaps a specific one, and I began to look at the individual examples and to think about how they might relate to something I've seen in real life. Lydia, who opens her doors (borders) to someone who needs help (a refugee) is killed by the monster and John Malkovich's character is deeply resentful because of this. We can understand why, but it really did remind me of the scenario we had when, as a nation, we were debating among ourselves about whether to help Syrian refugees and the consequences we could potentially face as a result. The Main hero, Tom, is a soldier who has done a tour of duty in Afghanistan, so it's easy to see who the Author views as his heroes. Don't get me wrong: I am in no-way implying that our veterans are NOT heroes: I'm only trying to solidify my case that my suspicion is that the author of the book/screenplay is deeply Conservative and that this was actually written as an analogy for religion-my guess being Islam, in particular.<br/><br/>As soon as I finished watching the movie, I hit the 'Net, looking for anything to confirm my suspicions, but could find nothing about the author's political views or any mention about the book being meant as a veiled warning against Muslims or refugees. As far as I know, this review is the first publicly-voiced suspicion linking these things together and I'm curious to see if anyone agrees with me."

Her presence was one of the few things that makes Bird Box a better movie than the average one.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you like movies like Blindness (2008), Los últimos días (2013) or e.g. Quiet Place you will like this one too. And honestly, I don't care who is a copy cat of whom (there seem some discussion here) - I am already satisfied and glad if I get served something of some originality in our modern times cursed by pre- and sequels, reboots and rereboots and whatever director's superfinal cut...<br/><br/>Not the most original plot, but a well made flick for the aficionado of post-apocalyptic movies with some decent ideas. Watch, and don't bother with all those rate 1 and 2 reviews."
"tribbles-56744","5","1","3","25 December 2018"," Interesting concept but ultimately fell flat
","I usually don't watch Netflix originals and Bird Box is a good example as to why. I watched the trailer and it looked really interesting but overall, it was lazily written. It feels like it was so close to getting to a really interesting concept when it just ended. The idea of something making people want to kill themselves isn't a new concept. It was done (also poorly) in ""The Happening"". I was thinking that maybe seeing how bad the aformentioned movie was, Netflix would improve on the concept. I was wrong. I do hope someone does this concept well, though. It's a really cool concept. I gave 5 stars for Sandra Bullock's always amazing acting. That woman is a powerhouse."

","The faces of the kids. Sandra's intensity. All were extraordinary! I found myself getting stressed out and had to turn the movie off, then come back later. I've never done that with a horror/thriller movie before! A very good watch!"
"bozley423","6","1","3","25 December 2018"," An Unfortunate Release Date: BirdBox
","This movie is 'A Quiet Place' but Sandra Bullock can't see. MGK should have added some bars about his role in this film as part of his Eminem diss track.<br/><br/>It probably would have been received better if it had been released further apart from 'A Quiet Place'. This movie has too many characters, who are underdeveloped and irrelevant. You know from the start that only Bulloxk and two kids will be there at the end. There is no reason to get attached to anyone else except perhaps the other pregnant woman.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock delivers (haha coz she has a baby) the performance we have come to expect of her, everyone else is okay too."
"siggyr","6","1","3","25 December 2018"," If it wasn't for Sandra Bullock........
",".....it would be a pretty dreary film. Bullock lends her class to this movie, if not a little bit strained to keep it credible.
Yes, there are a whole lot of unanswered questions (what caused all this? what happened to the community at the end? how come some people survived and others didn't?). Yes, Malkovich does his standard bad-guy overacting routine. Yes the movie goes on for about 30 mins more than it needs to. Yes, some of the scenes are a bit too much to take seriously (driving to a mall / walking through a forest / rowing down a river, all blindfolded....really...??) And yes, this movie bears a strong resemblance to A Quiet Place and other similar apocalyptic movies.
I watched it with my two 20-something year old daughters, we all looked at each other at the end of the movie with that WTF look. Some of the scenes were scary, other parts gave us a bit of a chuckle, others were just flat out laughable.
I love most movies Sandra Bullock appears in. Can't help feeling that without her, it would have been a dreary night in front of the telly. I don't think she'll be putting this one on her Resume somehow......"
"alex-799-908199","6","1","3","25 December 2018"," A lot left to be desired
","So this film pretty much feels like a reboot of the 2008 ""The Happening"". Something in the air causes people to go suicidal. Not saying bird box was a original idea but it did have some ok scenes here and there<br/><br/>What didn't get me entertained was when these killings would happen, they would be in bulk and short. Then mostly back and forth trying the story closer and closer. Think watching the happening I'm seeing too much of it in this film to say its anything but a lack luster and shear waste of time.<br/><br/>Tiny things did bug me during the film but nothing to note down that caused it to ruin it for me."

","***spoiler alert***<br/><br/>This uninteresting and unsurprising over extended movie is basically Sandra Bullock's role as a would be and eventually mother to two kids named boy and girl.<br/><br/>It's a gritty, bare knuckle survival of the swiftest, most prepared in an apocalyptic / post-apocolyptic scenario (switches back and forth between then 5 years ago and now).<br/><br/>Despite a few cliffhanger moments that quickly plateau, this is way too long to not have an interesting or thilling ending.<br/><br/>Even M Night Shyamalan shows a bit of skin in his flicks, where this one leaves everything to the imagination - like Cloverfield, which does this concept incredibly well."

","I thought this movie would be a ripoff of The Quiet Place and plus with Sandra Bullock how could it be anything but commercialized fluff? However, the movie has an interesting and new concept, at least the concept isn't a total ripoff of anything that comes to mind right away. A few small plot points seemed like plot holes or not thinking it through on the part of the writers but overall this is a fun watch."
"bekahlargent","8","1","3","24 December 2018"," Well done movie
","I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews for Bird Box; maybe it's because people are jaded nowadays and wanting guts and gore out of their scary movies. I personally think this movie is a great one. The acting was excellent with Sandra Bullock, of course, stealing the show. Bird Box was tense, thrilling, and yes, even scary. But it was also touching and tear-jerking. 8/10 would see again!"

","Full of plot holes, unclear character motivations, rules that don't make sense, then rules that get broken... rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>Nothing makes sense in this movie. Characters act in ways that would indicate that they understand whats happening, even when we know they should have no idea what's happening.<br/><br/>Rules are arbitrary, like monsters can't go in houses or any buildings? Blankets are the best weapon next to blindfolds? You have to see them, until suddenly they can speak now? They can be seen indirectly through cctv?<br/><br/>Whether it's depression or fear, or whatever, the crap writing trumps whatever symbolism/metaphor they were trying to make."
"donjohnson-dj","8","1","3","24 December 2018"," Dont listen to the haters. A solid apocalypse film.
","Firstly...as I have read many reviews by others on IMDB, I am amazed by how they either didn't actually watch the film or expect every question to be answered. I believe it was Stephen King who's said (I'm paraphrasing) ""Why does the audience have to know where the monster came from? The protagonist has no idea, why should the reader be omniscient?""
Is it so difficult to enjoy a film for what it gives you? Must every question have a nearly packaged answer gift wrapped for you? Is your imagination so limited and stunted that it is impossible for you to access it?
As several reviewers complained, "" why are some people not affected?"" If you paid attention, the unaffected are either insane or blind. If you are dying for an answer to the why, at the beginning a hypothesis is presented. It could very well be the why you are looking for..
The cast is fantastic. I would have loved the Malkovich character to have had more screen time. Sandra Bullock is solid and does a wonderful job of conveying fear even with half her face covered during the more tense moments of the film.
Give the film a go, dont expect the answers to be given to you. If you were fighting for survival, I think you would be more concerned with living other than, ""Boy, I wish I knew the origins of these creatures trying to kill me!"""

I hate children in movies because they are annoying but I felt extremely sorry for her during the river scenes where she knew she was meant to probably sacrifice herself, it was amazing acting for such a child. Even the scene with Tom when Malorie doesn't let him finish the story. Both kids were adorable."
"danren121","6","1","3","23 December 2018"," The ending, not so good
","A mass epidemic of some kind breaks out whereby a nebulous entity is manifest in the air which effects people's behaviour dramatically when they look at it; unless you are inside a house or a building with the blinds down in which case the malevolent entity cannot reach you. Still there? Yeah don't know if the film's producers were when the premise was read out. They were probably as bothered about the plot as John Malkovich appears to be about his wife who gets into a burning car, he has a moan for a few minutes and then moves on. When the children end up in the tumultuous rapids one is safely deposited on the shore the other a rock. As the lawyer in South Park exclaims to a bemused Jury, 'that does not make any sense!' The films ending is what didn't quite stick. It just doesn't really add up. Where do they get their food, what is it supposed to be? A utopia? And what's with the bird in the box? So the birds get flappy when danger approaches, so why go to the school?"

It would have been amazing to get a real glimpse as to what the characters see when they but it does set the viewer up to use their imagination and that does add some suspense.

"Mehki_Girl","7","1","3","23 December 2018"," Some questions answered ****spoilers****
","This is my opinion. I didn't read the book, but plan to do so. Just want to give my opinion about what some people would call plotholes or impossible happenings.<br/><br/>The creatures - we do get to see them. In the drawings.<br/><br/>What were the creatures' motivation and where did they come from? - a possible explanation was given early in the film by one character - aliens, demons, from another dimension, god, end times. If they were evil, then they caused destruction because its what evil creatures do.<br/><br/>Survivors - Like anything and everything, some people are immune. Now I'm guessing, mentally ill people with distorted thinking simply weren't driven to destruction and saw it as beautiful. Of course whether or not that was the reason for their ""immunity"", they certainly were highly disturbed afterward.<br/><br/>Getting around - blind people get around everyday. They go to work. Pursue hobbies. Go downtown unaided. Raise kids. Cook meals. Ride public transportation. Put on makeup. I know of a completely blind boy (look it up) who lost his eyes to cancer, who not only played video games, but rode a bike and skateboarded. This kid could go on a walk and correctly identify objects large and small. He had a very, very heightened sense of echolocation. Scientists wanted to study his technique to teach it to others. He's since died when the cancer returned. You can see him on YouTube<br/><br/>So one can't say what's impossible to to unsighted. The character had five years of practice. She was highly motivated and there was at least one scene of her training the children how to listen to determine their whereabouts based on sound.<br/><br/>Kids in the water - Its possible that their tiny bodies were tossed around onto the shore and a rock. Why not?<br/><br/>This is SciFi slash horror film and they always require a suspension of disbelief."

"matthewgaines-42787","8","1","3","23 December 2018"," An unwhelming ending is the only flaw...
","The ending did not do this film justice. It wasn't necessarily disappointing. It simply leaves you with unanswered questions. Although that may have been the point, it would have been nice to get a few answers to LARGE questions that arise throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Developing Sandra Bullocks character as to why she is so extreme with her emotional distance would have helped better understand her. Elaborating on the conflict as to why this large epidemic came to pass. Why the ""creatures"" effect people the way they do (although I don't see them as creatures, myself). Those are just a couple of the outlying questions that come mind.<br/><br/>However, Bullock's acting was very well done. Actually for the most part, all of the acting was very well done. The story line was strong. Kept you wondering.<br/><br/>Just a few answers to some of those questions would have strengthened this film for me.<br/><br/>If the acting wasn't as strong as is was, for me, I would have given this movie a 6."

I was initially expecting it to be the usual end of the world story line, with few lucky survivors, and whilst high level that is what it was, the way the story was told was suspenseful, and always kept me on edge. The interplay between the present and past was great, as was the main characters unique take on motherhood. Definitely recommend it to others."

"doubtitall","9","1","3","23 December 2018"," I'm generally skeptical about horror movies with children in them.
","The writers usually give kids unbelievable dialog and/or they aren't really up for the task, but no one wants to be too critical of their performance so you can't know beforehand. In Bird Box they were very young.<br/><br/>In this movie the kids don't have very many lines. Mostly they're just getting lectured at by Bullock as she tries to warn them to keep them safe, but I was more than pleasantly surprised with the result. I don't know if it was more the writing or their acting (especially the girl), but for me they were both totally believable, and it made my heart ache for them.<br/><br/>Their roles were only a small part of the total movie, but central to the development of the main character.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed Bird Box a great deal.

","I thought it was really well done. The story is gripping enough from beginning to end and music by Trent Reznor really led to a darker theme.<br/><br/>I thought it was much more mysterious than A Quiet Place, and a lot less irritating.<br/><br/>People seem to have a problem when a movie isn't in your face, but the real problem that we have is that we have lost our ability to use our imagination. As soon as a film shows what is terrorizing us - the movie immediately loses its bleakness, its mystery and its watchability. We don't NEED to see what the terror is - imagine it yourself. What you could conjure up in your mind would be way better than anything Hollywood can feed you anyway. I would hope.<br/><br/>While the plausibility of how people are getting around without being able to open their eyes is really a difficult hurdle for viewers to get over.....just do that. Get over it.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock was exceptional. Paulson wasn't in it enough. Malkovich was perfect. Even the child actors held their own.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly suprised from this, a Netflix original. Ignore some of the plausibility and Bird Box is actually a fantastically intense and dark end of days movie!"

The fact she insisted on shooting this blindfolded shows through as it adds reality to her performance.

","All of the Netflix promotion for Bird Box was a curiosity for me as I get accustomed to hype I associate with movie theatre releases. It was cool to be able to settle down in front of my own television for what was presented to me as a movie theatre experience. The movie itself is rocker recliner worthy, thanks in large measure to Sandra Bulloch. I find her entertaining to watch in whatever she does - I just like her presence and this movie was among the best to showcase the gritty dispassionate persona she excels at portraying. John Malkovich was mildly irritating owing to being the stereotypical malcontent character but that was the only drawback for me. In terms of the storyline, it doesn't hold up at all under second sober thought, but by then the movie is over, I'm off to bed, and most importantly, I've had my entertainment fix."

"eric_wever","7","1","3","22 December 2018"," Good movie, but not enough suspence
","This movie on Netflix made me very curious. I saw the trailer and I saw its potential. However, after 2 hours it seemed that not much happend. The movie is fast paced but the ending is rather unsatisfying. Nevertheless I give the movie 7.2 . Why? Because the acting is very nice. Sandra Bullock did an outstanding job as a no nonsense mother who's only goal is to keep the children alive without telling them any lies. Because of the cutback scenes you can easily predict who stays alive and who doesnt. So that takes away some guessing. However, the creatures are never shown on screen but rather some wind whistling and leaves which are blown upwards. Some hints are given because of some drawings and they supposed to look terrifying. Once people see the creatures their eyes change and they either kill themselves or become groupies. The movie has a lot of similarities form the movie The Mist. People who are determined and make good decisions, Others bail out and make a run for it or others just become bait. A positive thing about this movie is that it doesn't tell you how the creatures appear, it still becomes a mystery and the focus on the movie is all about the survival of the kids and Marjorie which gives the movie credits. However, there could be some more exciting scenes with narrow escapes. The movie cuts too many corners like, how did they survive for 5 years all of a sudden? Was there enough food? Medicine, water, electricity etc etc. And why did they trust the guy on the walky talky so quick? Didnt the groupies get to them by now? Maybe I am just thinking to much but this movie could be a lot better. I still say you can watch it as it is much better than a lot of other crappy Netflix movies around."

"carlosgustavobl","6","1","3","22 December 2018"," ""The Happening,"" only a little bit better
","While the plotlines between these two movies are similar, what really draws me to make this comparison is the gigantic build-up and the lack of payoff at the end. Once again, nothing is explained, it was just something that ""happened.""<br/><br/>This movie made a much better job in keeping it's audience hooked than M. Night Shyamalan's film. It has a very good use of non-linear time, using it as a tool to fuel the viewer's interest by constantly using the technique of showing effect before cause. This is what made the movie worth watching, along with very good acting from all characters.<br/><br/>The thing is, the main plot is never really concluded. There is a constant reference to this ""object"" that people see and makes them want to commit suicide. It has a shadow, it moves, and your car's proximity sensors can detect it. I sat through the whole movie anxiously waiting to see what it was. From what I saw, I understand that it was like a ball of wind or something. Might be a personal preference thing, but I expect a more exciting finale, showing very explicitly what the thing was, diving into the perspective of the people that it affected. Instead what we get is a run of the mill happy ending, with a pretty underwhelming twist."

","This movie will always be compared to ""A Quiet Place"" and it holds it's own. They both are great for different reasons and yes, some will say that this is a rip off but it's not. Don't get me wrong this is not a flawless movie but within the first 10 minutes I was invested in the world. Its no jaw-dropping beginning like ""A Quiet Place"" but comes close, with a subtle soundtrack that works SO WELL with this film. Some characters do suffer from stereotypes but the dialogue felt real, and it was enjoyable to watch several well-known actors come to grip with the threat outside. A major complaint that most people probably have is the fact that (spoiler) you never see the creatures. Yeah it kind of sucks but I have never felt so threatened by creatures you can't see. I personally think that its better that we never see them as it lets you focus on the influence that they have on people. The fear, desperation and insanity all in one. Its a good movie that had a lot off potential but sadly loses its steam by the third act."

The forest start whispering her name. All excitement was gone, it became a regular boring horror movie. I tried so hard to forget that the forest was talking or whoever it was doing the whispering. Too bad, I really would have like to give this movie ten stars, but this took away all excitement."

","Typical Netflix production. Just because the movie has good actors it does not automatically makes the movie good. This movie makes little sense and can not deserve such good reviews based on Bullock and the short appearance of Paulson. There are to many things that are not logical or reasonable. Time they spend on the river for example, in the car they are driving forward using the parking sensors and so on. Nah this was hyped in the Trailer but does not deliver"

","Any movie that has me crying at the end is fairly rare but this one managed to do just that. This was an amazing cast, Sandra Bullock is PHENOMENAL, there's no other word. It was intense, yes the plot bounced around a bit but with the flashbacks I don't think there was any other way. It was heartbreaking seeing the characters die one by one and most of all Tom and to see him fighting it. The scene where they are in the rapids blind folded and when she's trying to follow the birds to find the community and the entity is chasing her, I can't imagine how hard that must have been to film. Sandra deserves another Oscar and the kids were pretty amazing too. I highly recommend, it's a nail bitter and tear jerker all in one!"

Why were they able to, why did they so desperately want other to see what they have seen?<br/><br/>Other than the above mentioned I feel the acting was rather good, and again not the worst movie, but I won't be watching it again in a hurry."

","Bird Box will give you a proper suspense that will make you hold your breath. It also has great acting, very good actors, good cinematography, and quality music.

I know this is fiction, but post-apocalyptic fiction is supposed to be fiction only up to the cause and driver of the post-apocalyptic event. The reactions and limitations of the characters still have to be realistic. Some things that the characters do in Bird Box are not supposed to happen if this fictional scenario actually took place IRL. The title is also pretty lame since the bird box has very little to do with the plot.<br/><br/>Watch this only if you're pretty bored or you've run out of thrillers to watch."

The other actors do their best with limited screen time to help the story move to present moment.

Unlike A quiet place with these ""aliens"" you can scream, shout, act pretty much normal inside any structure, dance, sing, stumble around...just keep your eyes closed. They can read minds and make you see what they want you to see so that you kill yourself, but only if you see them. hahahahaha. If they can only be seen I'm struggling to understand the physical aspects including mimicry that we're exposed to later in the movie where we learn you apparently can outrun them...even though you are blindfolded. Basically they bit off more than they could chew and couldnt make this make sense.<br/><br/>Casting was pretty terrible. Bullock the 54 year old first time Mom?

","I thought this film was amazing-all around. Acting, story, cinematography and pace were all on point. Even though this story is unfolded out of chronological order, I still found it to be quite gripping. It. May not be super original but the way of telling the story was. It builds to a proper climax and I feel it did have some resolution. Those saying it left too many things unknown were distracted or not fully tuned in. This film also takes a unique way to bring attention to mental health and suicide, not in a profound but more of an artistic representation of what could happen the longer these topics are hushed or swept under the rug. These things surface no matter how quiet they are kept and the longer these issues are ignored the worse our problems become. I would not call this a horror film, but I won't hate on anyone who does. Thriller/Suspense are definitely more accurate as my heart was racing several times. Beyond that I had sad tears and happy tears. Not many films can bring you all of those things in one. Definitely worth watching. If you are into putting yourself into the plight of the characters and experiencing it with them, this is a wild journey."
"p-40267","8","1","4","22 January 2020"," In a world where you can't open your eyes, isn't a blindfold all you could ever hope for?
","What a roller coaster of emotion fit into a 2-hour movie. Bird Box is a tearjerker, action-packed movie from 2018, based on the novel written by Josh Malerman, directed by Susanne Bier, and the screenplay was written by Eric Heisserer. In the opening scene, we are shown an ominous shot that depicts an empty river with a baleful male voice-over. How dreary can a shot be? But it is just what this film needed to set the tone for what is to come.
The idea behind this post-apocalyptic movie is mysterious. We don't know what is behind these gruesome suicides. All we know is that if you see it, you die. Those who survived must now avoid looking outside at all costs. Sandra Bullock plays the role of brassy, passive-aggressive and not to mention, pregnant Malorie Hayes who finds herself amid this worldwide apocalypse. After witnessing horrendous and brutal deaths, she is picked up by a group of other survivors. Supporting role, Treyvante Rhodes who takes on the undervalued and underwritten character Tom does an astounding job carrying the somewhat splotchy plot with Bullock though he was given little screen time. After months of scavenging for food and surviving the deaths of their fellow survivors, there's only four left; Tom, Malorie, Boy, and Girl.
Susanne Bier undoubtedly capitalizes on the use of flashbacks within the entirety of the movie to bring together a beautiful montage of peace and action. Bier flips between the beginning of the apocalypse and nearly 5 years into it until the flashbacks catch up to the current time. Within these flashbacks, we are given insight into the horrors of this invisible killer while being brought forward to Malorie, Boy and Girl's dangerous journey along the river on their way to solitude. These flashbacks help us understand how they got to the river in the first place. I appreciate how well incorporated these flashbacks are, but I do believe if you decide to watch this movie with no context about it prior, you would be very lost.
Bullock is forced to make some heart-wrenching life or death decisions which truly unveils the strength behind her character. Sandra Bullock has played similar family revolving roles like in the movie The Blind Side, and other thrillers including Premonition. I truly believe that Bullock's role in Bird Box has been her best since The Blind Side. In The Blind Side, she takes on the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy, a southern mother who took on one of the most remarkable tasks one can imagine, raising not one but three kids. Bullock in this role won multiple awards: Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, Academy Award for Best Actress, and many more. Although Sandra herself didn't win an award for Bird Box, the movie did win MTV Movie Award for Most Frightened Performance.
Bier touches on the idea that 'if you don't look it won't affect you' which I correlate with mental health and the divide between those who struggle and those who do not. I think this subtle theme is brilliantly brought to light throughout the movie. In particular, during the birth of Malorie and Olympias children, a strange man who was reluctantly allowed into the house the day before has looked outside at what is killing everyone and thinks it is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. This man, Gary, who is played by Tom Hollander is deemed insane because what is making everyone so sad to the point of suicide, he sees beauty in.
All around from special effects, screenplay to acting, the film does an impeccable job.Somehow through this fictional movie full of gore and death, Susanne Bier still finds a way to touch our emotions and truly make us feel a strong connection to the characters were introduced to. For these reasons I decided to rate the movie Bird Box a 4/5."
"matejsuvada","9","1","4","21 January 2020"," Very good movie
","One of the best films that I have seen recently is Bird Box, an apocalyptic horror film directed by Susanne Bier and starring Sandra Bullock, one of my favourite actors. It is based on a novel by Josh Malerman. However, it received mixed reviews from the critics, and my siblings weren't impressed by it, so I wans't sure if I'd enjoy it. However, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.
The plot of Bird Box is that people see something horrific and then immediately commit suicide. The film tells the story of Malorie Hayes, a woman who is first seen sternly exhorting two young children, a girl and a boy, never to remove their blindfolds. The only way to stay safe is not to see at all. They need to reach the community, a former school for blind, because only there they can be safe. After long and scary journey, they finally reach the community.
The pace of the film is frantic and the action is non-stop. In general, the acting is excellent and Sandra Bullock in particular gives a great performance. Some critics were of the opinion that the story was predictable and silly, but I think they are missing the point.
To sum up, Bird Box isn't just thought-provoking movie, it's also very scientific. The film has you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I would certainly recommend it to anybody looking for a thrilling and scary horror film."

Bullock is 54, not 30, and the work she has had done on her face ends up making her look odd - like so many aging movie stars. I guess it's a catch 22: stars, especially (but not only) women, need to ""look young"" to get parts, but having plastic surgery takes away from their faces the lines & marks of aging that give their faces character & allow them to be expressive."

"bankofmarquis","7","1","4","1 February 2019"," Almost a good film
","One of my favorite films of 2018 is A QUIET PLACE where aliens with extreme hearing can get you if you make a noise. It is a quite interesting and well made film (with a bravura performance by Emily Blunt), so when I heard there was a variant of this theme (this time you can't use your eyes), I decided to check it out and to see if Sandra Bullock could pull off the same sort of bravura performance as Blunt.<br/><br/>And, that's too bad, for by comparison the Netflix flick BIRD BOX is no A QUIET PLACE, but if I don't try to compare it to A QUIET PLACE, BIRD BOX is a very entertaining film, indeed.<br/><br/>The story follows Bullock as Malorie a pregnant single woman who holds no ""maternal instinct"" towards her unborn child. Malorie is devoid of emotion and compassion and is dreading the day that her child will be born. Enter into this an ""end of world event"" where unseen aliens show up and, if you look at them, you go insane and try to commit suicide. Amidst this chaos, Malorie and a ragtag assortment of survivors find shelter in the house of Douglas (John Malkovich). Can this disparate group of strangers find a way to survive in this insane new world?<br/><br/>Well...the fun in this kind of movie is in the characters trapped together and the ""10 Little Indians"" style of demise as the house guests are picked off one by one by the aliens (or each other). It is the drama of these trapped individuals, and the surprise and the ingenuity of how they are killed off that makes or breaks these types of films.<br/><br/>And in this way, this film succeeds very well for besides Bullock and Malkovich, the housemates are filled with (for the most part) a strong grouping of actors led, most notably, by Trevante Rhodes (MOONLIGHT) and Jacki Weaver (ANIMAL KINGDOM). They are strong presences in this household and are interesting to watch. Good ol' B.D. Wong (JURASSIC PARK among many, many credits) brings his usual, solid game and Lil Rey Howery (GET OUT) brings much needed energy and humor to the proceedings. Add to this the usual, creepy Tom Hollander (IN THE LOOP) as a mysterious houseguest who is...creepy...and there is enough going on to keep my interest.<br/><br/>Add to this the always intriguing work of Malkovich as the paranoid, ""me first"" homeowner and Bullock underplaying her emotions as a counterbalance to Malkovich overplaying his emotions and the scenes in the house were interesting and (at times) gripping.<br/><br/>The problem I have with this film is that it inter cuts these scenes with scenes of Bullock (and a few other survivors from the house) ""5 years later"" - so, you already know who makes it and who doesn't - which takes away the tension of the house scenes. It also has an ending that, quite frankly, I saw coming a mile off and so it was not a satisfying conclusion to the proceedings for the ending was uneventful and unsurprising. A poor way to end this sort of film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the scenes in the house of the initial group of survivors is well worth viewing this film, I just wish Director Susanne Bier (THE NIGHT MANAGER) didn't dilute these scenes by bringing us forward in time too soon. I wonder how much better this film could have been had we just watched the events of the film (including all of the ""5 years later scenes"") in chronological order, I gotta think it would have been a better film.<br/><br/>This is, by every definition of the term, a ""B"" film, perfect for a snow, rain or cold-bound afternoon at home.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

"raptorshark","5","1","4","13 January 2019"," ""The Happening"" with better acting & more plotholes
","(possibly considered minor spoilers)<br/><br/>
A lot of people are comparing this movie to ""A Quiet Place"", the main thing they have in common is the characters can't use one of their senses to survive from a danger (vision in Bird Box as opposed sound in A Quiet Place); the overall plot and danger in the 2 movies starts out similar but the movies take different directions. It doesn't matter if Bird Box is based on a book that was written before A Quiet Place, this is a movie review site not a which script came first originally debate site. A Quiet Place beat Bird Box in terms of film release date so of course people are going to compare it to A Quiet Place.
Regardless, when I watched Bird Box I was immediately reminded of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"", so I watched it right afterward. The two movies are extremely similar (without the not using vision aspect). Bird Box has better acting in my opinion, but in The Happening the ending is much more realistic and the movie as a whole is a lot more freaky. I disliked the ending in Bird Box, but I enjoyed the movie and I would recommend it, but definitely check out The Happening, I feel it did a better job overall of telling a similar story. Bird Box uses the ""character take a risky journey to a supposed safe haven"" trope that is used in so many zombie movies (28 days later). The movie is nothing new but it's worth checking out, I'm loving these Netflix original movies raising the bar on quality"

","This movie had an interesting concept and it's probably a shame that this movie came out the same year as A Quiet Place.

For example, just focusing on the part in the house, or the part on the river/in the woods."

The interesting thing is this entity obviously has an evil intelligence and so chooses to converts some people to its evil ends. I wasn't sold on the whole movie, I don't think it hung together as well the recent Last Boy which had a similar lethal entity but was done much better.

","""Bird Box"" tells the story of a mother who has to save her two children by blindly leading them to a safe space after a mysterious force makes people lose their mind and kill themselves through eye-contact.<br/><br/>I honestly don't get why this is such a big hit. It is, to be fair, absolutely not my genre but I really find this movie a bit lazy. Not only is it hard to emphasize with a woman so harsh even under the given conditions but more important, major parts of the plot never actually get explained. Throughout all of the scrren time people are being terrorized and killed by a force that stays totally anonymous until the end. There isn't even the slightest try to explain what's behinf it or what happened. I'm not a big fan of demons and evil spirits but it's even worse when nobody even tries to make sense of it. Otherwise the plot is okay, it doesn't have huge lengths but neither does it have true peaks.<br/><br/>All in all I'm maybe not the best person reviewing this film regarding my personal taste but I do think that it is fair to expect a bit more than is delivered by this movie. I've heard that it's supposed to be some kind of allegory to the parent-child relations nowaday, which is something, but I think I would have prefered a different approach."

However there is rumors of a safe haven, ya know she's just gotta ride down a raging river blindfolded with two kids for roughly a two day journey, but its cool. Now that I really think about it... The Office fans: remember when Pam accidentally rents 28 Days Later, the zombie movie, thinking that it was 28 Days with Sandra Bullock. This is that imagined movie.

"themodernholmes","5","1","4","7 January 2019"," Don't watch! I repeat, don't watch! (I'm being serious).
","Okay, you probably want to see this movie because all the world is kinda talking about it these days and you're just too curious to ignore the temptation to know what is it about and how does the word ""birdbox"" come in.
Let me answer it all, but first, have you seen The Happening (2008)?
If your answer is yes, then let me tell you that people in this film are subjected to ""things"" with the same degree of ambiguity that doesn't ""unfold"" or get explained anywhere in the movie. The only difference is that in The Happening (2008), people are subjected to the danger by hearing, while here, it is by seeing, hence the blindfolding you see in the poster and some memes in social media. One other difference between the two movies is that in the one time people are trying to figure out the source of the danger, they say it is a poisonous air that comes out if specific plants in The Happening (2008), and they say it is some ""creatures"" in this film. Everything else is still ambiguous. The ending is also so not worth waiting for two goddamn hours.
Oh, I remembered, what if your answer is no? Well, now you must have understood what the general theme in these two movies is. Trust me, we who watched don't understand much more. Only that there are people desperately trying to escape this danger.
Now, why ""birdbox""?? Well, at some point in the movie, they find out that some birds in a store are reacting to the danger in the air, so they decide to keep the birds as a guide to help them sense the danger when they are blindfolded. And when the protagonist (Sandra Bullock) take her two kids in a survival journey, all blindfolded, she puts these few birds in a wooden box to take it in the journey as a guide. That's all. This is why the movie's named ""Birdbox"".
Why am I warning you from seeing the movie?
Because it is a waste of time and an insult to our intelligence and a boredom, among other things.
Still curious? You better see The Happening (2008) instead. It is shorter, less dark, and the best if all - it has Zooey Deschanel."

Perhaps if you like Romance, SciFi or Horror this is not your kind of movie but no, you cannot have Bird Box"
"fxdx4","9","1","4","7 January 2019"," Top ""End of the World"" movie out there
","Back in 2008 when M. Night Shyamalan put out The Happening, he was laughed out of Hollywood. The plot of that film is a mysterious 'happening' left largely unexplained forces millions to kill themselves and it examines the survivors.<br/><br/>Well, 10 years later there is a wave of these films. A Quiet Place and Netflix own This Is How It Ends are just two examples. The film is, of course, so much more about the characters and survival than about the cause of the end of the world, and that can be frustrating as we are often left without answers.<br/><br/>Enter Bird Box. This is the best version of this type of film I have seen. Netflix has constantly improved their original content, and the cast is a powerhouse here. Unlike USA Production's The Purge which boast such household names as Reed Diamond and Lee Tergesen, Bird Box collects Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich. In fact, just about every name in the credits is recognizable!<br/><br/>Bullock - in my favorite role of hers ever - is a single pregnant artist returning from the doctor when suddenly people start to kill themselves. In fact, anyone who sees the outside world ends up killing themselves. The film then bounces between the end of the world as it happens, and a present day where Bullock must attempt a river journey for the hopes of survival. Both plots are engaging and suspenseful.<br/><br/>The flaws are there, but they can't be avoided. There are unexplained side plots, relationships that are not flushed out, and the obligatory obviously stupid choices made by characters. However, all these flaws are minor compared to the general quality of the film. The characters are believable, and relatable.<br/><br/>I want more of an explanation, which of course there isn't much of, but that is not the point. This is about people and is micro, not macro. There are some other plot points which could easily have been left out all together, but again these don't ruin the film.<br/><br/>With a focus on drama and theme, and off of action and plot the film does hit a speed bump here and there, but it's not enough to take any of the paint off this work of art!"
"Madcour","7","1","4","7 January 2019"," Human Nature
","I think this movie is about lonliness. It's the monster we face. It comes and goes with no warrnings. People kill themselves with no obvious reason. They just see it and they are gone. Exxept of cource for those who enjoy watching it. These people are the people who saw the truth about the world the people who got hurt and suffered alot. They want you to see that lonliness isn't that bad it won't hurt you. UNLESS you rejected it because of the way you were raised. Your parents raised you to be part of the society, to be with people and to fight your negative thoughts and feelings they never tell you ti accept it. So most of the society isn't immune against lonliness. So people can't handle it they just commit suicide.
The ebding was fast but i could see that people didn't actually win this battle. They are just running away in a shelter trying to build their tiny society with the same ideallogy."

","Reel Nerd Reviews: Bird Box
Directed by Susanne Bier
Starring: Sandra Bullock, Trevante Rhodes, John Malkovich
I finally checked out the Netflix sensation that is Bird Box starring Sandra Bullock. This movie is Stephen King's The Mist meets The Walking Dead meets The Evil Dead with a sprinkle of The X-Files tossed in for good measure. In fact there was an episode of The X-Files with a very similar plot but on a much smaller scale localized to South Central LA. It was about an entity or presence that visually took the form of what you fear and much like in the film Bird Box you never see what the ""monster"" looks like or where it comes from.
I really liked this film though it did drag a bit for me in the beginning. Some force is clouding the minds of people causing most but not all people to kill themselves in the most gruesome way. Others become possessed by this force and make it their mission to make sure others open their eyes to the beauty of whatever this unseen force is.
Through circumstance and happenstance Bullock's character who is a reluctant mother to be ends up in a house full of strangers after all hell breaks loose in her hometown. This home is populated by a ragtag group among them a wannabe cop, the home's owner played by B.D. Wong, a kindly elderly woman, a grocery store clerk, a construction worker, another pregnant woman and a punk rocker dude and a MAGA inspired character played by the scene chewing John Malkovich.
One by one the numbers in the household dwindle down as the days pass by through a series of unfortunate circumstances. Flash forward five years later and Mallorie must undertake a perilous journey to safety with her son and a little girl she made a promise to look after. The scenes where she and her kids are attempting to flee to safety were more of interest to me than the scenes in the home where some of the interactions between the housemates seemed somewhat formulaic and was stretched out too long. They probably could have trimmed the house scenes a bit to make the storytelling a bit tighter.
There is a love affair that blossoms between Bullock and another survivor from the house Tom (Trevante Rhodes). I really loved the Tom character as he serves as the moral center of the film. He is a beacon of light for Bullock's character and perhaps due to his military background cannot seem to turn his back on strangers in need seeking assistance or asylum.
His character is a stark contrast to Mallorie as she deals with the crisis in a much more dour and somber way. She is angry and paranoid and does not see the point in entertaining fantasies that life can get any better or that beauty and light can still perhaps exist in the world. She is very harsh on the children because she cares about them and wants to give them the tools and the know how to survive in this new and dangerous reality.
Bird Box is a good movie if a bit long. Some parts could have been trimmed to help the story flow a bit better. I think they spent too much time in the house which is where for me at least the film dragged at times. I would recommend that you check out this film and see what the fuss is all about for yourself."

"The_Foiler","8","1","4","5 January 2019"," I have theories on what the entities are.
","Bird Box review by The Foiler<br/><br/>3 Stars, out of 4, is my official rating. (I typically don't do 5-stars or 10-stars basis, unless it's necessary)<br/><br/>Let me get this hot item out of the way first, before I get to my review:<br/><br/>I like originality. So yes, I get it that people are criticizing it for ripping off ""A Quiet Place"" and ""The Happening."" But if you look at it another way, most top-tier movies have taken ideas from other movies. The critically-acclaimed Star Wars 1977 was not 100% original. The opening crawl was taken from the 1930s Flash Gordon TV show's opening intro. The giant boulder that chased Indy in the greatest action-adventure film in history, Raiders of the Lost Ark, came from the 1950s Duck Tales comic strip, in which a similar boulder chased Uncle Scrooge after taking a golden idol. The face-melting scene at the end of Raiders was also taken from the ending of 1955's Kiss Me Deadly. I can go on and on. So, I wouldn't write off Bird Box's premise just because people think it's a rip off.<br/><br/>Now on to my review. What I think these entities are.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT
I've always wondered why these extremely powerful beings cannot break inside homes, but they are deadly outside. I think it has to do with the open sky. Inside your home, there is no open sky, right?
So, what is present in the open sky?<br/><br/>Satellites!<br/><br/>Theory 1: It's a man-made entity that was weaponized by a warring nation, whether it is China or Russia. Heck, it could be the States. It's a bio-chemical compound that was released into the atmosphere, and it gets its energy when a signal from the ground is sent up to the satellites, and then beamed down to give these chemicals the needed energy. Once it receives the energy, it becomes potent. In other words, when you look at it, it affects the retina, and then affects the part of the brain that triggers suicide.<br/><br/>Theory 2: It is not man-made. It is alien in nature. But like Theory 1, it still needs open sky in order to trigger the entities' potency. A signal is sent from outer space that gives energy to the entity, but this signal cannot penetrate solid objects. It could only penetrate through air molecules and the vacuum of space. Which is why you are safe inside your home.<br/><br/>Theory 3: Nothing to do with open sky. These are just creatures that are so weak that they cannot break through doors. But if you are outside with them, they have the power to destroy you.<br/><br/>Think of pit bulls. Say, there are 10 hungry pit bulls outside your house. And you are outside with them. These animals will maul you to death. But if you're inside your home, you can have a thousand pit bulls outside, and they won't be able to break in to your house.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a nice film. Great acting by Bullock and Malkovich. Good pacing: it was suspenseful throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>Reviewed by The Foiler, on 4 January 2019

","I'm taken aback, having watched this brilliant movie, to come onto this site to find I'm in a significant minority of people who actually rated this film highly. I'd read the book, which I suspect now is an advantage because I wasn't expecting things such as explanation of the ""monsters"", let alone visuals of them, or resolution of certain plot lines. The genius of the novel is that the protagonists are thrown into an apocalyptic situation that escalates too quickly for anyone to ""take charge"", ""save the day"", or ""come up with explanations"". Things are what they are and the few people left alive cope as well as they can or they die. The movie brilliantly captures this sense of unknowing. The whole point of the story is that you don't/can't see the monsters. I spent the entire novel and movie wondering if I'd have the self-control not to look... The temptation must have been overwhelming.
Perhaps some of the negative reviews came from viewers who thought this was a horror film--it's not. It's an intense psychological thriller with little gore and fewer jump scares.
Perhaps this is one film where I'd suggest reading the book first rather than the other way around?
Highly recommended."

"warplord","7","1","4","4 January 2019"," Pretty decent, but a few loose ends and unanswered questions
","This is generally a pretty good horror/thriller movie, especially considering it's coming from Netflix. The overall plot was pretty intriguing and you wanted to know more of what happened. My problems are that some questions were just not answered. People do complain about why some people are not affected in suicidal tendencies by the blindfold and instead try to make others see this entity, but I think it was explained subtly. It was mentioned that people from some asylum acted this way, and that criminal Fishwhatever his name is, AND Gary (i think they tried to explain he was a dark and maybe slightly on the not completely sane side with his dark drawings and all) was also affected in this strange way. That's showing that those with darker and/or insane tendencies sort of embrace this will to die and instead of being scared, they pass it on to others. Now what i find annoying are the things that were abruptly left off. Like what happened to the two that just stole the car and drove off? I would be happier if we saw them later, either dead, helping Malorie, or in the refugee camp. And what even is this entity? That Charlie guy kind of explained what it was but I still felt that the explaination was rushed and a little corny. Also, WHY did the entity show you things thag made you want to die? It never truly explained where it came from or why it was doing this. And the idea of birds protecting everyone from the entity was just a little strange. But my biggest annoyance was the way ending; it felt really rushed, kind of abrupt, and felt unfinished. When it ended I felt that feeling of, I could have gotten just a few more minutes explaining the end like come on. I would give this movie a 6.5 if I could but it's closer to 7 than 6. I'll prob release a non spoiler review later but this is my honest opinion"

It shouldn't have really gone over 2 hours in my opinion as most scenes were dragged on. It also wasn't the horror I was expecting; some scenes had suspense which was a good addition. Even though the actions of the new character in the house were extremely predictable, all of the characters each had their own identity and it showed how people would normally react during a crazy outbreak such as this one. It was also awesome seeing the older Lennie from Of Mice and Men :) Sandra Bullock was great and the kids actually stole the show. I would say if a new Bird Box is being thought of, please make it shorter. I must say the end of the movie is a wonderful surprise. I would recommend a watch."

","I wanted to hate the movie. Without thinking, I said to myself immediately upon hearing the premise, ""Ripoff from 'A Quiet Place.'"" Not only was that factually incorrect, as the book was written before ""A Quiet Place,"" but the movement of the story line was also different. There were some similarities though, and the similarities were the shortcomings of both. Both had glaring inconsistencies that others have pointed out, and impossibilities that had to be ignored. However, neither movie was ruined by these problems. It is a horror fantasy movie and to enjoy it you have to suspend belief quite a bit. Many good horror/fantasy movies require this. If you are capable of doing that, then you can enjoy the movie. I liked it."

","From the low reviews I've seen here, it seems apparent that some folks can't appreciate a movie unless everything is spelled out for them and neatly tied up with a red bow at the end.<br/><br/>Bird Box has good pacing and a subtle, driving score composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The combination of those along with my wonder of what exactly was going on kept me completely captivated for the first 30 minutes until viewers learned a little more. Then you spend the next 90 minutes wondering if anyone will make it. If you're a fan of The Shining, A Quiet Place, Hereditary, Black Mirror, or Dark (a German series on Netflix), you might enjoy this, too."

"beachcomba","4","1","4","2 January 2019"," mvmike...Bird Box IS a rip-off!!!
","This review is for mvmike and anyone else that thinks this movie is not a rip-off. There is a movie from 2011 called The Darkest Hour that at best could be called a prequel to Bird Box. It is about a random group of people in Moscow that must work together to escape an invisible alien invasion that takes over and kills any living thing through electrical systems (i.e. light bulbs and such) which is how they determine the proximity of said invisible creatures. What makes The Darkest Hour better (although not by much) than Bird Box is that the aliens are indiscriminate in who they kill and leave no questions about their motive. The aliens in Bird Box only effect sighted humans, driving them to suicide while leaving a small percentage of them alive, insane and driven to spread their madness. And why? To what end? Why do only some kill them selves and others fall into madness? And no revelation or resolution of how to thwart this threat. I'm all about leaving a movie's ending to the imagination of the viewers but there's not enough information for this viewer to work with."

Acting phenomenal. Directing really good. Production good too<br/><br/>But there is a problem. You either make this kind of story with details of what happened, how, and make sure there aren't that many plotholes.
OR
You forget about that, trust the audience to forget that and put the emphasis on the drama/philosophical point of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie had the chance at one particular point, of making an interesting discussion worthy move. A move Hollywood wouldn't make, and it would've made sense with the characters and situation. It would've made this movie more ""artistic"", raising questions about humanity and whatnots.<br/><br/>And they said: NOPE, WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.<br/><br/>So what there is left is what we see. A too long, Sci-Fi, well acted, horror (barely) movie, without the care to details to make it better than average."

"meisler","8","1","4","1 January 2019"," A phoenix in its own right
","I see alot of reviews rating low because of 'loose ends', 'unanswered questions', 'what's up with the entities??' etc.<br/><br/>It must be the same people that rates Lost low (you know the old TV-show that had 1000 unanswered questions, a very underwhelming ending, and basically epitomized J.J. Abram's mysterybox for good and bad). The same people who passively want the creator's vision/message to be punched in their face leaving no doubt what it's about.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this is any masterpiece, but I was left with a feeling of a world was created. A world I wanted to know more about and explore. That aversive irritation/craving of wanting to close the knowledge gaps does not exist if you're unengaged with a movie, it's usually intensified when you feel engaged with the characters, story and world. You care. And I cared when I watched this, sure I also want to know more, but that irritation must be because there was a right balance of curiosity - alot was given but alot was also left for imagination. If all my questions was answered I would have forgotten the movie by now like another binge-consumption.<br/><br/>Mystery and curiosity exist here and I feel like they could make a whole tvshow. I really want to know more about these entities - who are they, what's their goal and why, and how would you fight them or live in a conditional space like this.<br/><br/>So yes a movie who is able to balance all these things deserve some credit. I know Bier also had some parenting messages she wanted to convey, but when I look at the movie as an ""abstract"" apocalyptic horror genre, she did a really good job. Answering some questions and leave others out for imagination.<br/><br/>A phoenix in its own right.<br/><br/>Thanks Bier."

"juliankennedy23","5","1","4","1 January 2019"," What's Happening
","Bird Box: 5 out of 10: Sandra Bullock stars as a recently pregnant woman who with her sister find themselves in the midst of a worldwide catastrophe as seeing something causes most people to become suicidal and a few to become homicidal. So it's blindfolds for everyone for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The Good: I like Sandra Bullock, Heck everyone likes Sandra Bullock. She could do almost anything and people would still like her. (Cough marry an actual Nazi cough) I want to like this movie. There are some good bits in the film. The film is very well made and shot. The first half an hour of the film is very gripping and exciting. Like the Dawn of the Dead remake that opening bit carries a lot of goodwill throughout the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, like most dinner parties, as soon as John Malkovich shows up things start to go downhill.<br/><br/>The Bad: This is not John Malkovich's fault mind you. He is fine. He is, of course, playing himself. After all, it was his character that wanted to know why they just don't stay in the grocery store. This is supposed to make him the bad guy mind you but let's get real. In the event of some sort of apocalypse, your local Costco or Walmart are awfully good choices. Easy to defend, endless food supply and heck Walmart has shotguns and ammo. Malkovich is playing that most frustrating of characters, the bad guy that is clearly right.<br/><br/>The latter scenes simply seemed unbelievable to me. I am just not buying it. That was, in essence, the problem. The movie failed to get me to buy into the against all odd scenario and wasn't otherwise entertaining enough that I didn't care.<br/><br/>The Ugly: This movie is clearly supposed to be an allegory about Bullock's character being accidentally pregnant. Now for starters, Bullock is a strange choice to play this character. It is a bit unbelievable she wouldn't be at least a bit maternal and it is a bit more than unbelievable she could become accidentally pregnant. The allegory is clearly there somewhere but it never really coalesces.<br/><br/>And without the allegory working and with an oh come on second half you basically are left with a remake of that notorious 2008 Mark Wahlberg bomb The Happening. Now I confess I have never actually seen The Happening and I admit I am curious how it compares to this movie. I am a sucker for unknown force causes people to kill themselves or others films. Whether it is the excellent 28 Days films or the considerably less excellent Steven King's Maximum Overdrive I am there with popcorn in hand. This film seemed to be on the right track but it drifted horribly off course.<br/><br/>In conclusion: It is a well made film. Unfortunately, it is a well-made film about a woman wearing a blindfold hiding from leaves blown in the wind. I can't help but think if they went a more Lovecraftian route with the horror they would have been better off. To see such a horror will drive most men mad so avert your eyes is a lot more appealing than that grass nearby is swaying in the breeze so the invisible whatever is nearby. My wife liked the film more than I did and I have a feeling some people will buy in hook line and sinker. I, unfortunately, was not one of them."

I mean they used a thread to know where they are going and that car would tell them if there was anything in their way while driving.

"FilmWriter569","8","1","4","29 December 2018"," READY TO CATCH THE SYMBOLISM? ...THE VERY POINT OF THIS MOVIE IS PROVEN BY REVIEWERS WHO DON'T GET IT
","I read where this is turning into a smash hit as Netflix's largest download in the shortest time ---breaking streaming records, they're saying. Netflix's ""Bird Box"" with Sandra Bullock. This movie makes you think.. That's what I like about it.<br/><br/>After watching it, I definitely recommend it ---heck, I think they should show it to high school classes to teach our youth about how to prioritize what is important in life and how a society should protect itself from its own progressions. It reminds me a lot like ""The Lottery"" by Shirley Jackson (1948) a short story that a lot of us were taught to read in high school ---how it opens of your eyes to humanity, how society behaves and what society does to itself without being aware of it. I especially recommend watching this movie with your significant other, as it will make you appreciate your loved ones, while thinking about humanity, where we're headed based on what we prioritize as important in life: Family, resisting those things that disconnect us. etc.. There is tons of symbolism in this movie.. especially with the sounds of birds, etc.. It's a psycho thriller (bloody and rated R) but with a VERY deep meaning behind it.<br/><br/>To truly get the most out of it (and this is not giving away any spoilers here ---no more than what the synopsis summarizes) watch it with the idea of this: There are clues in the movie of humanity feeling ""disconnected."" Look for them. Think about what forces are causing this (I have my idea of what it is, do you?) and the multitude of problems with humanity that are on the rise from that disconnect, whether it be from a lack of family structure, or anything else you might guess. Think about what entities are there in our society that are so easily-influential on the masses? Think about what is causing a rise in things like psychotic behavior, suicides, loneliness. Think about what evil has the power to influence by merely making you look at it ...so as to try to influence you do so more ...where it acts to amplifies one's fears, create deeper sadness for that person, and then, ultimately, it influences one to destroy their own life in the process. Think of anything like this that is destroying humanity at alarming rates. Then imagine this thing being an actual, physical, more-obvious antagonist in this film, that, instead of slowly, literally causes people to kill themselves instantly in this film, just by looking at it.<br/><br/>Now figure it out for yourself.. What is the evil demon in this movie?<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

The romance almost right from the start seems off, without reason, at the berge of how bad the things were in the beginning it's crazy to believe they survive 6 years without bigger complications and the movie cut off all that, it was not one year, 6 years, that's a life time."

"businessasusual-90644","8","1","4","28 December 2018"," The hidden meaning and biblical foreshadowing
","Sooo I believe that this movie is portraying the rapture or the day that God comes back to take those that were faithful and leave the rest. So the darkness is sin (I think we could all agree) looking at it or playing with it will kill you. *side note in the Bible it says that the wages of sin are death... you also might notice that the darkness takes on different forms, symbolizing that sin is viewed equally and that no sin is greater than the next. There were also people in the movie that were not affected by looking at the darkness in the movie.... this is a symbol of the antichrist, they were the devils keepers or temptations telling you that sin was okay... ""just look at me it's okay"".... next the blindfolds those symbolize faith God says walk not by sight but by faith.... next the string that symbolizes the path to God or the Bible, if you follow it you will be lead on the right path to heaven. And then lastly the school for the blind, it is the lords house or a symbol of heaven, notice it's for the blind, this who walked by faith not by sight trusting in God. I believe that the school was strategically placed at the end of the movie to show the end of the rapture to show that they were now safe to play and be happy because they had followed the path to God. It was long hard and scary at times. It was hard for them not to take off their blindfolds and question Gods purpose, but they stayed true. That is why they made it. And if you remember the part where ""girl"" wandered from the boat and she was pulled back in... I believe it is symbolic of no mater how far we stray from the path god will pull us out of everything because he is the giver and taker of happiness and pain. No matter how dirty she was after bing pulled through the mud she was instantly embraced with open arms. God will do the same. She also kept her faith because she kept her blind fold on. God will always lead you on to the right path"

","Thanks to the screenplay by Eric Heisserer, that made the movie watchable. Stretching over a span of two hours in some parts the movie feels like its never getting over. This is due to the fact that there's no revelation about the root cause of the disaster also the story really slows down at some points during the time span. Sandra Bullock is one of the attractions of the movie when it comes to sheer performances, and she does really holds her ground.

","""Bird box"", the post-apocalyptic movie that gained notoriety after the great marketing done by netflix upon its name, but then, did all this marketing make sense? No, ""Bird Box"" did not have to be a cult movie with great acting, fantastic technique and admirable script, it just had to be a charismatic brockbuster, but neither of the two things the long directed by the already experienced Susanne Bier succeeds, is all bad and not horrible as the great criticism has been labeling it in recent weeks, it's just an ordinary movie. The way the script works is very interesting, if using several timelines to close a cohesive story, with beginning middle and end, this is good, but the same boldness applied in the structure could have been applied in the script itself, which is very watery with sugar, with poorly developed characters, superficial plot, lack of chemistry, bad rhythm ... A complete roller coaster, the movie improves and worsens constantly, again praising its script structure and the only good and complex development of the film, Malorie's relationship with the two children, something that is more maternal instinct than proper love. This is very good in the movie. Obviously, the violence contained in the book was diminished in the film, even by being on netflix, but more things were lost, as the various symbologies involving depression, maternity, suffering, hope, all this becomes superficial in the film and surrendered to an action secondly, the personification of the creatures is also medium, could be worse if they had a form, but symbolize their presence with wind, and to show that to the viewer kills the tension, it should be something more animalistic as it is in the book, where the they are symbolized with heavy steps. Although the film has a great deal of tension, not necessarily for the creatures, but for the agony of not seeing and for the crazy people who are well used in the film, mentally weak human beings who are passionate about the visualization of the divine or the monstrosity. A palette of gray colors, open and closed plans, good makeup and weak soundtrack sum up the technique of the long. Sandra Bullock is tough and well in her role, Trevante Rhodes also, although together, there is no chemistry, for me, the best character in the film is John Malkovich Douglas, who steals the scene whenever he appears and ends up serving as a crutch for the development of the protagonist. ""Bird box"" in the end is a film that has caught too much of the criticism and of all, but much has forgotten its good narrative structure and some other high points, nothing much, but it is a good movie."
"tburns-08406","5","1","4","27 December 2018"," Great Cast & Acting; Lacks Substance
","I watched it last night with high hopes after all the reviews I had seen. Great cast and acting, but so much was missing for me. I would love to see this as maybe a series, where more details could be added, but it felt like the movie started in the middle. I don't feel like any of the characters had enough development or back story, and then they just stopped filming. There was really no ending, just ""this looks like a good place to shut down production."" Too many things never came together to make it a cohesive story for me. I don't care that you never saw whatever it was, I get how that makes it more of a psychological thriller and an fine with that, but I feel like there has to be at least some explanation...the closest you got were the drawings, but some stories from the outside or just some sort of information would have helped."
"spisc1955","3","1","4","27 December 2018"," This is a copy cat movie!!!

"laxx-99162","8","1","4","27 December 2018"," Doesn't dissapoint and ia worth the time.
","Ive watched a lot of garbage horror movies and this IS NOT one of them! Throughout the movie it has solid flashbacks and cuts into time, you dont get lost throughout it or is there any long scenes that are used to pad the run time. It doesnt ride so much on the fact that there are jumpscares or something scary lurking, it uses the fact that your senses are disabled and can no longer be utilized. Yes, 'A Quiet Place' did use this method and so did 'Dont Breath' so for those that say it is a ripoff or a spinoff of the movie clearly doesn't realize that it is a genre at this point. Also for the critics saying there are loose ends like 'what did the creatures want?' Or 'where did they come from?' Clearly missed the part where subtle dialogue was used at the beginning saying ""its the end game man... Humanity has been judged, and we've been found wanting."" Lucy says, ""judged? By who?"" Tom replies ""they go by different names."" He then continues to say that they are demons and show up all around the world in mythology and lore, also they threw in (which i thought was clever going back through). That pregnant women often saw their children as ""lobsters or spiders"" (Charlie).<br/><br/>So it explains its a demon that is judging humanity, the movie isnt a sci-fi movie so they arent going to do lab experiments and they obviously cant defeat it due to the fact they can't use their senses. Then a critique I saw a lot was 'why are some people immune to it and dont kill themselves?' Well the force is obviously smart enough to: 1, make itself visible on camera so it can kill through any visible options, and 2, I guess you could say 'possess' them so it can kill anyone who doesn't look at it. Now yes some of the things have stupid quirks that shouldn't have happened and should have been cut. Overall a great watch, its a thriller that has a new concept with gorgeous cinematography, makeup, soundtrack, and sets, and I suggest it for anyone looking to kick back and watch a movie on a weekend night. (Also bird box was a novel written in 2014 so 'dont breath' and 'a quiet place' could have used that easily for an idea)."
"MoistMovies","4","1","4","27 December 2018"," Mediocre
","Yep... Not much more to say.
Easily a 5/10 to straight down the middle, but i was a little bit more entertained than a 5 in some parts. So i'll be generous. Don't expect much going in and you'll get about the same satisfaction i got from this film. I felt like every scene minus the river parts, i'd seen done in other films made within the last 10-15 years.. Far from original and not overly refreshing..

"joshlogiudice","4","1","4","27 December 2018"," A movie for the new generation
","This isn't a terrible movie, it has a few decent aspects, as in the cinematography and a lot of the acting is pretty okay, especially Sandra Bullock. This movie has its fair share of problems however. To be honest going into this movie I was expecting another ""a quiet place"" which surprisingly this movie is nothing like, but still has a lot of the same problems. For example, where did these ""monsters"" come from? I understand movies are not supposed to spoon feed you everything which I enjoy, but they should give you some content to form theories on your own. In this movie, the ""monsters"" are just there one day and movie watchers nowadays don't bother to think about that stuff, just what is going on screen. Another problem is, how did anyone get anywhere in this movie without being able to see. Unless you were born blind, being able to suddenly not see wouldn't be that easy. We're supposed to expect a woman and her two children walked through a forest to a boat on the lake and then rode the boat without being able to see anything? Doesn't make sense. Why are some of the people who see these ""monsters"" turned into more of a cult rather than suicide? I like to think it's because they are already crazy and seeing these ""monsters"" just enhance that, but that's just my guess considering we're not given any information. A movie should have a good balance of telling you what's going on, and giving you clues to figure out what's going on and this movie doesn't do too much of either. There were a few characters I didn't care for and a lot of dumb decisions made. not the worst movie, but not much replay ability"

"vfcman","9","1","4","27 December 2018"," Very well executed movie
","This movie was very well portrayed. It had many foreshadows that allowed us to predict what will happen later on in the film, and allow us to prepare ourselves for the ending.
For starters, the apocalypse was by some-type of pathogen. With no known origin. But Charlie gave us his point of view which should be enough to allow us to believe its some type of religious ending.
Then the three birds, we saw that from the begging of the movie only 3 people were left. Then when the select few were at the grocery store, Marolie saved 3 birds. This showed that the her, her kid, and her adopted daughter will survivor till the end. The birds also allowed us to realize that they are unaffected by the pathogen, only humans are. So, when the pathogen evolved to control a select few to allow it to infect more people the birds want to leave the area and go crazy, allowing the human around them to be cautious.
The blind school makes sense, now it's survival of the fittest. Since the pathogen can only be transferred through sight, all blind people are immune.
The movie did an amazing job by taking please in the present time or the movie then during flashbacks throughout the whole movie to understand what she is currently going through and thinking at the time. Her emotions ultimately is what saves them at the end.
Having her name the kids at the end is also very meaningful. She never wanted kids from the start. So, in an apocalypse world she couldn't get attach to the kids so named them boy and girl. So if they died she would not care as much. But when she meet the Dr. at the end who was her Dr. during the pregnancy it showed she was safe and she was ready to be a mom, and thus naming the kids."

","This movie cleanly moved from the normal to the post apocalyptic situation that the survivors faced. They quickly determined how to survive but to actually survive was extremely difficult. I feel that Sandra Bullock played a strong character who faced her own social issues but managed to collaborate with strangers to move the story forward. The storyline gave us a lot of situations that dealt with trust, loss, danger and betrayal. I have not read the book but I suspect that role of the birds was watered down a bit for the movie.

I found this movie to be intense, not really a scary horror, but I felt connected with the characters and cared what happened to them. This kept me on the edge of my seat through the movie. The connection was the result of story being shown from the perspective of Malorie, we don't ever see the entities and we know about them as much as she does. Movie does not explain on everything and we are left with open questions. The acting was on high level, including/especially children.

"mark-long2008","7","1","4","25 December 2018"," Honest review
","First, Sandra Bullock is appealing in what she is in. Just a great actress that is easy to relate to. As usual, she does a great job and runs the spectrum from vulnerable to strong as the movie goes on. Really, all the actors did great, there just wasn't a lot of character development for most of them and perhaps it wasn't needed, as the story is really centered around Sandra's character. It is a little strange, to say the least, but it doesn't really take away from the movie. Personally, I would have liked a little more transparency as to what exactly was causing the apocalyptic type of behavior, but that is also part of the movie, that it is kind of left up to our imagination. Definitely worth a watch, but not the type of movie I would see multiple times."

"Hajimoto0625","9","1","4","25 December 2018"," Disregard the early bad reviews, this is a good movie!
","I waited patiently for this to be available on Netflix. And when it did, I started to see bad reviews on here. After watching the movie, I just don't get it. I guess some reviewers like to find fault with everything. But I think that while it is important to post a bad review when a movie is deserving of it, and thus sparing others from wasting their time on it, I think it is equally important to let people know when a movie is good. Bird Box is very good. Not great, but very good.<br/><br/>Bird Box falls into the genre of films like 'The Happening', and 'A Quiet Place', but it is not a ripoff of either. In fact, the book was written before 'A Quiet Place'. The movie gets going pretty quickly and pulls you in, and then keeps you there. Some observations then...<br/><br/>THE STORY: Like all movies like this, there are some small things that might be a bit of a stretch. But this is a fictional story, so those things are not a problem. They help make it better. The story jumps back and forth between the present, where Sandra Bullock's character is trying to transport two small children down a river with all of them blindfolded, and the past, which tells how everything got to where it is. Basically, there was some kind of force which came to Earth and when people looked at it it caused them to see their greatest fears, sadness, and loss. This then caused them to go mad and commit suicide. The only people exempt where those that were already insane, as it didn't bother them and actually made them happy (brilliant if you think about it). It bounced back and forth like this pretty seamlessly, so it worked very well. They did a much better job with this than the makers of 'Annihilation', which was an absolute mess. By the end, everything was tied up nicely, all questions were answered, and there were no holes left in the story. They never really explain what this force that was wiping out the population, but that was done on purpose and added to the suspense of the story. It also helped you connect with the characters, as you understood how they felt not knowing what this thing was. All in all, the story was excellent.<br/><br/>THE ACTING: Top-notch all around. Bullock, John Malkovich, BD Wong, Sarah Paulson, Trevante Rhodes...great cast, great acting. Also, the 2 young children were not annoying, which was a nice change (unlike the kids in 'Extinction'...OMG).<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY AND EFFECTS: The effects were very good. Watching Sarah Paulson step in front of a fast moving 18 wheeler is a scene that sticks with you, as is the scene where a woman calmly switches from perfectly fine to mad within seconds, suddenly talking to her dead mother as she calmly gets into the driver's seat of a burning car, catches on fire (without making a sound) and then blows up with the rest of the car. Eerie as hell! The rest of the film work is beautiful, especially the scenes on the river.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that it is a little too long. If it were shortened by about 20 minutes it would be perfect.<br/><br/>Disregard the early negative reviews. Bird Box is a very good, edge of your seat, scifi/horror type movie that is well worth the time you will spend watching itwith elevated blood pressure and sweaty palms...lol<br/><br/>I give it a 9!"

The ""side"" characters all seem fairly cliche and predictable in their actions, and the whole thing has a very usual post-apocalyptic shtick - TV reports, ""but it's not where we live yet, oh now it is"", vague radio updates, etc. It's not necessarily anything that hasn't been done before, but it creates some fairly tense scenes and overall has strong performances from the cast.<br/><br/>So if were like me and find yourself a bit turned off from it... all I have to say is let the pride go a little and let the film play.

Their fear was my fear. Their moments of victory were victories for me as well.

","Bullock and 2 young children set off down a river to sanctuary, blindfolded, because you'll commit suicide if you see the dark malevolent force that has infected the planet.<br/><br/>Swapping between the river trip and how it all started 5 years ago, this is a really tense and sometimes almost unbearably hard to watch chiller. The force is never explained or seen - definitely for the better - but remains a frightening presence throughout. The cast are terrific, but Bullock is something else, delivering a stonking performance which not since Sigourney Weaver as Ripley has so well combined vulnerability and toughness.

","Bottom Line: This is not a fast-paced action horror, but a methodical and deliberate character drama that is worth the watch if you are willing to follow the process of a character working through her internal conflict.<br/><br/>Although this is definitely a horror/thriller, I think some of the negative reviewers were expecting an action horror/thriller. That's not this movie. We don't get the backstory about the ""monsters"" because the movie isn't about them.
The theme of the movie is introduced in one of the very first scenes: this movie is about people's ability/inability to connect with one another. Every single character represents some aspect of that theme, some degree of connection. John Malkovich represents the self-centered a-holes who don't even want to connect with other people. On the other end are the ones who seek out connection with others even when their efforts are rebuffed. But they aren't cookie cutter characters either. The conflict created by the ""monsters"" forces all the characters to examine themselves and decide what kind of people they are.
The central focus is ultimately Sandra Bullock's character (Mallory) struggling with figuring out where she fits on that spectrum. The true conflict of the movie is Mallory's internal conflict. And without spoiling anything, the ending does give you an answer to that conflict.
Sure there are some unrealistic things in this movie. I don't understand why people would expect it to be any more realistic than, say, Jack Ryan, which is laughably unrealistic (but which I still enjoyed). But the actors were all pretty solid (even John Malkovich whose ""acting"" is usually abominable), lighting and direction were very good especially for this genre, and there were definitely some tense moments, even when I knew what was going to happen.
The real star, though, was the little girl. My goodness her ability to convey complex emotions just through facial expressions was absolutely incredible!"

","""Bird Box"" is a Sci-Fi - Horror movie in which we watch a woman with her two children trying to survive after the wake of an unknown global terror. They have to leave their place and go to refuge in order to have more chances of survival. If they don't see these forces they will be fine and from now on they have to make their journey blindly, it will be a very difficult and exhausting journey and they all know about it.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations or hopes for this movie but after watching I have to say that it was very good and I liked it. I liked this movie very much not only because it had an interesting plot but because it had a very clever idea of having a deadly force that you don't have to see, something that made this movie even more interesting. I also liked the interpretation of Sandra Bullock who played as Malorie and for one more time, she was just amazing. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were John Malkovich's who played as Douglas and Trevante Rhodes who played as Tom. Regarding the direction which was made by Susanne Bier, I believe that it was simply outstanding and I especially enjoyed the fact that Malorie (Sandra Bullock's character) evolved as time was passing and it was obvious how much she changed from the beginning of the movie to its end.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I have to say that ""Bird Box"" is a great movie to watch, it has an interesting plot with many good scenes that will grip you, some interpretations that you will find very interesting and you will have the feeling that you are there with them. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much."

"ericrnolan","Null","1","4","21 December 2018"," A short review of ""Bird Box"" (2018)
","Netflix' ""Bird Box"" generally pleases - I'd rate it an 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a creative and effective apocalyptic horror film. A few reviewers call it a ""high-concept"" horror movie because of its MacGuffin - an invasion of otherworldly beings causes anyone who looks at them to hallucinate and become suicidally depressed. (A handful of survivors escape the chaotic mass suicides because they are lucky enough not to lay eyes on the mysterious, mind-bending creatures which can become images of their victims' worst fears.)<br/><br/>It's a hell of a setup - it reminds many people of this year's ""A Quiet Place"" and 2008's unfairly maligned ""The Happening."" (Hey, I really liked that movie.) For some reason, ""Bird Box"" reminded me of the 1985 ""The Twilight Zone"" episode, ""Need to Know."" (It's a great ep.) And the plot device pays off - ""Bird Box"" is genuinely unsettling, and the whole story comes across as a blackly inventive end-of-the-world tale.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is good here; supporting actors Sarah Paulson and John Malkovich are even better. (Malkovich is mesmerizing whenever he plays an intense or unpleasant character.)<br/><br/>The film suffers somewhat from puzzling pacing problems - sometimes the story appears to be unfolding too quickly, but by the end of the two-hour movie, it feels too long. ""Bird Box"" was adapted from a structured 2014 novel by Josh Malerman; I strongly get the sense that it tries to squeeze too much of its source material into a the running time for a movie. I honestly think I would have enjoyed it much more if its frightening plot device and interesting, well-played characters were explored in a mini-series.<br/><br/>There's another disappointment too - we learn very little about the story's antagonists, beyond one character's hypothesis that they're archetypal punishing figures from a number of the world's religions. I wanted to know more."

I believe this story does much much better as a novel than it does as a film. With the novel, you obviously must imagine every little detail described ...and I felt it was much more effective than when it's a picture pained for you, with a film.<br/><br/>Also, I wanted to say, many seem confused as to if the creatures are actual physical monsters or something ...more mind based? The book makes it VERY clear that yes, there are actual flesh and blood monsters.<br/><br/>I think the film is actually closer to a 5-6 on IMDb, however as many horror buffs know, anything above a 4.5 (sometimes even a 4) is actually not that bad for a horror film. Mainly due to the stigma of horror not being on the artistic level of say a drama.

"d-73341-15739","8","1","5","16 January 2019"," The Thriller That Will Make You Fly Higher Than a Bird Out Of Your Seat
","Based on Josh Malerman's novel, Bird Box is a new Netflix original film. The apocalyptic film is extremely creative and thrilling.
The movie opens with intense music leading to a woman yelling at two small children. This woman, we later discover, is named Malorie (played by Sandra Bullock). The film than jumps back 5 years in time, when pregnant Malorie and her sister are off to a doctors appointment. When leaving the doctors, the world suddenly changes. Creatures we don't know anything about start destroying the human race. If one looks at this creature, their eyes suddenly become red and glossy and they will begin killing themselves with any nearby object. Unfortunately, this happens to Malories sister.
While people are dying left and right, the streets are blowing up with fire, the audience can hear gunshots and people are running around, bleeding, trying to save themselves. The realistic special effects and the gory details help draw the audience deeper into the film and making the mass suicide dramatic.
Currently, the only known way to remain alive is to avoid looking at these creatures. People who survived the first wave of suicide must remain inside and block all windows, doors other accesses to the outdoors. Fortunately, Malorie was invited into a kind lady's house to seek shelter from the creatures.
After recovering from the initial shock of the incident, Malorie begins to cry. Watching her cry, the audience is meant to become more emotionally connected to the film, making them feel empathy towards Malorie. Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job portraying the character Malorie as she truly looks upset in the film.
Later on, Bird Box resumes switching between time periods. The movies continues to flow nicely even with these transitions. Nothing comes across as abrupt or unnecessary.
The remainder of the film is entirely based on survival. Malorie and other survivors must stay away from the lurking creatures. This idea relates closely to the book Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel. Within Station Eleven, a deadly disease overtakes the human race leaving only a small population alive. The survivors must remain healthy by avoiding the highly contagious plague, but they must also work hard to find food and other necessities. Bird Box, has a similar theme of survival.
Another theme in Bird Box is love. Love is not only said through the words ""I love you"", it is shown through the characters in many different ways. First, many people in the film take chances and risk their own lives to save others. They are willing to die in order to save the one they love. Also, some of the characters show love through their tears. Many men are afraid to show weakness, so they hide their emotions, but in Bird Box, the male characters cry when a loved one passes away. These deep emotions help the characters seem more relatable, which helps the audience continue to connect with them.
The film is very detailed, has great music, dramatic special effects and relatable characters. There are only a few things I would change within this film. First, some things are very unrealistic. For example, at one point in the film, two different people have babies at the same time within the same household. Also, in the present day portion of the film, Malorie, and the two children from the beginning of the movie, travel for days on a river. Malorie rarely stops rowing the boat and never once stops to sleep. It is very unrealistic to work your body that hard and never stop to sleep.
Overall, the film is definitely worth watching. The unrealistic details do not distract from the amazing thriller. So much thought is put into this creative film, every actor does an outstanding job portraying their character, the transition between time periods is very smooth and the music creates a feeling of horror. This movie is great if you're looking for an intense, late night nail-biter."

"miigail","8","1","5","14 January 2019"," an interpretative analysis of the movie ""Bird Box"" by Marel Gail Escano
","THE BIRD IN THE BOX
(1/14/19)<br/><br/>According to scientific research related to biodiversity, the birds when placed in a cage they become depressed and tend to suicide although the person who put them in a cage to ""care"" or ""save"" meant no harm<br/><br/>In bird box, the humans are the BIRDS and the invisible monsters are HUMAN. The monsters made the people unintentionally visualize a painful caged (limited) reality, their worst sorrow making them see how limited and dark life can be, resulting to suicide.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the BIRDS (I use capital BIRD to mean human) in the movie who are constantly struggling in life in a special way find the HUMAN to be helpful, as their savior, affect minimally or doesn't affect them at all. It is because the HUMAN ""feed"" them the ""food"" the visions of the answers of their questions and problems. Reinforcing the idea the they meant no harm.<br/><br/>Back to science, it is said that in order to prevent the bird's depression they need to be free. And the freedom of birds is commonly defined as the ability to fly or being able to fly.<br/><br/>Humans can't fly in reality but they can fly in imagination, in order to live with imagination we need to forget the figure of reality, and to forget the figure reality is to CUT OFF the connection that made visualization of reality figures possible, the CONNECTION which is the organ called ""eye"" . In short, in order to fly we need to be blind (get rid of our eyes).<br/><br/>And in the movie by being blind the BIRDS become free from pain, sadness, and sorrow that brought by the HUMANS, and therefore they fly."

","I was very hyped before watching this movie and I can't say it was worth it. Its not perfect by any means though, there are some wrong decisions made in the film making. Firstly, the movie dragged on a bit I was expecting a 1 hr 30 min or 1hr 45 min movie but instead I got a 2 hr 4 min movie which felt a bit too long. Secondly, some of the character arcs weren't fulfilled as I believe they should've been. Thirdly, I can understand why some people may compare this to A Quite Place so the timing of the release could've been better. However, the pros outweigh the cons firstly, the suspense built is perfect this is partly due to the actors but a major part is of the director. Secondly, the cinematography was spectacular including the color pallet. Thirdly, the performances were phenomenal especially the one given by Sandra Bullock the whole movie is built on her incredible performance, even the child actors were good. Lastly, it didn't feel like a throw away movie it was actually worth the time invested as it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats which I think is why I give it a 6.5/10 and ""C"" grade."

If you're looking for an explanation at the end of the movie that puts all the links together I recommend you watch The Sixth Sense (also a personal favorite).<br/><br/>Most critics hated the movie because the monsters had no back story, nor a future fate, but what I was rooting for was the journey a mother went through to save her kids.<br/><br/>I believe Sandra played the role so well because she is a mother of two, and the love and fear she had for ""Boy"" and ""Girl"" was reflected out of the love of her children.<br/><br/>Standing ovation to Sandra Bullock the mom!"

"secondtake","6","1","5","9 January 2019"," Entertaining end of the world stuff if you don't think too hard about it!
","Bird Box<br/><br/>Do not even try to make this make sense. Relax and go with the bigger set up, the feeling of helplessness, the dependency on friends and strangers. The high drama in a near-future dystopia (the favorite new realm for movies since 9/11).
Fairly quickly into the movie, something goes terribly wrong in the world, and for the few people who are not immediately affected and killed, the one hope is to hide. And hiding in various ways becomes the rest of the trip. Oddly, that creates enough suspense to make it work.
Sandra Bullock is key, a strong female lead. The surrounding cast (including a really good John Malkevich for awhile) helps keep it together. And the filming and pacing is really good.
But of course the premise of the movie is really its biggest point, and its famous weakness because there are just so many unexplained and unlikely aspects to the perils, and to the solutions, to make your brain happy. So shut off the brain and enjoy the ride."

"adamdanielgrey","8","1","5","6 January 2019"," Wanted to Hate, found a Thrilling Watch
","I wanted to hate this film because of all the hype. So many moments where I was holding my hands to my face in fear of watching something too gruesome to bare. I appreciated how they avoided graphic violence at alot of moments. I found the concept of the film very intriguing and compelling. Some of the questions people have complained about, like why some people can be infected was perfectly answered. Some questions were left unaswered like the origin behind the monster, but that's fine with me. The way they showed the monster reminded me a lot of the black smoke in lost, with a different twist and you do get somewhat of an image of it. Sandra did an excellent job playing her part, Malkovich played his part a little over the top, and Machine Gun Kelly's part was useless all the other actors did a great job. I had a blast watching this film and didn't ever get board. Continuous thrills! I had minor qualms, like Sanda being too old to have a baby, how she had a continuous supply of makeup, and the ending was a little too story book for me (btw the ending is not like the novel which I prefer, but is not as happy), but my minor qualms didn't prevent me from enjoying the movie. Hopefully all the haters get a sequel Birdbox origin story so they can have all of their questions answered. Bottom line if you have to have all your answers spelled out or answered for you and some minor flaws in believability bother you don't watch this. If not I think you'll have fun watching this.

To a certain point the unseen evil of this film can be considered an artistic choice, but after the first hour it becomes clear this is nothing more than a lack of artistic direction. A shorter film (70-90 minutes) might not have suffered from this to the same extent.<br/><br/>In summary, this film seems to draw all inspiration from films like The Happening and A Quiet Place, and substitutes only the most minor of details. Anyone seeing originality here has clearly never ventured outside the echo chamber that is Netflix.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's convincing acting, nor the delightful camerawork can salvage this train wreck from a three star rating."

"cattykoo","8","1","5","4 January 2019"," Intriguing
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Well, everyone has there own opinion on whether they like a movie or not. Personally I found this movie to be scary in all the right places, suspenseful, and mysterious. I don't watch a lot of psychological horror type movies but I absolutely love Sandra Bullock and I wanted to see her in this. She doesn't get enough credit for her work - her character showed resilience and the necessary survival skills to keep herself and the kids safe.<br/><br/>Someone said these characters were unrelateable. I don't get that. I found them very relateable. Each character had a role to play and we got a glimpse of how there's a bit of darkness and lightness inside every one of them...can you ever really know someone? Besides this movie was more about the supernatural events occurring outside...not an in depth description of everyones backstory. Uh...thats what books are for! Read one.<br/><br/>I guess if you constantly compare other movies to this, you will be disappointed because you are not enjoying what's happening on the screen in front of you. And if this doesn't scare you, or worse BORES you...then you need to take a break from horror movies.<br/><br/>The whole concept of good vs. evil, God, judging humans to be unfit to live on the planet anymore and demons rising up from the earth to wipe people out - is intense to say the least. I was not bored once during this entire movie. And its not like other movies of the same genre because this movie has great actors. Use your imagination to fill in the blanks, it's there for a reason.<br/><br/>P.S. If you found this movie enjoyable, don't read negative comments. Everyone has an opinion, don't let it ruin yours."

Definitely not the best out there, but it's thrilling enough to leave you craving for explanations. The plot is alright, the focus being not only on surviving under the ominous threat, but on the characters' psychological behavior.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a bad movie. It's at least average, compared with Hollywood blockbusters."

"tazzier","9","1","5","3 January 2019"," A fresh breath of air
","For movies in this genre you have all kinds of expectations, and I think this movie breaks a lot of what is expected, and leaves a lot to the imagination. There's so many questions left unanswered; but in a good way.
It's not about answers, not about solving the world's problem. It's about these people you follow and their story, nothing more. Yes, we want all the answers, but sometimes you just don't get to have them, and as viewers I feel it's refreshing being denied all the answers, and instead being put in a position where I have to imagine - just as the characters in the movie.
I really appreciated the movie, and the way it was layed out, and although a lot of people were disappointed by the ending, I wasn't. We're in a time where nobody wants an ending like that, we want something more unexpected, something we couldn't even have thought about, we want plottwists that twists our heads around. But sometimes things DO end like this movie, and that's actually not something we see all the time anymore. I would really recommend this movie."

I'm surprised that no one else noticed this - this is a movie about refugees - everything in the world you know crumbles - doesn't matter what made the world crumble - the situation is set. Your only goal is survival for yourself, your fellow travelers and most importantly your children (even if one is not your own) - think natural disasters or more likely war- you hear of a place with safety and a chance for the children but getting there is just about impossible - now imagine when you arrive with the enemy on your heel. You knock on the door only to be told that you're not deserving and should go back where you came from - the allegory is complete.

","I've never left a review before, but I want to encourage others to watch this movie.<br/><br/>I'm surprised by all the negative reviews I read, labeling Birdbox as a knockoff of other recent films. Yes, there's an apocalypse of sorts. Yes, there is a group of humans thrown together by chance. Yes, some don't survive. But comparing Birdbox to one or two other ""end of the world"" films is like comparing ""Night of the Living Dead"" to ""Zombieland.""<br/><br/>Birdbox is original in multiple aspects, and BETTER than a large number of films in the genre. The characters each have their purpose, managing to rise above some of the simple/typical expectations... and since when does the viewing public eschew a solid archetype???<br/><br/>The main character, Malorie, is complex & flawed. It's not always easy to like her. But she's authentic. She never pretends to be something she's not.<br/><br/>There are those who say there were too many unanswered questions. It's true that every detail of the hows & whys was not spoonfed to us, but we know as much as we need to. The director doesn't pander to the viewer, which I appreciate. It leaves room for imagination. Bottom line: the plot does not contradict itself.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the pace, the suspense, the style, and the evolution of the characters.

"am-hlam","8","1","5","1 January 2019"," A DARK PLACE
","I don't often write reviews, particularly with a hangover, but I was compelled to with this one.<br/><br/>Less than half of the first day of the new year lapsed and I've already seen one of the top 5 films I'll see in 2019 - Bird Box. No spoliers contained.<br/><br/>Though not captured with quite as much stunning camera work as A Quiet Place (it perhaps being enhanced by containing virtually no dialogue), they both successfully deliver the goods via similar plot devices. While thematically AQP utilises sound and forced silence to drive the story forward, Bird Box uses vision and forced blindness to do this.<br/><br/>Like AQP, Bird Box has separate sub plots - plus a duel timeline - giving itself bags of its personality and uniqueness to differentiate it from any other horror/thriller I've seen.<br/><br/>There's a wide range of cast members, with similar sized roles, all performing excellently. In the central role, Sandra Bullock is in fine form, capably managing to exhibit the extreme strength and fragility the character demands. Doing so often at the same time.<br/><br/>It's a highly effective emotional roller-coaster with some very suspenseful and creepy moments, making this 2+ hour masterpiece pass like a 90minuter. Available on Netflix, though not one for kids.<br/><br/>Happy new year!"
"mukul1904","6","1","5","1 January 2019"," Great movie, with well-told story
","I can't believe people are calling it ripoff or pissing off on not getting answers. This movie had some great performances and amazing direction. I loved the flashback scenes and how group of different people tried to stay together to survive.
Also, that river scene gave me chills, amazingly filmed.<br/><br/>Now, like some review mentioned, I didn't bought the fact that people can do some things shown in movie blindfolded.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't liked the pacing, the movies could have 10-15 minutes short.<br/><br/>Other than that movie was worth watching.<br/><br/>Now, those who are saying, it's The Quite Place ripoff, I cam say The Quite place was ripoff of its source material. Yes, movie took inspiration from past movies/shows (Lost) but every movies does it. How many movies have taken inspirations from classics like Godfather, Psycho etc, are those ripoffs too?<br/><br/>Also, the movie was not about getting answers of questions like why this phenomenon happened or what's with birds or those drawing but the survival of its characters."
"kentwoolgar","8","1","5","1 January 2019"," Surprising little nugget

There are a few holes in the story, mainly the accelerated understanding of what's going on. This aside, Bullock gives her usual quality performance and the the suspense ramps up as the film gathers speed. Excellent use of the timeline by hopping back and forth from past to present.
The ending is very predictable, worked it out 10 minutes into the film. Worth a watch without a doubt."
"view_and_review","8","1","5","1 January 2019"," A Blind Place
","Can this be? Two movies in the same year that are so similar that it cannot be ignored.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place and Bird Box are just too much alike. Female leads, pregnant, apocalyptic, one having to learn to move silently the other having to learn to move blindly, kids that make everything a bit more challenging, both amazing. And that's what needs to be stressed: they were both excellent movies.<br/><br/>Bird Box, like A Quiet Place, starts immediately with a tense situation. Something has occurred that is causing people to commit suicide (think ""The Happening"" but better). Pretty quickly they figure out that seeing these entities is what triggers the self sacrifices. The only way to survive is to not look at the beings. That is a sucky situation.<br/><br/>I think Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich's characters and performances were great. They really enhanced the movie-a movie that didn't need much enhancing it was so intense already. This is a definite edge-of-your-seat, question-every-move type movie. If you're like me you will be yelling at the screen, giving unsolicited advice and generally trying to dictate the very movie from your couch. I was completely drawn in and fully vested. Good stuff."

It isn't until Mallory is faced with the literal end of the world and is forced into trusting other people that she starts making a real connection with Tom, even while maintaining emotional distance with the children that she refused to name.

"gummi94","10","1","5","31 December 2018"," Well done
","I'd like to address points made by others who rated this movie poorly.<br/><br/>1) it's not scary enough. The thing is, there is no threshold set in stone that a horror movie needs to reach. If a scene that's supposed to be horrifying is hilarious, or if a Ring movie isn't scary, then yeah, this criticism is warranted. But a movie like this will be as scary as the writers and directors allow it to be.<br/><br/>2) beings weren't explained. This is not required, and revealing the ghost often has an anticlimactic effect.<br/><br/>3) it's not revolutionary. That shouldn't be required of any movie to be well received.<br/><br/>4) no symbolism. Again, this isn't required. Were you expecting the second coming of Jesus?<br/><br/>5) not enough gore, as if that is a good metric...<br/><br/>This is the first time I have seriously scoured the review section of imdb and I have to say, many of you make life unduly difficult for yourselves."

I just love how Bullock is so natural on screen. It has been her niche since day one of her career. She looks so natural in all her roles, like she just falls in to place and this film REALLY showcased that. A lot of actors LOOK like they are acting or 'playing' it (a role). Bullock seamlessly never does. What you get I what you see. The rest of the ensemble is nothing to sneeze at either. Bravo and kudos to Netflix for keeping it under wraps then BLASTING us this past week causing such a stir AND that PRICELESS word of mouth.

"Mike_Devine","7","1","5","28 December 2018"," Put a blindfold on Bullock and she'll still out-act you
","Very few actors can anchor a Netflix movie and turn it into a massive hit. Sandra Bullock fits this bill, as the Academy Award-winning actress carries the apocalyptic thriller 'Bird Box' on her shoulders.<br/><br/>The sign of a solid ""mess with your mind"" thriller is when it stays with you long after you watch it. In 'Box,' Bullock stars as Mallorie, a mother who must guide her children while blindfolded through the wilderness as supernatural forces try to hunt them down. As the film progresses, pieces begin to fall into place that help the audience understand the events that transpired. While some twists can be seen from a mile away, there are plenty of ""OMG"" moments around every corner, which feel like a punch to your gut. Not every film in this genre can accomplish this nowadays, but writer Eric Heisserer and director Susanne Bier were able to achieve this. A lot of this is due to smart cinematography, as well. Using tight shots that leave much to the imagination about what's going on surrounding the actors, as well as quick transitions and flashbacks - these techniques work well here.<br/><br/>Bullock is of course the lead here, but a number of familiar faces are seen hiding in houses behind drapes and shades. Sarah Paulson stars as the sister of Mallorie, and although her screentime is not super long, she brings ""horror cred"" to the film. Others like BD Wong, Machine Gun Kelly and Trevante Rhodes do alright, with the latter making the biggest impact. And John Malkovich is quintessential John Malkovich, bourbon and all. But 'Box' is really all about Sandra, and she steals every scene she's in.<br/><br/>And then there's the birds. Birds represent much more than winged creatures who sing. Not only do they serve a functional purpose, but they are also emblematic of the psychological imprisonment that humanity experiences throughout the film. And so the film's title is not as random as it seems.<br/><br/>There have been a few Netflix films that have gone on to garner buzz (and some even critical acclaim), and 'Bird Box' is surely one that will encourage more to be made."

I am not the best with my words so I am probably not doing it justice. I was confused to see so many negative comments on various platforms because I thought it was very well done."

","I'm not really a fan of the genre but the synopsis caught my eye. The acting is fantastic and the idea behind the story is great.<br/><br/>I hate reading these reviews about loose ends and plot holes. This is a movie about surviving a catastrophe that you have no defense against. This is not a monster movie. Who cares what the entity is, where it came from and why it's doing it? It's doing it and you better keep your blindfold on."
"evrivali","7","1","5","26 December 2018"," A decent horror movie
","When I watched the trailer I knew I had to watch Bird Box right away, since it seemed like an interesting movie with an original plot. I think this was pretty much what I got even though it had its flaws.
PROS: It's definitely not a waste of time and no one can deny that it has a good main story and a higly respectable cast. It is packed with action and the plot unravels pretty well so the two hours pass pretty quickly.
CONS:
It uses many horror movie cliches and there are times it gets predictable. Also if you ask me it could have used it's cast a little bit better considering that some good actors don't get a respectable amount of screen time. Plus the ending was a little bit dissapointing at least for me.
IN CONCLUSION: It's a very respectable movie. It DOESN'T imitate ""A Quiet Place"" and if it wasn't for some cliches the movie could be considered just as great if not better. I think that it is totally worth watching and it definitely deserves a spot on your watchlist."

I understood at the end by naming them after the dead mother & of Melanie's B/F until he killed himself. But still naming them Boy and Girl, that was a little bit off.

Shouldn't the movie's script me strong enough on it's own to create intelligent tension?<br/><br/>That's what you get with this movie. In order to provide many of the tense scenes, the characters must be made to do extraordinarily stupid things.

Yes I wanted to like this movie, for that very reason, but the book didn't have stupid characters doing stupid things to create tense moments.<br/><br/>I would give this a 5.5 if IMDB allowed decimal scoring.

","This movie is fantastic. Without comparing it to a Quiet Place, which I wasn't a huge fan of, or to the happening, it was executed very well. It jumped back and forth from present to past which kept me on edge like, what happens to this character or where did they end up going or where did they come from? And progressively you get your answers, though there are still some left unanswered, which is fine! Though I wish more ""answers"" were provided, the mystery keeps me talking about it wondering. Sandra Bullock does not disappoint and Trevante Rhodes was astounding.
I think it would've been great as a short Netflix series, to dive into the experiences or fill in the time lapses, or even to better expose, even partially, more of these ""creatures"". Will definitely watch again."

But I have to say, although this is not necessary a flawless film, I would definitely say it is worth watching. It finds a good balance between thriller, horror, and syfy with a good amount of heart. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. And yes... it could almost be considered an actually good version of the happening by M. Night Shyamalan, but that is just scratching the surface of what this movie truly is."
"dwclark-59729","8","1","5","22 December 2018"," To anyone looking for a suspenseful experience, absolutely worth the watch.
","This is my first publicly written review, immediately after finishing this movie I was stunned at the quality of the film and of my experience and wanted to check what the general reception was. I've seen a lot of people comparing it to other movies for some reason and giving it negative reviews. I've seen A Quiet Place and found it to be entertaining, but it did not thrill me, it did not keep me in such suspense that I was at points completely tensed up physically wondering what would happen next.
I feel that the negative reviews saying that this movie isn't scary or gripping set their expectations on a different kind of movie. They expected to see monsters, they expected to see blood and gore. They expect answers, they want to be told in detail exactly what is happening, but that is NOT the point of this movie. There are plenty of other horror movies out there that will put a big spooky monster on the screen, show it cutting off a few heads before a writers' relief character reveals the weakness of the monster and the protagonist eventually defeats it and everyone gets the warm cuddlies.
The suspense and terror comes from not knowing why any of this is happening, from experiencing the struggle for survival from the protagonists point of view. Every instance of conflict builds on this tension, a new form of threat is discovered that both the survivors and you as the audience begin to worry about. The time-skipping pacing works very well within this movie, setting your expectations for how dire the situation becomes later in the plot and building intrigue early in the movie when you have no idea what is happening. As the viewer is caught up with what the main character has experienced up to this point, pieces of the puzzle that is this ""threat"" begin to slide into place, and you become more and more aware of how much danger they are in. You become understanding of the bizarre and at times ridiculous ""rules"" they must go by to survive. as you witness the failures they experience in the past.
If you are a horror addict like me that is looking for a suspenseful experience that avoids the cliche and overdone(the worst of them anyway), you will find it here. Its not that I consider this movie perfection, but a genuinely gripping experience is becoming rarer and rarer to find in modern horror. To me the experience of the journey is much more valuable than having all of the answers neatly boxed up in front of me, and my lingering questions only serve to fuel my imagination."

"kyle_gallagher","9","1","5","22 December 2018"," Heart-racing thriller, with an exemplary performance by Bullock
","Firstly, there are similarities between this film and ""the happening"" or ""a quite place"" But BIRD BOX is quite different. Just because Star Wars and Star Trek are in space doesn't make them the same.<br/><br/>This film is intriguing all the way until the end, keeps you on the edge of your seat and fearing for the characters as if you were in the boat with them. The way the story is told, non-linear time, satisfies the questions you have throughout the movie until it's end.
Sandra Bullock's stellar performance and emotion reminds me of her in SPEED. You are connected to her from the very beginning.
This movie is a great late night watch and with it being on Netflix. No brainer CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT. You may find yourself thinking you have to close you eyes as you walk to the bathroom afterwards.
In addition Machine Gun Kelly makes an appearance in typical MGK fashion.<br/><br/>Only thing I have to say, Malorie should've named ""girl"" Cinderella in the end."

","It's not a bad crack at the book, some good additions others not so grand. Straight of the bat brilliant choice with Sandra bullock as malorie just who I pictured when reading. My only issues with it was:
1. Why does Netflix have to politicise everything? There's no need to shove in Gay, Army vets at any given chance. That's what was so good about the book it wasn't politicised.
2. They rushed bits that didn't need rushing and slower down bits that didn't need slowing.<br/><br/>There was however some deviation from the book which was good not gunna spoil anything but I highly recommend the book. You could read he book before hand and then complain how it's not as good as the book or read the book after and then read the book haphazardly."
"zachmc-86007","6","1","5","21 December 2018"," Great performance by Bullock
","When I had first seen the trailer for this movie, I was immediately excited to see this. I even debated with myself, on whether I should read the book first. In Which, I didn't, because books are mostly better than on-screen adaptions.<br/><br/>So, I just finished the movie, and I am disappointed with the editing. Why have other people in the movie, when you are just going to show flash-forwards. You know those people won't survive. it took away from the suspense, and made you only care about one character. The best part, to me, was the rapids scene.<br/><br/>This movie, could be used to introduce people into the thriller genre. Movie wasn't as intense or descriptive enough as I was hoping. Let's just hope the book does a better job of that."
"gegen-daemon","5","1","5","19 December 2018"," Average, rushed-feeling adaptation of an excellent book
","OK, so first off - to all of you people going on and on and on about A Quiet Place (which, in itself, was a thoroughly average film with a daft concept full of plot holes), Bird Box - the novel - came first. Josh Malerman's novel came out in 2014, at least a couple of years before Mr Krasinski thought about writing a Quiet Place.<br/><br/>Secondly, this is a thoroughly average, rushed adaptation of a superb novel. The fact that it's rushed tells me that it WAS adapted in response to the success of A Quiet Place.<br/><br/>So much has been changed, from how Mallory's sister dies, to how she discovers she's pregnant, to who the people are in the house she ends up in & when they arrive. And, as is often the place, a lot of it is needless. At times it almost feels as if those doing the adaptation of the novel into a script feel the need to stamp their mark on it. It baffles me that Josh Malerman would be happy with how it's changed.<br/><br/>One of my biggest sticking points was how rushed the arc featuring Gary is. The book is such a slow-burn but much of the best beats are either missing from the film or changed entirely for the sake of it, seemingly. Along with this, the bit about how she teaches 'boy' and 'girl' to tell anything that's around them or what's happening in general is a huge part of the novel, she utterly relies on the kids and their hearing ability, which she trained from birth. We only find this out in the final 15 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>Had it not been an adaptation, it would've been a solid thriller/horror. As an adaptation of one of the most original concepts I've read in a while, it's a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>The name of the director, and a lot of the stars in it means it'll get a lot more leeway than it deserves, much like the above-mentioned A Quiet Place. If it had had a long list of B-actors it wouldn't have been so well-received."
"natcalgary","6","1","5","19 December 2018"," About the same as ""a quiet place""

I had to pause it so many times because I couldn't handle the anxiety and I wept so hard at the end when they made it, those kids will experience so much more in life than what they had.
I feel the negativity this movie has gotten is either due to non parents watching it or maybe parents who don't have that fear to life and death of our children and of ourselves. I think it was a truly deep movie and people are not seeing it for what it really is."

"kailey-31423","9","1","6","16 January 2019"," Bird Box; A film telling you not to look, but makes you can't look away.
","This Sci-Fi apocalyptic thriller portrays a unknown, mysterious force that makes people commit suicide, the story follows a mother who leads her children on a treacherous journey. A now Netflix favorite, is viewed as an ""unexpected December gift"".
Bird Box is not the jump-scare thrill seeker film that many expect when they hear ""sci-fi apocalyptic thriller."" It's quiet at times and quick in others. Much like the unseen creatures, or ""force"" it brings our deepest human fears to life, disguised as someone we've lost, asking you to join them and when you to remove your blindfold and watch what happens, it really is beautiful.
People seem to be drawn to and obsessed with watching and thinking about how humanity and the world will one day reach its end. Bird Box gives a fascinating take on the end of the world and interesting emotional insights on survival, parenthood, and humanity itself.
Award winning actress Sandra Bullock leads an all-star cast that includes Trevante Rhodes (Tom), with Sarah Paulson (Jessica), and John Malkovich (Douglas).
Sandra Bullock delivers another brilliant performance as the strict, assertive, unemotional Malorie. Throughout the film, she challenges what ""maternal"" means in survival circumstances like this one. Does motherhood mean too much affection, playing pretend, and filling a child with hopes and dreams, or does it mean you raise a survivor, training and teaching them what they need to stay alive, while holding them at arm's length for fear of losing them? How a mother protects her children is a question that haunts every parent.
Malorie is first pictured having an intense conversation with her children, saying they will be going on the trip down the river, that they must report anything they hear, and under no circumstance will they be allowed to take off their blindfold, because taking off their blindfolds means they would die within seconds.
It then flashes back to five years earlier when pregnant Malorie is with her sister living their regular lives, when all hell breaks loose. First in small cities in Russia and around the world, then right in front of them, there's people jumping in front of cars, leaping off buildings, harming themselves in anyway possible.
Another thing that made the film stand out was how the films events were organized. The Film jumps around time periods from the past when Malorie is pregnant (five years earlier) to the present of her on the dangerous journey down the river. Using the events that took place out of order and instead showing flashbacks that eventually lead up to the final scenes adds an interesting flow to the film that keeps the audience on their toes wondering what will happen next.
Another thing that made the film stand out was filming Malorie's point of view from under the blindfold. It adds an interesting camera shot and was a nice touch, it presents the audience with how vulnerable and extremely difficult it was to maneuver their way through all the obstacles and challenges they faced and put the watchers in her shoes and made their experience and the film more tangible and realistic.
The films post-apocalyptic setting, need to survive, and constant action has a close relation to the film 'A Quiet Place' and to the popular series 'The Walking Dead'.
The question that seemed to be asked a lot is if Bird Box is just another version of 'A Quiet Place'? Another post-apocalyptic film? Or does it bring more to the table? Personally I think the film is exceptional and although the ending is a little cheesy and cliche, it was the perfect way to end such an action packed movie."

Problem was, story was stuck at that concept of evil-pshychotic attack. It didn't show what human kind is doing to defeat it? Why it doesn't enter homes?

","This is a well done allegory about the existence and danger of evil. People see something, it is presented as familiar to be beguiling, and it makes them kill themselves. To live, people must stay inside with the windows blacked out. Outside they must wear blindfolds. To look upon evil is to die. The only way to live is to not look upon it. A segment of the population is drawn to evil, it is evident in their eyes, and they try to force others to look upon evil and die. It is a very powerful allegorical thriller. Sandra Bullock delivers another Oscar-worthy performance. This is a Netflix movie. There are many excellent productions with tremendous writing being produced by Netflix and Amazon. I wish they weren't littered with foul language. It is not necessary to the story telling. I could understand the terror and anger without it."

","The first 30 mins of this film I found very intense and I could not look away and thankfully the pacing kept up nicely throught the film. I found Sandra Bullock very watchable in what has to be her most physicaly demanding role to date. There is also an incredible supporting cast consisting of John Malcovich, Sarah Paulson & B. D. Wong of Law & Order SVU. I overall was utterly satisfied with this film and would highly recommend it to anybody."

That would've been a more interesting movie.<br/><br/>But the whole film is about her trying to find a safe place, and that's it.
We don't learn anything about the creatures, about the people who are immune, about what they really do in people so they want to kill themselves.<br/><br/>As a ""Sunday movie"" (as we call those kinds of movies here in Mexico) is fine. It's not boring, it has some action, some ""aliens"" and an apocalypse scenario. That's it."

"jadepietro","7","1","6","24 December 2018"," Flying Low
","GRADE: B-<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Real suspense takes a tailspin in this horror thriller due to a heavy-handed plot.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: In Susanne Bier's chilling but illogical apocalyptic thriller, Bird Box, the world is coming to an end. Unknown forces suddenly control your mind and make mostly everyone unpleasant, You're either suicidal or homicidal. A compelling premise, especially in the beginning stages of this horror film. But the movie has some issues with holding on to its creepy promise as the plot begins to unravel to its shaky conclusion.<br/><br/>The plot involves some survivors who band together in one house in order to survive. The rules are simple, even if the story is not. Much of the Eric Heisserer's screenplay is succinctly explained by its heroine and mother, Malorie Hayes (Sandra Bullock) in the film's opening minutes. She adamantly states to us and her children: Do not remove your blindfolds or you die. The mantra, do not look into the light or you are doomed, is repeated ad nausea for those of us moviegoers who are dim-witted or bird-brained. In fact, it seems that only the certifiable insane, pregnant women, and birds are immune to this deadly Circe siren call. There is lots of conjecture about the problem, but no real solutions or valid explanations. Moviegoers must willfully accept the plotting and move on.<br/><br/>The film flashbacks prior to the global catastrophe, to offer some backstory, yet it never gives any enlightenment of the dilemma facing its cast of characters. They are a stereotypical bunch, from doomsayer (John Malkovich), hero (Trevante Rhodes), and other minor figures that are woefully underdeveloped and dispatched as pawns for the next killing. Still, the film is highly suspenseful and has moments of real tension served by its director (especially the initial chaos sequence), But a horror film with an invisible monster does present some unforeseen problems in the scare department, All the moving trees and rustling bushes, complete with an atmospheric music score, and eerie sound mixing, just cannot hide the flaws of the plot. Expeditions into the outside world are far-fetched and straining for logic, despite the human speed bumps on the road.<br/><br/>The story becomes even more ludicrous when the Hayes family finally decide to take a 4 day river trip to a far-away refuge. One never knows if it is fate, unanticipated events, or just sloppy screenwriting that gets Malorie to her final destination. By the film's conclusion, there are still many unanswered questions about the ensuing havoc, and still more about that arduous trek that becomes more implausible with each overbearing situation. (However, a nifty twist does add some cleverness to the narrative.)<br/><br/>Perhaps the main asset to this thriller is Ms. Bullock herself, who ups her game with a very strong and believable performance. She provides all of the compassion of a fearless woman who fights to protect her children from peril, even if her character's weaknesses are based on fear and tinged with sadness. The actress uses her likable screen persona to her advantage with her self-effacing banter and plays her role very effectively, even when she becomes overwrought.<br/><br/>Bird Box is a better-than-average film, reminiscent of some of M. Night Shyamalan's earlier work. While the film never truly soars,it does somewhat glide along with its share of tension-filled scenes. The movie consistently entertains, even with nary a peep of logic in sight. Maybe, it should have taken off its blindfold more often.<br/><br/>NOTE: Nearly the same notion, a family in danger due to otherworldly events, is the plot of a superior horror movie, A Quiet Place, one of 2018's best films. That horror film is destined to become a classic and would be a better moviegoing experience to savor, providing well-earned suspense. By all means, see that film!"

"nancymilholland","9","1","6","24 December 2018"," Why the animus?
","It's a super-natural thriller. It's make-believe. It's a movie (based on a short story.) There don't have to be answers. People in *real life* make horrible, terminal decisions. Entertainment is profoundly about suspension of disbelief: it's also about a voyeuristic experience of human nature and its failings. This isn't my go-to genre, but I saw Sandra B on Ellen talking about it and it sparked my interest. The acting, score, direction and cinematography are top shelf; the writing is nuanced, clever and multi-dimensional. It's one of those movies where I ended up thinking: what would I be capable of doing in order to survive."
"Nightmarelogic","Null","1","6","24 December 2018"," An excellent thriller
","This is an excellent and quite chilling thriller with a great cast. Anyone who complains about movies being ""rip offs"" must not watch many movies or be the type who picks their favorite movie and hates every movie even remotely similar out of spite. Of course this probably had aspects of many other movies but who really cares if the movie is good...and this movie is good. Sandra Bullock is really good in this but then she is good in most movies. The supporting cast is as very good in smaller rolls. I would definitely recommend watching this if you like thrillers."
"peterp-450-298716","9","1","6","23 December 2018"," Simply. This is a must-see.
","You never, ever take off your blindfold.
If you look, you will die.
Do you understand?<br/><br/>Each year ends with a bang. You'll have the end-of-year festivities and people party themselves into the new year. But when it's about movies, this one created an end-of-a-filmyear-bang. Frankly, I didn't expect too much of it. But maybe my prejudice about Sandra Bullock has something to do with that. I readily admit that I'm not really a fan of this actress. Is it her way of talking? Or her facial expression? No idea. But I have already avoided a lot of films just because of her being in it. But for her acting performance in ""Bird Box"", she deserves a standing ovation.<br/><br/>Brilliant how Sandra Bullock plays her character, Malorie. A free-spirited woman who's on her way to becoming a single mum. All indications point to her being a cynic who prefers not to have too emotional bonds with others. Even the way she talks about her unborn baby shows how aloof she is. Even the two children, with whom she makes the dangerous boat trip, are still called by the names ""boy"" and ""girl"" after 5 years. Is it pure selfishness? Or self-preservation? Or fear of commitment? Probably. But as the film progresses, you'll also notice that she has other character traits that make her more human. She stands her ground, shows understanding, defends others and shows how vulnerable she is herself. So thumbs up for Bullock, even though she looks more and more like Michael Jackson.<br/><br/>But it's not just the acting of Sandra Bullock why this film entered my list ""Best movies of 2018"". The film itself impressed me. It's that constant feeling of threat, helplessness, and fear that you get while watching this film. Inevitably one will compare ""Bird Box"" with ""A quiet place"". In this film, the survivors had to produce as little noise as possible, because those who have conquered our beloved globe have a pair of sophisticated ears. Every sigh or groan can, therefore, be heard by them over kilometers, with the result that the person who produced the sound can't do this a second time. In ""Bird Box"", looking is already fatal. That's why a lot is being blinded with newspapers, curtains, and blindfolds. An advantage for the pregnant among the survivors. No problem to be noisy while giving birth.<br/><br/>You can see this film as a fusion of ""A quiet place"" and ""Cell"". Just as there's chaos in ""Cell"" after a telephone signal has changed those who were on the phone into murderous psychotics, in ""Bird Box"" it's when looking at something unknown that all hell will break loose. In this film, I found that moment more frightening and more breathtaking. When I watched ""Cell"", I was slightly disappointed about that moment. Perhaps because I also read Stephen King's book and King wrote it in such a brilliant and unparalleled way that it was impossible to film it. After the general mass hysteria where a lot of suicides are being committed, we see how a group of random people is entrenched in someone's home. Soon they are confronted with the known problems. Their food supply is shrinking so they are forced to go outside to resupply. A hazardous undertaking that provides the necessary tension. There's also the constant threat of falling prey to the unknown danger. Or people who seek help (or something else) knocking at their door.<br/><br/>Most criticism will probably be given to the fact that the phenomenon that causes a global suicide wave can't be seen at all. Apart from some wind, shadows, and leaves that appear to be floating motionlessly in the air, there's nothing to see. Is it an alien invasion? A failed scientific experiment? A virus? A social media syndrome? No idea. And weird but true, even that didn't bother me. It stimulates your curiosity and makes you feel the same way as the victims. A feeling of helplessness and fear of the unknown. During the entire film, it goes back and forth between past and present. Normally I'm not such a flashback-fan because this usually undermines the pace and mood of the movie. With ""Bird box"" I didn't have that feeling and the subcutaneous tension remained constant.<br/><br/>It's clear this film competes for the title ""Best film of the year 2018"". Sandra Bullock steals the show and is emphatically present in almost every scene. Also worth mentioning is John Malkovich as the sometimes hard-hearted cynic and pessimist Douglas. Such a person who immediately assumes that his country is in a state of war. So he's constantly parading around with a gun. There is also Trevante Rhodes which is the absolute opposite of Douglas. A sympathetic fellow who's helpful and shows compassion. And finally, the two young children who act so natural at certain moments. The moment when a terrible decision had to be made during the trip on the river, was touching and brilliantly acted. It's kind of obvious. ""Bird box"" left a crushing impression on me. It wasn't so exciting that I wanted to cover my eyes. But it was a close call! Indeed, a must see."

Look at this now, Sandra's first ""horror"". What makes this movie so good? Should you watch it?<br/><br/>A definite wow! For me, seen on Netflix, this movie actually made me sit on the edge of my couch. It felt like the scenes and script lets you decide what this evil, dark and twisted power is. Sandra did an amazing job by setting the fundamentals of her character and from point one that Trevante joins in, he nails it by simply adding meaning to what happens later during the film. During the film, I often thought, how did they make this possible for the kids to act in since it has such a mysterious fling to it? The film let's you guess and guess while you kind of, already know what is coming up, and that adds great value to the fun factor.<br/><br/>Are you in the mood for a nice film? Nothing too bloody yet want it to be exciting and where you can say ""Oh I would've done that!"" or ""I would've been like this during..."". Worth a view, have fun!"

"jdollak","6","1","6","20 December 2018"," Your mileage may vary
","When this ended, I felt like something was missing. I didn't feel a sense of closure, or a sense of relief at things working out. This made me reevaluate the rest of the movie.
First, the structuring is sort of a pain. It isn't difficult to follow, but it feels like a crutch to stretch the running time out, when something like this actually seems like it would flow better if it didn't try to do something clever that didn't add anything.<br/><br/>I sort of enjoyed the first half of the story. The mass suicides, figuring out what was causing it, being teased with little bits of information like the drawings... all of that was really pretty good.<br/><br/>Once we lose most of the characters, the story gradually falls apart into something that's harder to care about. Gone is the interpersonal conflict in the face of adversity. Instead, it's Sandra Bullock trying to protect kids against... ghosts? Ethereal aliens?
Normally I would be fine with not having an explanation of what they're dealing with, but there's a lack of establishing rules. We know that seeing them is a problem. But they don't seem to physically interact with people, but they do stir up wind. And somehow, they are solid enough to trigger a car's collision warning. Not to mention that these entities seem to be able to get inside minds and create auditory hallucinations that are especially personal.
What is this?<br/><br/>To be fair, this is probably something that's just at the right level for some people. No real gore, long sequences of slow tension... it's a horror movie for people who are turned off by most horror movies.<br/><br/>I don't think it will persevere very well, because even if the ending had done better, I wouldn't have felt like it had anything to offer on a second viewing."
"marantz-nz","5","1","6","19 December 2018"," The Happening Revisited
","Enjoyable movie and well acted by Sandra Bullock. There was a sense of familiarity throughout the movie and I clicked near the end. It was similar in many ways to M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening.<br/><br/>One of the better Netflix releases if late. Not excellent, but not bad, somewhere in-between."
"patrick-lafont","6","1","6","18 December 2018"," Clever but kind of predictable
","To be honest, I wanted to write a review just because halfway through the movie I thought there was an obvious flaw. The ending was addressing it, although it could have been a different movie if they would have used this idea from the start.
It's very easy to relate to 'A Quiet Place', a story with children, make no noise replaced by do not take your blindfold off. But I guess it's easier to make a movie without sound than without visuals. The blindfold thing is a nice workaround but somehow you might think a blindfold should not be enough to protect you.
Anyway, it's a movie that keeps you on your toes because you can easily guess what can go wrong. I will go straight to what I didn't like or could be improved.
Another story with kids. Anyone who's a parent will think what if I'm in such a situation with my kids, what would I do, how scared would I be to loose them. I don't like that idea, those movies are playing this card too much in my opinion. Grown men, or women, taking on supernatural stuff, zombies or whatever, I don't mind, just don't play with our feelings when it comes to children.
Thinking about 'A Quiet Place' it reminded me of 'the sixth sense', and how ghost stories were suddenly popular again in movies around 1999-2001.
Finally the story is good for a novel, you don't need to explain what happened, but somehow it feels all too easy. It is sometimes good to leave it to imagination, and in the end from the point of view of a character, they have no clue and probably will never know what those being are, why they want people to commit suicide (maybe it's a good way to wipe out a population, but then again what if it is just a virus). I mean telling a story without really telling it might not be enough.
I tried to write some big stories myself and I was often confronted with that idea that I want to focus on the part of the story I really want to tell and thought how can I do without explaining the whole thing, because the supporting story might be weak, I'm not one of those writers who are creating their own world to tell a story. Of course explaining too much might make the story a little less scary, but the question is do you want a great trailer or a great movie?"

A Quiet Place is the one that is very much overrated! I agree that A Quiet Place is a good film, but can't deny it seems like a reboot to the Cloverfield franchise. Bird Box is a much better dystopian film and, in my opinion, is very well adapted from the novel. Bird Box might not have the technical qualities of A Quiet Place, but at least is much more fun and thrilling.<br/><br/>I admit that there may be some loose ends and clichÃ©s typical to the genre. However, let's all be realistic and acknowledge this film for what it is.

","Unfairly bad rated. People tent to question very strictly, and usually hate something that is overhyped and not perfect, so that's the reason for all these very unfair critics, but people that rate this movie with ones and threes can't be taken seriously. Finally a thriller with no stupid jump scares and unbelievable monsters. A survival movie that keeps you on your toes till the end, makes you care and worry about it's protagonists, and has a good relieving ending that pays off. There where some predictable moments sure, but that's not necessary a deal breaker. I liked that it has the good old fashioned thriller agony and build up, and no easy answers, that people nowadays can't appreciate because they are spoiled with most of today's thrillers. People think a movie owes you answers and beliefs. NO IT DOESN'T! I like the idea of me having to use my imagination, like in the good old Hitchcock movies."
"DonutLover","8","1","7","8 January 2019"," Thoughts on the ending
","Spoilers here so don't read if you haven't seen the movie. In the end, what gives about the blind people? A) Why was her doctor there? Never explained. B) Who was feeding/taking care of the blind people? C) Whoever was taking care of the blind people (supplying food, building things) would be exposed to the monsters, right? So how did they remain safe? How will they venture out in the future to get food/supplies to continue living?
These questions are not answered, but hit me the second she walks into the blind school with the children. Also, the ""blind"" thing was used in the movie ""The Day of the Triffods"". Anyone remember that one? The entire earth goes blind except for one man who had his eyes covered. This move leaves too many questions.
The monsters make you kill yourself by making you sad, scared.....then chooses some people to make them think it's beautiful? Interesting concept, would have liked that explained more."

It's derivative, 'they' are trying to find an original idea of framing Armageddon, but it's been done before, but mentioning it could be construed as a spoiler. This is the worst horror/thriller I've seen in the 6 star and above rating. Dawn of the dead original, and latter so much better than this dumb pile of horse dung.

"falanukki","5","1","7","21 December 2018"," Yet another story of a mother and her two children
","Although Bird Box is based off of a famous novel written before ""A Quiet Place"" I still struggle finding true originality from this film. The storytelling is rather slow and is mainly your typical one big journey and flashbacks -type of film, in which the triplet travels along a river.<br/><br/>First half of the movie is rather interesting, taking place when the pandemonium started. But the plot itself falls kinda flat and the character development is rather poor. They're trying to build the mother to be cold and strong, but fail, for the character is filled with conflicts of interest. (Such as who she holds dear and how she interacts with other people)<br/><br/>Unlike the statistics suggest, it's not actually a horror film - rather a thriller filled with mild violence. If you're expecting blood and guts, don't bother really.<br/><br/>Bird Box isn't too original and it doesn't really give anything new to the genre, except for the really cool set up of something unknown that goes out making people want to kill themselvs. And trust me, it's not your average demon they're dealing with. Long story short, it could've been better and I would've loved to see some other characters' perspectives as well. (Fish Fingers etc).<br/><br/>The ending falls flat, but it's a film worth seeing. In the end two hours might feel a bit too long, but it's a good ""horror"" film for those, who aren't too keen on watching actual horror."
"Aaron1375","7","1","8","15 January 2019"," Not a rip off of Quiet Place people...
","A Quiet Place was released in 2018, early in the year. This film was released the same year and its production started in October of 2017 and it is also based off a book from 2014 so no, this was not ripping off Quiet Place and if you think so, you are kind of dense thinking that a movie can be thrown together so quickly within a year and you don't bother to read anything otherwise you would know it was based off a book that predates Quiet Place. I have not seen Quiet Place, but I do want to, but I actually did minimal research to discover the origin of this film had nothing to do with that one as they were already in the works to making this film prior to even the book release back in 2013! If anything, Quiet Place may have stolen a couple of ideas from the novel this film is based on. Now what the film is much more like is The Happening, but with a much better thing causing people to take their own lives.<br/><br/>The story starts out as two sisters are about to visit the doctor as one of them is pregnant and not to thrilled about it. They see on the news that there is something going on in Russia where people are claiming their own lives. Well it quickly moves in and soon they are fleeing amid mass suicides as it appears that the ones who kill themselves see something that causes their abnormal behavior. One sister sees it and takes her life leaving behind the pregnant one played by Sandra Bullock. She is helped into a house where the people are smart enough to close the windows as it is clear something is seen before the urge to kill oneself occurs. They try to figure out what to do while at times we are taken ahead years in time as Sandra's character is now in charge of two kids and is trying to make her way down a river to a place offering safe haven.<br/><br/>While the film is not a ripoff of Quiet Place, it is also not perfect and suffers many flaws and questions. I figure the things they are seeing are demons as only something like that could possess a person and cause them to do the whole suicide thing and I can see a demon not being able to enter a house kind of like a vampire not being able to unless invited (in the book they apparently could enter houses). This was not one of the problems for me, but one thing that was, was the way the film played out. It starts by showing Sandra and the two kids thereby telegraphing that all is not going to go well at the house and that pretty much everyone is going to die. I also wanted to see the demons, but the only way we could have seen them is if the main protagonist had seen them and quite frankly, they probably would have been disappointing had they been seen. The ending was a bit too happy and still leaves one with questions too.<br/><br/>So, this was a pretty good Netflix original film. Certainly better than Open House and another one I saw about a haunted school, but I think I still give The Ritual the edge as far as best Netflix original horror film that I have seen. That one provided more atmosphere and tension than did this one. Still, it was entertaining for what it was."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Bird Box"" (2018) was an amazing movie. If you like this so called genre type of ""something terrible happens / the end of the world"" movies, or you simply like a great intense thrillers - ""Bird Box"" will leave you breathless - at least it left me. I loved pretty much everything about this movie - simple yet great and not that predictable story, superb directing (the movie is terrifically paced and very intense) and amazing acting by Sandra Bullock - that is her best performance since ""Gravity"" in my opinion - she was truly amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, 2018 gave us two movies of this so called genre which are among the very best in this genre, ""A Quiet Place"" and now ""Bird Box"" - both have similarities, but both movie were just great. To sum it up - ""Bird Box"" is in my opinion one of the best movie from 2018. I loved every single minute of it. Great movie."

I seriously believe all other user reviewers didn't understand the film at all! The acting was suberb, the main protagonist characters have depth, you don't need to care about all of them, but each and every one of them has something to offer plotwise! If you pay attention from start to finish, then you'll understand, why the characters need the blindfolds and their true meaning! It becomes clear by the end of the film and because of the place she goes, personally, at that moment, it blew me away! If you cannot tell what the ending truly means, rethinking all things that happened prior to that point, then you need to watch the film again and maybe that will make those who rated this film poorly, to change their ratings!

","This is my first time reviewing a movie because I was shocked to see the low rating and so many negative reviews when everyone I spoke to LOVED it. It is an amazing movie based on an even more amazing book (published in 2014, BEFORE A Quite Place and Don't Breathe came out -so stop calling it a copy cat). It is incredibly suspenseful and well acted. I don't understand what 'loopholes' people are talking about because everything is explained if the viewer is paying close attention. Possibly some people just can't understand this type of movie and need a simpler storyline. However, I can't imagine giving a movie an negative review because I couldn't understand an aspect of it. I found the screenwriter's choices interesting (some I don't necessarily agree with) and comparing the movie and the book is definitely worth it. It is one of my favorite movies of 2018!"

Firstly, if most of the criticisms deeming the movie ""unrealistic"" (e.g. how they achieve x, y, and z wearing blindfolds) were actually corrected, there wouldn't actually be a movie. It's fiction, get over it. Secondly, would it really be realistic to discover every explanation and motive behind each movie scene? Do you really go through your entire lives receiving a thorough explanation for absolutely everything? Or do you have to fill the gaps yourselves sometimes? The day of having to end movies with a long explanation from the baddies detailing every motive and intention is over - because it's unrealistic. Those who want an entertaining piece of fiction without being spoon-fed it, this is a movie for you."

Just because you guys have a mind that wonders around besides thinking what is going on, does not make this a bad movie, but you just stupid enough to not enjoy it and keep your thoughts on it, while it is going.<br/><br/>The eyes on them after going crazy reminded me of In The Mouth Of Madness when they went crazy. This kind of remind of that movie to me. Still the same as The Happening but a heck of a lot better than that movie. I would definitely be saying this is better to anyone that asks about it, and recommend it. I read a review before watching saying people that rate this high is stupid but that person is the dummie.<br/><br/>I think this is one of my favorites and would watch it if put on regular television. Not sure if they put Netflix movies on television but I would not mind if this was the first one.

","This is a blatant ""The Happening"" ripoff. The author that wrote the book thisnis based off of also ripped of The Happening. Can't believe people don't realize that and that Netflix was sleezy and desperate enough for filler content they let this pass for the simpletons to enjoy. . Somehow because it's released on Netflix starring a strong female lead, instead of the decade ago it was released in theatres from the great M Night, it's somehow more well received? People make absolutely no sense. While quality wise it's easily the same mediocre caliber as the film it tried to be, there are some decent moments of atmosphere and intensity. Then it's all deflated almost every time when there is never anything to see as far as the creatures or things causing these moments of insanity in humans.

Poor old Sandra Bullock does kinda remind me of Jen from the Dark Crystal after her plastic surgery which does detract ones attention - sad how they all have to go under the knife to keep hollywood directors happy and stay in the limelight.<br/><br/>Story was obviously borrowed from and riding on the coat tales of A Quiet Place but was much better than that lacklustre effort.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is that although you never see the ""demons"" except in drawing form (presumably all the budget went on Bullock and Malkovich's wages lol) so couldn't afford any CGI, I can forgive that but to not have the exact plot explained; was it the rapture or aliens from another world? Same problem that was evident in A Quiet Place is that nothing is ever explained in any way and whilst it is good to have the viewer think for themselves, directors are just taking this now as licence to give us a skeleton plot and story which makes it overall rather unsatisfying!!!<br/><br/>Overall though its a well directed and competent performances from all concerned; even though the BLM / LGBT / Diversity agenda is slapping you in the face at every turn as seems the mandate now in Hollywood, it was better than A Quiet Place and did keep my attention which can only be a good thing these days with all the ordure pouring forth from Netflix and Pay Per View.<br/><br/>Above average 6 for this one but it will not be joining my movie collection!"

","I've watched 1000s of films (and made a few myself) over the years, and I've never taken the time to review a movie. After seeing the score for this film, I was inspired to give my two cents.<br/><br/>Horror is not my favorite genre, but Stranger Things and A Quiet Place were intelligent projects that slowly but surely changed my mind. I'm adding Bird Box to this list. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Bird Box. Bullock's character harks back to her early days of Speed: a very physical, tension-building portrayal of a woman fighting for her life...and others; but in a completely different world. The supporting cast was excellent from well-known actors like Paulson, Malkovich, and Lil Rel to newcomers.<br/><br/>Although in the same genre as the other projects mentioned, Bird Box is unique, and entertaining in its own right. The suspense was palpable from start to finish, and kept me guessing throughout.<br/><br/>It's definitely a 'curl up and eat popcorn' movie. Take the naysayers' comments with a grain of salt."
"tjsuf","5","1","11","20 December 2018"," Lets be realistic...
","There were good and bad things about this movie.
GOOD- The acting was not bad, and I like the lead male role. John Malkovich is awesome, like always. Some good excitement, and a pretty decent plot.
BAD- How are you going to cast Sandra Bullock, in her 50's, as a new mother. Super predictable. The story dragged on a bit. Sandra Bullock does not come off tough anymore, Maybe in Speed not in this movie. The plot was a lot like the Happening. Plot holes about why some people can see the thing and not die
Overall it's not horrible, but it does have holes, Bullock is old and annoying, and it's been done too many times. But if your bored it's a decent watch.

"sophbazile","5","0","2","10 June 2020"," Interesting Plot, Bland Execution
","Considering the plots of other post-apocalyptic films, e.g., viruses, zombies, natural disasters, etc., Bird Box stands apart. However, besides the plot, everything else about the film is disappointingly generic.<br/><br/>I see other reviewers mentioned that reading the book provided more clarity or made them like the film more; it seems that their ratings are based on the book. But the film adaptation and the book that it's based on are two separate things. It makes little sense to rate the movie on the book; if that's the case, then why watch the film at all?<br/><br/>That being said, the premise of the film, that people have to move around without looking/seeing caught my attention. After watching the film though, it all seemed so unrealistic. At no point does anyone bring up the canes that are used by the blind. Instead, they use string. String! Speaking of the blind, where are they? All of them are at the safe haven at the end of the movie? Sure. How amazing would it have been if the protagonist of the film was actually a blind person? Such a missed opportunity. (I get that the protagonist in the book isn't blind but writers do have wiggle room when it comes to film adaptations.)<br/><br/>As for the entities that cause people to commit suicide, the viewer has no idea what they are. Are they even creatures with physical bodies? Are they creatures or more if a humanoid hybrid? Are they ancient or alien? Are they more like ghosts/spirits? Because whenever they're around, the wind always whips around and they seem to be able to move objects without a physical presence. So, what is it that people actually see? And why does it change people's eyes? What's physically happening to their bodies? And why are some people immune to these entities and why do they want to force others to look? Are they possessed? What's in for them if those who aren't immune are just going to kill themselves?<br/><br/>And I cannot not mention how I hated every character in Bird Box. I wasn't rooting for anybody. Honestly, I wouldn't have minded if they all died at the end, including the protagonist, which is rare for me. The only exceptions are Girl and Boy. They were so adorable. But how stupid to name children by their gender (constructed or not). Sure, life sucks in this dystopia and it's understandable that the protagonist wants the children to be hardened in order to survive. But what's the point of surviving if you're not going to live? You might as well be dead. I wish the character Tom would have delved deeper to make this point, especially as a Black man. Even African slaves managed to find some joy in their lives while being property, having no rights, and constantly getting separated from their kin, so, I don't see how this white lady raising two beautiful children with a hot guy can't do the same. Give me a break.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah. Speaking of race, the only two Black characters in the film sacrifice themselves for the white people. This is such a tiresome trope. And the nerve to have a Black man pining after a PREGNANT white woman carrying another man's child is a topic for a dissertation by itself, especially considering the discussions around Black fatherhood.<br/><br/>Lastly, Bird Box is not a horror film. Suspense/thriller, sure. Sci-fi/fantasy, perhaps. Horror, no. For the people who were scared watching the film it's likely that the idea of suicide creeped them out. We're a society that's very uncomfortable about the topic of death. We're incapable of grasping the idea that someone wants to end their life; the notion that an external force can control us and make us commit suicide is likely to highlight an unconscious fear.<br/><br/>There's just too many big answered questions around this film. And when there are big plot holes, then the smaller plot holes become even more apparent. Y'all, there's a school for the BLIND in the middle of a FOREST. A forest! Huh? Why? How? This is what I mean.<br/><br/>Bird Box isn't complete trash. It's just mediocre. I didn't feel like it was a waste of time after watching it (I've watched much worse). I just wasn't impressed."

","I just watched Bird Box last night, directly after watching A Quiet Place for the first time. They really are nothing alike, other than they are both high concept movies that don't hold up to logic or scrutiny, but most people who watch this sort of thing are happy to agree just to not let their minds go there and spoil it for themselves (at least until after, when it's actually fun to poke holes in it).<br/><br/>Overall, I suppose I would have to concede that A Quiet Place is the superior film. The acting is superb. However, I personally enjoyed Bird Box more. I felt more fully engaged with Malorie and her character development than with anyone in A Quiet Place. I felt a lot more menace from the creatures and more anxiety on behalf of Malorie and her charges than I did for the family in A Quiet Place. I suppose it's because A Quiet Place was a sort of 'We were so perfect and happy before all this happened, ain't it tragic,' whereas in Bird Box, we get, 'I always believed there was nothing to trust or hang onto in this life, but for some reason now that this has happened I want to stay alive anyway and the struggle for survival has taught me to see how beautiful and precious it is to be connected to others and value life.'<br/><br/>The people in A Quiet Place start who they are and stay that way. The only one who has any sort of development is the deaf daughter. I enjoyed the character development in Bird Box much more. There are no surprises there, but it's still satisfying to watch the story unfold."
"Cineanalyst","8","0","3","22 April 2020"," To Gaze, or Not To Gaze
","Seeing ""Bird Box"" a second time now, I appreciate it more. Perhaps, upon first viewing, it appeared too akin to ""A Quiet Place,"" but primarily based on sight instead of sound, and made worse by its naturey suicides similarity to ""The Happening"" (2008). Maybe its popular and social-media appeal at the time, or those nitpicking plot holes and improbabilities, blinded me to what the picture does fundamentally well. I still find the sisters' first conversation as they largely and ridiculously ignore incredible TV reports to be laughable. Regardless, that we're now, as of this writing, living during a real-world pandemic may focus the mind and draw some parallels with the fictional narrative--blindfolds instead of masks. As a horror movie, ""Bird Box"" is solidly Lovecraftian, of the fear of an unknown and better unseen monster that attacks the very essence of cinema, to look.<br/><br/>Two elements in the movie reflexively point to this symmetry and paradoxical dichotomy, between the spectator (i.e. us, the audience) of the movie intended to fear the horror picture on the screen in front of them, as they presumably sit in comfort before the Netflix streaming (or, you know, a theatre, for those who still and may someday again go to the movies), and the surrogate viewers within the movie whose very lives as characters depend on looking away and running away in terror. Either way, it's the act of looking that matters. How apt, then, that the protagonist, Malorie (Sandra Bullock) is a painter in the pre-apocalyptic world--creating art to be gazed upon. The other reflexive element here involves video-as-surveillance. Greg (BD Wong) is closest to being our in-film surrogate spectator, as he positions himself seated to view a screen of the recorded monster. We never quite share his exact position, however, during the presumably full exposure of the cosmic, monstrous force. To do otherwise, it seems, would drive one mad over its reported beauty or kill the effect.<br/><br/>This core understanding of the importance of the cinematic gaze is enough for me to appreciate ""Bird Box."" That gaze, moreover, is further reinforced as character driven by the association of the camera's view (for which the spectator strongly associates, as what the camera sees is what we see in a movie, after all) with the sight of the characters, or their lack thereof, as obscured by blindfolds, closed eyes or otherwise looking away from the unseen menace. Rather the inverse of ""The Invisible Man"" movies, by the way, whereby we try to see what can't or doesn't want to be seen, as, instead, here, we try not to see what wants a look. In addition to looking, though, ""Bird Box"" isn't bad, either, as a mother-children adventure to an almost-Biblical Garden of Eden, with one boy and one girl, to boot. Speaking of which, this was an odd movie for me to review after also having recently reviewed ""Blindness"" (2008). Both are apocalyptic and involve not looking, but for contrary reasons, and the depictions of the blind are starkly different. In their own ways, however, they both employ sight as parables and, more importantly, demonstrate and play with the essence of cinema as a visual art form."

In a struggle for survival, Malorie (Sandra Bullock) and her two children must search for sanctuary down the rapid river without their sight to guide them. There are some seriously impressive sequences in the film such as the depiction of the outbreak (Sarah Paulson is fantastic as always as Jessica), and when other humans also turn out to be a threat. That is when the film is at its most exciting and the menace is high. The story is well put together and very well directed by Susanne Bier (Love Is All You Need) who encourages beautiful acting from all the cast and weaves a doom-laden atmosphere. It's nothing particularly original or groundbreaking which a lot of the hype made it out to be in my opinion and that's perhaps its biggest downfall; too much hype. It is also overlong; it could have done with more detail on some characters over others. Nevertheless, it's well made and well acted (Tom Hollander is particularly memorable; one of his best roles to date!) and worth a watch"

","This film is better than I expected. I knew nothing about the hype about this film, coz I'd never heard of it before I saw it, so I watched without any bias or anticipation, which was a good thing.<br/><br/>People complain about the lack of ""explanation"", but why is it necessary? The whole apocalypse is nonsense to begin with and it's just the factor of the whole ""end-of-the-world"" background setting, it's just like zombie or global warming or Ebola. You don't need to know why or what. You just accept it. And the director doesn't have to give the audience any satisfaction of ""fighting against the unknown evil and defeating it"", because it doesn't matter!<br/><br/>What matters is the humanity and the transformation of the characters in it. You see the two a**holes steal the car. You see the coward turn into a hero, albeit not convincing coz you just don't overcome your cowardice in a minute. You see how differently your aspects change according to which side of the door you're on. None of these is new or mind-blowing moral arguments, but they're well knit and hence make it a good story.<br/><br/>However, there is one thing I hate about it. Humanity is supposed to be more ugly and people are supposed to be more selfish than it is in the film. When Malori was forced to decide which kid to be the one risking his/her life, the audience knows immediately that director/author deliberately created this dilemma for the audience to ask themselves what their choice would be. And stop kidding yourself--most people would choose the one that's not your kid with no doubt, and the kid would be crying and refuse to comply, and then everyone would just die lol But because it's Sandra Bullock, and because it's a ""film"", ergo it's supposed to be bright and selfishless.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, I still quite enjoy the film and don't mind watching it a second time."

"farisrasul","6","0","1","31 October 2019"," Beware -- sans eyes
","Fear gets amplified when it is amorphous and sticky to the atmosphere and without any tangible physicality. There have been many films that capitalize on an unknown entity pulling up jerks and cries in the people and stifling any ray of comfort, to strike through one's pale persona. The evil only gets bitter to the senses, when there is nothing to hide from. The breeze itself becomes a presage to all the devilish overtures and what remains is a sense of unknowability. You no longer remain inside the bony shell; fear dissipates you into the niches of everywhere. I watched the Bird Box, starring Sandra Bullock - yes, the Oscar winner - and what this movie actually does is, profess the all-roundness of fear and that it can bombard you with everything wrong even if some Frankenstein monster is not coming onto you, with its vociferous monstrosity. The movie opens up with bubbles roving over the lake somewhere bound in by a rainforest and Bullock rowing the water with a plank, while seated in a canoe with her two kids. There's an outbreak of a certain kind and what really shadows everything under its clout is a fear to even see into the out. Eyes, being the points of entry, are the most prone to this viral enigma; that has pitted everyone against it. Eyeballs turn pale with darker lines jutting into the outer membrane and what really follows ahead is a systematic end to one's life and boy, gone it is. The movie has an intangible fear set up into the atmospheric niches and that follows everyone and it is this inability to tap into it, that makes it a boon for mystery-movie-guzzlers. It doesn't really swipe into your heart and embosses an impression but still revives a certain chord; of uncharted character of fear. Visuals like a woman striking her head into a windowpane, drivers diverting from the lanes and crashing into others, people getting mentally toppled and turning into suicidal freaks; make up for a different movie and that I believe, is something that eminently characterizes the Bird Box. Horror should have a deeper undertone; it shouldn't just creep into outright blows or spooky shout-outs, rather it should evolve into a mystery and in that, it doesn't relieve the viewer of the later conundrum, that he would - if it's a real hair-splitter - find himself in, even after the film has clapped its blinders on the watchers. The films in which I find horror professionally matted onto the screen hence, bringing out a textured layout of terror are namely: The Conjuring series, The Shining and such other flicks. In the Conjuring, you have a house terrorized by an occult entity and in the Shining - one of my favorites - you have a man overwhelmed by terrifying isolation of the hotel and much more. The Bird Box wasn't one of those movies which I would admire with my loins ungirded but it should be a one-time watch; because of its invisibility of fear itself and also because of the astounding performance by Bullock onto the screen. Just to hear her accent on a televised reel is something one would dunk in money for. Bird Box doesn't really stump you like a real-time horror flick as it doesn't have the innate makings of what makes up a film soul-peeling; as one might find out in other mainstream horror movies. It's more of modernized version of how such horror films would be, in the near future. In this, we have fear getting infused into one's conscious through eyes and that plucks out all the neural capabilities of its host and then the body plays host to the parasitic fear. The way it has been conceptualized - the fear - is quite astounding and it could be brought into analogy with many of the ills of today like excessive periods of time spent over radiation-emitting devices and as has been scientifically verified, it does produce some chemical reactions within one's mind and procreates many other conditions. Bird Box isn't the best movie out there; it is connotatively rich and does produce some horrific rushes within one's body but they aren't much profound as one would have sought in other such movies. The movie just touches another dimension of horror and in that it does a good job in introducing a newer version of how to get horrified. Another movie that could be leagued with it, is The Silence. It doesn't differ much in its tone than the Bird Box, and it uses the similar cinematic tools to defy horror: a movement done is a sure forebode of danger. In The Silence, we have an apocalyptic outbreak of ghoul-footed creatures prying over sounds. A sound made would make way to their highly-sensitive ears and they would run to eat them with a ruthless clutch. Both the movies have taken on a wholly different turn; with each skimming the fear from sensual experiences."

I knew the basic premise about needing to be blindfolded throughout the movie and that was about it. But, it truly tells a story (with a ridiculous concept) that keeps you intrigued. While watching, I completely forgot how ridiculous it was. I was pulled into the movie, feeling the emotions the cast felt. There's a ""Sophie's Choice"" moment on the river that I could not help but cry. I was concerned about the ending based on a few reviews I read beforehand, but I was not disappointed at all.<br/><br/>This is simply a must watch for the ""average"" moviegoer!"

","What 'Bird Box' is, is a better-realized version of the infamous M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Happening'. Yet, this movie doesn't quite reach its full potential. An unknown, unseen and unexplained power (these are called monsters in the movie) forces people to commit violent suicides. The visuals are gorgeous and the film has a hauntingly ominous atmosphere. Sandra Bullock is a brutal force and carries the whole movie on her shoulders. The rest of the characters are quite trivial and flat (well, except John Malkovich's Douglas, but that is because of John Malkovich). Still, 'Bird Box' is quite an alright movie, especially if you like atmospheric horror films. And Sandra Bullock's highly dedicated performance is the reason alone to watch this movie. Just drop your suspense of disbelief and lower your logical thinking, and you might enjoy this chilly ride."

The ""thing"" with came to nothing, without a reason and no one can see just feel the desire to kill himself/herself it seems like this disorder. The main character is Sandra Bullock, whom was pregnant and begin a fight to survive. Most part of the movie she acts too rational and just focus on survive, it is like nowadays when people are too focused on their career and social status don't belong to other important stuff, like mental healthy or a good relationship with the people around us. In this movie children represent the hope, the reason that Melorie choose to fight, is the light at the end of a tunnel and make a comparison with process to dealing with this injury - the therapy."

","The thesis of this movie had great potential, it is just a shame how they ended up structuring the story.

It seems if you don't look at the enemy they can't really do anything but make you hear voices of long dead people...so without the evil humans it is lackluster.<br/><br/>Anyway it doesn't really cost the maker anything to just give us a nice creature to look at at the end.

"jboothmillard","6","0","2","8 August 2019"," Bird Box
","A Quiet Place was a brilliant scary movie that used the sense of sound, or rather sensory deprivation, to create fear, this Netflix produced film does almost the same thing, using the sense of sight, directed by Susanne Bier (Serena, The Night Manager). Basically, in a post-apocalyptic world, Malorie Hayes (Sandra Bullock) tells two young children, known only as Boy (Julian Edwards) and Girl (Vivien Lyra Blair), that they will be going downstream on a river in a rowing boat. She strictly instructs them never to remove their blindfolds, or else they will die. Malorie's story goes back and forth in time, separated by five years, until they conjoin: her attempt to navigate the river and the events that led to it. Five years earlier, Malorie is pregnant and visited by her sister Jessica (Sarah Paulson) for a routine check-up in hospital. A new report on television tells of unexplained mass suicides taking place in Romania and spreading across Europe. When leaving the hospital, Malorie sees a woman bashing her head into a glass panel, followed by panic erupting in town. Malorie realises the ""violence"" has now reached North America, Jessica tries to drive them away from it. But Jessica experiences the phenomenon affecting the masses, she sees an invisible entity, which causes her to lose control, and deliberately cause the car to crash. An injured Malorie witnesses Jessica walk into the path of an oncoming truck, killing herself. Malorie runs through the mass chaos on the streets, until a woman named Lydia (Rebecca Pidgeon) invites her into her house for safety, even though her husband Douglas (John Malkovich) disagrees. But as she does so, Lydia goes into a trance, begins talking to her dead mother, and casually climbs into a burning car, which explodes. Malorie is rescued and brought into the house by Tom (Moonlight's Trevante Rhodes). One of the survivors, Charlie (Get Out's Lil Rel Howery), has somewhat comprehensive knowledge of what could be happening. He theorises that demonic entities have invaded Earth, taking the form of their victims' worst fears and traumas, driving them insane before causing them to commit suicide. At the insistence of Tom, they cover all windows in the house and blindfold themselves whenever they must venture outside. Later, Greg (Jurassic Park's BD Wong) volunteers to tie himself to a chair while monitoring the surveillance cameras to find evidence of the entity, he falls victim after seeing it and kills himself by rocking his chair violently and slamming his head into a hearthstone. The group are soon joined by new survivor Olympia (Danielle Macdonald), who is also pregnant, and they find that supply of food is decreasing. Using masking tape and the satellite navigation, most of the group drive to the supermarket where Charlie worked to restock. Malorie finds pet birds and decides to take them along with their supplies. Charlie hears a co-worker begging for help, he accidentally causes himself to get locked outside with him, the group contemplate helping him, but Malorie notices the birds going into a hysterical fury. The group is attacked by the infected co-worker, he was not killed by the entities but is instead used to infect others. Charlie sacrifices himself to save the others, who are able to make it back safely to the house. Sometime later, fellow survivors Felix (rapper Machine Gun Kelly, aka Colson Baker) and Lucy (Alita: Battle Angel's Rosa Salazar) steal the car and drive away. Later, Olympia lets stranger and apparent lone survivor Gary (Tom Hollander) into the house, although Douglas objects. Douglas gets extremely upset and threatens the others with a shotgun, he is knocked unconscious by elderly survivor Cheryl (Jacki Weaver) and imprisoned in the garage. Later, Olympia and Malorie go into labour, and Cheryl helps with the births. Gary starts drawing various entities and goes into a trance, indicating that he was already partially overtaken by the entity when he arrived. He opens the garage door to kill Douglas. He peeks outside and is completely taken over; he then knocks out Tom and proceeds to remove all the coverings from all the windows. Despite Malorie's warnings, Olympia fails to look away from the windows, is overtaken by the entity and jumps out of the window. Gary forces Cheryl to look, she is also overtaken and grabs a pair of scissors to stab herself in the neck. Douglas blindly attempts to kill Gary with a shotgun but fails, Gary kills him stabbing him the scissors. Malorie tries to protect the new-born babies, her boy and Olympia's girl, Tom recovers consciousness in time to overpower and kill Gary. Five years later, Tom and Malorie are living together with the children. They receive a transmission from Rick (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a survivor stating that they are well and safe at a community hidden in the forest. The four decide to go to the community but are ambushed by a group of infected survivors along the way. Tom tries to distract the group, while Malorie and the children make an escape, but the group notice them. Tom sacrifices himself, opening his eyes to shoot the group dead, he is then overtaken by one of the entities, he is able to shoot the last member of the group before shooting himself. Malorie, the children, and the pet birds, kept in a cardboard box to protect them, make their way blindfolded down the river in a boat. On the way, they fight off an infected survivor, and survive raging rapids. The boat is overtaken by the rough water, but Malorie, Boy and Girl are able to find each other. The three are separated when Malorie accidentally slips down a hill. Voices of the entities, pretending to be Malorie, attempt to convince Boy and Girl to remove their blindfolds. Malorie is able to tell them to fight the urge. Once reunited again, they are chased by the entity, implied by invisible forces (wind) moving through the trees. Malorie and the children eventually reach the community, a former school for the blind. Malorie releases the pet birds from the box to the other birds up on the ceiling, she knows they have found somewhere to settle, and finally gives the children names: Tom and Olympia. Also starring Parminder Nagra as Dr. Lapham, and Frank Mottek as News Anchor. Bullock is terrific as the leading heroine, Rhodes is likeably charismatic, Malkovich does his usual scathing thing, and other supporting cast members, Howery and Weaver, do alright as well. It is a high-concept tale, mysterious creatures who, once glimpsed, causing them to commit suicide or become homicidal psychopaths, there are a good amount of shocks and eerie moments, I agree it is not as inventive as A Quiet Place (released the same year), but it is a most worthwhile post-apocalyptic science-fiction horror thriller. Good!"
"joshpietzcker","4","0","1","7 August 2019"," I'll sum it up real quick...
","Here we have a story that doesn't take 2 hours to tell, but was stretched to fo just that. Basically we have this plot; A phenomenon occurs that causes most people to kill them selves (but doesn't affect birds) and sets up the story of a woman who doesn't love her kids enough to name them. She travels 38+ hours down a river and through a forest with no GPS and no vision and happens to quite literally stumble upon the doorstep of her intended destination. Somehow this makes her love her children after all. But don't ask exactly why... in fact, don't waste your time on the very few other questions they try to grab your attention with because none of them are explained."

","You never get to find out what is following them. Nothing is ever explained and yet, it gets so much hype. Why?
The concept is easy to comprehend: a strange entity causes victims to commit suicide when they ""see it"". What ""it"" is is still unknown to me and you never find out. The only thing I enjoyed was just how good the young child actors were.<br/><br/>I struggle to find anything positive to say about a movie that tells you nothing, but demands you watch on anyway.

It is a supernatural horror, mystery film with a little of drama, I believe it is mysterious because it misses a lot of expositions, you can guess and say they are monsters or creature of some kind for instance blackhole livings or something but the truth is unknown.
I rated the film 7 because it's bang average.It has a medium intensity, a little machination and a little entertainment it works just fantastically if you're bored. Overall it was almost forgettable and not exceptional experience with a frustrating ending and some will deem it insulting.
I have regard for the concept, but it could have been better!
The plot is pretty good in theory however, they went wrong and made plain mistakes by making each death expected, predictable and almost set-up.
I can say that the movie is saved from a total disgrace by dint of Sandra Bullock's talent.
Regrettably I feel pretty let down. I wouldn't say it's a bad film the performance cast is great and the premise is fine but all of it is potentially lame."

We've seen a bunch of movies with warped scenarios in a way, either mystery or crime movies etc. But in most of these films, that whole weird situation makes sense at some point in the end. Yet, in birdbox, it didn't, at least for me. It's mostly a story about survival. That isn't necessarily bad, but in this particular case the whole concept was pointless.
On the other hand though, this movie has good actors, filming, sound effects etc. I wasn't disappointed at all from that perspective. It is certainly a good production.

"OneAnjel","5","0","2","15 June 2019"," a message sold to the wrong audience
","This film was poorly done, considering it had 2 mega stars. The stars seemed out of place: Malcovich seemed like he was playing Shakespeare to a HS class; Bullock seemed like she was bored and just finished reading her part moments before shooting the scene.
But it's definitely not a post apocalyptic film; it's not about surviving after a holocaust. It's about hope.
For me, the final moments of the film - the message of hope - was worth sitting through the meandering of the film until then. It was a lot of meandering and yet, looking back you realize that the film was setting the stage for what it was; too many people complain about what it wasn't. The trailer that makes it look like a post apocalyptic piece is appealing to the wrong audience.
I especially was disappointed in Bullock. She was never my fav actor but I think she really was miscast here. Not only is she too old to play the part of a pregnant woman who manhandles a rifle and has the attention of a 29 y/o hottie, but we can't figure out what age the film wants us to see her, as an introverted artist who got knocked up by a roommate. I actually thought she looked a lot older than 54 in many of the shots.
I did not read the book, but I feel safe in saying it was probably a lot better entertainment. that is often the case with book-to-film. Steven King has said
there are only 2 accurately done films of his novels. The rest were disappointments - at least for him."

Not quite a horror film as such, it has touches of The mist, A Quiet Place, and The Happening sprinkled throughout, fortunately a lot more to do with the former two than with the latter. It's entertaining, if never as gripping as its opening contagion scene. Tropes and cliches abound, the stakes are drastically reduced by the storytelling mechanics alternating between two timelines, and the supporting characters are one-note. Yet, the movie is enjoyable to watch and moderately suspenseful even though the hazy rules of its universe prevent the scenario from eliciting flat out terror."

","The film is not without its effective set pieces and suspenseful moments, but sustaining that suspense with the building threat of seeing two children commit suicide just makes the entire film seem cheap and exploitative. Rather than embrace the tawdry 'B-movie' shocks bubbling beneath the surface, the director and cast instead insist on treating the material like they're in a prestige pic while never finding the emotional heart, psychological depth, or cultural significance of its central premise. Because of this jarring disconnect between tone and material, the film fails to work as a literary art film or as a genre thriller."

Malorie (Sandra) is also scared that she won't be able to connect to the child she is carrying.<br/><br/>The movie overall isn't about jumpscares or a plot that is always moving forward in a fast paste, sometimes it might feel a bit slow. People are usually complaining about not getting the origin story about these creatures but that isn't the focus point with this movie. People love getting answers to everything but when the world as we know it ends you probably won't get the answers you so desperately seeks for. If you want to know the answer to everything that is happening, you won't enjoy this movie all the way through, you will feel this movie is lacking something. This movie isn't perfect it's not too alike a quiet place either since the story isn't the same. This movie is not perfect but it is a good movie.

"Front-Row-Reviews","6","0","1","11 April 2019"," JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10)
","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>""Bird Box"" is not a movie to understand. It's a movie to experience. We are taken on a long, arduous journey with our film's main character, Malorie (played by Sandra Bullock), when the world literally goes crazy. People suddenly lose their grip on reality and begin committing suicide all around her, including her own sister. Though she doesn't see anything, they seem to and it drives them to the very edge.<br/><br/>The movie is presented in two parts: the present day where she is traveling precariously with two 5-year-old children simply known as ""Girl"" and ""Boy"", and in flashbacks that slowly catches you up to the present day. I say precariously, because in order to remain safe, they have to wear blindfolds while they travel, to keep from seeing this strange entity that causes people to become suicidal. They follow the course of a river that will hopefully lead them to a safe haven, a compound, from whatever has taken over the world.<br/><br/>Nothing is explained. You never find out what is behind this or why. Only that it is happening and what people are having to do to survive. As you follow along with Malorie, there are some intense and gripping moments - and these are well filmed. The only problem was that once we reach the film's climax, it just kind of falls flat and then you have the ending. It leaves you feeling unsatisfied - sort of like seeing a delicious meal prepared but then not being able to eat any of it.<br/><br/>I guess this comes as a recommend, but not a very high one. The story builds, the cinematography and intrigue is there - but then it sinks at the end and just leaves you sitting there to watch the end credits with nothing having really been resolved ... I guess. Still, it was well made and enjoyable up until that time."

","It is decent but it also fails here and there. It tries to be something it just doesn't achieve. It feels forced to please the critics.<br/><br/>One argument critics lately seem to care a lot about is character development. To me that always has been relative, i never took that too seriously as long as the rest was fun to watch. But here the movie just tries too hard to be different on that but falls flat on it. Because it is based on well known stereotypical characters who just end up doing the opposite of what you would expect but you see it coming from miles away.<br/><br/>The horror element is lacking also. You never feel scared or threatened. There is no build up to the people dying and their deaths are never really terrifying. Just in the beginning when some random people die there is something promising to see but when the main characters die, it's boring.<br/><br/>And than there is the family thing, a single mother of 2. Yes that part is kinda interesting but also it doesn't go deep enough.<br/><br/>In the end i feel it tries to be a combination of all those things but it is just average in it. It's alright and it has its moments but it could have been much better."

","I personally found the movie okay-ish good. Like a good one time watch, but I won't re-watch it or recommend it as such. Although it portrays as horror, the movie mostly just seems to be a thriller.<br/><br/>The movie has nothing special to offer. It is set in a typical apocalyptic world, with strange creatures that can't be seen and won't attack until you see them. OK, so this is a new concept, but the way it plays out is like any typical Zombie movie. First all the survivors are locked in a house, running out of ration, go to a grocery store or some place to rob, slowly start losing team members.<br/><br/>The plot. The plot is a little unexplained. The makers want to keep you focused on the horror, but there isn't that much horror anyways, and on top of that you don't even give answers to what the creatures are, why and how are they coming to Earth. I wanted more answers and I kept on thinking I will get them by the end, but nothing.<br/><br/>Also, why does she hate the girl child so much? Why does she only name them girl or boy? I understand it a life and death situation but that just seemed stupid to me.<br/><br/>Overall, there was no horror, no explanation, no story as such (pretty much generic), acting was OK (nothing that deserves a standing ovation), no character development (I couldn't connect with them), and very limited action.<br/><br/>Not worth the hype at all."

","What happens when you combine the premise of people committing suicide from The Happening and an entity attacking us based on our senses a la A Quiet Place? Bird Box? Yeah this movie combines both concepts and it is not a ripoff but rather a unique baby that isn't perfect but quite intense with zero jumps scares and less corniness. The scene where our society breaks out of order in the beginning is intense as hell and the part where the entity possesses these individuals is scary and lacks the corniness of The Happening, where the individuals there commits suicide in quite a funny or cornier way. Even the part where the survivors have to survive on their own during the flashback scenes is intense as hell. The only part where the movie feels less intense and gives me a mixed feeling is during the current scenes in the first-second acts in the movie. Whenever the movie does that it felt less intense and no doubt the slow and suspense is there, it felt a bit off and when the third act comes in, it creates an uneven tone but nevertheless I was still invested in the story. Overall, I highly recommend this movie if you are into this post-apocalyptic kind of movies as I find it a worthy entry in the genre and if you liked A Quiet Place or dislike it for its jump scares or lack of gore, you might enjoy this more. For sure it is way more serious than The Happening (Thats unintentionally funny. I wanna see that again for sure)."

"joelshibujs","5","0","1","13 March 2019"," Rip-off or Revolutionary?
","For a period of time, memes featuring blindfolded individuals have been running rampant across the internet. The humour this film has garnered is ironic compared to the serious yet somewhat predictable storyline consisting mainly of an invisible monster(s) that runs rife and drives people insane by simply being seen. Regardless, Netflix has strained to make Josh Malerman's book into some enthralling, original film that simply falls flat.
In essence the film is about our pregnant protagonist (Malorie) who watches the world collapse as an epidemic emerges and people spontaneously decide to kill themselves. Amidst the chaos that unfolds, she watches the death of her sister and finds herself with a group of vastly different characters in a mansion. Together, they hypothesise that there must be something outside that corrupts people's minds and forces them to commit suicide. As the days become weeks and weeks become months, the herd has thinned and Malorie is in charge of a small family who must occasionally venture out into the desolate cities to find resources - blindfolded. Sound familiar? You wouldn't be wrong to understand why many claim this plot is awfully similar to A Quiet Place which was another hugely successful film and consisted of our characters being stripped of a sense (speaking) and forced to survive as a family.
The story tells two tales simultaneously, as in it switches from present time and how Malorie ended up in the position she is in. As the story progress the two timelines match very seamlessly and parallels between both timelines are executed cleverly. This gives the opportunity to introduce dilemmas in one timeline which the other resolves and adds a layer of intrigue and tension.
But the storyline feels very formulaic at times, yes it has the occasional ""twists"" or ""turns"" with new ""unexpected"" threats. In fact, my cousin and I concluded that the survivors would be the blind during the first half of the film - and we were spot on. It makes an effort to try and stand out but the introduction of some evil people who were miraculously immune to this epidemic was not surprising and reminiscent of The Walking Dead (you'll get what I mean if you watch it).
Personally, I find it frustrating that the monster is never revealed but by keeping this a secret is a double-edged sword; it digresses from the typical ""scary monster"" genre and keeps the viewer rapt. On the contrary, it becomes mildly ridiculous watching grown adults sprinting away from a gust of wind that scatters leaves - that is often how the creature is portrayed. Although films with the absence of an antagonist (or monster) is uncommon, Bird Box has used little imagination to illustrate its existence and the memory of A Quiet Place is too fresh in our minds. However, it is not impossible to have a frightening creature that is rarely seen, as depicted by The Thing.
Despite the fact that Bird Box seems to have taken scraps of ideas from a variety of very successful films, it remains a wild mashup of other films whose standards it desperately tries to match. The film itself is generic with little to nothing which is particularly new or original, however it has some faintly creative and unorthodox aspects - but that may not necessarily mean it is a masterpiece. It is easily forgettable and perhaps the memes will outlast the film at this rate."

","During the movie i enjoyed it just about the whole time but there was some things that did not feel as polished as it could and should have been. One of these things are the 2 time frames. Why this bothered me was because they kept switching back and forth, and if you thought about it you can realize that everyone is going to die. That is why the deaths in this movie (with the exception of Jessica) did not affect me as much as they could have if they came to me as a surprise. Another thing that I did not enjoy was the characters. Now yes I did enjoy some but most made awful decisions (typical horror movie decisions) The only people i liked was Greg, Malorie, Charlie, Cheryl, Tom, Douglas, and Jessica. Boy and Girl were not the best actors but i don't expect much from little kids. Some things did not feel finished in this movie. When Gary had the black paintings i felt two things; 1. I was disappointed that they did not keep what they looked like a mystery. ( Yes I know it wasn't exactly what they looked like but i liked the mystery) and 2. They did nothing else with the paintings, you saw them a couple of times and then nothing really was done with them. The last thing i will bring up before we go to why I enjoyed it is this. How in the world did they make a school for the blind next the a dangerous river, and in the forest? I get that it is for effect but that is very unrealistic. Now, on to why I enjoyed it. I enjoyed this for multiple reasons. One was because it was not a original plot but they made it original in its own way. They also had some good actors/actresses. ( Like i said i did not like some of the acting or the characters but i liked most). The most thing i enjoyed about the whole movie was that at the end it felt more of a family movie. I don't know. i liked that."
"alexmichalski","6","0","1","21 February 2019"," Pretty good, but not the best.
","I really enjoyed the majority of Bird Box, but a couple of things let it down for me. Firstly, it feels quite long. This isn't always a bad thing, but in this case the last 30 minutes really started to drag, and I think it could have benefited from a 90 minute run time.<br/><br/>My other issue with it is that we never actually see the monsters that are causing the suicides. The ending of the movie seems like it's building up to show us what they look like, but it never happens. I understand that this is intentional, and it could be argued that it would be impossible for the audience to see them, as every character sees them differently; they see whatever thing would drive them to suicide. However, there's concept art online for the monsters, and the design is really great, so it's a bit baffling that they never show them.<br/><br/>Other than these two issues, the movie is actually really enjoyable! It's tense, with some scary moments, and there's a constant feeling of danger. The characters are also written and acted well, and the relationships between various members of the main groups are interesting to see develop.<br/><br/>Overall, Bird Box could be better, but it could also be a lot worse. Give it a watch if you have a couple of hours to spare."
"david-meldrum","7","0","1","19 February 2019"," Engaging and entertaining, if never quite fulfilling its potential despite Sandra Bullock's excellent performance
","There's been some strong opinions expressed about this film; the heat around it seems to have been ratcheted up by Netflix telling us it's their most viewed original release, equivalent to massive box office had it been given a cinematic release. I also can't help but feel some of the online vitriol would have been lesser had it not been both directed by and starred women. Either way, it comes as little surprise to discover that it's not as bad as some of the hate directed towards it suggests. It doesn't benefit from thematic and plot similarities with the superior A Quiet Place. It's set in a - you guessed it - dystopian future where a glimpse of ... something we never see ... leads the individual who sees it to immediately commit suicide. The film takes place in two different time streams - one in the immediate aftermath of the crisis hitting one city, in which the pregnant Sandra Bullock is caught up. The other is five years on, with that same mother and two children (named 'Boy' and 'Girl') attempting to make their way on a raft down a river to a possible safe haven. It's never less than engaging, and Sandra Bullock is superb as she channels a potent cocktail of spoken and unspoken paranoia, fear, insecurity and maternal feelings into a race for survival. There are false notes - John Malkovich is either badly miscast or very badly written (probably both) as a grumpy survivor of the initial crisis. In that same time frame, the dystopian trope of whether incomers to the group should be trusted is never convincingly handled. On the plus side, one of those outsiders is Tom Holland, an actor capable of great complexity and always one I relish watching; his part is engagingly handled. The main weakness is, though, that the film can't quite decide what it wants to be: a horror-thriller, a film for adults, a film accessible to children, a film about family and specifically motherhood, a survival thriller, a reflection on our fear of mental health issues ... or more. It takes no central decision, so several thematic threads are frustratingly left hanging; the outstanding, leaner A Quiet Place settled on the horror-thriller format and in doing so found profound expression for its themes, even given a shorted running time. As a result, Bird Box's emotional pay off at the end doesn't quite take flight, and the film's titular metaphor feels clumsy. But still; I was never bored, and Sandra Bullock's performance is worth it on its own."

","This movie was OK, but certainly did not live up to the hype.<br/><br/>Bird Box wasn't bad because it has unanswered questions. A lot of movies leave us with thousand unanswered questions. I'm okay with not having answers but this movie is bad because it has nothing to offer us.
Even without any answers, there still could have been scary or shocking moments, action, character development... something.<br/><br/>It's full of clichés like searching for provisions, dealing with conflicts within the group, and watching fellow group members die. Nothing new.
There are no interesting characters. Each and everyone of them is so cliché, smart superhero, selfish white guy, pregnant blonde, black geek and already dead old lady. I hated them all. I mean come one people, really?<br/><br/>After an hour into the movie, it's five years later, we still have no idea about anything regarding the entities and their origin, nature, aim. Nothing.
The group now consists of only Bullock, the two children and the protector and only proves us how unnecessary and stupid the presence of all the other characters were, because we have known since the opening of the film, that Bullock will live, and all we're doing at this point is watching to see how everyone else dies a somewhat slapstick horror comedic sort of way.<br/><br/>The worst part of this movie was probably the dull, cheesy and cliché
dialogue. It definitely is the worst part of the making.<br/><br/>To balance it out. Bird Box is not entirely a bad movie. It is well shot and has decent cinematography.
The scenes where Bullock must scold her children on the boat under the safety of a blanket are by far my favorit scenes. The little girl by the way delivers really natural and emotional performances.
Another good scene in Bird Box was when the initial survivors ran out of food and had to make a trip to the grocery store.
These scenes pretty much sums up all the originality in this movie.<br/><br/>I wouldn't necessarily call this a waste of time. The story is actually quite interesting, but no one managed to put a well-packed plot, quality performances and a good dialogue together to make Bird Box one of the best movies of 2018. It's watchable but not necassary.

"tomgillespie2002","4","0","1","13 February 2019"," A missed opportunity
","Perhaps it's because the dystopian survival horror has been done to death of late, or maybe it's because John Krasinski's vastly superior and similarly themed A Quiet Place is still fresh in the mind, but there's something strangely hollow about Netflix's latest smash-hit and water-cooler conversation starter. Bird Box became the inspiration for a series of dangerous YouTube stunts that resulted in the social media platform issuing a warning to anyone thinking about taking part in the 'Bird Box Challenge', but sadly, given the film's potential, this is perhaps all it will be remembered for in the years to come. All the pieces are in place for a tense 90 minutes, but Oscar-winning director Susanne Bier's film plays out over a mostly dull 2-and-a-bit hours, with little more than two memorable set-pieces and a strong central performance from Sandra Bullock to hold it all together.<br/><br/>Like an uneasy blend A Quiet Place and The Happening, the planet has been overrun by a mysterious force that causes people to go insane and commit suicide. While the family of Krasinski's memorable horror were forbidden to make any sounds, the players in Bird Box aren't permitted to see. Just one glance at the unknown creatures stalking the streets will cause their eyes to turn a murky purple and instantly seek a way of ending their own life, and when we first meet Malorie (Bullock), she is about to embark on a dangerous journey down river with two children in the hope of locating a sanctuary they heard about over a walkie-talkie. Flash back five years, and the pregnant Malorie witnesses the collapse of society first-hand, as a routine car ride back from the hospital turns into a mindless bloodbath. She escapes into the home of shouty misanthrope Douglas (John Malkovich), and is forced to hole up with a bunch of genre archetypes (played by Trevante Rhodes, Jacki Weaver, Rosa Salazar, BD Wong and Lil Rel Howery, amongst others).<br/><br/>With the doors locked and the windows covered up, it seems like Malorie and her new friends have it made. But for reasons never entirely explained, the creatures don't drive everybody to suicide. If you're crazy, you are instead driven to expose those lucky enough to be hiding out to the mysterious force. It might be an attempt to keep things cryptic, or it may be sheer laziness, but the rules of the game remain frustratingly unexplained. These creatures - who we never see - sometimes announce their presence with a gust of wind, and sometimes not. One person infected will immediately jump out of a window, but another will take minutes to turn, allowing them time to say something meaningful before they croak. The monsters clearly possess the power to move objects, so why don't they at least try to enter homes? We are left to fit the pieces together ourselves, but very little adds up. The likes of Night of the Living Dead and Assault on Precinct 13 sustained a bristly atmosphere by making us care about the characters, but reliable actors like Rhodes and Malkovich are never allowed to be anything more than 'love interest' or 'annoying right-wing nut'. It isn't all bad - one set-piece involving a short car ride to get supplies with only a SatNav computer screen to guide them is wrought with tension - but in the wake of A Quiet Place, which understood the mechanics behind what makes an effective survival horror, Bird Box feels like a missed opportunity."
"thebloodybaker","7","0","2","10 February 2019"," Interestingly different
","For a film about the end of the world, Bird Box manages to scrape by without the gore and gut-wrenching loneliness intrinsic to the genre, but this is thankfully placated for by a lot of drama and tension which sort of carries through the entire movie, plus it has Sandra Bullock and Trevante Rhodes, so it's cool with me."
"Artifam","7","0","2","6 February 2019"," Better than average B-movie.
","At 2 hours run-time you could be put off watching this when taking poor reviews into consideration and particularly if you expect the blindfolded concept to be an imaginatory stretch too far. However, with practical answers quickly offered up in the film as to the mechanics of apocalyptic survival without sight you can begin to suspend disbelief and settle into the plot development. Strong acting, and for that matter an incredible cast line-up, help it flow from a sluggish start to a rapid finish, like the river running through the film. Some critics pick up on the weak character development, but it's wrong to get too bogged down in irrelevant back stories that could just needlessly dilute the storyline. Bullock is a tour de force (as always) and certainly adds credibility to what could easily be a lame duck horror-thriller if acted out by unknown actors. The demons (or whatever spectre name they may be assigned) are, and remain, a largely unexplained mystery, along with a box of other miscellaneous loose threads. Nevertheless, the trick is to just go with the flow and not over-analyse what is overall a better than average B-movie."

"oliviaamoako","6","0","2","3 February 2019"," Horror, but interestin!!
","After hearing so much about birdbox on social media, it made me curious about the movie, so I decided to check it out. Bird box is a high budget thriller horror movie that involves a lot of violence, blood, and terrifying images. This movie kept me in suspense to know what was going to happen to the mother and her two children. The movie started out great and then all of a sudden, there comes a scene in the hospital where people start to go crazy, to the point that they kill themselves because they have completely lost their minds. I started to close my eyes because it kind of made me scared, since I usually don't watch horror movies , but after all the hype of the movie, I stayed to finish the entire movie. I won't say it's a terrible movie, but I'll say the message of the movie was that one always has to be ready for challenges at all times. Because of an outbreak that happened in the world, it made the mother and her two kids to find solutions on how to survive the outbreak. The movie went viral and this caused a lot of people to watch it, but I didn't agree on people making challenges out of the movie. It was all over Instagram, #birdboxchallenge. For example, people would put blindfolds on whilst driving. In Utah, a teen crashed into a car, while driving blindfolded. This act is very dangerous, and people shouldn't involve themselves in treacherous activities."

"michielodb","6","0","2","3 February 2019"," Nothing special
","I watched this movie with my girlfriend the other day. What's better than a good horrormovie we thought? Since Birdbox was getting a lot of buzz and it was on Netflix, naturally we decided to watch it. Now I had to really strengthen myself to not start talking about all the flaws that I saw (talking about an awkward date).<br/><br/>On first notice I would say that this movie is a mix of ""A Quiet Place"" and ""The Happening"". The first one is actually a really good thriller, the second one...yeah not so much, so it was pretty weird. Is it as good as all the Facebook messages were saying which we kept seeing the past months? No, definitely not. Is it one of the worst horrormovies ever made? No. It's actually a perfect movie if you are with a bunch of friends, or your girlfriend, and you just want to have an easy-going thrillride.<br/><br/>If your movie starts with a monologue of a seriously overacting Sandra Bullock, I was holding my breath because I was preparing myself for 2 hours of just plain bad stuff. At the end, it actually wasn't as bad as I presumed.<br/><br/>The good stuff: The idea of being blindfolded the entire time is a good idea, although it does feel like a copy of ""A Quiet Place"", but just a little bit different if you know what I'm saying. The acting is fine, not great, just fine. There's nothing really memorable about the techniques used, it's all pretty standard, not bad, just basic. There are some pretty good intense scenes near the end of the film that did surprise me a little bit, but since the movie is 2 hours long, 3 good scenes isn't really enough.<br/><br/>That's what my main issue is with the movie: It's just so basic. There's nothing memorable about it. The plot is something we've all seen before, just remixed a little bit. The characters are all basic and stereotypical. One character, who gratefully isn't in the movie that much, was really unbearingly annoying (SPOILER: This girl's first line is: ""I'm a cop!"" Then 5 minutes later she has sex with some random junkie we don't even know and then 15 minutes later she drives off with that junkie together with all of the food our main characters had gathered. Yeah nice cop you are.). The climax isn't really a climax, it at least doesn't feel like it, it feels more like a quick action scene that ends within 1 minute. The movie also feels a little bit too long, once we get the point and we are all caught up, the movie reaches it's final destination, but then it decides to add a whole other ""scary"" scene, and it really felt unnecessary.<br/><br/>Bird Box is not a great film, I would even doubt to say that it's a good film. It's the definition of a standard, basic thriller with nothing special about it, that's just good for having a fun time with your friends and some beer.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a well-deserved 6/10"

"pearlinasilverbasin","5","0","2","30 January 2019"," Excellent Acting, But Poor Visualisation (pun intended)
","(This is a long review but it's spoiler free. First, I discuss what I disliked about the movie, then what I liked about it. TL;DR at the bottom.)
Humanity is on the brink of extinction after strange creatures spread over the earth. Anyone who sees these creatures commits suicide afterwards. In the midst of this chaos (or silence) one mother undertakes a dangerous journey to keep herself and her children safe.<br/><br/>I'll just start by saying that I don't think Bird Box is a bad movie, but it wasn't great either. It played some overused tropes, but what especially bugs me about this movie is how poorly it adapted the book, and even left out things that I thought made the book so great. In the book, there is constant tension between the survivors, which only increases as the days go on and food starts running out. Aside from a few arguments and a fight, this tension isn't portrayed convincingly in the film. In the book, you never truly get to know what the creatures look like, because never knowing what the creatures look like adds to the survivors' and the readers' fear of the unknown. Yet in the movie we get to know what they look like through drawings depicting extremely clichéd monsters.
In outside scenes, the creatures' arrival is always announced through blowing wind with leaves, which I felt was an awkward way of 'depicting' them. Yet the director can't be blamed for this. A movie is a visual medium; making a movie about something that can't be visualised is by itself tricky.<br/><br/>What I loved about the movie were its atmosphere and its acting. It takes a lot for me to get scared by a movie, but there were scenes that literally had me at the edge of my seat. The acting was absolutely superb; especially Sandra Bullock (playing Malorie, the main character) managed to get the part of a scared and lonely survivor just right. The chemistry Malorie has with some of the other characters (such as with Olympia) is surprisingly touching, especially with her children Boy and Girl.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Despite excellent acting and surprisingly scary and touching scenes, this movie is clichéd and lacks depth. All in all it's a bit of a poor movie adaptation of a better book."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","2","30 January 2019"," Allegory of motherhood embedded in well-acted sci-fi/fantasy thriller with an excellent ensemble cast
","Released a year right after ""A quiet place"" (for which Emily Blunt just won Best Supporting Actress from Screen Actors Guild), ""Bird box"" inevitably attracted ample comparisons with that movie. But there are plenty of other movies that warrant comparison.<br/><br/>While I am not sure if Bird Box fits into a more specific genre than Sci-fi in general, it has several characteristics in common with other movies:<br/><br/>An after-apocalypse world
Quest in search of a safe haven
A mysterious threat, supernatural or otherwise
Mass suicide
A group of strangers caught in a ""situation"" together, getting killed one after another
Survivors in an essentially dead town going from house to house to savage food and provision<br/><br/>I am not going to match these characteristics to the movies listed below, but will rather leave the fun to the readers:<br/><br/>""28 days later"" (2002)
""I am legend"" (2007)
""The happening"" (2008)
""Resident evil"" (2002) and it's umpteen sequels
""Ten little Indians"" (1965, 1974, 1989)
""I think we're alone now"" (2018)<br/><br/>""Bird Box"" runs in two parallel, cross-cutting sequences: the ""present"" and 5 years ago. Without understanding what has been going on in the last 5 years, there is not much to talk about the ""present"" sequence, which shows a woman and two small children, all blindfolded, journeying in a row boat along a river through forests of towering trees. After each flashback (which follow a simple linear trajectory), the present journey becomes a bit more meaningful. Therefore, let's concentrate on the flashback.<br/><br/>The narrative starts with a visibly pregnant Malorie (Sandra Bullock) visiting her obstetrician, accompanied by her sister Jessica (Sarah Paulson). TV newscasts report apocalypse-scale disasters such as mass suicides in far-away places like Russia. Some comments point to biological warfare, just conjectures.<br/><br/>Then abruptly all hell break loose, as the world around them is plunged into similar chaos in which Jessica dies (throwing Paulson fans like myself into absolute dismay, as this award-winning character-actor simply goes into oblivion in this movie).<br/><br/>Barely surviving a mad stampede of human beings turned mad, Malorie escapes into a house and finds herself among a group of strangers, fellow survivors finding temporary protection from whatever that is killing people en masse outside. Someone calls these killers ""demons"" and ""spiritual creatures"", instrumental to the ""end game"". At this point, what the audience can observe is people (such as Jessica) looking suddenly blank, as if their souls are snatched from them instantaneously. They stare at something which is only visible to themselves. Then, the commit suicide, in whatever horrendous way.<br/><br/>Later in the movie, more about these mysterious, lethal threats are revealed. They are equally deadly when ""seen"" (but never shown to the audience) on a computer monitor via survey cameras mounted in front of the house. An even more terrifying revelation is that they do not make lunatics suicidal but instead turn them into murderers. These converted lunatics, with religious zeal proclaiming that they have seen something ""beautiful"", will force others to come out and see this divine sight, and kill them if they refuse.<br/><br/>Disclosing too many details would take much away from the enjoyment of the movie. From one angle, it shows a group of people stuck together in a desperate situation, how they interact, how they trust, and distrust, each other. As the story is told in flashback, we already know right from the start that the woman and two kids are most likely the only survivors from the group. Very shortly into the story, when another pregnant woman arrives to seek refuge, we also know where the two children come from.<br/><br/>One more thing that requires mentioning is the destination of the river journey: a safe haven advertised over a walkie-talkie type broadcasting. Initially, another survivor is to take part in this quest but he is killed, leaving the trio to face the hazardous journey by themselves.<br/><br/>One of the key attractions of this movie is an excellent ensemble cast, led by Bullock, that includes John Malkovich, Trevante Rhodes, Jackie Weaver, Danielle Macdonald, Lil Rey Howery, Tom Holland, BD Wong and the aforementioned, lamentably brief appearance of Sarah Paulson."

"ergine","6","0","1","29 January 2019"," Wasted potential
","The beginning of Bird Box is gripping. The idea of a visual essence capable of adversely affecting a person's mind is truly frightening. It recalls David Langford's short story BLIT and the concept of the 'basilisk', an image containing patterns that effectively crash the human brain.<br/><br/>The suspense is here, the possibilities are here.<br/><br/>Sadly - and this is the movie's biggest crime - the potential is wasted. The frightful idea is reduced to a monster without substance. And I don't mean physical substance. The monsters need to a have an unconscious meaning for the story to work. And the decision to actually show or not to show them is irrelevant. Mallory's inner struggle to connect with others simply isn't enough to give life to the beings.<br/><br/>Maybe there's some deeper symbolism here that would tie things together, but I can't find it. There are some attempts at substance in the theme of parenthood in a new and hostile environment where the rules have changed. It's precisely the same thing A Quiet Place did, only worse. The only interesting thing is this particular meta-narrative that keeps popping up in contemporary stories.<br/><br/>Ultimately Bird Box boils down to a group of survivors weathering a storm. It explores their relationships instead of the motives and nature of the beings. Many questions are left open, and not in the way an open mystery is used to let the viewer's imagination play a part in the experience.<br/><br/>Why can't the monsters come indoors? They are seemingly unable to cause direct physical harm, so why would anyone run away? Why neuter the threat like this, only to bring other people - the 'crazy ones' - to be the actual physical danger. This reeks of writers trying to patch up the limitations they've created themselves.<br/><br/>And finally, why exactly is the sanctuary a sanctuary? While they cannot be harmed by the beings, how are the blind any match to the crazy ones?<br/><br/>The form of the movie is problematic as well. For one, the movie is too long. The inter-cutting flashbacks quell all suspense. Eventually the movie starts repeating scenes only to underestimate viewers. One quickly loses connection and the emotions no longer come through. The ending falls flat.<br/><br/>It's easy to turn this into a critique of Hollywood movie makers trying not to exclude anyone. The main guideline still seems to be: movies cannot be too smart or too vague or they will alienate potential paying customers. Even Alex Garland's brilliant Annihilation stumbled when forced to explain itself."

","Netflix successfully launched content production. Their main feature is the qualitative implementation of new interesting ideas. The picture is always juicy, decent camera work, the actors play well and are perfectly matched, an unusual and often non-linear plot. All these advantages apply to the movie ""Bird Box"".
The narrative is built around a pregnant woman who is not eager to become a mother. From the conversation of the Jessica and Malorie at the beginning, we can correlate the main character Malorie with a bird in a cage (the studio in which she paints).
Malorie has to be strong and closed, especially in the expression of emotions, she deliberately sets up barriers and she is quite tough. Unfortunately, this dramatic line is not fully disclosed.
By the way, Sandra Bullock miraculously plays her role, but viewer don't empathize her, because the movie don't show us why she became so and what she had to go through, therefore the movie finale doesn't play a big role.
A more important place in the film is the message that people need to clearly see the reality: murder, violence, terror and hopelessness. In such conditions, only mad people can live normally, who became so because of the cruelty of the outside world and people.
What to do the rest? How to raise children in such conditions? Is there any hope? Of course, these questions also give a direct answer: in order to correct the situation, we need to love and protect each other, be able to listen and support, be near during difficult times and even sacrifice yourself if it necessary.
In my opinion, ""Bird Box"" is deeper and smarter than it seems at first sight."

While that works brilliantly for David Lynch and Darren Aronofsky, this one didn't quite pull it off. The writers did an excellent job of creating a plot, only for it to never quite unfold. This was like watching a Halloween campfire story, one that someone with a very creative mind made up on the spot, come to life. It held my interest and drew me in, but to what end? What I know for certain is that there is no answer to that question. The viewer's choices are to find a way to draw some semblance of an ill equipped conclusion, take it at face value and don't try to assign meaning where it doesn't exist, or turn off the movie. I went with the first option, and as such, will need to watch it again. The fact that I actually have the desire to do so is why I gave it six stars."

"boyofthunder","6","0","1","23 January 2019"," Severely underwhelming
","A movie in shambles, Bird Box is the prime example of aiming high and falling short. Despite having a good premise, the movie never seemed to take off.<br/><br/>Starting off with a woman telling her two kids that they are going to row down a river blindfolded and they are to not open their eyes under any circumstance, the movie then cut back and forth between this journey and a series of events revolving around a group of people (the aforementioned woman included) inside a suburban house after an unknown supernatural force made anyone who looks at it either commits suicide or turns into fanatic. Up until this point, Bird Box seems like an interesting mix of A Quite Place and The Walking Dead. Unfortunately, before any of the supporting characters in this group was able to shine, the majority of them either died rather meaningless deaths or simply ran away and disappeared altogether without ever being mentioned again, leaving us with the woman and the two kids, one of which was her own. The two parts eventually merged into one coherent storyline but that was pretty much it as the ending was sadly, underwhelming with the source of this widespread genocide was virtually left untouched.<br/><br/>Another big issue with the movie, aside from the expected goofs, is the over-simplification of navigating in an open, post-apocalyptic world without sight. How a frightened, rather obese pregnant woman was able to travel safely from house to house with chaos reigning outside, blindfolded, is simply unfathomable.<br/><br/>The film assembled a quite strong cast but was not able to utilize their potential as most of their roles were written off quite early in the screenplay, especially that of BD Wong and Sarah Paulson. Sandra Bullock, whose acting repertoire was supposed to elevate the original script from a typical thriller flick with a twist to something so much more, was mediocre in it if not cringy at times.<br/><br/>All in all the movies left a lot to be desired. The plot was indubitably intriguing but perhaps it is better fit for a series rather than a full-length feature film where it fell short. But with Bird Box being Netflix's most watched film in the opening week, its producers can at least be satisfied with the fact that the audience didn't turn a blind eye to their creation."

","This film is very similar to The Happening (2008), ok it is a different story line but the concept is 90% the same.
I also expected that more would happen to the end of the film, but probably we will have to look at the sequel for that.
It was not a bad movie but a bit more inspiration would have made him look less like the happening."

I don't understand why some people think this movie is unfinished. You get to see the creatures by way of the pictures that Gary draws of them, and what does it matter whether they come from outer space, another dimension, or are really the spirits of dead loved ones who are calling them all to join them in the afterlife? You don't really need that answered because it wouldn't make much of a difference to the story anyway. It's a very enjoyable film and if you haven't watched it yet you should give it a chance."

"teetee-67303","8","0","2","22 January 2019"," Well I liked the movie
","I have to be honest and maybe harsh (to some) in this review. This is for the dumb part of people brains who can't seem to comprehend, understand, or in easy words ""just don't get it."" Bird Box in my opinion is about us today now in the present. We are connected (internet, games, movies, music, headphones) and disconnected (human contact, face to face, socializing with others in the same space and/or room) at the same time. One thing I read from reviews is that it doesn't tell us what it is. Why does everything have to be explain plainly? Why should the movie give u an answer to your question? Do you have all the answers to your life? If you do then you're boring. Now back to saying why I feel this movie is about us. The beginning tells part of the movie. I know I didn't see it at first until I watch the movie alone by myself (disconnected), after watching it with my family (connected). The portrait and conversation about the portrait and artist gives you an base idea about the movie. The birds in a box weren't about the freaking birds in a box. The people were in a box (house, store, car, sanctum, hell our minds) once again us now today society. I don't want to discuss the river. Oh I will, if want to add more thought then that could have represented how we go through life. There will be calm, crazy, chaos and peace not in that order. You complain the movie was long and drawn out but you also complain when a movie is too short. Make up your minds people, short or long but it can't be both. The movie gave us viewers a little bit of everything we like love or do . It showed sex, violence, fear, panic, horror, shock, adaptation, chaos, psychos, death, love, conquer, hate etc. Then the movie actually put people together in a house (birds in a box) trying to figure out what's going on with the world around them. In a group there usually is a a**hole, a believer on a higher power, a person totally confused, a dim whit, an addict, the brave, the optomist, the pessimist,
Come on the represented most or all of us. Let's me not even discuss the main main (yes I said it twice like some millennials do) character. That person was already in denial, a pessimist, emotionless and closed off from society in one way or another. Maybe it stemmed from nurture not nature. Oh and the ones who say/ think why the birds get to see and have all the fun are idiots. If you pay close attention they reacted when the so called creatures were around or close. They reacted which my guess could be they can sensed (something we stop doing since things are easily given to us) the danger that something is wrong. Birds have it in their system to fly south, they don't look for a southward/ southern/ go south bound sign. The strong ones just go and do it. To the reviewers who took more from the movie then wanting an answer and ""it's too long"", thank you for having open mind when watching the movie. To those I offended I'm sorry that your closed mind didn't get it. Oh and the Happening was based on how nature (trees, plants, soil, hell Earth) fights back not on purpose but fixes itself from destructive things we (humans) do, did, or have done. Bird Box base on people that could, did, or will survive a creatures, could mean a major crisis, since we never truly see with our eyes, because even the characters that saw seen different things."

","To me, this film is alright. A Lot of it's been done before but it still keeps you wondering. Everything seems a lot worse when there's kids involved. I hate it when kids are put in that situation....but the film would've been a bit boring without them.

"oumaimasiyed","8","0","2","22 January 2019"," The only way to survive
","One of the coolest and most enjoyable movies of 2018
Truly throughout the film I felt that there were many meanings<br/><br/>To sacrifice for others through the personality of the owner of the house to which they belonged and the person who wrote the novel
The weak and the pampered die in this world if they do not mature Olympia
Love through Tom's character
There are some people who are really right and want your interests do not ignore them like the person who warned them to enter the stranger on the house and said to them do not enter him and then put the old man in the garage (as if they ignored the right and mind and pay attention to their feelings) Your actions will also lead you to your end
The strange personality that came and acted from them, but the opposite was evil, do not trust one easily and choose who you trust the two characters who fled by car as well as they are proof that we do not trust easily
Personality Tom was expressing the emotional side and to dream whatever happened and to follow the dream
The main character is expressing the mind, strength and motherhood. If the mother sees that her children are in danger, she will treat them firmly so that they do not hurt, but their packages mean love in the end and you have to be strong because the strong are the ones who can survive and reach the goal and the dream.
The people who force others to look are people who are wrong and see that they are right and try to be violent like them in the dark
The thing that is chasing them is darkness, destruction, injustice and the wrong vision of things, so do not look at it, no matter how circumstances forced you to do so
And a lot and a lot of meanings in the details of the film
The only thing that I did not like and I was shocked by is the scandalous scenes among some characters that direct you to follow a romantic and dramatic film instead of horror"
"classicsoncall","7","0","4","22 January 2019"," ""Here's to hoping there is more.""
","The movie is actually a fairly good metaphor for the times. Mass hysteria grips humanity and a herd mentality exists for everyone to save themselves from an invisible (imaginary?) monster. Does it sound like the mass media jumping on every single imagined slight against one of their cherished icons in an effort to discredit or destroy. We see it every day now in the headlines, outrage over someone cracking a politically incorrect joke, or slighting someone over their personal beliefs. Kevin Hart anyone? Let's all jump on the soapbox with our moral superiority and condemn the man for a nine year old tweet, and even after an apology, it's not enough.<br/><br/>It's all brought to the fore in the picture. Distorted whispers, rumblings and growlings are designed to get people to take off their blindfolds and look, for what they see might influence them to join the crowd. Only joining the crowd in this case leads to insanity and certain death. It's the ones who can think for themselves who have any hope of saving themselves and persevering to escape the madness. There's even the notion that individuals are meaningless in this construct, otherwise why name the two kids 'Boy' and 'Girl' instead of giving them an identity of their own. In that regard, I think the picture left it perfectly ambiguous for each of those five year olds as to who their real mothers actually were. They called Malorie (Sandra Bullock) by her name, and not 'Mom'. No sense in confusing love and family with the notion that 'it takes a village' to raise youth to acceptable adulthood. And then they arrive at a village where everything will be nice and safe again. Gee.<br/><br/>Aside from my astute analysis, I'd like to know how a cardboard box with a removable lid, and the three parakeets inside, survived the overturned boat in the raging rapids."

"jwalkeruh","8","0","3","21 January 2019"," Thank Goodness I Didn't Look At These Negative Reviews
","Although I am a little late to this train, my girlfriend and I finally decided to pop some popcorn and turn on a little Netflix movie called Bird Box. We had heard some things about the movie but never really decided to look at reviews and decided to give it a chance. Now that we have watched it and I have taken the time to see what others say, I am disappointed at the negative reception that this movie has received.<br/><br/>I really liked the pace of this film, starting right away by introducing the viewers to the scene where Bullock's character, Malorie, is speaking with two children simply referred to as ""Boy"" and ""Girl."" This opening monologue from Malorie was enough to get me interested in this fantastic film and make me wonder what would happen next.<br/><br/>One thing that I really appreciated from this film is that the identity of the creatures in Bird Box is never really revealed. Although it is hinted at through images, there was no confirmed identity and that gives me excitement because it allows the viewer to imagine what could be there. What are the people seeing? What makes all of these people want to commit suicide? I would rather something like that than a ridiculous explanation like ""the plants did it,"" like in that movie The Happening. I think that today, a lot of films like to go for ridiculous and over-the-top creatures (like the demon in Annabelle) that, in some ways, ruin the fright factor.<br/><br/>Another thing that I thought this film did very well was that I genuinely found myself cheering for characters like Malorie and Tom, hoping that they would make it through, while disliking people like Douglas (John Malkovich) and Gary (Tom Hollander). Some people have said that the characters were bland, but I found some characters relatable and enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>I think that one thing that this film also doesn't get credit for is the fact that all of these unanswered questions make the viewers ""blind"" to what is happening and can only get information as they watch and listen carefully, as not paying attention for a second could cause you to miss key details that are explained at various points of the movie.<br/><br/>This is, of course, not the perfect movie and I wouldn't sit here and say it is without flaw. But I think for a movie on Netflix that also comes from a book, Bird Box delivered a thrilling and genuinely terrifying experience that I may find myself coming back to, which is why this movie deserves 8 starts in my opinion."

"ansondouglas","8","0","2","18 January 2019"," Not a sci fi movie
","Bird Box is a suspense movie. The film kept me on the edge of my seat hooking me in with the suspense of an unknown and unseeable danger.<br/><br/>The fear and suspense comes from the unknown. I would not appreciate yet another Alien action sci-fi movie, or a gory horror movie. There are plenty of those and they usually aren't that great.<br/><br/>This film is well directed and we'll acted. You can feel the fear of the characters. If the entity was well explained and you knew exactly it's strengths abilities and weaknesses then that takes away from the fear and suspense. Once you take away the unknown, it usually forces the story into an action film where the characters attempt to defeat the entity, and I'm too interested in another of those.<br/><br/>As for the ending, it showed the development of Malorie from someone who thought she wouldn't even like her child as her father didn't love her, into a mother who would die for her children and take any risk to protect them.<br/><br/>True, I'm still curious of what the entities are, but to be honest, I'd bet I'd be disappointed if I was told the answer. The entities are just the apocalypitic background to the story of Malories unusual growth into motherhood. I'm totally ok with that rather small development in an apocalypitic world as the ride was so compelling. I enjoyed it while it lasted.<br/><br/>2 points are taken off for loopholes in the story, e.g. Tom being super buff after 5 years of surviving, failure to know how to use walking sticks after 5 years of scavenging blindfolded, why the heck is a school for the blind in the middle of a rainforest only accessible by rapids...<br/><br/>For all it's flaws 8 out of 10 was prob generous, but I truly enjoyed the 1.5 hours watching it, and that's all that really matters."

When it comes to movies nowadays there really is no limit of post apocalyptic thrillers in film because the viewers seem to love watching them, thinking about the various ways the world could come to an end, and before watching Bird Box one might think that this movie is like all the others but the movie Bird Box starring lead actress Sandra Bullock presents an intriguing and different take on the end of the world, survival, and family.<br/><br/>Director Susanne Bier who has also directed many other films uses a very smart approach to the movie which mixes the use of emotion and thrill. Many people compare this movie to ""A Quiet Place"" and ""Hush"" and i hesitate to compare the movie Bird Box to these other movies because unlike ""A Quiet Place"" and ""Hush"" Bird Box combines both emotion and thrill to get the message across to the viewers which is connection.<br/><br/>Bird Box opens up with the lead character Malorie played by Sandra Bullock yelling at two young children whom she names boy and girl (hence the lack of connection). Malorie is telling the kids they must cross the river to get to safety all while blindfolded because of the ""Creatures"" who will make you kill yourself if you look right at them. This film bounces back from present day to earlier on throughout the whole movie to unveil how the story unfolds which is fascinating to watch.<br/><br/>Malorie (Sandra Bullock) is first presented with the ""creatures"" mid way through her first pregnancy with a baby she's not sure if she wants and she's with her sister Jessica played by Sarah Paulson waiting for a doctor appointment when horror breaks out and everyone starts killing themselves. Malorie finds safety in Greg's house which is filled with terrified survivors like herself. This group of many different types of people get together and figure out that this occurrence is developing all over the world and they have to figure out a way to get out of it.<br/><br/>The symbolism in this movie is pretty straightforward but screenwriter Eric Heisserer executes it beautifully. He adds in contrast to the world today. His take on this movie shows people rapidly killing themselves which connects to our world today, his take on this movie also provides insights on topics such as the use of guns and fleeing people looking for refuge. Although this movie raises awareness for mental illnesses such as depression, some of the characters in this movie with mental illnesses were depicted as the bad guys which is a horrible concept that is prevalent in our world today. And while the movie does add in the issue of mental illness it doesn't really get into the different types of mental illnesses, the movie just shows people killing themselves. Eric Heisserer also decided to use birds in cages to symbolize freedom from the creatures which is ironic because they are in cages but the birds are the only safe ones who warn humans when the creatures are around by flying around in their cages.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie executed it perfectly. Sandra Bullock who plays Malorie is already disconnected from her emotions in the beginning of the movie and throughout the film she has to challenge herself with what it means to be a parent. She has to ask herself throughout the whole film does motherhood include all comforting and cuddles or does motherhood mean teaching her kids how to survive. Malorie has to raise her children so they know how to survive in the messed up world they live in now. If you're watching this movie you might find yourself tearing up because the characters in this movie execute human fears and emotions that everyone feels today. The character development in this film is outstanding, in the beginning of the movie Malorie is a homebody who paints in her apartment without seeking connection with anybody but by the end of the film she changes for the better.<br/><br/>Bird Box is not like all the other jumpscare post apocalyptic movies because it deals with real issues such as motherhood and emotions. The movie finds its way in to humans fears and worries and it feeds off of that which is why this movie has been such a hit. Bird Box took the theme of post apocalyptic and turned it into something new and fresh that everyone must see because it involves what it means to survive and connect."

","Birdbox starring Sandra Bullock is a marvelous film, it has many elements of other horror and apocalyptic movies, although it has its own spin on it. The film starts out with Sandra Bullock stars as Mallorie Sharron, an artist and an expecting mother. She doesn't have a husband or father in the picture, her sister is her main company. Her sister worries she is too much of a homebody. While at the hospital for prenatal care they see on the news a sudden epidemic of suicides across Europe. When leaving the hospital they see a random person kill themselves. They barely make it out safely.<br/><br/>The film flashed between present day at the hospital and a safehouse and when sandra and two children are on a river. Throughout the film they figure out they must be blind folded or they ""turn."" Sandra gets to the safehouse and spends time with people they encounter many different obstacles such as getting food and such. The film was similar to A Quiet Place and has a similar theme or atmosphere throughout the screenplay. The circular plot of time going back and forward keeps the viewer engaged in finding how Malarie got from a normal under the radar life to being blindfolded with two children on a river in a row boat. The survival thriller is similar to World War Z in the beginning but evolves to be much deeper of a plot. There is this apparent force that you look at and become suicidal, there is a twist on it that makes the film turn into something greater. The film has this psycho horror aspect in some parts that have only a point of view perspective and the camera work is great.<br/><br/>The director, Susanne Bier, turned a suburb into a war zone and the style she did it in was brilliant. The overall theme of the movie is never clear until the ending scenes. The way she alternated times throughout the film to keep the mystery of it all real and intrinsic.
A example of a flagship scene would be when Mallory is with the two children and she is trying to get down these rapids but she cannot see since she has to remain blind folded, the children fall out and it shows of great camera work as you view what is happening with the blindfold underwater through the eyes of a five-year-old. Bullock preserves in order to end up at a safe place and the closing of the scene completes the film and closes the theme in a great way, the cinematography of the final shot are marvelous. The camera work as a whole is a substantial part of the strengths of Birdbox. There are weaknesses, the supporting actors are subpar to Sandra Bullock's acting. There are some scenes that make the reader cringe. They are very stereotypical. The film deliberately as characters of all different backgrounds and I think that is good and bad. It makes the viewer connect to some degree with a character weather they're a mother, teenager, father, etc.<br/><br/>The film was slightly controversial due to the fact that the movie depicts mental illness as a bad thing, it is woven throughout the plot. The critics didn't like how they glorified mental illness. To me this was one of the gaps in the plot of Birdbox.<br/><br/>Birdbox is a very controversial movie, it has also showed a change in society. This film has record setting streams. It shows that we are really moving away from traditional theaters and movies to Netflix, Hulu, etc. The movie has received lots of media attention. The camera work was exceptional, the script was well written. There still are flaws in supporting actors, as well as the poor representation of the mentally ill."

","Birdbox, a film fronted by Sandra Bullock (I'd rather go back and watch Speed again), for the most part, with some cameos from other well known actors, works on a similar premise as other films like A Quiet Place but instead of not being able to make a noise, the people are attacked if they see the ""monster"". I'll try not to delve too much deeper as I don't want to include any plot spoilers. Unlike A Quiet Place, everyone must remain blindfolded when outdoors, or keep shutters and curtains closed when indoors, to protect themselves from what is outside.<br/><br/>The film is a little longer at 124 minutes long, but actually doesn't feel that long. It had some interesting plot twists as well, and although a lot of critics are killing it with poor ratings, I felt it fared better than A Quiet Place overall.<br/><br/>IMDb rating 6.7/10 My rating 6/10"

It's on Netflix for a free price. The actors were very good on their job. I felt bad for the older bald guy in the beginning when he saved a lot of people, and all they did was disrespect him. He is one of the only ones who used the brain.
Cons- Not enough horror like I wanted. There only some horror in the beginning. Since it's a lengthy two hour movie, I was expecting the ending to at least give me details on what happened. The ending didn't make much sense."
"rlaine","6","0","4","16 January 2019"," Entertaining and tense, but quite meaningless
","There have been a lot of this kind of apocalyptic road movies. World seems to be coming to an end with weird events and at some point they embark on a journey to get to a safe shangri-la kind of place. Usually a child is involved. Recent Cargo comes easily in mind as similar. From older movies The Road and Happening are also quite similar.<br/><br/>I watch a lot of horror and sci-fi so Netflix recommended this to me immediately and I also went for it almost immediately. I have to say I did enjoy it, but in the end it doesn't mean it's a masterpiece of a movie.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and also scary at times, but in the end there are really no answers to anything. Nothing is revealed about why the ""happening"" happened nor what it really was. This goes pretty much for Sandra Bullocks character too. She's very distant and negative for the whole movie and atleast I didn't figure out why. Maybe I dosed off at some significant scene, but to me she was mostly just annoying. It seemed she never even wanted a child, but why. How did that guy she met at the house eventually tolerate such character for years. She didn't even name the kids. There was this scene between Malkovich and Bullock where she stated her dad was similar ""asshole"" as Malkovich's character, but if they based Bullocks character on that only, it seems a bit far fetched. Her sister was totally different after all.<br/><br/>Despite Bullocks character being annoying, the acting in general was pretty good. As were rest of the production values.<br/><br/>So all in all it kept me interested, but don't expect a huge payoff in the end."

","I will say this from the outset: this movie is most effective if you have kids. Dont have kids? It may not have the same emotional resonance, as Sandra Bullock spends a decent amount of the film trying to keep these kids alive. As with most high concept horror/thrillers, there are plenty of dumb people making dumb decisions. ""Everyone keep your blindfolds on, except, let me just peak one quick second at thi...and now I'm dead"" This repeats itself a little too much.<br/><br/>The negative reviews, many of them, come from people wanting more gore, perhaps, or they cant stand not seeing the *monster at every turn. Remember, Jaws worked so well because of how little we saw of the shark.<br/><br/>This movie really is more about the journey than the destination. Bullock does a great job, as do most of the actors.<br/><br/>Camera work, sound, minimalist visual effects, all top notch. The script could've been tightened. At 2h4m, it could stand a 20m haircut.<br/><br/>It's a good, not great film. I wouldn't have hated it on the big screen, especially all of the northern California redwoods and river scenes.

","After watching similar but with higer budget, better marketed and so overrated The Quiet Place, this movie indeed looks like a small gem in comparison.
Everything holds movie together: the story, the carachters, the paceing. It is not straightforward horror but it frequently delivers a tension, and that feeling of unease is almoust constant, which I think only great horror films poses.
It is not predictable, and plot holes are existing, but there not enough to ruin the movie.
Ending is in my opinion the weakest point, since it is too dreamy, fairytale like and too good to be true.
Sandra Bullock is great, she is very convincible, and anyone can easy relate with her character as a person who finds her true purpose in life only after a world has ended. And I am saying this, even thou I am not her fan.
The rest of the actors are fine, I only think JM role could have been better written with more screen time. His talent is a bit vasted in there.

","Bird Box (2018) was a film directed by Susanne Bier and starred Sandra Bullock as Malorie, a mother who is trying to get her two children to safety. The world is being tormented by an invisible force that drives people to kill themselves, and over the course of five years we see Malorie's struggle to survive in this apocalyptic world. The premise is interesting, and made me curious to see what happens next, but I just felt that it was unfinished somehow. The characters weren't very compelling, especially Malorie who got me angry on many occasions. I would've loved to see an explanation for what the inviable force was, even if it was hinted at, but we never really get one. The ending seemed rushed; in fact, the over all pacing was strange. Overall, I can really appreciate what they were trying to do with this film and I think some creativity defiantly went into it, but I just wasn't compelled by the characters and the story felt unfinished."

"dnathanr1111","8","0","3","12 January 2019"," What movie did you guys watch? Seriously.
","I honestly dont get the hate for this movie. For me these were the biggest pros:
1. Acting: The acting in this was great and realistic. Nothing too extravagant but of course we got a great role from John Malkovich and Sandr Bullock of course. All the others filled their roles respctively and done well.
2. Storyline: The storyline in my.opinion was adapyed differently from the source material yet still coherent. The non-linear style was actually very smart and left you really wanting more out of it every time it switched from the ""present"" to when things first started. It didn't take any u necessary routes and every minute was used to.its capacity.
3. Emotional Punch: I was on the edge of my seat 75% of the movie. It was an intense movie honestly and there were times where I really thought things were gonna just go downhill, especially near the end. Also, around the ending with all the loose ends wrapped up in a sense it really made a lot more sense of where the storyline was headed and how Marjorie's character has evolved throughout the movie from being a someone non-emotional rock to finally accepting the children and the idea of actually caring for someone
4. Realism: Some of the characters were stupid, but thats what's gonna happen in real life. People are idiots and not every single person in the world is gonna make the right decision or else all of us would be able yo save the world basically. Some characters were betrayed, some did the betraying. Some did things without thinking, some overthought things. Its realistic and that's what I liked about it.
5. Cohesion: Everything in the movie set up for something else. Whether it be what happened at the market or what happened with Lydia. Even some later parts can pretty much set up the rest of the movie. Yes parts are somewhat cliche but honestly, at this point, what isn't.<br/><br/>This movie was honestly really enjoyable for me and I'm honestly very very surprised that there's so many negative reviews. From what I've seen a lot of these reviews have more ""questions than answers"" but half of them seem to have skimmed through the movie when a lot of their questions are answeres in the movie.
-Why can't the monsters get into the house? Does nobody remember that anytime there was a creature that the wind would pick up or that the trees started to sway a lot? Theyre probably tied to something of that sorts. Kind of Like what The Happening shouldve been.
<ul><li>Why were the crazy people able to live?</li></ul>Earlier in the movie its stated that it preys on your greatest fears an losses. Later on Gary talks about how he (now we know he was actually one of them) was ""attacked"" by inmates of a psychiatric hospital. Then with fish fingers Charlie said he was in prison for a while. People who either have no morality, empathy, or just no fear at all aren't going to be affected by it. I thought it was pretty obvious when it was stated twice in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie was very straightforward so I really sont understand all the confusion."

Sarah Paulson shines in everything she does and Trevante Rhodes executes leading man gorgeously (even if the 24 years age difference is noted). The plot was interesting, even though I found a couple places a little flat (gauging how much time is needed to build tension is a delicate thing - sometimes they overestimated). So, we have THE QUIET PLACE where voices are dangerous, with this we have sight being the danger. I'm interested if they can do the same for taste, touch and smell.

"Psi-Clone","7","0","3","11 January 2019"," Film Analysis - Bird Box
","A fair warning to all reading after this point, please go watch the movie and then come back to read this, as it contains major spoilers, film dissection, a thorough analysis and other things such as the breakdown of characters and monsters of the film, which might ruin your watching experience.<br/><br/>Bird Box (2018) is a movie adapted by the book of the same name starring Sandra Bullock( Gravity, Oceans Eight ) in the lead role with other stars which include T,revante Rhodes, Jacki Weaver, Rosa Salazar, Danielle Macdonald, Lil Rel Howery, Tom Hollander, BD Wong, Sarah Paulson, Machine Gun Kelly AKA Colson Baker, and John Malkovich and is directed by Susanne Bier ( Serena. Love is all you need ).<br/><br/>This film majorly falls under the category of Drama with a touch of Sci-Fi. Though IMDB adds Horror as a genre or maybe a sub-genre there is no horror element to the movie for the viewers, but the characters in the movie go through trauma, psychological imbalance, and fear for the whole run-time.<br/><br/>The plot-line of the movie is set in the current time period. The movie starts off with a dramatic scene between Malorie(Sandra Bullock) and 2 kids who are told not to open their blindfold once they start the journey and then jumps back in the timeline with Malorie and her sister in their apartment.<br/><br/>The plot structure is basically 2 different timelines shown to the viewer one after the other(jumping from present to past(5years) then back to present(with a few shots being hours earlier of the present timeline) and these plots meet together in the final act of the movie. Although I felt the plotline to be too linear and predictable, it is not what the movie is all about. Let us understand where the movie shines and where it doesn't!<br/><br/>Firstly our main character, Malorie, goes through various troubles which get intertwined in each other and eventually get resolved. In the beginning, Malorie is all about herself, avoids public places, tends to live alone and enjoys her own company. She is pregnant with a child and still feels that she won't have any connection or emotional bond with the child once it is born. This is the direct behavioral response due to her boyfriend leaving her in the middle of the baby crisis. Near the end of the first act of the past timeline, she makes a friend for the first time after her boyfriend incident and also trusts another guy to be close with her.<br/><br/>During the second act of the present timeline, there is still no bond between the kids and Malorie. It feels like she has given up on hope and just surviving for the sake of it. The final act of the present timeline, a major transformation in Malorie sets into motion. The decision of choosing which child will guide her during the raging river section makes a huge change in her character. She understands what it is to have a child, what a mother-child bond is, and also keeping a promise made to an old friend.<br/><br/>In the climax of the movie, she opens up completely to the girl which even though she didn't give birth to, has an equal place in her heart just like the boy has. This, for me, was a very powerful scene as it was not expected and for a moment, I thought that this was the end of the girl, but she comes back safely to her.<br/><br/>Even though there are 2 connected plots running simultaneously, one can easily keep up with the time period as there are no sudden jumps and cuts. The suspense and the climax were a slight disappointment for me as it fails to deliver with the much-anticipated intensity and emotions. It still keeps us on the toes when Malorie and the kids enter into the safe zone, it feels for some moments that this place too is taken over by the monster and the people their still seem suspicious at the start.<br/><br/>The Characterization of the main characters is well-defined thanks to the superb performance by the cast. Malorie's transformation is beautifully shown through her dialogue and the way she speaks with the kids in the later point in the movie as compared to the beginning. The kids are somewhat like dolls, very little dialogues, very tiny contribution the main plot and very few expressions, but there was point where the girl showed major fear, disbelief and hopelessness towards the mother through her face( This takes place when she says one of them has to open the blindfold guide her in the river) . I loved her expressions, on point I would say! Tom Hollander gave an amazing performance making us believe that he was a good guy, I was like, ""hell yeah"" one more to the party. But hey, they forgot to check his bag! I felt really sad when Charlie takes one for the team and sacrifices himself, feels like I won't be able to survive in the apocalypse because of being too soft and nerdy!<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the elephant in the room! Yes, The monster, entity, devil, ghost, demon or whatever you want to call it. We never really know what it is, its shape, size, color, form, is it human-like or monster like, how big it is or can it take whatever shape it likes because it was never really shown in the movie. All we know is if you see at him you are either dead meat or hypnotized by it. Also, they seem to be in huge numbers, looking at the presence of them lie from continent to continent. As Charlie says, the entity can take the form of your worst fears and nightmares. We can see multiple drawings made by Gary, but they are through his eyes. Alternatively, many of them see dead ones or hear them so it can take a human form also. These things also seem to influence you through the digital medium, as seeing it from the camera also affects you. It seems the entity controls only those who are bad human beings and kills the one who are good. This opens up to questions like which side Douglas and Malorie would have gone to? Would the pre-transformed Malorie be controlled and the post-transformed Malorie be given a highway to heaven ??
Analyzing all of this, I feel like we have some kind of powerful shapeshifter with hypnotic and telekinesis powers. Notice that whatever destruction, damage, chaos it has brought upon the Bird Box Universe (let's call it that!) is through humans, as he/she/it has not touched a single thing. I was a little upset that they did not explore the entity much, there was like 2-3 minutes of screentime given to that invisible thing.<br/><br/>This can also mean the director wants to show us that even you are blindfolded. You cannot see it because you are traveling alongside Malorie and are going through the same situations as she is. A few places during the film we can see leaves moving as if something has a force field and is walking but notice that a huge emphasis has been given to the rustling of leaves and air and some kind of eerie silence. This also implies that you are seeing and hearing the world through Malorie or seeing the imagination of what it is, as she is unknown to what exactly is out there. This may be one reason why we do not see the entity.<br/><br/>There are few plot holes, unsolved mysteries in the movie such as - Can you look at footage of the creature which was preshot as the person filming it has its fear shown not the fear you have. How did the bird box survive the boat crash, how did the girl come to the shore with the bell and bird-box so intact from those ravaging waters? Also, they did not get any reception in their phones but the GPS was still working.<br/><br/>Let's talk about some of the technical aspects of the film. Let's start with Audio. I felt the soundtrack could have been more powerful and more intense during certain situations. Thinking about recently watched movies with similar tone and setting, ""A Quiet Place"" always comes up in terms of sound design and building up the tension. The growling noise used at some places felt too much of an asset flipping. Overall, not too much impressed by the sound.<br/><br/>Camera was well established for each shot. There were a few scenes which stood out really well such as the river scenes and the forest scenes. But apart from that nothing else stood out. The camera felt unused in a few scenes and would have been impressive with an extreme close up shot, entity POV and tracking shots. Scenes were well setup through extreme long shots in the latter half of the movie depicting were exactly the characters are.<br/><br/>Lighting during the river scenes was impressive, it gave that dark empty feeling. Forest scenes should have been much darker, with low key lighting and darker shadows. Overall missed an opportunity to play with lighting also.<br/><br/>Editing was butter smooth, not much of short scenes and cuts. The transition from present to past and vice versa was pretty well done. The rhythm of the movie keeps you from thinking about what is going to come next. Pace of the movie seems to pick up really quickly and we can see a lot happening from the first 5 mins till the last moment. This was also a good thing as it engages the viewer and does not bore them even though some things are predictable.<br/><br/>The Visual Effects in the movie were subtle but nicely done. The scene such entity presence through the force field, river scenes. Maybe they had to do a lot of cleanup as shooting with a blindfold on would have taken up a lot of guides, chroma scenes, and other markers. Overall well-done un-noticeable VFX, which is the best VFX!<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film, it held me in one place until the very end! I wrote the review first thing after watching the movie so that I avoid any major outside source influencing my writing.
Do have any interesting theory? Any major plot details or plot holes I missed Let me know what are your thoughts. If you disagree with me on anything, do let me know!<br/><br/>Cheers!!"
"jte6451","7","0","3","10 January 2019"," A Decent Film, Just Don't Try This At Home
","So I was going through social media and I kept seeing people talking about this movie on Netflix called Bird Box and I was curious as to what this was all about considering the fact that this film inadvertently spawned an internet challenge where everyone is doing everyday things while blindfolded (yeah, I don't get it). So, after seeing people talk about it, I've decided to give this one a watch. Is this really worth the hype? Well, let's start with the plot.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock plays a mother named Malorie who, along with two children only referred to as Boy and Girl, must navigate through a forest and a dangerous river rapids completely blindfolded to reach a sanctuary while avoiding supernatural entities that, upon seeing them, will cause people to go insane and kill themselves. Much of the story is told through flashback beginning with entities' attack on humanity and a then-pregnant Malorie meets up with a group of survivors.<br/><br/>Even though this was based on the novel of the same name, this movie very much reminds me of A Quiet Place, which is one of my favorite horror films in recent years. While it's similar in tone and atmosphere, this is more of an emotional story revolving around our main character having to deal with what's happening around her and reluctantly becoming the mother of two children in a post-apocalyptic environment. It does have some tense moments, but not as terrifying as A Quiet Place where you never know what will happen.<br/><br/>The performances from the cast are pretty good, especially Sandra Bullock. Trevante Rhodes from Moonlight is also good as Tom, a strong-willed and likable character who is caring and helps Malorie through a dangerous and emotional time. John Malkovich plays the typical stubborn a**hole character found in any kind of horror film, but I find him kinda hilarious whenever he gets pissed drunk and start saying pessimistic remarks. But the real star is Sandra Bullock in probably one her best roles since Gravity.<br/><br/>Overall, while it may be original pre se and it was a little bit overhyped, I genuinely enjoyed it for the most part, mainly due to the atmosphere and some solid performances. The one thing I found disappointing was that we never see what the monsters look like, where they came from, and how are they able to manipulate people into killing themselves. Also, some of the flashback scenes either don't make sense or tend to drag a little. I still prefer A Quiet Place to be the better film, but, as far as a movie with plenty of suspense and emotion, it's not too bad. Just don't do anything from this film, or in real life for that matter, blindfolded.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 7/10"
"stylegamer","7","0","4","10 January 2019"," Unconvincing premise but watchable for the suspense...
","The movie is not half as bad as a dozen other similar flicks out there. The premise is similar to the other recently recently movie "" A quiet place"". Intriguing but yet unconvincing premise at the same time. If u can suspend disbelief for 2 hours , one can enjoy the suspense thrills and compelling storyline this movie has to offer...Great, horror thrill -inducing stuff for those who need you need a dose of apocalyptic horror that works on the senses.. The ambiguity throughout the film keeps it moving and gives a certain aura and charm . Performances especially that of the Sandra Bullock is great and commendable with emotion inducing on screen aura as a mother fights on to save her children..."
"recoldblood","5","0","2","10 January 2019"," Why so much hype?
","Don't really get the hype for Bird Box. By the end, I felt it belonged in a kitty Litter Box. There's an idea for the sequel, the entities are actually ghost cats, and the world is their litter box. But in all seriousness, it wasn't quite that bad, just so many unexplained things, so many illogical actions, so many plans that absolutely would not work the way they did, lots of deus ex machina (just for the sake of convenience), and really no terribly likable characters. But some of it was shot pretty well, the atmosphere was good at times, and the acting was pretty good, when crap lines like, ""Make the end of the world great again"", aren't being shouted obnoxiously. Way to be a product of the times, and surely to be forgotten in no time. The more I think about it and try to make sense of all the nonsense the more I realize how little I enjoyed it, 5/10. Woulda been better as a 30 minute short film with less pointless characters, and less filler dialogue."

"bencaandrew","7","0","4","10 January 2019"," A rushed storyline but overall good experience
","This film is certainly worth a watch.<br/><br/>The omnipresent threat of the entities that incarnate your worst fear works it's way into every aspect of the film, leaving you with an underlying tone of suspense and unease which creates a good overall viewing experience.<br/><br/>To its credit, the film starts of very strongly with a harrowing opening sequence. Further scenes, however, fail to live up to this standard and come off as underwhelming. This is partially due to the lack of development during the film for supporting characters, scenes that should provoque emotion simply fail to do so as the audience has little investment in the consequence.<br/><br/>I'd therefore disagree with those who say the film could've been 20 minutes long, I don't believe 2 hours was long enough for a plot involving so many different stages and different characters. My personal opinion would suggest that it would need a miniseries to do it justice: whilst the action/horror scenes would be yet more sparce, they would leave a far greater impression if the character(s) involved had been given more than just a couple developing scenes."

What Bird Box tries to do is nothing new -at all-, from the formulaic characters to the good-hearted, moralistic drama. The acting is quite solid, though, with a great cast being part of the project and Trevante Rhodes being the highlight: I absolutely loved him in a much, much better written film (""Moonlight""), but he makes do with the script here as well."

","Oh gosh this movie is enjoyable.
I enjoyed the heck out of this movie and in my opinion was a roller coaster ride i would not wanna experience again.
But sadly this movie isn't that good.
The plot is interesting but similar to a quiet place (that's not a flaw just wanted to point that out don't @ me) and characters.<br/><br/>THE FIRST SCENE
The first scene was good and interesting and Sandra Bullock really nailed the acting in the beginning.
She is serious but scared and she shows how bad and serious the situation is by explaining what the kids need to do and what will happen if they don't follow orders.
But then the ""Flashback"" starts and pretty much ruins everything.
Until we see our main survivors we know what will happen to them so any shock factor given when someone dies is gone.
PLOT
The plot is simple.
Creatures attack and if you look at them you want to kermit sewerside.
I have heard that the book never explains where the creatures came from so the comic relief explains by giving a minor exposition dump and when they ask how he knew he said that he did research. Well that's convenient.
I mean at least they explain what they are but they never explain were they came from but i'll let that slide.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
They were already in trouble when they had so many characters.
So what they do is kill them of.
All of the main survivors never gets developed or has any depth.
I'm not asking a lot when it comes to depth and development with these characters i just want something.
For example humanize them show their life what they wanted to achieve in life and how they can't get that cause of the current situation, or show them argue, they did that a little which was good but it was all because of that bald old man disagreeing and being rude, what i want them to do is show all of them disagreeing and show their way of thinking and go personal so that we can expand on the characters.
Cause all of the characters were there just to die they had no other importance at all.
Malorie was a mediocre protagonist she didn't have a lot of development but none of the characters had.<br/><br/>VERDICT
Enjoyable movie you wont get bored."

I personally enjoyed the movie. Great action scenes. Reminded me of dawn of the dead. But the main question is what is this entity where did it come from and what is it's purpose. My opinion of the people who didn't need blindfolds are those whom have evil within. I had a theory that pregnant women and children would be the only ones able to see without being consumed as the entity would not be able to harm them due to their innocence."

","The world becomes total chaos when an unknown outbreak occurs, killing many people. 'Bird Box' focuses on Malorie (Sandra Bullock), a mother who must take her children down a dangerous river in order to reach safety. To top it off, in order to stay safe from this outbreak, Malorie and her children must be blindfolded at all times while traveling down the river and through the forest. The film also provides a lengthy backstory as to how Malorie got to her present situation.<br/><br/>This film has a really solid opening scene that builds suspense, but that moment is gone shortly after as we are then faced with a film that decides to go back and forth in the narrative timeline.<br/><br/>While 'Bird Box' has similar tones to other films we've seen (such as A Quiet Place, The Happening or even the smash hit TV series The Walking Dead), thankfully 'Bird Box' has enough to make selected elements in this film differ. Either way, it will be a challenge for most viewers not to think about those other films while watching. Perhaps it's a key reason why this film landed on Netflix?<br/><br/>One of these different elements is simply having the actress Sandra Bullock as the lead role. She is a strength in this film but sadly I felt she was not utilised to her 100% full potential. In key dramatic moments her responses can sometimes be delivered along with cheesy script and dialogue which takes away from what should be a suspenseful moment. The fact her hair and make-up is consistently stunning while others around her go without is also something of a distraction for me, but this seems to be something of the norm for this actress. Nevertheless, it is her performance alone that is a highlight of the film. The film also manages to introduce other well known actors including John Malkovich.<br/><br/>As for the film's runtime, it is a lengthy one. I was surprised when I felt like I had achieved a large duration of the plot only to discover that I had only hit the one hour mark and had another hour as well as more to go. For this film, I don't feel all the elements of its back story was required. We have an opening that delivers tension and suspense, but first we must know about how our leading lady and all the characters met beforehand. It is this backstory that makes the film drag and become overall predictable. I felt like the film had started to show its ending already, so when the audience is forced to watch a backstory.... we feel like we already know the outcome.<br/><br/>Overall, Netflix has managed to deliver another big film without the release in cinemas. For horror/thriller fans, there are elements to enjoy here but there are also elements we have seen once before. Some will be bothered by this, some will be happy to watch these elements again. As for the film, there are moments that can drag and are ultimately predictable. Actress Sandra Bullock is the biggest strength of the film which I feel is also something different for her film career.<br/><br/>5.8/10

The story keeps you interested and wanting to see the end. While it does leave holes (why I gave 9/10 instead of 10/10) the cliff hangers were not bad enough to come and trash the movie.

"rustonreviews","6","0","3","8 January 2019"," A perfectly fine, yet unremarkable, post-apocalyptic thriller.
","Based upon the novel of the same name by Josh Malerman, Bird Box follows Malorie (Bullock) and a small group of survivors who band together to navigate their way through a world plunged into chaos as an unstoppable force mysteriously drives people into crazed, violent suicides. Unexplainable mass suicides break out all across Europe and the world is left in ruins. Malorie and the other survivors quickly learn that the only way to combat the looming threat is to keep their eyes covered at all times whilst out in the open. If you dare to take a look, something gains control and you die. It's a great premise, but the problem with Bird Box is that it stretches itself far too thin, and much of it feels far too familiar.<br/><br/>Comparisons to M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening (2008) are inevitable, but placing Bird Box in the same league as that disaster would be unfair. The film begins strongly as we are thrown into an exciting and hectic opening as we follow Malorie throughout the chaos as it unfolds before her eyes. People are struck by out of control vehicles whilst others willingly sit within roaring flames, and nobody has any clue as to why. After such a riveting opening, I was expecting the rest of the film to follow suit, but the unfortunate thing is that the film never quite regains the strengths of its great first act. Everything gradually slows down, and it never quite picks itself back up again, with the exception of a few exciting sequences here and there. The performances are perfectly fine though nothing special, but the cast of survivors we find ourselves with aren't developed as well as they should be, including Malorie, resulting in a fairly uninteresting lead. At times the film rings hollow, and the intrigue of its concept is never explored or developed to its full potential. What's worse is that despite its overlong run time, the film doesn't deliver a satisfying ending and provides more questions than it does answers. Bird Box is a decent yet unremarkable post-apocalyptic thriller, falling short of reaching its full potential. A better film is buried here somewhere, but maybe the much desired answers can be found within the book, as is often the case."

The action was intense-until the end of the movie I was on the edge of my seat. Bird Box was a roller coaster of emotions: sadness, terror, and relief.<br/><br/>However, there were several plot holes which were never addressed. For example, the movie never explains just how crazy one would have to be to see without a blindfold. It left me thinking, would schizophrenics be as ""immune"" to the problem as someone with bipolar disorder. Also, at the beginning of the movie, the problem's powers were just that it would cause people to kill themselves by looking outside. As the movie progressed, the problem was able to talk in certain people's voices and knock them to the ground. The ending will thoroughly disappoint viewers. The ending was incredibly cliche. Although, they did set it up in a way to potentially create a sequel."

","Bird Box stars Sandra Bullock as a pregnant single mom trying to survive pandemic where if you open your eyes in the outdoors, you are driven to suicide. A lot of hype and memes surround the Netflix Original film Bird Box. One could argue this film is easily Netflix's most popular film with all the hype surrounding the film. A lot of comparison to another recent film, A Quiet Place are being made. Hype could be both good and bad for anything, with Bird Box the hype punishes the film.
Bird Box is not a complete disaster. The film has a strong cast and solid performances. Where Bird Box suffers, is the lack of cohesion of the film's story. Bird box is based on the novel of the same name by Josh Malerman. I have three major gripes with the film. The first thing, the run time was too long. It did not need to be over 2 hours. Certain points you feel the Director was stretching the story. Second, ""the creatures"" that were stalking everyone and driving them to madness were never seen or really developed. To me, it seemed like the writer had no idea what and who the creatures were. This could be a fault from the source material (the novel), but since I have not read the novel I cannot say.
The ending. I will not spoil the film for those who still want view the film, but there felt like there was done or basically a cop out. The ending felt cheap or the screenwriter did not know where to go to finish the story so they just ended the story. This as well could be something that came from the original source, if so why did they bother making a film and/or book to begin with. This is poor storytelling. The viewer feels they are only watching a rough draft.
Overall I score this film a 6 out of 10. The film is okay if the weather is bad and you are stuck inside all day, but this is no great apocalyptic film like The Road or a Quiet Place. Netflix swung and missed a hanging curve right in the middle of the plate. I recommended A Quiet Place over this. That film is better in every aspect as is The Road."

Has John Malkovich ever been in a movie where he wasn't on the edge of deranged?

The story is good but it's this kind of film that destroys itself by itself, Sandra is the hero with her excellent performance and her character but the story had to be like any other story and put less than ordinary characters that are silly and full of weakness points along with some unanswered incidents from some characters and also has that lack of horror and only play on thriller and surprise making noises and you know it's nothing and the sexual things that didn't need to exist with some predictable plots and and others that doesn't seem right like the creatures matters and mentioning causes against what we see and didn't bother to show anything about them or describing and visuals of what really happens in a great challenge too that the film failed to impress about it. Also the middle of the end was boring and the idea though it's new and professional had omitted sensible things to happen especially in the Nile scenes and was based on luck.

And while the idea of a sightless struggle for survival is certainly nerve-racking and ingeniously depicted, this Netflix adaptation of the dystopian bestseller is too ambition for its 2-hour confines.<br/><br/>Moreover, everyone knows the only way to tackle rapids blind is inside of a wooden barrel.

","Really don't understand the hype, 'scariest film ever' 'haven't slept since watching it'<br/><br/>Now everyone is entitled to an opinion........ But come on! Seriously! Have you ever watched a horror/thriller before.

"LaSaggezza","6","0","3","6 January 2019"," Apocalypses on the Cheap
","""Bird Box"" is the latest 'apocalypse on the cheap' Sci-fi and some of these features have top-draw names. Robert Duval has a small role in ""The Road"". This apocalypse is caused by a fire which spreads over the globe. There's no reason given, no aliens, no biological accidents. It leaves one with the burning question of ""why"". ""How it Ends"", with Forest Whitaker, has a global power failure apocalypse. So you'll know how it ends but never shocked to know why it ends. It just does. And a similar apocalypse sends Ellen Page and Rachel Wood ""Into the Forest"" but again, the nagging question of why will stick with you like moss on a tree. ""Bird Box"" is different in that the apocalypse is caused by some alien lifeform, but you can't see them. How financially convenient. To be fair, all four above mentioned come off as reasonably good entertainment mainly due to the really good performances by the top draw names. Bird Box goes a step further having two: Sandra Bullock playing the central role and John Malkovich whose performance creates the underlying tension which carries through the rest of this feature.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the problem isn't the stories, dialogues, performances, or anything else which can turn an entertaining feature into a real disaster. What is obvious in all of these 'apocalypses with no name' is that the lion's shares of the budgets of these productions were spent on the well known top-notch names and not a dime on a really good down to earth understandable, imaginative, tangible apocalypses. To put this in context, take the popular series ""The Walking Dead"". Although not one of the original first season cast could be considered well-known box office draws, (to say the least), this production's budget spared no expense on zombies. Smart! How can anyone pass up a prime time Zombie-Apocalypse-action-soap-opera? Now, the costume designers for TWD had to create really convincing looking HD worthy zombies requiring many extras. Else, had they gone cheap it would have turned the TWD into a high-definition one season laugher. The result of betting on herds of zombies over the famous living: the series really took off. The budget for the whos, whats and whys was well balanced. Make no bones about it.<br/><br/>The moral of the story: balancing the budget and feeding the fears of the viewing audience along the way really matters.<br/><br/>So 'Bird Box' is okay. You might not watch it twice, but having Bullock and Malkovich set the pace makes it certainly worth watching at least once."
"jerralagbayani","6","0","1","6 January 2019"," Netflix Tried... 5.7/10
","I've been hearing about this Netflix Original called Bird Box for a decent time now, spanning not only a challenge but what some people call one of the greatest films in awhile. To your dismay, I disagree.<br/><br/>Meet this lady who's pregnant when a strange force begins to make people suicide or go mad at a single glance at whatever the hell it is. With the force on the rise, she must live in this very very harsh environment while a series of unfortunate events begin to unfold.<br/><br/>I liked the pace of the half of the story that took place in the beginning of the outbreak because each scene was just as equally as fast paced as the next, but the half that takes place in the present got a little jiitered and clunky. Some parts of the present scenes seemed to slow and it's pace dramatically increased or decreased. I didn't like how there were a lot of time jumps and a lot of deaths were seemingly for nothing.<br/><br/>Also the ending was in a way how I predicted but the story at least tried to unfold itself in a way to keep the viewers learning what happened and why they're there in the present like that. Also I love how we never get to know about the origin of this force because, like Cam, it focused more on survival than the villain.
If it was a prequel to A Quiet Place and they altered 40 percent of the story I'd be a little more interested but the outcome would most likely be the same.<br/><br/>Not the worst for Netflix but it definitely isn't the best."
"Prismark10","6","0","5","6 January 2019"," The Happening
","Netflix produced movies always seem to have a touch of not quiet being the final product about them. A star vehicle of a slightly over the hill star with a third rate script, an expensive bomb sold to Netflix or something low key that might had done well in the independent film circuit.<br/><br/>Bird Box has provided them with hype and an Oscar winning star in Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>Malorie (Sandra Bullock) is a pregnant woman in a society that has fallen apart as people inexplicably commit suicide.<br/><br/>It seems something the victims see causes them to harm themselves.<br/><br/>Malorie hooks up with other survivors and shut themselves off from the world.<br/><br/>The film goes forward and back in time. In the future, Malorie and two young children, all blindfolded try to find a safe haven. They have a bird box as birds chirp when an alien danger is nearby.<br/><br/>You get a sense that in this society that the blind man is king. Like the film A Quiet Place, you sense there is an alien presence. Instead of not making a noise, you need to avoid seeing them.<br/><br/>The initial scenes are shocking, horrifying and mesmerising. Then it has all the tropes of a zombie movie as the survivors are holed up and one of the character's is played by John Malkovich and he dislikes everyone.<br/><br/>The bits with Malorie and the blindfolded kids did not work for me, it takes a serious leap of logic as to how they got to the river and go whitewater rafting while blindfolded. It is hairraising to do the rapids while you have your eyes open.<br/><br/>'If you look, you will die' Mallory sternly tells the two children. It reminded me of David Tennant's tenth Doctor telling people not to blink.<br/><br/>Elements of the film is clunky, silly, it does not always add up. Why do some people see the monsters and not top themselves? Instead force others to open their eyes. Surely not all of them can be insane. Madness in people have different layers, here they become the alien entity fan club.<br/><br/>Susanne Bier showed she is an interesting and effective director in the BBC television series, The Night Manager. Here she does well with a script that is rather cumbrous and derivative of similar themed films."

"topijalkanen","5","0","1","5 January 2019"," Missed potential
","The river part is great, and the concept overall is great. Also mainly pretty good camerawork and editing.
But theres 2 that i think ruined it:
1.The characters
2.The structure
So big part of the movie is centered around this group of characters that are straight from an b-horror movie in the style of 5teenagers went to a cabin. All of the characters except the one portrayed by John Malkovich were so obvious and thin plot devices if even that, maby more just filler.
The house section becomes good around at the point when the birth giving starts but still.
A mayor problem in this section is also that we have already seen the main character alive 5 years later, so theres absolutely no tension about her surviving trough the scenes, which would not be a problem if the movie didnt center around trying to create tension to the main character's survival.
So altough I love the time jump structure when it's done right here it feels like it's been slammed on as afterthought. it would have made this a lot better if it would've just used an linear timestructure or then given it a sideplot to keep it interesting.
Also the ending would have been a lot better if they had changed it so it ends to them releasing the birds but not nearly as important, would've been a nice touch though."

The voices in the woods was original in THG. Hit by a bus was expected. Character pretending to be uninfected.<br/><br/>The most original part were Boy and Girl.

","I had a really difficult time rating this movie, I'm a huge Sandra Bullock fan and I thought the movie as a whole was decent. There are several underlying revelations of the characters and it may be better placed in the psychological thriller genre rather than horror or sci-fi or even as a collective of those two... psychological thriller may have been turned out a different critique all around as it would have made for different expectations of the movie. Either way I thought the film was good, the only reason for the rating of 7 is, to me there was the disappointment hanging over my head. There are a lot of questions raised and very few answered. Especially what is it that created the havoc??? There should have been more explanation, or even something more to take the imagination a little further.. maybe even some hints?!? However, the movie was enjoyable irregardless of the lingering questions. I only hope that this was done by intention as there will hopefully be a sequel?

I questioned the entire movie and really cannot understand why it's so popular.<br/><br/>What caused the beings? What actually were the beings? Why did some people not commit suicide, but became some sort of slaves of the beings? Going through rapids in a boat (blindfolded)? Why can't you open your eyes when birds are silent (outside)? Can we fight them? Why couldn't the entities enter buildings?"

It was an okay movie about an apocalyptic end (not very original). The storyline wasn't super well developed for most characters, and they stuck around about as often as in the walking dead. They never showed us the creatures which was hugely disappointing. The premise of the monsters was incredibly silly-things you can't see or you'll kill yourself-really? Don't buy into this gimmick."

","So you've probably seen this movie all over social media with teenagers going crazy and about a million fantastic memes thrown in.

So what's the hype?<br/><br/>Well, the story goes back and forth about how the world starts to change and how people start committing suicide because of a force they have seemingly seen. Now this movie does not awnser how or why this happens but rather on how to survive this. That's the point. It wraps together perfectly and keeps you glued to your senses because imagine navigating around danger without being able to see?
The film touches many moral and ethical issues as well which keeps your mind busy yet feeling the emotions of the characters too as you'll probably picture yourself in the situation,<br/><br/>Simply give this movie a go, you will not regret anything"

The entire journey is symbolic of the woman's fears about parenthood and being able to keep her child safe in an unsafe world.<br/><br/>She was contemplating putting her unborn child up for adoption right before all of the crazy journey began and the journey ended when she internally decided to put the hold up for adoption and gave him/her up to the doctor.<br/><br/>I was expecting a horror movie but this was not scary at all.

","The beginning of the movie was really great: it did not mess around for too long and it went almost straight to the point, which in this case worked really well in my opinion. The idea of the monster is good, and it starts off great, but then for me it is just a mess: the film cannot figure out what the monster can or can not do which is really frustrating sometimes. Sandra Bullock is amazing in her role, but her companion Tom (as a character) is just pure creepyness and cringy behaviour all aroud. Long story short: the first part was ok, then the plot developed lazily and went basically nowhere in the end, and the climax, as I mentioned the thing about not being really clear about the abilities of the monster, was dull.
Watch it for yourself, because it has some cool ideas, but dont get really disappointed at the end"

The ending is a bit corny also. Sandra Bullock is a B-rated actor at best. But have you noticed her resemblance to Michael Jackson?

It should be a comedy. I understand the post-apocalyptic movies are supposed to be unrealistic but all the supposedly ""sane"" people reacted and behaved so preposterously. This is not a horror film. It is a great cast of actors running around acting like it's a horror movie and the whole time you are thinking, ""WTF are they doing?""<br/><br/>Any reason why they couldn't walk around in the darkness of the night?"

what was the monster? - Charlie gave us a religious explanation to what it was which leads to other questions. Why didn't it effect the crazies? How did Tom resist it for that short time. Does it not effect the blind? What if you make yourself blind? Don't get me started on the birds, where some of the cast ended up or the ending.<br/><br/>It seems Susanne bier has no intention to show us what the monster looked like. However putting a reveal on the boat instead of those shadows would have been better. Gusts of wind didn't creep me out.<br/><br/>comparing this film to a similar films 'A quite place' which has a monster reveal and used it to create tension and fear, this move would have scored higher than a 6.<br/><br/>Bottom line is the film was alright, if everyone listened to Douglas (John malkovich) or made the kids blind the film would be 30 minutes long.<br/><br/>(Disclaimer: many of my questions could have been answered in the book however this a review on the film.)"

","Ok i have to say first that I came across Birdbox on Netflix unexpectedly (Like most Netflix releases) and days before the first I had heard of it starting a craze across social media (a big reason I gave up social media years ago, too many loud stupid voices dominating the popular opinion) and immediately put it on thinking it had a chance to impress me as Netflix releases usually fail to bring much substance. But then then it started and after 5 painful minutes of what I viscerally felt as the death rattle of many former successful acting careers (Malkovich, what the hell?) I got the jist, like I had already seen this movie, i had, its called the Happening, so I turned Birdbox off. I didn't give it another thought until my wife asked what the deal with this Birdbox thing everyone was freaking out about on Facebook etc. and I told her it was a new Netflix movie and asked what the freak out was about and she said people were talking about it being the scariest film of all time. I want to say I was shocked or disgusted but honestly it makes sense that so many Americans in this 2018-2019 society that marches day by day closer to full blown Idiocraxy, not metaphorically but like life imitating art. People realize Mike Judge was critiquing societal trends towards shallow vapidity and not cheering for the mental retardation of a population right? Making a poor ripoff of an all time disaster of a film that nearly ended the one time genius directors career, literally, no one would give him money anymore because it was like investing in toxic waste. But Birdbox makes the Happening seem like a benchmark worth striving for, it at least had an interesting premise, however poorly executed. Birdbox replaces that premise with an unexplained demonic force rising up and causing anyone who looks upon it to commit suicide, but inexplicably cannot appear indoors, but is able to get you through cctv feed, and instead of just coming inside to knock off the rest of humanity (and tie up faulty plot holes I.e. 'what about the blind') the demon/s allow the criminally insane to look upon them without being suicided which turns them into a possessed zombie people? Which is definitely as bad as it sounds and insults the intelligence of those with any shred of self respect left. So yea I ended up going back and watching it all the way just to make sure popular opinion hadn't suddenly proven me wrong and no it wasn't the best thing I've ever seen but it wasn't the worst either. My cutting words are simply directed towards popular opinion that has repeated millions of times how great something so clearly mediocre was. I actually found it sweet at times. But unoriginal and lazy it was most of all. It only succeeded in making me want to suicide myself for being the darling to so many lovers of average. I mean Sandra Bullock was playing an expecting mother and was clearly at least 50 years old. Yea I said it."

","Opening on an instantly gripping note with promise of more thrills waiting ahead, Bird Box paves a solid foundation during its first act yet fails to fully capitalise on it, thanks to the unnecessarily drawn out plot that allows the tension to dissipate, and the weak ending that wraps the entire journey on an underwhelming note.<br/><br/>Directed by Susanne Bier (In a Better World), the set up is brilliant, for it creates the right kind of intrigue, and the decision to not show the supernatural entities works in its favour as well. However, the film's 124 mins runtime isn't earned, it has too many characters & it indulges in subplots that don't contribute much to the final outcome.<br/><br/>The perilous journey down the treacherous river sequence had all the ingredients to be one potential nightmare for the viewers but Bier fails to keep things taut & tense as the plot detours to less interesting events. Sandra Bullock plays her part responsibly plus the two kids aren't drawbacks either. However, that insane twist was by all means an insane choice indeed.<br/><br/>Overall, Bird Box begins on a promising note yet finishes in a way that leaves a lot to be desired. The scares are intermittent yet effective plus the creepy vibe is well-sustained for the most part which might keep the interest alive for many viewers but there was room for improvement here. A strong start marred by a downhill journey, Bird Box is another middling entry in both its genre & Netflix canon."

The rest of the cast is playing not only the typical stereotypes from this type of movies, but also their own stereotypes that they are usually type-casted as, that funny dude from Get Out is being the funny dude here, we have a conscious smart and charming guy that ends up being a love interest, a drunk old man that is likely to become a villain or at least an anti-hero, a hot chick, an old woman who happens to know how to deliver babies, and that's her only purpose really, and Machine Gun Kelly of all people probably playing himself.

"david-von-den-busch","6","0","3","3 January 2019"," An honest review, where I will put movies i really like in the beginning of it, so you can decide if my taste of movies is close to yours..
","Ok first some movies I really like:
Horror: the possession of micheal king
Insidious (series)
The exorcism of emily rose
The possession
The babadook
The conjuring
Case 39
...<br/><br/>That being said.
Hard thing to rate this movie for other people.<br/><br/>I watched it going in without any expectations, and even though the progress of the storyline was filled with flaws that would usually make me hate a movie and turn it off, I kinda still enjoyed watching most of it...<br/><br/>Normally when I find obvious flaws within a movie I get so annoyed I just can't even finish it... Don't know why, but this time i could... Although to be honest 30 minutes before the end of it I fast forwarded a bit to see if the end might solve the biggest problem I had with the story itself. Which it kinda did, but not really either...<br/><br/>First of all, if u know for sure u will die the moment you see, the obvious choice for me was immediately to make urself blind. Second of all, all the blind people in the world aren't just gathered in schools for the blind... So the fact that the big revelation in the end leads them to a school for the blind, while not encountering any blind people before that, or getting news from blind people is just ridiculous and kinda insulting to blind people if u ask me.<br/><br/>Also it makes no point or reasonable arguement to the nature of origin of the ""entity"" that is destroying most of mankind.<br/><br/>Anyway it's late and I'm tired, so not gonna keep writing too much about this movie.<br/><br/>Just saying I enjoyed watching it, nevertheless the people who made it are not too bright in my opinion. The being blind factor had to be included way before the end of the movie. Could've been horrifying seeing sandra B decide to blind the kids to keep them alive.
And would've made it a hell of a lot more credible...<br/><br/>So a hit and a miss at the same time, the hit comes from the cast and acting, the miss comes from the idiots who didn't asked smarter people how their original end of the world hypothesis would unfold.<br/><br/>But watchable nevertheless guys...<br/><br/>Peace"

"kim_smoltz","7","0","1","2 January 2019"," Solid post-apocalyptic tale brought to life by Susanne Bier
","In a very polarizing genre, where most films seem to be hit or miss, Susanne Bier has delivered a solid post-apocalyptic offering in ""Bird Box."" While the source material may be somewhat stale, Bier is able to weave a convincing web of dread, danger, and suspense to keep us on our toes. A strong ensemble cast fills in the rest.<br/><br/>I haven't read Josh Malerman's novel (released in 2014), but this particular tale of the end times -- in which people start dying inexplicably by suicide -- has been seen before, perhaps most notably in M. Night Shymalan's ""The Happening"" (2008). To bring a fresh film adaptation of ""Bird Box"" to the table is therefore an ambitious project, but director Susanne Bier has really hit all the marks with this one. Maybe we can all forget that ""The Happening,"" er, happened? Because this is just a far superior film all-around.<br/><br/>""Bird Box"" is presented in the familiar flashback format. In present day, we have Malorie (Sandra Bullock) desperately escorting two children down a dangerous river; in flashbacks, we learn of the events of the past five years. Like a lot of post-apocalyptic films, there are lots of questions, and not too many answers. But the audience is thrown enough of a bone to satisfy our natural curiosities -- we see the breakdown of society in some very harrowing sequences, which leads way to a cast of characters being isolated together in one household in a southern California neighborhood. Bier takes enough time to foster just enough character development to make things interesting without venturing into ""filler"" territory -- and this is supported by strong acting from Bullock, Malkovich, Howery, and others. While the unknown apocalyptic force is referred to as a ""creature"" or ""creatures,"" none of this is seen, and there is little if any evidence to prove the exact nature of the threat. Some people seem to be immune, or even attracted to this dark force. To my disappointment, this particular concept is never really fleshed out in the film, and seems to almost be a forgotten subplot. Nevertheless, it adds mystery and tension, and ultimately ends up working in the film's favor.<br/><br/>Once the flashbacks end and the film enters its climax, it starts to lose a little bit of steam. There are a few sequences towards the end that reminded me of a bad episode of ""Lost,"" and the ending itself is underwhelming if a little bit contrived. Like I said, the source material doesn't seem to be groundbreaking -- but director Susanne Bier has done some really admirable work with what she was given, and was able to successfully bring this story to life on screen.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it's a great effort, and I'm excited to see what she does next. We'll all probably end up remembering ""Bird Box"" for the memes it has inspired over it's actual substance, but it's a solid film, and absolutely worth watching on Netflix."

","Very suspenseful but hated the ending as always Sandra Bullock was fantastic. IN fact the majority of the characters were believable and held my attention. The twists and turns of the plot kept my interest and allowed me to become part of the story filled with suspense it kept me from guessing the ending. And speaking of the ending that's where I found a problem with this movie. There is no tie up anywhere. What were these creatures or what was this feeling that was causing people to commit suicide. And how come the crazy people and the murderers were left.. It's easy to figure why the blind survived e but there was no explanation at all as to what was causing this or whom. I'm one of those thinking people that likess things to make at least a little bit of sense and if you're going to take me on a path of suspense in which the majority of the people of the world are destroyed at least let me know why"

Yawn! And what's with these people who look like humans may even be human with mad coloured eyes that promote looking at the bad thing and go out their way to make survivors look, killing them in the process even though those that see whatever they see then kill themselves for some reason. Who knows what and why? How come only at the end of the movie do we find the entity can actually taunt the survivors in voices of people from the past?

","What is ""it""?
Why has ""it"" come to Earth?
How did ""it"" get to Earth?
Why do crazy people not try to kill themselves?
Why is ""it"" unable to enter buildings?
Is ""it"" even a metaphor for anything?
Why does ""it"" want people to die?
Why is there a school for the blind in the middle of a forest next to a raging river?
Why do the children act the complete opposite to how actual children would act in that situation?
How did the children know how to swim?
How did the birds not die during the rapids scene?<br/><br/>.....is that Machine Gun Kelly?...<br/><br/>Just some of the questions that you'll ask yourself while watching this film.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock must journey down a river blindfolded with two children named Boy and Girl in hope of finding refuge at the end of the trail. This is integrated with flashbacks to let us know how we got to this position in the first place, which is a actually not done too badly in terms of pace for at least the first half of the film. Its only when you realise that none of these people are going to make it on this journey with her that it becomes less of a question of whether they'll make it or not and more of a question of ""I wonder how this one's gunna die?""
It saps a lot of the tension from any scene these side characters are in, which is a shame as the cinematography and sound design was for the most part pretty solid. There are tense scenes and it does keep you guessing as to whats going to happen next but as the film goes on it begins to drag and the repetitive soundtrack gets a little irritating.<br/><br/>Also at certain points its hard to take an entity like ""it"" seriously when closing your eyes is an effective way of avoiding it completely. Yes it would suck to have to close your eyes every time you went outside but is it really Horror movie Material?<br/><br/>The first act in which everyone is realising this phenomenon and begin committing suicide on a mass level is fun.Cinematography is good and it does make you want to learn about whats going on. Overall effective.<br/><br/>Second act in which people are having to hide together from the outside world in some random house wasn't too bad...or good really. We learn a bit about the characters but not enough for me to actually care that much when they were in danger and not even enough to remember any of their names. It's set up right from the start that none of these people are going to make it so its hard to connect to people not even the script cares about. Also hard to take a character seriously when all you can see is Machine Gun Kelly. I don't think he's a bad actor I just think he sticks out like a sore thumb. Luckily he's not in this film too much and his character has no impact on anything or anyone around him what so ever except that cop woman he bangs just...coz...and then he steals a car, leaving the remaining survivors stranded with limited supplies.
Does he get away and seek refuge at the supermarket? Does he die? Does he feel bad about what he did? We'll never know because the film never goes into it.
I guess he cost a lot for the production company to put him in the film so they gave him like 6 lines and then just had him..drive away. Brilliant.<br/><br/>Evil crazy English guy enters the group and John Malcovich doesn't trust him. Which is completely predictable given his character is just ""the grumpy old man"" however we as an audience are somewhat understanding of his position this time as it has been several hours since this whole thing kicked off and it comes across as fishy when some random starts knocking on the door.
Old man gets locked in garage for being a d**k.
New guy is actually crazy and exposes some of the survivors to ""it""
most of the team dies and now Sandra Bullock and her new love interest must conveiniently escape together.
How, where, why?...you'll never know the film just cuts to 5 years later.<br/><br/>Third act and Sandra Bullock is clearly standing out as having the best acting in this film. If it was not for how good she was in this role it'd be a 3-4 rating. Tom the boyfriend was alright I guess but nothing special. The kids actually are good actors its just the script has not incorporated them into the film whatsoever. They're almost props for Sandra Bullock to struggle with more as she journeys down the river.
They've somehow been surviving for 5 years in the same house, doing ""runs"". Essentially going out and scavenging for supplies, mainly in other houses. Don't know how the water supply has been consistent for 5 years with everyone on the planet dead but never mind the film never explains it. Move on.
The couple have an argument because its the third act and thats what happens in films. There needs to be conflict between at least two of the protagonists.
Tom sacrifices himself because thats what happens in the third act of films usually, leaving Sandra Bullock to look after the children all alone.<br/><br/>Im calling her Sandra Bullock because at this point (waaaay over an hour in) I still have no idea what her characters name is.
She decides to take the ultimate risk and seek out a compound she was previously told about by a mysterious man on the radio. Blindfolded, with two 5 year old children who are also blindfolded. Luckily the script has them act like robots so not too much of an issue.
They have a brief encounter with ""it"" which is prevented completely by keeping their eyes shut and the they escape to the compound which is again...conveniently cut off from the rest of the world. Its completely covered in thick green plants. This is enough to shield them from ""it"". Will they have to be concerned for when the plants die, leaving them exposed? who knows...the film doesn't care.
Sandra Bullock...I mean Mallorie names the kids after 2 dead characters, she talks to that girl from bend it like Beckham and we're supposed to think that this has some sort of subtext surrounding motherhood or something...I don't know the film never explains it.<br/><br/>Cut, thats a wrap, thanks for coming everyone...aaaaaaand credits.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film is not bad. Thats about as much praise as I can give it though unfortunately. Good Acting for the most part, good cinematography and an incredibly vague antagonist.
The rules of this world are bizarre. Sometimes taking you out of the film to have to ask yourself questions about why things are happening the way they are, but at least this film does stick to the rules it sets up for itself.<br/><br/>Honestly don't understand the hype surrounding this film although films like Aquaman make hundreds of millions on their opening week so I guess people really aren't that demanding of films to be good or make sense. I feel like there was a lot of potential with this film and some good ideas that could have been expanded on but it just didn't quite hit the mark for me. I think anything under a 5 is a discredit to Susanne Bier and anything over a 6 is just...wrong.
Wouldn't say I'd really recommend this film although if the premise is appealing check it out, you'll probably have a good time with this one.
If this was a short film it would've made more sense and could have been genuinely masterful.
Sadly......it was not."
"bowmanblue","7","0","1","2 January 2019"," Nearly a classic
","Ever since 'Demolition Man' I've been a fan of Sandra Bullock (I'm ashamed to say). I actually think she's a far more versatile actress than many give her credit for. She's been in many different movie genres over the years, but - to my knowledge - she hasn't done too much in the way of 'horror' (or at least memorable horror films! I seem to recall that 'Premonition' didn't do that well). So, when I saw her in a new horror movie on Netflix that I could watch from the comfort of my own home that was picking up a lot of praise from audiences, I definitely thought I'd give it a go. Overall, when the credits finally rolled, my initial thought was, 'That was pretty good.' I only had one major problem with the film throughout its runtime (I'll get to that later). It's now been a few days since I watched 'Bird Box' and, the more I've thought about the film, the more additional flaws I seem to keep coming up with.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock plays 'Malorie' - a woman who's heavily pregnant when something very strange/bad happens to the world. Basically, everyone starts committing suicide in very gruesome ways. I've seen this film compared to a couple others, but no one seems to mention the similarity in premise to 'The Happening' (perhaps because many are still trying to forget that film?). Anyway, she seeks shelter in a large house with a group of random people and there, they try to wait out, or at least survive whatever is causing this.<br/><br/>The only gripe I came up with while watching this film was that the 'time period' isn't just the goings on at the house with the group. It's split with a segment four years later where Malorie is trying to get two children down a river and the story keeps flicking back and forth between the two time periods. The reason I didn't really go for this method of story-telling was for the same reason I don't like most prequels, i.e. you know what's coming. Because she's on her own (besides the kids), we basically know that no one in the house is going to make it this far for whatever reason and so it removes all tension as I found myself just waiting for other characters to die.<br/><br/>You may see a lot of the marketing behind 'Bird Box' depicting people wearing blindfolds. Hopefully it's not too much of a 'spoiler' to say that the story revolves around the fact that if you look at the monster then you'll kill yourself. What monster you say? Yeah, well, there's a monster - apparently. I read another critic's review online after watching the film and I'm going to blatantly steal their phrase when I say that 'Bird Box' is a monster film without a monster. If you've seen any of the 'Evil Dead' films then you'll know there's that thing that flies through the woods and chases Bruce Campbell. You never see it right? But you see a hell of a lot of other nasties along the way. Here, you just have the thing you never see. It rustles bushes, moves trees and if it gets you... er, well, I'm not sure. Apparently, if you close your eyes you'll be okay. Apart from the times when characters just don't and aren't. In short, there seemed to be a few discrepancies about how the 'world' worked and the rules people had to follow for survival.<br/><br/>Bird Box' clocks in at around two hours and about an hour and a half of the film is set in the house, compared to the final half hour showing how Malorie got to the river and why. Personally, I preferred the stuff in the house. Yes, I had a fair idea regarding what was going to happen to everyone else around her, but I felt there was more conflict within the humans than there was with whatever this thing was that we couldn't see or understand. In specific John Malkovich is about the most famous 'housemate' to share the screen with Sandra Bullock in the house and he's definitely the best to watch. Yes, he's a bit of an idiot, but he's an entertaining idiot and that's what we want to see in our films! The rest of the group seem to have been hand-picked to be as 'diverse' as possible, meaning all races and s3xualities are accounted for and, of course, portrayed favourable - besides John Malkovich and later Tom Hollander - go figure.<br/><br/>I also mentioned that other people have compared it to other films, namely the (really awesome!) 'A Quiet Place.' Yes, I can see there's similar themes here and there and I read somewhere that 'Bird Box' is based on a book that was written well before 'A Quiet Place,' meaning that it couldn't possibly have lifted anything from John Krasinski's surprise hit. Perhaps if 'Bird Box' had have been released first then it would have been considered the better of the two, but, despite my enjoyment of Bullock's performance, if you asked me which one was better, I'd pick 'A Quiet Place' every time.<br/><br/>Overall, weighing up the pros and cons of the film, I can see that it's definitely up there with some of the best Netflix has come up with. However, it does feel sometimes like a little bit tighter writing and shuffling the order of the scenes could have made it into a film that explained a little more about what was going on and didn't leave so much up in the air, or the situations generally to chance as to whether the rules of the phenomenon actually applied at that time or not. If you have Netflix and like horror, give it a watch. It's like the 'Quiet Place' of online streaming services."

","'Bird Box' is definitely not a revolutionary movie for the horror/apocalyptic genre. I agree with the comparisons made to 'A Quiet Place'. In fact, when watching I immediately thought it seemed like a combination of 'A Quiet Place' and 'It Follows', two of which have been two of the most successful and well-received horrors to be received in the last few years. Personally, I don't mind that the idea has taken inspiration or ideas from other movies (let's be realistic, there's no such thing as originality) and this movie definitely has a lot of redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is fantastic (as she is in any role she takes on) as were the rest of the cast, including the children. The strong performances from all of the cast definitely made the story more engaging, because beyond the performances all of the characters were completely lacking in personality or substance. Unfortunately, this did make it hard to connect to the characters and their inevitable deaths had little impact.<br/><br/>The plot itself can be summed up in one brief sentence: in a post-apocalyptic world, a woman with two young children makes a dangerous journey across a river to find sanctuary from an invisible supernatural entity that when seen leads the person to kill themselves. There are little bits in between, but that is the basis of it. Despite the plot being simple and lacking in substance, the two-hour run managed to keep my attention. As mentioned, this is largely down to the fantastic performances, but credit also needs to be given to the crew that managed to build suspense throughout through use of clever camera work and good pacing.<br/><br/>Although 'Bird Box' has been labelled a horror, and there are some moments of horror they are very mild and when watching this definitely felt more like a post-apocalyptic thriller than a horror. For that reason, anyone that's looking for a true horror like 'A Quiet Place' is likely to be disappointed and underwhelmed.<br/><br/>The main issues that drag 'Bird Box' down from getting a 8 or even 9 star rating from me are the plot holes and lack of substance. Much like 'A Quiet Place' there is no explanation for HOW or WHY these entities came to be. Where did they come from? What are they? Why are they causing people to kill themselves? How do they operate? There are many other questions that I was left with that there is no explanation for. In addition, much of the plot is unbelievable and the journey Sandra Bullock's character goes on would be nearly impossible to undertake whilst blindfolded and alone with two young children. As for the lack of substance, the plot unravels in a rather predictable way, the deaths are also predictable and underwhelming, the characters lack personality/background and the ending feels somewhat rushed and anti-climatic.<br/><br/>Despite this there are many more redeeming qualities than bad and overall 'Bird Box' is an enjoyable viewing experience. There's an adequate amount of suspense and intrigue, but the second half does dip off a bit in this regard and begin to fall into a rather predictable narrative. Nonetheless, I would recommend thriller/horror fans to watch this, although if you're an avid horror fan looking for a true horror, this may not be right for you."

There was no explanation of the so-called Presence: what it was, where it came from, how it got here, how it killed, or what was its motive. The movie is like a murder mystery in which the killer is never identified, leaving viewers to wonder what the movie was all about. The ending is stupid."
"wesley-hackelton","5","0","1","1 January 2019"," A Lack of Tension
","There is a common criticism that the movie is a rip off of A Quiet Place. While its premise definitely had a similar feel to A Quiet Place, and it's easy to associate the lack of a sense with not being able to make noise, the plots of these two movies were completely different. The biggest problem with this is it takes away from the ACTUAL problems it had. Namely that it set itself up for failure by trying to create tension in scenes where the characters were only in danger of tripping or running into something.<br/><br/>As long as they left their blindfolds on they couldn't be affected by the shadows. So, in the end of the movie, from the moment Sandra Bullock made it to the kids the tension didn't feel earned or weighted. They tried to make it seem like they were in some sort of danger by having the wind pickup and showing us the shadows behind them, but they spent the movie telling you that as long as they didn't look they couldn't be hurt. They tried to combat this by giving you the people that were enslaved by the shadows, cause they could go where the shadows couldn't. But in that final scene they made it clear that they were only being pursued by the shadows. So, the only tension in the finale of the movie was ""will they make it to the front door or will they mistakenly run into a window?""<br/><br/>In the end, I didn't hate the movie. It had some solid performances from John Malkovich and Travante Rhodes, in particular. But, some of the logistics of the premise made it difficult for me to get into the movie."

"SharkByteAudioProductions","6","0","1","31 December 2018"," Intriguing but ultimately nothing special
","For a Netflix movie, Bird Box has caused quite a stir and it's execution is quite well done.<br/><br/>Despite the 2 hour run time which some what drags at times, the moments of tension and emotional resonance are quite engaging alongside the great score by Trent Reznor and solid cinematography. Acting from the main cast was good - though characters should have shown more raw emotion at times.<br/><br/>It does tip in to clichÃ©s within the apocalypse/survival genre and somewhat lacks depth in it's plot at times. Granted, the characters are fleshed out a bit but parts of the plot is purposely kept vague, which is intriguing but not as exciting as some might come to expect.<br/><br/>Worth a watch but if you want something similar that released this year, go ahead and watch A Quiet Place as it's a much more effective film.<br/><br/>A light 7 / 6.5"
"toonyjakes","5","0","3","31 December 2018"," It's like it wanted to have a theme so badly
","Bird Box is definitely a quality film- there's some good acting in it, decent dialogue, and an interesting method of narrative. But at the end of the day, it's just got nothing to offer.<br/><br/>Plot- A pregnant woman faces an apocalyptic world where anyone who looks outside dies by hallucinating and killing themselves. Birds can sense when the ""entity"" or whatever is near. The burning hot issue for me was that the film never once explains why this happens, as well as why some people can see and just want to watch others kill themselves. Not once. It just sort of ends hoping that you forgot about the whole supernatural element of the film. And i think for that reason, the same plot could have been used with a different protagonist, maybe one who finds the answer.<br/><br/>Writing- Dialogue isn't unbearable, but I will say that some scenes feel way to stagnant. Characters don't quite have their own personality, such as the first scene where we have 3 women talking to each other, all using the same snarky tone, all making back to back wise cracks. It was an awkward scene that shows the importance of distinguishing a character on screen. No one wants to see multiple characters with the same personality.<br/><br/>Characters/Acting- As said before, the characters are relatively stagnant, aside Bullock, her live interest, and an antagonist they unintentionally meet. Acting was good aside MGK who is just way too much like him real self. Did the producers ask the writer ""hey can you just throw in a rap star and have him be some sort of doctor in the film that complains the whole time?""<br/><br/>Quality- Well shot and edited, a very good aspect of the film actually. The music isn't bad at all. The style of the story being inthe past and present was nice.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is nothing to go nuts for. I only watched it because of the hype, and I cannot see why there was any to begin with. Yes it starts right away, gets you interested, feels intense. But once we get to the last third of the film, all of it drops and we starve for reasoning. If you can watch a movie that makes you curious for its entirety and doesnt even try to hint at an explanation, feast your eyes. Other wise you'll be like me, waiting at the last 10 minutes of runtime for your mind to be blown, only to get that waste-of-my-time stomach ache."

","Bird Box is worth the watch if you're into post-apocolyptic stories. The acting is convincing and they've painted a great cinematic picture. I personally would loved to have seen this as a series rather than a movie, as this would give us more opportunity to learn about the why and how of these creatures, as well as the journey of survival within those 5 years separating the flashbacks, and what happens after the movie ends. It feels.. unfinished. Although the lack of clear answers is somewhat part of its charm, I'm disapointed that the filmmakers hintedat those unaffected (or shall we say, differently affected) being mentally disturbed. I would like to learn why the creatures affected them differently. This however leads into a rabit hole of other questions that the movie left unanswered, so perhaps they purposely left us in suspense. Another option is that they opted for a cheap secondary antagonist without giving it much back story, but I don't know if this was was perhaps explained in the book but the movie left it out. What still makes it a 7 for me, is that Bird Box managed to stick in my head for some time after watching. All in all the level of entertainment I got from wondering about this story was perhaps just as fun as watching the movie itself."

"aciessi","5","0","5","31 December 2018"," Seeing is Believing.
","Behold, the most talked about film of 2018, appearing right at the tail-end, that has flooded your internet screens with memes and steaming hot takes. We've been in this new era of streaming cinema for a few years, but I've never seen a streamable film become such a phenomenon so quickly as Bird Box has. I barely new this film existed a week ago, by the end of the week, it was in my face everywhere. Perhaps it's because of it's mass availability. Perhaps it's because it's truly a groundbreaking horror classic we all didn't see coming. Perhaps it's because Sandra Bullock is so good in this, she's gotten herself into an instant comeback. Perhaps it's all of the above. Or... here me out.. perhaps it's all just hype. But you know what, I watched it to. I submitted, I succumbed, I jumped right into the fray and turned on Bird Box. I hand it to Netflix and nearly everyone involved in the making of Bird Box for bringing everyone to the table and tuning into the show. So much so that it's now being reported that 45 million subscribers streamed Bird Box within the first week of it's release. That's not a smash-hit, that's a gold mine.<br/><br/>In the end, Bird Box is truly, unfortunately, just hype. A B-Grade horror movie with a nice little gimmick. But it just doesn't try anything new, nor does it utilize the power of cinema in the profound, horrifying ways we all know it can be used. Many are describing it as A Quiet Place, but replacing noise with sight. A succinct description of Bird Box, and it's correct. But here is the catch, if you must limit a sense, you must enhance others, and you must present excruciating challenges that one must face in eliminating an entire sense, vital to the human condition. Bird Box should be mind-blowing, and yet it settles. It takes the easiest way out. If you've seen any generic Horror movie, you've seen Bird Box. Maybe not with the same budget and high-end actors as Bird Box, but you've seen this movie already nonetheless.<br/><br/>A terrifying virus is sweeping the entire civilized world, and it just stepped foot in America. An epidemic of sudden mass suicides. You've heard of the living undead, try the living ""wish I was"" dead. But these folks don't need Prozac. No, their longing for death comes from a more mystical source. A fantastical being, said to be so beautiful, it makes life itself unbearable. Thankfully, we never get to see what this being is. Chances are, if we did, we'd all be reaching for a blindfold to put on. Malorie Hayes (Bullock), a single mother who never asked or deserved any of this is put to to the test as she loses her sister to the being and seeks shelter in a ""half-way house"" of perfect strangers all looking to survive and keep their virgin eyes unscathed. It's all a matter of who isn't stupid or unlucky enough to die first. Malorie, through sheer badassery, makes it far enough to protect herself and two newborn children, out of sight and out of mind, so to say.<br/><br/>I wish I was scared. I wish this movie gripped me. But instead of praying on our own worst fears (which is what the world's greatest horror movies have ever done) Bird Box takes a terrifying dilemma, and only shows us one dimension. One by one, we see the characters fall victim to the accursed sight, but the viewer doesn't feel it with them. It was as though we all were under the blindfold. An emotional, empathetic blindfold. The dialogue is cheesy. Indistinguishable from a Sci-Fy channel variety Horror movie. The cinematography does it's thing and at time works, but it never goes far enough. Props to the performances by Bullock, Sarah Paulson and even John Malkovich. They were as serious and committed as they should have been to this material. But nothing ever comes together. It's a bit disheartening.<br/><br/>For many, seeing is believing, and most Netflix users have and will see Bird Box. If nothing else, a phenomenon can be worth participating in as a cultural experience. Even if the experience leaves much to be desired."

"JakeBrinkman","5","0","4","30 December 2018"," A less successful ripoff of A Quiet Place
","Because Bird Box involves removing one of our 5 senses, it is easier to review by comparing it to A Quiet Place, which has the same general concept. A Quiet Place removes sound while Bird Box removes sight, but both films involve a monster that is off screen for the majority of the movie and both films attempt to highlight the difficulty of raising children in their situation. There are other similarities as well, but I can't give more details on those without spoilers.<br/><br/>As A Quiet Place knockoff, it doesn't live up to the standards set by the original. It seems devoid of the suspense required for any monster movie that chooses not to show or delays showing the monster, and that is the primary reason why Bird Box fails to pack a punch. However, Bullock does very well, and the movie concept is still interesting, which will probably make this movie worth watching even though you may not want to rewatch it."

"danielmanson","6","0","3","30 December 2018"," Do not believe the hype.
","When this film came out on Netflix, I have never seen so much hype and praise based around it.
It's the most watched film on opening day ever on Netflix and has currently got over 45 million views. There was memes flying around all over social media, based on this film and it was just simply everywhere. So obviously, I had to give it a watch and see what the fuss is all about and I can say with confidence that it should not have all this hype at all.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong, it is not a bad film. It just isn't a great one either. And if you are going to watch this film with high expectations then please lower them or you will be disappointed. I will start by telling you the negatives of this film and then was is good about it.
For me, the film did not have to be over 2 hours long. It felt dragged out in certain scenes and at times very long winded which took away any emotions you are feeling, because you become bored. The biggest problem I am seeing in other reviews on here and social media etc is that there is no closure and nothing is really answered. And I sadly agree with that statement. You are made to wait over 2 hours to find out nothing about what is causing all the deaths. The characters aren't allowed to see ""it"" or they will die. WHAT CAN YOU NOT SEE, SHOW OR TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT. You are made wondering what happened to certain characters come the ending. There is just so many unanswered questions to this ending that it goes far beyond the audiences imagination to just it being a cop out end to a film. There is several instances where, as a viewer, you question the motives of certain things that different characters do. I won't go into examples as I don't want to spoil anything, but you do get miffed off by certain actions and responses that some characters do.<br/><br/>Some positives to this film is that the acting is pretty decent. The 2 children especially as they weren't annoying like a lot of child actors in films. The film did keep you in suspense a lot of the time. You don't know who to trust, who will survive etc. The general idea of the film is also good, you cannot see whoever or whatever is trying to kill you. It is a very similar idea to ""A Quiet Place"" if you know what that is.<br/><br/>But to sum up. I think that the negatives of this film outweigh the positives. Like I said at the beginning, this is not a bad film. But, it is not exactly a good one either. I gave it a 6/10, because there is good things about this movie and it is worth a watch if you need a couple of hours to kill. But, just expect to be miffed by the ending and DO NOT go into this film expecting it to be some unbelievable masterpiece."
"Thrashman88","7","0","1","30 December 2018"," Apocalyptic Suicidal Tendencies
","Netflix has a sometimes morbid fixation with end-of-the-world movies as of lately, and its latest entry is no exception. ""Bird Box"" has an interesting apocalyptic premise: people start killing themselves for no apparent reason, just by looking at thin air. Instead of turning into Zombies ala ""The Walking Dead"", the folks in Bird Box simply go suicidal. Whereas in TWD we are informed that some sort of virus is responsible for making the dead come alive, in ""Bird Box"" we are never given an explanation, with only hints of what it could be. In order to avoid going suicidal, people have go blindfold out in the open and avoid looking at thin air.<br/><br/>Pregnant single mother Malorie (Sandra Bullock), narrowly survives the apocalypse in her hometown (somewhere in the Bay Area) by finding refuge at a house that soon becomes the main shelter for survivors in that neighborhood. Malorie and the rest of the survivors in the house conclude that they need to blindfold themselves in order to avoid going suicidal which means driving blind to the supermarket when they run out of food. We also know that a very small group of people are immune to whatever's causing this ""suicidal craze"", but these people are psychos with mental problems.<br/><br/>The movie is quite tense and it develops at a nice pace but my only complaint is that it never explains anything about what caused the suicidal rage and why some people are immune (aside from actual BLIND people, of course). Just like Netflix's other apocalyptic entry, ""How It Ends"", the streaming giant just isn't interested in letting people know the origins of their Armageddon flicks, which in turn makes them look half baked and with lackluster endings.<br/><br/>It seems that ""Bird Box"" would've fared much better as a mini series, since a TON of stuff is left unexplained as if on purpose.

"adam-1819","5","0","1","30 December 2018"," Cloverfield with blindfolds
","If you like an ever-present threat and a story exploring the condition of fear, you'll enjoy this. If you like a story where there is a plausible meaning and a conclusion, nah, move on. In the mode of Cloverfield, where the enemy is unexplained (until the made for Netflix sequel), there is one paragraph of explanation in the form of 'ancient civilisations believe that blah blah' getting nowhere near a satisfactory answer to what the malevolent entities causing mass-suicide are or what their purpose is, which left will leave you feeling unfulfilled.<br/><br/>Although some annoying plot holes, the acting is OK, but nothing more than one should expect from Bullock (looking at times like Michael Jackson in the Bad era) and Malkovich (channeling Victor Meldrew minus the puppies).<br/><br/>The concept of not being able to see your foe is never really played as frighteningly as it could have been either, as for most of the film the entities cannot harm you if you can't see them (reverse Doctor Who episode anyone?) and psychotic humans, immune to the desire to top themselves, scream their presence blocks away! If I had directed this I would have gone for minimal lighting and constant close ups to exacerbate the feeling of claustrophobia and 'what's lurking around the corner'.<br/><br/>Finally, after five years avoiding disease and malnutrition, Malarie finds a sanctuary and discovers that despite realising within the first few minutes of the movie that birds can detect the entities, if only she'd thought about it two minutes longer she would have realised that she could take off the blindfold when they were relaxed too. Doh! She could have saved a hell of a battering down stream if only she'd have got there first.<br/><br/>The thing I struggled most with in this movie was the treatment of the two children who after five years of mental abuse from not only the entities, but Malerie, would have been deeply traumatised in reality. I get that she had a father with hair and a mother who liked horses, but where did this hatred of children come from? I've not been this displeased at an attitude to children since the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (who, when I think about it, Bullock resembles at times in this too!)<br/><br/>On reflection I think this would have made a better multi-part series where the story could have been fleshed out as well as the characters, but I still love that Netflix is creating such high budget material."

I had ideas about how it was going to end but was never quite sure, so points to them for not making it easy to predict. The ending was not satisfying to me.

"Diedelmon","6","0","1","30 December 2018"," It's ok
","I enjoyed the movie. It reminded me a lot of ""The Road,"" and maybe this piece was what Shyamalan wanted when he made The Happening - and no, for the love of God, this movie has nothing to do with ""A Quiet Place"". It's a good thriller. Entertaining. Sandra Bullock Once more is amazing on screen. Trevante Rhodes proves himself as a versatile actor and stands amazing beside Bullock and Malkovich. The pacing of the story is good. We're on the edge of the seat at times.
I did not see all the allegories people said this movie dealt with, like depression and anxiety; I did not find it an ""Annihilation"" or a ""Get Out"". It's an apocalyptic monster movie. No mystery or deep meaning there.
It was a little annoying not to show the monsters - not one bit - but at the same time, maybe it's a smart decision. It's known that their presence means absolute danger, that doesn't take eyes to know. The starting point felt a little rushed, like World War Z - actually both starting sequences have the same tone of rush, confusion and urgency. There are tense moments.
And for that, I have nothing to complain about. It's a nice thriller; I enjoyed it.
The movie is ok."

"procletnic","5","0","3","30 December 2018"," This movie is the definition of average. And average isn't good by any means.
","The movie has a promising start but it lacks many important ingredients for it to be anything else than an average cliched sci-fi horror wannabe flick. The main things which aren't there are effects, any resemblance of realism and any sort of lore.<br/><br/>When it comes to the effects, they are non-existent. The ""entities"" which are responsible for the whole mess are simply invisible. How convenient for the producers, they were able to save just enough money on effects to pay Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief is something which this movie struggles with. You want me to believe that a computer screen can turn you into a suicidal maniac? Fine. You want me to believe that it can turn your eyes from brown to blue? Fine. You want me to believe that Sandra Bullock can run through a thick, unfamiliar forest, blindfolded while carrying two 5 yearolds? Nope. You want me to believe you can drive a car without seeing anything but GPS in a debris filled city? Nope. There's a fine line between something being perceived as possible and something being perceived as total nonsense when it comes to sci-fi flicks. You'll be perceiving a lot of nonsense while watching this one.<br/><br/>Sci-fi movies of this type are fun because they present the viewer with a mysterious and interesting antagonist. The formula which works best is always the same - introduce the mysterious ""aliens"", show the effect these malevolent ""aliens"" have on human kind, introduce a solution based on our understanding of the ""aliens"" and finally - present the viewer with some sort of closure. This particular movie follows the formula but has a significant problem. There's absolutely no explanation for the occurring phenomenon. Most movies utilize some sort of mechanism through which they inform the viewer what these antagonists are. This kind of mechanism is severely lacking here.<br/><br/>If you are OK with average then I suggest you give this movie a try. If you are someone who values his time and wants to watch quality stuff then avoid this one."

","This movie is a product of sex between A Quiet Place and the Happening. And the movie, thankfully, received more genes from A Quiet Place. The acting throughout is mostly fine, especially from Bullock and Malcovich. Their characters were the most developed. The basic premise that you get from the trailer is that something has been causing people to commit suicide so you cannot look at it. A premise that isn't new to Hollywood, just written in a different style. What this movie also gets right is the atmosphere. Everything is appropriately creepy to keep the viewer entertained for the entirety of the runtime. However, the movie does suffer a bit from unnecessary characters that are present to just serve the purpose of heightening the death count. The 2nd act stalls just a tiny bit but other than that, it's an enjoyable story fueled with atmosphere and fine(for the nost part) acting."

"cbsman97","6","0","4","29 December 2018"," I don't get the hype, it's an okay movie.
","First, a lot of people are calling this a rip off of A Quiet Place, it's not. They do share similar plot mechanics that add to the suspense of the movie, but that's about it. I think this movie EXTREMELY similar to M Night Shyamalan's 2008 movie The Happening. If anything Bird Box rips that movie off a lot. Both explore the aftermath of a mass suicide driven apocalypse perpetrated by an unknown entity. So if you want to compare it to anything, then compare it to that movie.<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie is pretty average. It has some suspenseful parts, but most of this is anticlimactic because the ""flash back and forward"" structure of the movie makes things predicatble. There are also holes that also make it predictable. For example, halfway through the movie, I turned to my girlfriend and asked her, ""what about blind people? What are they doing during this?"". The blatant omission of blind people in the earlier parts of the movie made the ending really predictable.<br/><br/>Overall it was an okay movie and I really don't get the hype that this has been recieving."

"jhmeaney-50002","7","0","1","29 December 2018"," Modest storytelling and genuine performances make this cautionary tale work on multiple levels
","The film leads with a decent backdrop, providing both a sense of family value and realistic character qualities. We are given just enough details surrounding the main protagonist and her motivation for survival almost immediately. Our heroine is with child, and seemingly has a positive relationship with her (presumably older) sister, who is perhaps even her best friend. As the story progresses, we will learn that they share a common bitterness towards their late father, who apparently lacked any worthy patriarchal qualities. So, given that, we can surmise that the two are basically the only family each other has. As it begins, this family is happy and full of hope. Not too soon after, however, the mood changes with the vague unfolding of chaotic events that leaves the older sister deceased, and our protagonist alone and pregnant. The vague chaos, as it is, revolves around a mysterious attack that seems to be occurring on a global scale. We see streets filled with people intentionally killing themselves upon looking up towards the sky. We don't see any visible entities and we don't know for certain what this ""invasion"" really is, but it's likely inferred that it may be linked to an extraterrestrial threat. That being said, the majority of the population appears to be under the influence of this threat, and ultimately end up engaging in a mass suicide/homicide course of action. Our heroine finds refuge and friendship in a local house where we are introduced to several new characters of different backgrounds and beliefs. As typical survival scenarios play out, some characters are foils that highlight the attributes and qualities of our main protagonists, and some are not to be trusted. As it turns out, there are confrontations and connections that keep the story's momentum going. As a result, our leading lady finds herself raising two young children alongside her newfound love interest, all leading up to five years after the initial events. Without giving away the best spoilers, it's safe to say that many people are loved and hated, and most meet an untimely demise. This may certainly upset the audience, but it is tastefully executed for contextual purposes. Overall, the story seems to present a very powerful and relevant message at its core. The concept of sight and equality are obvious, however, the importance of family and community are most essential, especially when it unifies a damaged and distraught collection of people who ultimately realize that they have more in common than they initially believed prior to the catastrophic events that take place. Symbolism aside, the acting feels very real and there are more than enough genuine performances to keep the ball rolling in this simple tale. Top nods go out to Sandra Bullock and rising newcomer Trevante Rhodes for their roles. All-in-all, this is soon to be a cult classic that truly explores the concept of a melting pot society at a crucial time when race and gender equality seem to bolster more hate than love. There are real threats beyond delusional vanity and any other distorted interpretation of anthropocentrism. Remember equality while watching this movie."

The times that I was supposed to feel thrilled I certainly did, and I really liked the visual tone of of the movie. It certainly has the post-apocalyptic aesthetic.<br/><br/>My main issue is how unfathomable it is. I get it, yeah movies don't have to be realistic, but this is anime levels of over-exaggeration that don't work in live action movies. Creatures that speak without having mass that can speak and move debris just feels silly. And this movie takes place over 5 years, you'd figure they'd learn how to not let it get to their heads, or figure out a way to see without being infected, like maybe wearing welding masks. Maybe these points were discussed in whatever the concept was based on.<br/><br/>And when they let Gary into the house, I don't understand why they would leave him alone. He obviously looked sketchy, and out that annoying record back on when they all went upstairs to have babies at the same time (lmao what timing). I suppose that's what makes it suspensful because you know he's gonna kill most of them, but the only one who sees it is the ""a-hole"" guy who they lock in the garage. And also, why was he blindfolded when he wasn't near a window, all he had to do was not look outside. Or even simply open his eyes for a fraction of a second to shoot Garbear in the friggin head. I don't know, I wanted to like the movie more than I did, but it just felt so stupid - the whole plot and concept felt idiotic. Like the two kids being named ""Boy"" and ""Girl"". Give me a break, that's such a lame plot point lol. Also these kids are friggin' dumb - they might be kids, but I sure as hell wouldn't be wandering off every opportunity I had when blindfolded in a forest.<br/><br/>NEVERTHELESS, I enjoyed it Sandra and the gang were awesome at playing their roles. I struggled with the transparent script with inconsistent writing, but the movie's atmosphere and suspense helped me look past it. If you want something interesting to watch, then give this a shot.

","It is basically a survival story with a nontypical threat to human survival which is never exactly explained what it is. I did not read original novel but I found too many unexplained issues or unbelievable events: why some are not affected and do not kill themselves? (Because they are 'mad'? That's all?) How come Douglas manages to do what he could not do before and exit the garage, harm Gary? (Why didn't he do it before?) Rick says that somebody has to open their eyes because rapids are too dangerous, then Malorie decides that nobody needs to open the eyes, and miraculously they all survive? (How did the small children, not attached by a rope with their mother, know how to swim?) She runs blindfolded holding two children in the forest arriving at the house in no time...in the end there are still a lot of unanswered questions on how humanity can survive - I mean the resources of this 'sanctuary' are not eternal and the 'enemy' outside is still there..."

","But make no mistake, this is no piece o cake.
Tis a slice not so nice; not the worst acting, but an an endless wait.<br/><br/>And the reward for waiting...NOt worth fir a 6/10.
Nowadays its rare to see something longer than an hour and half since the average * insert country of nationality here* can barely sit still for asit still contest, let alone keep interest in something they paid for themselves. Like a child with extreme ADHD. Yet as one that actually has ADHD, let me tell you this movie was not BAD, and I was paying attention, thus I saw nothing to truly dazzle, and predictability stalked the land like a great big, unseen, stalky thing.
Making anything good, especially a visual story like a film these days, is like the modern equivalent of the quest for the holy grail. What a wonderful aspiration to try and reach for something so grandiose, yet ones hopes are too often dashed in the tiresome, unfulfilling pursuit.
It was nice to see Sandra Bullock in something other than a crummy romcom after so many years. When suddenly she gets hard up for the sole dude that
is a little kind to her, and is too in shape, despite never seen exercising or having enough food to eat. IS this a Tyler Perry movie? Theres a demerit.
Where so many ""unseen danger lurking"" or "" invisible end times scenario"" movies have failed time and time again over the last 20 years in films, BIrd Box was better than the rest. Some films have based off of books, like Bird Box , some have not. Some are just about invisible electrical surges that any kid can arc to death and save the day... Spasiba comrade, yaaay >,;,<
A couple of rules to survive an impending doom scenario , at least from the hollywood point of view *ahem*:
Number One - Run/ Get a Gun
Number Two - Get out of plain view/ Just worry about You
Number Three - Get to Safety/ Have a Plan B
Number Four - Dont open the Door
Number Five - Have supplies
Number Six - No Kids or pregnant chicks
Number Seven - Loud noise = To you ""they're"" headin'
Number Eight - Law Low and Stay Safe/ Get rid of those that aggravate
Number Nine - Drink water not wine/alcohol (I'm not hatin' I'm just sayin')
Number Ten - Only Friends and Kin ( Everybody else go 'way)
Yah I know that sounded corny as could be, but for all the merits that this movie had,these tropes seem to always be close to the unofficial rule set that scary movies and end game scenario sci fi always break in spades.
At least with Bird Box there was some nuance to a relative degree. Yet the time lapsing, back and forth, and poor choices of characters didnt help. And though likely a fair to realistic mirror to the historic and unfortunate stupidity of our species during a panicked crisis, where were the real types that just have plain common sense?! There was technically one, and for him a special rule:<br/><br/>You Listen to John Mutha*#&@$%^ Malkovich when he speaks!<br/><br/>The blind leading the blind, as the tired old saying goes, and in a movie about not looking, it really shows. Bird Box should have been named ""Land of the Blind"", cause in it the ""one eyed man/people"" really were king. The only survivors were crazies , aside from our pathetic protagonists. Yet even the main character, a woman that is a home body and knows not to go outside cause the world and people suck, she doesnt take her own time honored advice! WHAT?! Why the films that depend upon a single sensory organ, yet end up so easy to circumnavigate to safety? Why have these stories caught on? NO seeing in Bird Box. No noise in A Quiet Place ( though any creature with advanced hearing could have found those fools from the get go), and what almost amounted to ""No smelling the air"" in The Happening, as if Death's bony behind had any flesh left to rot to forewarn of its coming.
IS there a message here? Are all the tales, regardless of the media used to bring them to us, trying to tell us to simply pay more attention? Cause this one seems to contradict that. Dont look at that touchscreen. Put down that device if its not about world affairs or an e book, or face timing with the family and friends you dont bother to see anymore. Make the effort to wake up, is I suppose the subtext in this, if one surpasses the tried christian notion of t judgement days almost thrown in our faces..
At least we had Malkovich for a while, cause none would need rules written in stone. Still rules for living are there. They are more ""What you'd call guidelines""... But i guess you would have to be a genius to simply survive and have a plan in what seemed like one of the richest places in the world, or at least the west coast of America ( name dropping about North of San Francisco, and Sausilito in California. Rich enough anyone should have a plan A through B at least). Another film that would go well with a drink, but if thats not your cup o tea...may dont give this... a LOOK-SEE. >,;,<"

","First off the performances in this movie are great, especially from Sandra Bullock and their are some truly suspenseful moments in the movie. However my biggest issue with the film is the pacing, some moments of the film are very slow and just plain boring which just made the film feel very stretched out for no reason. Also so many unanswered questions! Leaving the mysterious threat in the movie unanswered is alright for me as helps with horror element but what about the people who didn't get killed by the 'plague' but worked for it? Or the couple who just left the house with no explanation? What happened to the rest of the world? Why kill off most of the characters in one scene and have a massive 5 year time jump?"

"jaimiewhichelow","8","0","1","28 December 2018"," Suspenseful and attention grabbing
","I see a good number of negative reviews and created an account just to add some balance. This movie is captivating and fully entertaining. Some people are calling it a copy/ripoff. Be realistic, people. There are many of the same or similar themes circulated around Hollywood, and they can be well executed and thought provoking regardless of that. Just think about Star Wars and Star Trek. Similar themes widely explored by Hollywood, and both of them are extremely well-loved. Bird Box is a new take on a previously explored theme. Big deal-that is not nearly enough to discredit it. Sandra Bullock's character growth and her understanding of relationships is a major focus. It isn't just about the scary, unexplained supernatural force. There are also quite a few people criticizing the movie for not tying up loose ends, specifically that there's no explanation for the strange occurrence. In the event of an apocalypse of this nature, do you really think there would be some scientist in your small group of survivors that could explain what was happening? Doubtful. You'd probably be holed up with your neighbors or coworkers. That makes this a realistic portrayal of what you might be left with-no explanation. If a couple of people ran off together and abandoned the group, would you ever find out what happened to them? Probably not. Are there some stereotypical supporting characters? Yes, because that's how movies are made and characters are developed. Every movie has room for improvement. I took away a couple stars because I would like to have seen a little more depth at the end-more about the community. I also thought the dual pregnancies/simultaneous deliveries was pretty unrealistic, crossing into cheesy. But other than those two things, I found this to be a very good movie. I was entertained the whole way through, never bored, and stayed captivated. I related to the characters, experienced the suspense the movie was aiming to establish, and enjoyed the special effects and cinematography. This movie, while not perfect, was still well done and worth watching."

"e-1529","7","0","4","27 December 2018"," Good movie but the premise doesn't hold up
","Watching the Bird Box reminded me of 'A quite place', another recent apocalyptic movie I watched recently. When I finished watching 'A quite place' I was left satisfied and that was not the case with Bird Box. Both movie are very well done, have great productions and great acting. The difference is that the premise of Bird Box is not explained very well throughout the movie and without a strong premise everything else is affected in the end. Throughout the movie you're kind of left waiting to see what is driving people crazy and suicidal and hoping for god's sake that they will show you but it never happens. There's an invisible evil force and we basically don't know anything about it. It behaves differently in different kinds of situations. Just one example, why did Malorie and the kids hear the voices in their heads only when they are outside? The same goes for moving objects, the car was being moved outside but nothing ever moved when they were indoor. I mean, is that thing not capable of going inside?
So all in all , this could have been much better movie if they had focused on re-enforcing the initial premise of the movie and provide more details to the audience. I can almost picture in my head what those who came up with this idea were thinking. ""Let's make a horror movie where people can't keep their eyes open!"". Well that's a very good idea but unfortunately it was not developed to its full potential. 'A quite place' on the other hand didn't leave any stones unturned. All in all Bird Box is a solid movie but it leaves you hanging and I hope they make a sequel where they explain what the heck this evil thing is and what it looks like. And that somehow would retroactively make the first movie better, just like a show series with unexplained situations, that becomes better as a whole, when they explain things later on."

"kurppanoori","6","0","3","27 December 2018"," Dull and badly executed
","It's okay. The premise was good: some strange creatures that make you want to kill yourself, when you see them, but it was just executed very badly. The premise could have been expanded upon something great, but it turned out to be just yet another A Quiet Place and The Happening.<br/><br/>The story is boring, predictable and stretched way too long. With a running time of two hours, it's just a dull watch. The characters were non-memorable, there was no character development. The plot was very straight-forward and I could just guess every coming event. Also the end was very anti-climatic.<br/><br/>My biggest concern was the plot holes and just leaving so many things unexplained. Like, what were the creatures? All we see is just wind blowing. What did people see, when they saw the ""creatures""? Why did some go mad and kill themselves, while others went mad and killed others? There was a little hint, that the people not killing themselves had escaped from an asylum, but why? If you're mad already, the creatures just make you homicidal? Why weren't birds (and apparently other animals) affected by the creatures? What happened to the two characters who stole the car? Why did the main characters have to go into the river, when they could have just walked the shoreline? What did the characters eat for 5 years? It's not like they were growing their own food. Why couldn't the creatures come inside buildings?<br/><br/>If you can get past things like this, it's fairly watchable, if you have nothing else to do. But if there's some other movie you're interested about, watch that instead."

"con_au","7","0","1","27 December 2018"," Great - but bring your A-grade suspension of disbelief
","Bird Box is based on the 2014 debut novel of Josh Malerman, and it's translation to film struggles with some of the leaps of faith that can maybe be more easily made in print.
Malorie (Sandra Bullock) is a crotchety, middle-aged, mother-to-be when the planet goes beserk with an unidentified force giving folks some weird pink-eye, closely followed by an irresistible compulsion to kill themselves.
By un/happy accident (depending on the character's POVs), Malory is dragged into a (gorgeous) home where a collection of tropes have somehow gathered to seek shelter.
Top shelf casting here as Trevante Rhodes (Tom), John Malcovich, Jacki Weaver, Machine Gun Kelly, Tom Hollander and the psychiatrist dude from SVU join a couple of other randoms, largely as road kill on the path to learning a bit more about how the invisible agents of infection operate. They scare birds. They can infect some people who become weaponised and infiltrate 'clean' groups - sort of insultingly, these carriers appear to be escaped mental patients.
Eventually, the group is picked off save for Malory, Tom and two newborn infants. Five years later, they're well-adjusted to their largely blindfolded life when they receive
radio contact from a person claiming to offer sanctuary, but only after a perilous journey. Drama follows.
Bullock is pretty good given the amount of facets she's asked to take on, although the amount of post-apocalyptic eyeliner she comes up with surprised me. The supporting cast, the two little kiddies in particular, are solid.
But, for me, the plot makes everyone work really hard. Successful thriller/horror films have to keep the tension between what we know, and what we don't know really balanced. Here, in trying to squish in a lot of the book's tangents, we're left with a lot of questions and not a huge amount of character development.
The ending is a surprise twist away from the novel's, which I think is a shame. For me, it's a
choice that ends up landing the film in 'young adult' territory.
It doesn't require Sherlockian powers of observation to see parallels between A Quiet Place and M Night Shyalaman's The Happening. Elements of sensory depravation, and the invasion of an unseen, psychopathic foe are present in all three films, which doesn't necessarily make any unoriginal.
For my money, director Susan Bier could have lost some characters, put Malorie on the road earlier, created some more spikes of tension and built to a darker, but still fully resolved and not necessarily tragic, conclusion.
The more pedestrian approach chosen seems, somehow, to me to need more suspension of disbelief than a more extreme one would have.
In any case, a pretty good effort and well worth the watch."

Many a horror film has been made with similar themes, i.e. don't listen, don't make a noise (no, it's not 'A Quiet Place' rip-off), don't switch off the lights, etc etc. However, the story was well executed and well acted. Sandra Bullock was great and supported by fab performances from John Malkovich, Tom Hollander and others. The child actors in particular were great.<br/><br/>Unlike others, I liked the fact that there was no explanations as to the origins of the monster, what it looked like or why it arrived on earth.

","Firstly, it's a misleading title. But the title doesn't make a film good or bad, it's just a title. But it's like calling Shrek...Blue Flower, Red Thorns. Yes they are both in the movie, but barely have anything to do with the plot. But anyway, Bird Box is a conflicting movie. It's does things right, but gets things wrong too, and I'm not sure if the positives outweigh the negatives. First I'm going to mention the elephant 🐘 in the room, it's very similar to A Quiet Place, but instead of noise being a factor, it has sight as a factor. While I do like the idea, even if it's pretty basic just like A Quiet Place, it all comes down to execution. And that's were things get muddy. The film became very predictable right from the beginning and I can see the outcome of a solution before it even happens. The film is very slow as well, making feel longer than it is, my partner I was watching went to the restroom and to my surprise it was only on for 1 hour and 11 minutes, I felt it was at least 2. So what I'm saying is, the pacing was off, and it didn't do a good job at holding my suspense like A Quiet Place where I was on the edge of my seat due to John Krasinski's direction. Susanne Bier is the director her, and as a seemingly first timer, she did a descent job, just needs to work on her pacing. Sandra Bullock was fabulous as always and pretty caries the entire film on her back, and she is the reason this film gets a 7 from me. I enjoyed John Malkovich in this but wasn't in the film for long which I was disappointed about. A surprise appearance by both BD Wong (Jurassic Park) and Machine Gun Kelly but they were cameos mainly. The story itself had potential, I like the idea of having no sight to solve problems but that can result in writing issues and it shows at times. However, the one thing this film has that's better than A Quiet Place is the ending. It actually had a complete ending. Overall, it is a film with both strengths and weaknesses, and to me the positives slightly outdoes the negatives having mainly to do with Sandra Bullock. If you like a movies that is not as suspenseful as A Quiet Place, this is it. For me, I will never see this again, but I am glad I can say I watched a film called Bird Box, it's just a silly title, but it's a good silly."

Interesting concept, huh?<br/><br/>On the other hand, the idea of a backstory struggles to uncover the supposed thrill and momentum it has to offer thus making it less ineffective, less substantial, and boring at some times. Unlike in 'A Quiet Place', the delivery of the plot is straightforward without relying on cliche-y and unnecessary backstory hence you could really feel that the momentum is firmly and consistently building up (not to mention its plot holes as well).<br/><br/>Character development is also poor; Malorie remains Malorie.

"cruise01","8","0","1","27 December 2018"," Suspense and thrills but with a weak ending.
","Bird Box (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Bird Box is bit of a scary apocalyptic thriller film with a concept of blindfolding yourself to survive from some supernatural entity that will cause you to commit suicide. We already got a horror movie that played with the concept of keeping quiet such as A Quiet Place. Bird Box messes with a concept of closing your eyes when walking through the apocalyptic lands.<br/><br/>The plot was good. It is a survival thriller. About a pregnant Malorie (Sandra Bullock) who gets caught up in a mass epidemic of people committing suicides. She gets rescued by Tom (Trevante Rhodes) and held up in a house with Cheryl (Jacki Weaver), Lucy (Rosa Salazar), Olympia (Danielle Macdonald), and Douglas (John Malkovich). They figure out there is some kind entity that is causing people to commit suicide. Some kind of evil that cannot be seen nor can you look at it. They will have to gather their resources, stay inside, and watch out for any other threats that may be lurking outside.<br/><br/>The plot begins with Malorie and two children crossing a river. Trying to get to a safe haven. While it flashes five years earlier; Malorie surviving with a group of people in a house. The plot is a bit of a mystery on what is causing this threat. Without going much into details, it does leave it open and vague with what this threat is. From the maniac people that are obsessed with this supernatural thing. By the time the film reaches its end, you still do not get a direct answer on what it is. Which is for the best cause it does leave you feeling chills with characters being chased by some invisible thing. The direction and music score also helped build the suspense and thrills. The music score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross helped create the chills feeling when something is lurking outside with people trying to hide from an unstoppable force.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock delivered a great performance. Trevante Rhodes was also good as well. However, I did feel like the film was having trouble coming close to its climatic end. Yes, it is a survival story with Malorie and two children trying to find a safe haven. But once you reach the end, you will be asking yourself, that's it? It ends a little too quickly without an actual climax.<br/><br/>Overall, Bird Box is a good apocalyptic thriller. It does deliver some suspenseful chills with its direction and music score. The plot and concept was good with the survival story with blindfolding yourself and walking through the apocalyptic city. And the performances were great."

Also the driving with blacked out windows and not hitting anything was a bit unrealistic... also floating in the river without hitting the sides constantly.. but with all that considered it was still an entertaining movie even though you never actually see the threat. I feel like it would have been better if you at least saw it once.. perhaps when Tom died.. they should have let us see what he saw and it would have taken the film to the next level.

However, at the end of the day, you still don't have the slightest idea of what malignant force has taken over the Earth, which gives rise to the strong possibility of a sequel."
"jcawthon-24749","6","0","3","26 December 2018"," Bad Writing of Book & Movie bring down acting.
","This movie is really just a gimmick to put people in a contrived scary predicament. There's no plan to explain why or how it got this way because the book doesn't either. It's like a King short story that just wants to give the scare but doesn't have time for anything more. Some things I really couldn't get past with both the book and the movie. How is it that everyone just figures out that people are dying because of something they saw? There's never any evidence explained, people just all quickly go to blinding themselves so they won't see it. Never do we see such experiments to determine if the threat was viral or something much more plausible. Ok so everyone is supposed to just go along with people just figured it out somehow. Fine. Then you have more unexplainable contrived things happen you have to just accept and go along with I won't spoil. Where The Quiet Place contrived it's gimmick to have to stay quiet ""Hear No Evil"" this one is the second monkey. ""See No Evil"" and if you want to see a movie about the last monkey you could check out Pontypool. There's your ""Speak No Evil"" gimmick film. A perfect trilogy for the 3 monkeys. But none are really brilliant. Some have better cinematography, writing, or acting. But they are very narrow and claustrophobic stories you can't consider outside the contrived bubble it exists in. Worth watching though for a few good moments maybe."

"kathschneck","6","0","3","26 December 2018"," A failed attempt to follow A Quiet Place
","Found the plot progression and dialogue odd and unconvincing. Some of the premises make zero sense and are unexplained. Tried to do a lot and failed I think. A Quiet Place allowed representation for the deaf community in a way that was respectful and hopeful. I am troubled by how the film concludes at a Blind School. No explanation as to why being blind is being spared (you can't experience this evil in other ways? Just by sight?) In many ways this essentializes vision and places it in a moral field. Not only is this not representative of real blind people but there is no likelihood of Sandra's character, a woman with sight, could've gone down the river with two kids and survive. It's a romanticization of sense deprivation that does more harm than good"
"spider853","5","0","4","26 December 2018"," Good idea - lazy writing
","The starting of the movie feels promising and leads to some interesting predictions. Sadly it fells into a lazy plot trap, bringing crazy people as a threat and other non interesting stuff. The movie would've been much more interesting if the plot would go like this: Remove all the crazy people thing and dark creature drawing. Use the actual biblic apocalipsis, where Christ/God comes to earth and revive all dead people and takes the ones alive. Imagine if at the end of the movie she finally takes the eye cover away and sees the being, which calls her to leave here body and join the it to the heaven. That would explain people wanting to kill them selves and seeing/hearing already dead people!"

Is it the daylight?, is it the wind? is it looking at people who knows? why offer any explanation when you can use it as a terrible plot device to try and move your awful story forward. Done in a flash forward where the transitions are nearly always unrelated to each other in a pitiful attempt to make the drawn out narrative seem interesting. The only thing that can be known for sure about this terrible story is the strongest women ever will step over the corpses of everyone to protect her childrens that she refuses to name because her daddy was too hard on her.

"vshukri-83740","4","0","3","24 December 2018"," LOTS of potholes and unanswered questions.
","If it wasn't for Sandra's acting, I would have DNFed. I should also mention I didn't read the book (I know the book was written before The Happening came out, so I don't think it plagiarized anything like some people are suggesting.)
But I didn't read the book (I have no desire too now after this movie) but maybe some of these questions were answered there, and Netflix dropped the ball.<br/><br/>I'll start with the good first.<br/><br/>-Sandra's acting. As always she proves her craft is top notch.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes of the film was action packed and had me on the edge of my seat. Everything from the fear of watching people go crazy, to meeting the other characters and them taking up shelter in the home, it all was on point.<br/><br/>-The symbolism of the ending.<br/><br/>What I did NOT like:<br/><br/><ul><li>SO. MANY. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. Lord, where do I begin?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Felix and the female cop. What happened to them? (In my mind they became the people in the cars) but there is nothing to support that, so it's just my own mind trying to make sense of it.</li></ul>To be honest, they should have just killed those two off, but instead, they randomly stole the car and left? Why? What was the purpose? The only thing I can think is that they needed them to either be gone (in which case, kill them) Or to take the car so when the other dude gets trapped in the garage he can't escape (BUT if that was the case, why not just, you know...NOT give him access to the keys?) Plus why would he take the car when the danger is outside? There were plenty of ways get around that.<br/><br/><ul><li>The river. But before I get to that, I should note My husband HATED this movie because he just didn't understand how someone could ever navigate a river and continue heading in direction if they were blindfolded. He also hated that there was no explanation for anything. Like it made him so mad he couldn't enjoy the rest of the movie.</li></ul>MY argument to him was that blind people can navigate the world, and after five years of essentially being blind, she acclimated.<br/><br/>However, the river WAS a little over the top in terms of believe ability.<br/><br/><ul><li>We never get an answer as to why this is happening in the first place. Which, normally I can wrap my head around (sometimes stuff just happens as such is life.) But this was...I don't know. Lazy?</li></ul>I mean, I wasn't looking for some ten-minute deep, profound explanation...in fact, I enjoy movies and books that give me the freedom to form my own opinion and don't spell every little thing out for me, but this was too much.
I just needed a little something to make sense of it all, but I was never given one.<br/><br/>-Why are some people dying but others aren't? Aside from the obvious (blind people), I don't understand why most were dying, but others weren't.
MY guess, in the beginning, was that Sandra's character didn't die because she was pregnant (and babies can't see) so somehow the life-form she was carrying was protecting her.
BUT again, that was just ME filling in the blanks for that character.
It was NEVER discussed why some people weren't dying when they were exposed. I know it's because we needed more bad guys to kill the good guys to create conflict etc, but again, a little explanation would have been nice.<br/><br/>-The chemistry/ romance between Tom and Sandra. *sigh* I didn't feel the romance/ love between them. Like I thought they made GREAT friends, but there wasn't a romantic spark between them. I wouldn't care because this wasn't a romance, but the consequence down the line was that when Tom ended up dying, the emotional element wasn't there for me. (I felt for the children though.) Even though, again, I know it wasn't a romance, I personally wish there was another was another scene between them, something that made me see their romantic connection (not even sex) just...I don't know...something. For the sake of character development. Heck, I felt more of a connection between Sandra when she was drinking in the kitchen with that guy than I did with her and Tom.
I guess what I'm saying is, I just wished they would have remained friends because the romance aspect felt forced.<br/><br/><ul><li>Same issues with her chemistry with Olivia. The little girl (Olivia's daughter) played a bigger role than the biological son did, and we're meant to believe that Sandra's loyalty to this girl is because she was ""so close"" with her mother. (think woman raising her best friend's child after she died kind of relationship.)</li></ul>But the both of them being pregnant and giving birth at the same time wasn't enough for me to believe they had enough of a connection for Sandra's character to finally name the girl and declare, ""After the sweetest woman I've ever known.""
Say what, now???? The dumbest woman maybe, because she let that guy in the house which led to her death and the other housemates. But I digress.<br/><br/>That said, there was a scene with the little girl in the river that made me tear up (I actually added another star because of it.) It was the scene where Sandra announced that one of them were going to have to open their eyes and look in order to tell her what direction to head in. Her little boy volunteered twice but each time she said, ""I will decide who it is."" And the little girl...man, she just knew. It broke my heart.<br/><br/>-I was also waiting for something super traumatic or intense to happen during the river scene or the forest scene after. Like my adrenaline was pumping and I was ready for the big showdown to freedom. But...there wasn't much of one.
I honestly thought she was going to have to gouge one the children's eyes out or even her own eyes out in the forest in order to save them, but alas. Nope. It was a fairly quick scene (just some voices) before they found safety at the blind school. (That part was brilliant.)<br/><br/>In short, It started off as a dystopian/apocalyptic thriller with some serious potential, but ended up becoming this strange, I guess....inspirational journey? That wasn't really all that inspirational.<br/><br/>If I had paid money to see this film in a theater, I would have felt ripped off."
"joey_k-74060","7","0","3","23 December 2018"," Beginning and Middle Parts are good but the ending, not so much....
","The story is quite gripping and not boring at all. I like how it jumps from different time point so you can get a good idea of how life progresses in the apocalyptic world.<br/><br/>And ironically not seeing the creatures makes it even more scary and engaging. I almost felt like the characters trying to deal with the terror of avoiding seeing them.<br/><br/>Only bad thing is the ending... how did that nurse somehow remember Malorie's full name after 5 years of chaos? Nurses deal with thousands of people and it's just way unrealistic to remember even their full names. Oh and how about how Malorie had been calling her kids Boy and Girl and then all of sudden decides, eh, forget it, now I'll give you names?<br/><br/>Plus I wonder, how did the blind people survive? Wouldn't the saviors have shot them up? I know that blind people can't see the creatures why wouldn't the saviors decide to the creature's bidding?<br/><br/>Overall great movie but not perfect and would've liked a more realistic ending."

","This movie has a start, mid plot and an ending. But there is not a hint or some kind of explanation what these black smoke entities, that destroyed the planet population, are. I paid the ticket, due to Mrs. Bullock. Her acting is good, as expected. Her co-leading character, with whom she relates (intimately), is one of the human race's last survivors. He could be female or male, white, yellow, black or chocolate colored. But as Hollywood movies are trying to impose frequently from 2000+, is a black male. Even more lucky Mrs. Bullock, the production chose him to be also a young, nice looking, sensitive and well-built individual, so the relationship between them, is an easy one. She really won the 1 to 7billion lottery there. The movie is nothing extraordinary. Has some action, some boring parts, some drama, some violence and some love. All comes in ""some"" quantity. You can give it a try, if you don't have something else to do or watch ."

It's been there, again and again - but never quite so stupidly.<br/><br/>That's not a slur on anyone acting in this film, including Bullock. They did their jobs amazingly. But the plot of having some kind of alien that just ""seeing"" it (or seeing the passing effects of it) drives a sapien to suicide is utterly bizarre and bereft of plot. Humans don't all view things in one idea. Even if you can pull a difference between the ""criminally insane"" and those who are nominally sane, that's too stark a difference to make a ""friendly/unfriendly"" idea over.<br/><br/>This movie is bizarre and makes no real sense. As a Bullock drama vehicle, it's fine. Considered on the merits of its plot, it is a real mess. Netflix fires a miss."
