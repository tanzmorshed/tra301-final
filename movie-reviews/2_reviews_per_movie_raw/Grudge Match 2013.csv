"vkupchan","7","140","172","25 December 2013"," WHY did they do it? I think I know why...
","Like so many other people my first thought after seeing the trailer was: ""WHY are they doing it? This will be pathetic!"". Our family still went to see this movie on the opening day - and me, my wife, and the kids aged 10 and 14 all had a lot of fun watching it. Yes, it had some cheesy lines and less than perfect moments but I would never call it pathetic. I liked it so much that I registered on IMDb to write my first review. The movie actually answers the ""why"" question - and somehow this answer is the best way to describe how the film makes you feel. Yes, De Niro and Stallone fully realize that they are way past their prime and will never make anything comparable to ""Raging Bull"" or original ""Rocky"". They just do not make the drama out of it, do not take themselves too seriously and do not see the roles that made them famous as some sacred ground that can't be touched. They just want to have some fun while they are alive - and may be help others have fun as well. Not a bad way to feel about getting older!"

","Sylvester Stallone must really love boxing. After returning to the Rocky films this past decade, he once again enters the ring in Grudge Match. But the smart thing here is that he's kind of poking fun at himself. Instead of trying to play a younger boxer which wouldn't be realistic anymore at his age, he plays a retired boxer who really is old this time around.<br/><br/>The story focuses on a rivalry between two boxers who fought each other a couple of times 30 years ago, winning one fight apiece. Naturally, that situation calls for a ""rubber match"" to decide the true winner. But it never happened. Hostility remains between the two guys 3 decades later though. Stallone plays Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and Robert De Niro plays Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen. When the two both arrive on set for a computer-simulated video game that will use their likenesses, they engage in a physical altercation which soon goes viral for all the world to see. This prompts a desire to see the two of them in the ring together once again.<br/><br/>Kevin Hart plays the loud-mouth promoter who puts the fight on. He plays the same type of character he always plays, but still very funny nonetheless. The same goes for a funny Alan Arkin as Stallone's trainer who also plays the same type of character that he always does. So there's nothing truly unique about the movie, but it doesn't take itself too seriously and that's kind of a good thing. It focuses on the funny for the most part, but also adds some depth to the characters when it shows the struggles they're having in their personal lives. That's part of the reason they agree to do the fight... along with a genuine grudge the two still have between each other after all these years. Some of the jokes can be lame at times, but there are some good zingers here and there when seeing the two old guys poke fun at each other. And the fight at the end of the film is done well and worth waiting for."

","I went in hoping that I would be at least mildly entertained. Wow, was I wrong. This movie is solid entertainment with a soul. Yes there are some solid principles to live by in this movie... and some to ignore. The acting was superb. I expected Stallone and DeNiro to be somewhat burnt out. But, they portrayed vivid characters. Stallone's motivation as a character was largely a mystery until about halfway into the movie. Definitely a mirror of life today. And, it had a decent ending that was digestible. I respected their life work before. But, this movie is likely to make you a fan... or at least of the story. I did not mention the other actors. But they are all stars in this worthy story, filled with laughs, mystery, and drama. What's not to like?"
"Ed-Shullivan","8","14","17","29 November 2014"," I demand a rematch! These fighters are worth seeing again!
","What a refreshing and unexpected (but nice) surprise Grudge Match was for the wife and I to sit down on a Saturday night, plop the Blu Ray disc in and for the next 2 hours, just enjoy a decent film minus any drugs, knife fights, or guns a blazing. When you have two major action stars such as Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone one might expect that the testosterone level on the big screen would get a bit heavy especially considering the movies theme is about two old and retired fighters who come out of retirement after 30 years to put the gloves back on and get back in to the ring to settle a very old score since both fighters won one of their two previous matches while in their prime back in the 1980's.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro plays Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen. Now Billy has a very big ego and since his boxing career ended prematurely 30 years ago he has done pretty good for himself owning his own car dealership and a successful bar called the Knockout. There is one scene in the film that I just grinned from ear to ear as Billy did a stand-up comedy routine in his bar with a puppet dressed as a prize fighter sitting in his corner as Billy bantered back and forth with the prize fighter dummy. The scene is less than a minute long but I give it full credit for the originality.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone plays Henry ""Razor"" Sharp. Now Razor was the guy who decided to hang up his gloves in the prime of his fighting career and we eventually find out why he retired. No spoiler alert, you will have to wait and hear it from Razor himself why he chose to retire from the ring. Razor's life has been kind of frozen in time these past 30 years, and he now works as a laborer in a factory, goes home to an empty house with no TV, cable or internet, and eats canned tuna and over ripened bananas to make ends meet. Razors life seems very depressing. Something is bothering him and the audience gets interested in finding out what makes Razor tick. I would have thought a boxing genre film would have been easier to figure out but the screenwriters did a good job in keeping the plot a bit deeper than most boxing films and we gradually grow to like Razor's character and think less of Billy the Kid's shallow and selfish personality.<br/><br/>There is also a good supporting cast of characters such as Kevin Hart who plays fight promoter Dante Slate Jr.. Dante's deceased father used to promote Razor's fights and Razors' memories of Dante Slate Sr. are not very good as he recalls being ripped off of his prize fight earnings. So Razor instantly is not prepared to go back in to the ring with Dante Slate Jr. holding the purse strings. Eventually Dante convinces Razor to put the gloves back on, but only for a fight simulation video for a software video company who agrees to pay him $15K. The movie is worth watching if for nothing else but seeing Stallone and De Niro dressed up in their head to toe lime green leotards game gear costumes so the techies can video their fight simulation. Did I say fight simulation? Well once Billy and Razor are within ring distance of each other the brouhaha goes viral on the internet and ""the fight is on man!"" We eventually get introduced to Kim Basinger's character Sally, who plays Razor's old love interest. Something happened to split Razor and Sally apart 30 years ago and we find out why Razor is a bit disenchanted with his life. When Razor eventually does agree to fight Billy for the grudge match of the decade he asks his old and trusted trainer Louis Lightning Conlon, played by veteran actor Alan Arkin. Louis is currently in a wheelchair and residing in an old age home, but Razor still wants his old and trusted friend Louis to get him back in to fighting shape. Razor is an honorable man and true friend as part of his income is used to pay for his friends nursing home costs. <br/><br/>There are a couple of scenes that remind us in a fun way of Stallone's Rocky films that just add to the films humorous theme. Billy on the other hand goes through a few trainers including LL Cool J who plays Frankie Brite, and Billy eventually settles on having his long lost son BJ played smartly by Jon Bernthal to train him.<br/><br/>Before you know it, we are witness to the fight of the decade in front of 18,000 fight fans split between who they want to win the fight. Most film goers always have their own prediction on who will win the main event. Will Razor win? Will Billy the Kid win? Or maybe it will be a draw? As I said no spoiler alert coming from me, so let's just say the ending is a good one. No, let me rephrase this..., I would say the ending is even better than I anticipated it would be. I Give Grudge match an 8 out of 10 ranking for the 10 rounds that Grudge Match went. Watch it and you will not be disappointed. It's a knockout hit."
"kramercosmo","9","66","96","23 December 2013"," A Great Christmas Movie - Excellent Cast And Lots Of Fun!
","I saw Grudge Match in an early screening and I (as most of the audience) had so much fun. This is a light hearted, nostalgic film with lots of great jokes and a fantastic cast. <br/><br/>Kevin Hart delivers, he fits just perfectly in his role. Alan Arkin steals the show in this one. He is so damn funny with his great one liners and his impressively cool acting. It is also great to see the beautiful Kim Basinger on the big screen again. De Niro and Stallone look 20 years younger than their real age when fighting in the ring, well choreographed fight scenes by the way. The physics of both Stallone and De Niro is just impressive. Most 30 year old would be more than happy to have a body like these two old-timers. There are some Rocky references in the film, and they are classy ones. <br/><br/>I find this to be the perfect film for the Christmas Days to have a great time at the movies. It certainly is not made to please the critics, it is made to entertain the audience and create a warm, nostalgic atmosphere. And without any doubt, the film delivers! Can't wait to see it with some friends on Christmas Day..."
"taylorkingston","8","5","5","1 May 2015"," A pretty good movie...
","I enjoy this movie. It's interesting. It's a bit different to what I thought it was going to be, but it was still a very enjoyable time.<br/><br/>This movie is about two former boxers who were rivals thirty years ago. Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen have been fighting ever since Razor retired because he slept with Billy's girlfriend and got her pregnant. Awkward. But now, thirty years later, a promoter wants them to fight each other in one of the most popular matches of all time. People would love to see them fight again, but Razor doesn't want to. But when Razor loses his job and finds out that he's broke, he has no choice but to play the game. Coming out of retirement for one final match, both our leads get ready to knock the other one out.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome."
"DonnieGReynolds","7","28","40","7 January 2014"," A well executed film, fun and touching. Haters got it wrong.
","I think people started hating this movie because people like hating.<br/><br/>I love the performances by all the leads in this film. I love the writing, the directing, and the editing. This is not a slap-dash, make-a-quick-buck film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is one short scene, almost an insert, for what appears to be nothing more than product placement. I suspect this was added by a producer simply for the product placement opportunity. It doesn't work, has a couple of laughs, but completely yanked me out of what was a well paced movie. It took several minutes to get back into the flow and made the ending come off cheesier than it would have if they had kept me in the story.<br/><br/>This movie will stand the test of time. <br/><br/>I don't know why everything has to be the BEST anymore. Why can't something just be good and entertaining?<br/><br/>This is not the best movie of the year, but it is a wonderful film with a heart. And it's FUNNY. There is a lot of variety in the humor-- some of it on the nose or slapsticky, some of it witty or even urbane.<br/><br/>I saw the morning show on a Monday. Lightly attended, but everyone was laughing and smiling as they left.<br/><br/>I hope there's a director's cut where that one short mistake scene is deleted (should have been saved for deleted scenes or over end credits).<br/><br/>That correction would likely not appease critics who had their complaints about Rocky and Raging Bull ready weeks before the release, but it would help.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic ensemble piece that is funny (very much in a Bridesmaids' kinda of way as weird as that sounds).<br/><br/>Don't let the haters keep you from a delightful film."
"Big_D_Box_Office_Score","7","43","67","18 December 2013"," A solid, better-than-expected comedy. Great for boxing fans.
","Grudge Match is the story of two well-aged retired boxers, who happen  to hate each other for varying reasons, who get talked into fighting  the rematch that was supposed to happen 30 years prior.   I don't think I'm alone in saying that there were some seriously low  expectations going into this one, but I must say, there are MANY  redeeming qualities about this movie that made it a great watch. The  first thing that stands out to me is probably the first thing on  everyone's mind - Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro combine to be  about 320 years old. Why do we want to watch them fight??? Well, the  movie is completely aware of your question, and answers you with this:  Because it's FUN. The movie never shies away from how old they are, and  plays on it for MANY fun moments. (On Stallone's end, they make more  than a couple indirect references to the Rocky movies, with great  effect.)   The next thing that stands out? SOLID ACTING. The cast as a whole could  have easily phoned this one in, relying on name-power so sell some  tickets, but everyone seemed to be all-in with their characters, and  give us scene after scene of good comedic interactions. Kevin Hart  gives us some great moments, Stallone and DeNiro shine when sharing  scenes, Alan Arkin is a pleasure to watch, Kim Basinger is still a fox,  and - I'm just going to put this out there - Jon Bernthal is a future  star, and he absolutely nails his role. (And the guest appearance of  the UFC's Chael Sonnen was some sweet icing on the cake...the camera  loves that guy...lol)  It's not all perfect - it runs a bit too long (nearly 2 hours), and it  does get pretty cheesy towards the end - but Grudge Match is a fun ride  overall. If you're a boxing fan, boxing-movie fan, comedy fan, or a fan  of anyone in this movie, don't miss it.  Grudge Match scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.  STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS!!! There's a couple of bonus scenes you'll  want to catch.  ...I've got the strangest craving for some butterscotch  jellybeans...lol"
"sharpobject2424","9","44","70","4 January 2014"," Great Flick - Deserves Better
","Grudge Match is an entirely satisfying popcorn flick that is good for just about any kind of movie-goer. The laughs are thoughtful, consistent, and sometimes enormous. There are some genuinely side-splitting moments here. And it's not just laughs; the story is sincere and emotionally driven, with excellent acting across the board to bolster it. There are essentially two story lines here in parallel to each other that occasionally intertwine so the plot stays interesting, granting the movie a little more to offer than your usual comedy. The movie had heart and if you let it, Grudge Match will win you over. I don't want to go too much into detail because I really encourage viewers to go in and check it out for themselves. Bring your low expectations if that's what you have because it certainly doesn't hurt. I just can''t believe this movie is doing so poorly in the box office, because it was in the very least a solid film with everything executed right. Go see it, and if you like it then see it again because Grudge Match deserves a much better reputation than it's getting."
"michalex_jackson","10","66","114","25 December 2013"," 67yrs old and still the best !
","Now I am biased in two ways while writing this review. First, Stallone is my favourite actor and second, I just saw the movie so I am still within the movie magic that's making me give it 10/10. However, I doubt the next 24hrs will change anything, Grudge Match is perfect!<br/><br/>Judge it by any standard or any angle you want, the comedy delivers, the plot is engaging and consistent, the actors are top-notch and believable in their roles and the score is spot on.<br/><br/>The trailer only gives you a third of what you can expect and take out from this film. The movie itself is such an enjoyable experience you will not see the time go by. While there is no suspense, at no point can you criticize the movie for being predictable. The story is so well done, it will carry you through the entire 113 minutes. <br/><br/>The very first 5mins did it for me. No non-sense, straight to the point and on your way to entertainment. Absolute jewel :D Stallone is 67 years old, and he is still the best."
"candelariahunter","9","30","52","6 January 2014"," A film that reminds us of Rocky, then makes a laugh about it.
","The movie is about Henry ""Sharp"" Razor (Sylvester Stallone) and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (Robert De Niro), two boxers who were arch enemies in their prime, then Razor announcement his retirement from boxing which makes McDonnen enrage. 30 years later, the thought of a rematch is asked by the son of the two's previous promoter's son Dante Slate, Jr. (Kevin Hart). McDonnen is all for it, but Razor is not due to his own personal reason (which is said in the film). At the end though the two boxers duke it out but both go home a winner. Personally I thought the movie was amazingly entertaining. Like I said before, it is basically a Rocky Balboa film, as I said as the movie was coming out,""It may have originally been Rocky 7."" However the film is a comedy and it has a good amount of laughs within it. If you are a fan of sports films, boxing fan, Kevin Hart, or Sylvester Stallone fan go watch the movie. My biggest grip with the film is the amount of language. I understand that these types of characters would speak this much, and the fact that the movie is PG-13, but there really is an amount of times you can say $H!% and getting annoying/ tired some. I don't know its probably a personal thing. Overall the movie is a great watch, and I will definitely add this to my Rocky collection (even though it isn't a Rocky movie)."
"camlee-37161","8","3","3","12 July 2019"," Good Movie
","Good movie overall, not too bad. Slow paced film with two great actors. Light comedy and humor; good for a late night movie"
"StevePulaski","8","3","3","22 April 2014"," A major-minor movie with some good majors but sometimes distracting minors
","When word first circulated that Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone, two acting legends, were signing on to do a film about two aging, rival boxers that would meet in the ring one last time, I vividly remember social networks and blogs dedicated to film buzzing about the plethora of opportunities that this pairing could entail. Pairing the actors who brought classic movie characters such as the Raging Bull and the Italian Stallion to life would both team up to do a film that would ostensibly tackle the issues of older boxers, legacy, and unsolved contention, while showcasing the talents of two superb leading men.<br/><br/>It's a little bit sad to note that the film we got, which could've easily merited Oscar nominations and worldwide acclaim, has turned into an only-moderately successful picture with some serious issues. Yes, I recommend ""Grudge Match"" and, yes, I find some of its commentary on the aforementioned issues rather stimulating and meaningful. However, the elements of a heavy-reliance on predictabilities, unnecessary and stereotypical supporting characters, and redundant jokes noticeably derail a project that undeniably has untold potential.<br/><br/>The film centers around two Pittsburgh boxers by the name of Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (Robert De Niro), who became rivals after they each beat one another in two separate rounds. A rematch was predicted, but Razor retired, which eventually lead to The Kid's downfall after assuming a directionless career and life once his main rival retired. Many years later, Razor works at a shipyard, while Kid is wasting away in addition. Out of the blue, Razor is approach by Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart), a promoter who wants to have Razor and Kid do voicework for a forthcoming boxing video game where both boxers will be playable characters. While on the set, geared up in motion capture suits and ready to imitate their respective video game characters, Razor and Kid see each other for the first time in years on the set and begin to lash out at each other, throwing whatever they can find at one another.<br/><br/>Turns out, one of the designers videotaped the fight, uploaded it to the internet and, as a result, the video went viral, became the main headline for sports shows, and has effectively created a resurgence of interest in Razor and Kid and their inconclusive rivalry. Slate decides to sponsor the rematch, to which the boxers accept, with Razor hiring the codgerly but motivational Louis ""Lightning"" Conlon (Alan Arkin) and Kid reaching out to his estranged biological son B.J. (Jon Bernthal) in order to train him, much to the dismay of Sally (Kim Basinger), the love that got in the way of both boxers.<br/><br/>Between Ron Howard's quickly-forgotten, underseen Rush, and now Grudge Match, it seems Hollywood is fascinated with the idea that two people can be rivals in a specific sport but still have respect for each other. Perhaps I'm a minority, but this never seemed to be a very unique idea. In fact, it would seem almost inferable. One has to have mutual respect for someone with a similar skillset and competence as them or else they wouldn't consider them a rival in the first place. Unlike Rush, Grudge Match doesn't seem to amuse and predicate itself off of the similar idea and instead makes the very smart move on treating its characters as humans.<br/><br/>Grudge Match still bears scuffs in its material. For one, the humor is much too repetitive, to the point where jokes that should be funny fall flat instantly because they seem to bear punchlines we've heard in different variations. Rather than relying on some sort of poetic, conversational flow, Segal and the writers instead focus on cheap-shots, like boxers that have been bolted so hard on their craniums they forgot any other form of wit besides sarcasm and obvious jabs at one another (no pun intended). We hear time and time again that Razor is a quitter, Kid is chubby, both are old and geriatric and should be drinking Ensure to assure they stay alive not Muscle Milk to assure they stay fit (see, I can do it too), Lightning is older than the dirt he sleeps in, and Slate is obnoxious, short, and overly-excited.<br/><br/>Give credit where credit is due in terms of Stallone and De Niro, who work damn hard at trying to make their characters work and connect on emotional levels. I'll be damned if by the end of the film, when the inevitable match roles around, I wasn't cheering for one over the other. The fight is riveting and often very exhilarating and that's thanks to the commitment of two actors who know their roles all too well and editor William Kerr, who beautifully captures some crushing blows.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's difficult to not be somewhat letdown by Grudge Match. Don't forget; Stallone stuck it through six, count 'em, six Rocky films and De Niro gained over twenty pounds to film the conclusion of Raging Bull. What's ironic is that Grudge Match manages to articulate where the actors are in their careers - plagued by what seems to be a lack of desire, interest, and ambition to do bigger and better things and are stuck in the shadow of whom they once were. The film is nicely put together, a thrill to watch at times, drab at others thanks to an onslaught of jokes that don't work because of their own ubiquity and overly-simplified supporting characters, but a moderately-successful package overall."
"Robert_duder","6","10","15","1 January 2014"," Some huge missed potential but still something for the fans
","Anyone who reads my reviews regularly will know that this is a biased review for me. I live and breath Stallone. I adore the guy, grew up with him as many of you did, and will pay through the teeth to see anything he does no matter how bad and I will desperately try to find the good in it. So its safe to say my expectations were extremely high because I was about to see my Hollywood hero on the big screen again and boxing nonetheless. On top of that Robert DeNiro is high up on my Hollywood heroes list and synonymous with boxing in his own right (though I hated Raging Bull..I appreciate it for its classic status.) The potential to do this movie right was huge. In the right hands they could have made this a cutting edge comedy/drama that was geared towards an older demographic and fill it with heart, and passion and fun. They achieve all this but on a much, much smaller scale. It has a little bit of comedy, satire, drama and is geared towards that older demographic and has a little heart, passion and a little fun. I would guess that our director probably didn't really put his full effort into this and let some of it fall flat which is truly unfortunate. On top of that you have easily one of the worst performances I have seen on the big screen in a very, very long time (more on that in a moment.) Still the movie is fun at times and tells a decent story.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is great in his role as Razor Sharp. He isn't Rocky so you can toss those comparisons out the window. He's a smart guy, artistic, passionate who hasn't moved with the times very well and was close to being on top but then spent the rest of his life working an assembly line in a factory. His performance is much better than what the script gives him to work with. I am glad to say he is one of the better parts of this movie. Same could be said for Robert Deniro. His role as the pompous, loud mouth Billy ""The Kid"" is perfect for him. Granted its sort of Deniro being Deniro but sometimes that is what's best and it works. The sub-story with him and his long lost son and grandson add a lot of the heart to the film. The thing that perhaps disappointed me the most was the lack of true chemistry between Deniro and Stallone. The entire film hinges on their comedic and passionate rivalry and that part of the film feels forced and often falls flat right up until the end. I worried immediately from the trailers that Kevin Hart would be obnoxious, annoying and distracting. Ding Ding Ding. Called that bout. He is all of that and more. His character doesn't fit this film even a little bit and he's incredibly annoying. Grudge Match is a very dry, satirical comedy not slapstick and Kevin Hart is just being himself and it doesn't work. There is a hint of fun chemistry between him and Stallone and also him and Arkin but they don't play on that enough to make it worthwhile. Alan Arkin (as many reviewers have pointed out) yet again plays a crotchety old man. However, his role is terrific and I loved it. He demonstrates a re-invigoration and he makes Stallone seem slightly younger than what he is. Arkin could have been amazing in the part with a better script but then most of them could have been. A better script would not have saved Kim Basinger. Being buried alive twenty feet deep couldn't have saved her from one of the worst performances on screen I've seen in years. She is wooden, campy, looks high, is so full of plastic she can't even move her face...she is just awful. I can't believe she didn't get nominated for Razzies when Stallone and Deniro did! Kim...let it go, pack it in, you're horrendous on camera. She took the entire cast down at least a peg or two. Jon Bernthal and Camden Gray are decent in their perspective roles as Deniro's son and grandson. Gray is a little bit campy (but adorable) and Bernthal does a solid job considering the character is underused.<br/><br/>I can't help but wonder how much better this would have been had Stallone did directing duties. If you wonder how much potential was lost on this movie just watch the last half hour. That is the best of the entire film with a well choreographed, uplifted and well done fight scene that wraps everything up in a great way. It was just amazing as a fan to see Stallone back in the ring probably for one last time (although if Creed happens then maybe not.) Director Peter Segal is a decent director but he is a through and through comedy director and this film needed someone who can handle comedy/drama/and an emotional story to really bring out the details. The script was sub-par there is no doubt about it and its unfortunate because they had a lot of ducks in a row but then they start throwing rocks into the mix. Still Stallone/Deniro/Rocky fans will find enough in this to be redeemable and enjoyable. I am certainly glad I saw it but for the average film goer you will likely find it nearly boring and certain bad scenes drag the film down significantly. I hate that Stallone's films aren't doing so well except for The Expendables because I don't want him to slow down one bit. 6/10"
"g-bodyl","9","4","5","27 January 2015"," Rocky Versus Jake LaMotta!
","After many years of wishful thinking, we finally get to see the ultimate showdown of Rocky versus Jake LaMotta....to a degree. Obviously, the characters in Grudge Match are not the same characters listed above, but they are played by the same actors, thirty plus years later. The film itself is actually a very good film....if you can take older men with no shirts. But the film is an excellent drama and is a lot funnier that I thought it would be. There were some great, though somewhat cheesy lines of dialog. I like how the film is not just about boxing, but about the characters. In fact, the actual boxing scenes are relegated to only like twenty minutes, if that. <br/><br/>Peter Segal's film is about two Pittsburgh boxers: Henry Sharp and Billy McDonnen who are the worst of boxing enemies. Sharp decides to retire early after being defeated by McDonnen. Thirty years later, fate comes a-calling when a promoter named Dante Slate Jr. offers each of them a good deal to bring one last fight to the table: to fight a grudge match.<br/><br/>I thought the film had fine acting. Robert De Niro is a very talented actor and it was nice to see him back in the ring, 33 years after Raging Bull. Sylvester Stallone managed to do a good job bringing back his inner Rocky. Kevin Hart added a funny presence as the promoter, Dante Jr. Alan Arkin added lots of humor, admittedly most about old-age, to his elegant performance. Kim Basinger was very good as Sly's former lover and Jon Bernthal as De Niro's long-lost son. <br/><br/>Overall, Grudge Match is actually a quite humorous and moving film that managed to stay entertaining. It doesn't reach the scale of Raging Bull and Rocky, but it's not meant to. That does not stop the film from making some excellent inside references to those classics. A very entertaining movie, though I could use an ending that was not so abrupt. I rate this film 9/10."
"Rat_27","9","13","23","19 April 2014"," A knockout of a non-boxing movie about boxers
","I found this movie outstanding. I do love Rocky and Raging Bull, but this was a movie about not letting go of things that hold you back. Like grudges. This is a movie about what is important in life, like family. This is a movie about what it means to win with honor, and to stand on your feet and be a man about it. <br/><br/>I think a lot of people were expecting this to be Raging Bull 2, or the next Rocky installment, but that's not what it's about at all. It uses those two characters to convey a different message that is important for all. I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>On top of it all, Kevin Hart provides a great amount of humor (because he is hilarious), and Stallone and DeNiro are veteran actors who are not past their prime at all. This movie is well-cast, well-acted, and original."
"coastdaze","10","13","23","29 December 2013"," You're still the same...GREAT!
","Refreshingly the same...two great actors doing what they do best and NOT apologizing for it. I LOVED this movie. It's got a good, fun storyline that is good for adults AND kids. It's got emotion and funny lines and moves along nicely. Note, it's not fantasy, beat 'em up sci-fi, good vs. evil, action heros, etc. (all of which I love, too). It is a nice movie about two guys who missed something years before due to basically a misunderstanding, a common type of misunderstanding that humans make.<br/><br/>Best of all I was able to see Stallone do a bit of acting, which, to me, is kinda rare. Yes, he is mostly his Rocky persona but with more substance. And Dinero...well, what can you say? This man has moved from strong drama to comedy to casual-type characters with ease. He can be menacing in one movie and really funny in another. I love these guys and their own acting abilities. And oh boy, seeing that beauty, Kim Basinger...she's good, too. I think early on her strong beauty may have kept her out of some roles. But now she can hang with the best of them, IMO. And she is still a beauty. Kevin Hart provides cute comic relief, too. He can be a bit over-the-top, but it works fine here.<br/><br/>Most surprising to me is Jon Bernthal. I remember this guy from the Walking Dead and I was glad when his character was killed off in that series! He's so good, I hated him! But what I see here is that he has a good bit of acting ability. He's believable (which is the main reason I hated him in Walking Dead!).<br/><br/>All-in-all, this is a good movie. Don't listen to the so-called pro critics. Gosh, I dislike how they pan some really good movies (like Depp's Lone Ranger, which was SO funny). What's up with them? I really miss Siskel and Ebert...they were most balanced, IMO."

","Barely a minute after he shows up on screen, silver screen legend Robert De Niro utters the immortal words: ""I didn't have a groin itch - I'm just a great actor!"" Whether you find that hilarious or tragic will probably determine your reaction to the well-intentioned but painfully mediocre Grudge Match.<br/><br/>The grudge of the film's title is the one that has lasted for decades between Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen (De Niro) and Henry 'Razor' Sharp (Sylvester Stallone). In their prime, the two men were the talk of the boxing world. Kid won their first match, Razor their second - but, before their final face-off, Razor quit boxing. Fast-forward thirty years: Kid remains a publicity-hungry Lothario, furious that he never got a chance to prove he was the better fighter; Razor works in a steel mill and is struggling to make ends meet. Neither can refuse when the opportunity to get back into the ring presents itself.<br/><br/>The draw of the film, of course, is to see Jake 'Raging Bull' LaMotta and Rocky Balboa duke it out in the ring. De Niro knows it, Stallone knows it, we know it. Both men gamely play off and send up the iconic characters they played decades ago, cheekily winking at - or desecrating, depending on your point of view - their respective cinematic legacies. Actually, it would all be somewhat thrilling if the script weren't so predictable and sluggish.<br/><br/>Like most of the comedies De Niro finds himself slumming in these days, Grudge Match has a few fun moments (standout: a mile-high publicity stunt) and a handful of good lines. It even gets better as it goes along, kind of - the two prickly protagonists arrive at an understanding that makes more emotional sense than you might expect.<br/><br/>But the film as a whole plods by, half ribald comedy, half brooding drama, and never presents either of its leads with moments that they're fully capable of making memorable. Instead, it gently embarrasses them, pressing home the point that they're not as young as they once were by flinging (bad) jokes about iPads, hearing aids and old-man boobs in their direction, while stuffing them into ungainly motion-capture suits.<br/><br/>To their credit, both De Niro and Stallone show up dutifully for work. They are, at least, worth the watch. De Niro takes the more broadly comedic part, and manfully tries to create a credible relationship with his new-found son B.J. (Jon Bernthal) and grandson Trey (Camden Grey). Stallone manages to dig up some grace notes in his scenes with 'Lightning' (Alan Arkin), his doddering old trainer, and Sally (Kim Basinger), the woman who stirred up even more trouble between Razor and Kid back in the day.<br/><br/>Even so, it's hard to watch Grudge Match without a lingering sense of disappointment. The material is nowhere near as good as the two lead actors deserve, and persists in undercutting them in ways that probably seemed funny on paper but are simply sad in the cinema. At one point in the film, a physical trainer yells at De Niro, ""A good performer knows when to get offstage!"", followed shortly by, ""Where's your sense of dignity?"" In a movie like this one, it's hard to take that moment in a purely fictional sense."

","Don't worry about spoiler alerts. The hack comedy writing in this movie is so predictable that a child would know the punchline before it hits. I can't believe I sat through this. <br/><br/>It's not like I expected this to be the best movie of all time, but you'd think it would have at least been a good time with half decent jokes that would elicit a few giggles. <br/><br/>Kevin Hart's lines were absolutely brutal and his character was more annoying than Chris Tucker sucking on helium balloons. Then you have Alan Arkin who is basically part of an ongoing ""I'm old and have a hearing aid"" bit for the entire movie. There was nothing funny or touching about this movie at all.<br/><br/>I give this 2 stars, 1 for me sitting there for the whole thing and the other for the Tyson/Holyfield bit before the credits."

","The movie was exactly what I expected, perhaps with the exception of Kim Basinger who looks smoking hot at an age when most women need hearing aids and false teeth. You have these two old boxers who have had a grudge for 30 years, since they had to fight each other, but the fight was canceled. The film is all about they getting over it via a box match. The fact that they did that after 30 years (time in which neither really had a life) makes it spicier, but basically, that's just the sprinkling on the cake.<br/><br/>I can't say that I got inspired by the movie or anything, but it felt more real than many of the genre, probably because of all the history of the characters making them deeper, meatier. Most movies of this kind use cardboard roles that mean nothing to anyone, like the obe played by Kevin Hart. Even Kim Basinger's role was a typical cliché, the woman that has always loved a man, waiting for him no matter how boneheaded he is.<br/><br/>Bottom line: aside the old actors, this was a typical sports match thing. They train, they say their piece, they fight. Also, except some marketing lines about iPads and some ""going viral"" lines, this could have just as well been a 70's movie. Robert de Niro was a strange casting for a boxer, but he finally played a role I liked him in since... forever. And Sly Stallone brings a lot more melancholy in this film than in any of the Expendables."

I don't like Kevin Hart too much but even he was awesome.<br/><br/>I love to see Stallone acting in good movies, because hey, he isn't a bad actor. I do not understand why he does like 5 terrible movies like Bullet to the head and then does one totally awesome performance and again goes back to the mindless 80's action sludge.<br/><br/>If you are a Stallone fan, boxing fan, DeNiro fan, or just love a heart warming story with senior citizens beating the crap out of each other, go see this one."

","I saw ""Grudge Match"", starring Sylvester Stallone-The Expendables movies, the Rocky movies; Robert De Niro-Last Vegas, Raging Bull; Kim Basinger-Cellular, Never Say Never Again; Kevin Hart-This is the End, Soul Plane and Alan Arkin-Argo, Freebie and the Bean.<br/><br/>This is a boxing fan's dream; Rocky Balboa vs Jake LaMotta, aka, The Raging Bull. Sylvester and Robert are basically playing their two iconic characters and show what might happen if they had a fight in their older years. They play boxers that had two matches against each other in the 1970's, each one winning a fight. The third tie-breaking match never happened for various reasons-which you do eventually discover. Kim plays a love interest that was involved with both of them, at one time, and had a child with one of them. Kevin plays the son of a boxing promoter that is now trying to coordinate the new match and Alan is Sylvester's old friend/trainer. There is comedy, with Kevin handling the majority of it, but there are also jabs at the Rocky and Raging Bull characters, especially in the training scenes. Also, at their advanced ages, each of the boxers have problems, anywhere from being blind in one eye to womanizing and having a drinking problem. For all of the UFC fans, there is a cameo of Chael Sonnen that is funny and there are a couple of scenes as the end credits start-nothing at the very end. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language, and sexual content-no actual nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. If you are a fan of any of the actors or boxing, you will probably enjoy this one. I did and I would buy this on Blu-Ray."

","This movie felt like it was written by a stand up comedian in his late 40s/early 50s who still does his material from the 80s and think his Viagra joke is the height of hilarity.<br/><br/>Going into ""Grudge Match,"" I knew the jokes were going to be excruciatingly predictable (yes, they do a ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" joke) and it was obvious that Kevin Hart was included just to get the younger people to the theater but I wasn't prepared how the film, almost like an Alzheimer's patient, suddenly forgets that it's a wacky sports comedy about two old dudes settling a rivalry and suddenly becomes a way too heavy drama about two old dudes who are foolishly ignoring the real priorities in their lives. While a drama element was as expected as the terrible jokes, the drama portion became way too serious that you forgot that just a minute ago they were doing jokes about Bobbie De Niro having moobs.<br/><br/>Bad, easy jokes in the film aside, I honestly think the film's cast did a tremendous job. Sly and Bobbie really have some chemistry on screen and really come off as two rivals who are out to get under each other's skin and beat them to a pulp in the ring (even though we, as an audience, acknowledge that, realistically, Stallone would destroy De Niro due to the fact that Sly is still in really good shape). I also really enjoyed the chemistry between De Niro and Jon Bernthal as De Niro's character's son. Bernthal is already a terrific actor but the two really played well together. Finally, Alan Arkin, as usual, is amazing and is able to take the weak jokes and the times when Kevin Hart is trying way too hard to be funny and is able to turn it around and be amusing—but he's just a wizard like that.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Grudge Match"" is a weak, unfunny film (with some frightening CG at the beginning of the filmthey couldn't hire younger actors to play young Sly and De Niro? They had to use nightmare inducing computer effects?) but the cast works their magic and perform great despite the circumstances.<br/><br/>Greetings, Earthlings! Do you feel like reading a more in-depth review of ""Grudge Match"" and some more rants, ramblings, bad jokes (but not ""Grudge Match"" bad), some geeky references and some more reviews that don't involve Sly Stallone restraining himself from killing Bobbie De Niro with one punch?

"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","6","8","15","28 December 2013"," Raging Rocky Bull
","There are probably more people curious about seeing ROCKY and RAGING BULL square off than witnessing a COP LAND reunion Either way, with Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta in the same movie, they might want something edgy, dramatic and uplifting. Well good luck with that.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone as Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and Robert De Niro as Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen are two retired boxers who had three No, actually two matches in the past Kid won the first, Razor the second and then, for mysterious reasons, Razor canceled the anticipated final bow at the last minute, making Kid hold a grudge till a new opportunity arises, many years later. <br/><br/>First let's get some ROCKY references out of the way: Razor is forced into drinking raw eggs by his elderly manager Lighting, played by Alan Arkin, a ""Mickey"" type character Also like the original Oscar-winning classic, Razor punches hanging beef in a meat locker He's fired from a menial job, buys new clothes, drives around in a hotrod and fumbles lines off ""dummy cards"" during a commercial shoot ala ROCKY 2 In the backstory, after the success as a fighter, he loses his money and returns to poverty like ROCKY 5 He trains in a grueling, hands-on fashion like ROCKY 4 (physically pulling a truck named Road Hawk c/o OVER THE TOP).... He takes part in a virtual reality ""What if"" bout lifted from ROCKY BALBOA...<br/><br/>And at one point later on, during the promotional circuit, he and Kid wind up at an Ultimate Fighting venue where Razor, comparing the popular sport to scripted Professional Wrestling, is threatened by a melodramatic blowhard brawler: reminiscent of Hulk Hogan in ROCKY 3 As for De Niro's Kid, he retired from boxing with a lucrative car lot but also runs a nightclub where he, like RAGING BULL himself, performs a laconic stand-up routine.<br/><br/>While not as good as it should be with the talent on board, GRUDGE MATCH isn't as god- awful as the maligned (and already Razzie nominated) reputation The lightweight banality sheds an endearing glow, and Kid has a few moving conversations with his estranged son, played by WALKING DEAD actor Jon Bernthal<br/><br/>Their scenes fare better than the contrived dialogue between Stallone and Arkin. Perhaps more tragic than De Niro and Stallone playing down to light comedy is that Arkin, no stranger to evoking genuine audience laughter, isn't funny at all. But he's not the comic relief...<br/><br/>In that department is Kevin Hart as the motormouth promoter keeping a reluctant Razor on board the upcoming payday, trying way too hard with an annoying Chris Tucker imitation. After a while his frantic intrusion tappers off, which leads to something even more ghastly, blunting the dynamic of Bernthal's character: One of the worst child actors in history, playing Kid's grandson, enters the show and never leaves. <br/><br/>Meanwhile our two rivals seem to be going through the motions. Their constant bickering is liken to GRUMPY OLD MEN sans the essential cantankerous anti-chemistry. Supposedly these guys hate each other yet seem pretty content, making us forget the entire purpose. But their combined scenes are merely sporadic: Much of the film involves dragging conversations with side-characters, ranging from trainers to the sole love interest played by Kim Basinger.<br/><br/>Will or won't Razor stay in the fight becomes the only suspense till the final match where two old dudes beat each other raw like that frozen hanging beef. Here's where we finally get some old school blood and gusto, but it's much to late to save a missed opportunity involving this rare superstar collective, intriguing and disappointing both cult and mainstream audiences."
"utgard14","5","3","4","23 August 2015"," Grumpy Old Men
","I'm honestly being kind with a score of 5. It's not a movie I can ever see myself watching again, that's for sure. The premise, which no doubt resulted in much back-patting for someone, is that two older actors who starred in classic boxing movies play two old boxers with a score to settle. It's one of those movies where the last moment anybody cared about putting any creative effort into this was when they came up with the concept. After that it was just a matter of phoning it in and collecting a paycheck.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Robert DeNiro and Sylvester Stallone is decent and results in a few amusing lines back and forth before the novelty of that wears off. Their appeal is what carries the film. If you're not a fan of either actor, you may as well skip this. The romantic chemistry between Stallone and Kim Basinger is nonexistent. Kevin Hart is funny for a second or two until you realize he's only bringing that same old tired shtick of his to the table - every other sentence is 'white this' or 'black that.' Yawn. The little kid playing DeNiro's grandson is annoyingly precocious so prepare yourself for that. On the plus side, Alan Arkin easily steals every scene he's in and Jon Bernthal is ideal casting as DeNiro's son.<br/><br/>The movie meanders a great deal and is pretty predictable throughout. Some emotional scenes in this don't register well because you will find yourself disliking so many of the characters. There are also some glaring plot holes such as how Sly's character was medically cleared to fight when he's blind in one eye. The movie even jokes early on about the old guys passing medical exams, but when an actual medical issue figures into the plot nothing is ever said about how he ever passed the physical exam in the first place! Also, how terrible was the use of CGI in this? The early scenes showing footage of the two men fighting in their prime was so fake it was disturbing. Then, with the Dancing with the Stars joke at the end, DeNiro's face was clearly CGI'd onto someone else's body. Just creepy. Anyway, it's not a good movie but it is watchable if you are a fan of the stars. It's never as much fun as you hope it will be but it has moments here and there."

","Grudge Match is a boxing film which includes a lot of entertainment. Razor (Stallone) hates The Kid (DeNiro) for over 30 years. When they meet again for helping a company creating a video game it is obvious that a Grudge Match is necessary for them to make things clear on who is the best. Things further complicate when Sally (Basinger) makes her appearance. Instead of trying to recalibrate Rocky series, this film offers us some original elements: the screenplay is good, making great use of humor and catchy dialogues while the cool music helps us to relax and enjoy the story. Stallone delivers a good performance and convinces us as Razor while DeNiro seems to enjoy his part as the Kid. As the story evolves we learn details of their rivalry and we have the chance to realize how things that seem to us important when we are young, later in life we have the chance to see them from another aspect. Also, what is important is that this film makes us realize that older people still want to have another chance in changing some things and really need the help of their beloved ones. Overall, this is a great boxing flick and a very interesting story."

And especially considering the initial (and natural) fears I had before watching those other ""stallone-rehashs"" Rocky Balboa (2006) and Rambo (2008) and finding them actually somewhat tolerable in their sadness/tiredness/cynicism, the overall awfulness of this turkey is even more amazing.<br/><br/>Well yes, OK, above mentioned were always meant to be ""more serious"" than this one, but of course with GM you get your excessive amount of ""drama"" and ""bitter relationships"" between laughs too.

Try EVERY character's EVERY reaction/remark in EVERY scene, worst examples being no-brainer: Kevin Hart, Alan Arkin, that grandkid.

","When I first heard of the concept for this film, I thought that the whole ""Rocky vs. Raging Bull"" angle was interesting. When I saw the trailer for it, I thought that it looked like a comedy with a healthy dose of heart. When I saw the movie itself...I realized it was an ""idea"" picture surrounded by filler.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Grudge Match"" tells the two of two rival boxers who each beat the other one time, setting up what was to be a hugely popular ""rubber match"". Before the fight could take place, however, Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) walked away from the sport, leaving Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (Robert De Niro) to stew over what could have been. Thirty years later, both fighters meet up again at a motion-capture exercise for a new video game coming out. They still have as much vitriol and hatred for each other as before, and thus the rivalry is rekindled. When the prospect of a huge $$$ purse is dangled before their eyes, they agree to step in the ring one final time to settle the score once and for all.<br/><br/>The trouble with this movie is two-fold:<br/><br/>First, Stallone has never achieved any comedic success (besides perhaps ""Avenging Angelo"", but that wasn't supposed to even BE a comedy)...period! When it comes to the comedy of this film, De Niro runs circles around Stallone. Since they both share about equal screen time, the Sly comedy scenes get a bit tough to stomach. Plus, as usual, Kevin Hart's brand of comedy is very much an acquired taste (one that this reviewer hasn't come around to).<br/><br/>Secondly, even the best of comedy movies have to contain some heart or ""meat"" behind them, and ""Grudge Match"" fails miserably in that department. The backstory involving Kim Basinger's character just isn't interesting enough to make you care about what should be the emotional punch of the movie.<br/><br/>Granted, there are some positives to this film (hence the 2 stars instead of just a single). Some jokes (especially for those intimately familiar with Stallone and De Niro's past works) are laugh- out-loud funny, while the end fight scene is probably the best part of the entire movie (where Stallone really gets to shine).<br/><br/>However, it is quite clear that the ""Rocky vs Raging Bull"" concept is what fueled this movie, and that just wasn't enough to carry a two-hour film. ""Grudge Match"" isn't terrible, but I have absolutely no desire to watch it again, either."

It a very fun movie in which we see Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro prepare to fight each other in a boxing ring, we get to see the emotion and stress they go through in order to get in shape. The character development is showcased tremendously, as we are given a feel for everyone's relationship with one another. However, I did feel there was far too many clichés that sometimes threw me off, you could tell what was going to happen to certain characters and how the plot was going to develop from a mile away, it does little to surprise its audience. The cast shines and, despite it being a comedy, they are all given strong roles that gave them very much to do, De Niro brings in class, Stallone has still got the macho attitude, Kim Basinger has vulnerability, Jon Bernthal adds to the tension, Alan Arkin adds to both the comedy, as well as drama, and Kevin Hart simply brings in huge laughs in all his scenes. Very enjoyable, albeit somewhat predictable, Grudge Match is worth the watch and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or sports film. <br/><br/>Two senior boxing champions decide to come back for one last fight. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Robert De Niro"

"alindsay-al","7","1","1","10 November 2014"," A good film that is not as bad as you have heard
","I originally really wanted to see Grudge Match but I just never got around to it and now I have heard that it was really bad, but it is in fact good. The film sees two ageing boxers who 30 years prior had a rivalry with score 1-1 and now they are looking to finish the rivalry. Now Stallone and De Niro were both good in the film with De Niro providing the comedy and Stallone the tough guy and the dynamic between the two worked well. The supporting cast is also really good with Kevin Hart being really good with him being hilarious throughout and adding allot of energy to the film. Alan Arkin also did a good job with his comedic timing adding a lot to the film. Jon Bernthal also did a good job with his chemistry with De Niro being good throughout the film and even though I think her character wasn't really necessary Kim Bassinger did a decent job. I do like sports and rivalries stories and when this film focuses on that the style is good, but there are too many unimportant side stories that should have been cut out of the film. The script is alright with some of the dialogue being great, however, there are some times where people talk over each other and also the end of the film is quite predictable. The style is good when once again it focuses on the rivalry but is quite generic otherwise. Overall this film is good and better then what you have heard."
"phubbs","7","1","1","15 October 2014"," Grudge Match
","Well well what's this? the long awaited sequel to 'Raging Bull'? the long awaited follow up in the Rocky franchise? or is it merely an excuse to have Rocky vs Jake LaMotta? Well it kinda felt like all of the above really.<br/><br/>The plot sees aging fighters Stallone (Razor) and DeNiro (The Kid) trying to recapture their youth and regain their old pugilistic skills via setting up a big lavish grudge match. Back in their early years they were both top of their game, the best of the best, but which was better? The only fights the pair ever lost in their careers were to each other, one beat the other and vice versa. Just before their old rematch Razor retired which angered Kid, now the game is back on.<br/><br/>What I find a little amusing about this is it actually does feel like Rocky Balboa vs LaMotta, both Stallone and DeNiro perform pretty much in the same way they did for both iconic movies. Stallone's character basically is Balboa for Pete's sake, he lives in a typical blue collar area, has a poor paying job in the shipyards and comes across as a soft centred soul. On the other hand DeNiro is a cocky loud mouthed edgy fighter who only wants to win any way he can. Both actors are playing these roles seriously I might add, this is not a silly dumb comedy, its a proper boxing movie.<br/><br/>The whole project is so old school and retro it really is, Kim Basinger and Alan Arkin both have leading roles alongside the OAP fighters which made me feel like this was another Expendables type setup. The plot is clichéd as hell and utilises every trick in the sports movie book, everything you saw in Rocky basically. At the same time there are some nice references to the lead stars earlier movies and some nice little moments to add a chuckle. Such as Stallone going into a meat locker and is about to slam into one carcass with his fists but is stopped by Arkin who points out they are there to buy meat not hit it. Yeah sure it sounds like a cheap modern day throw away visual gag reference to an older classic movie...and it totally is but it did make me smile a tad.<br/><br/>So yes there are plenty of obligatory family issues throughout for both fighters, gotta have those family issues to deal with. Its all so very predictable and painfully obvious what's gonna happen, DeNiro has his long abandoned son to win over...plus a new grandchild to get to know. Stallone loses his crappy job and has old flame Basinger crawling around him who also just happens to be DeNiro's old flame and mother of DeNiro's now grown up son whom he abandoned. Can you feel the pain and anguish surging through here?<br/><br/>Despite all the rather dull cheesy hokey drama the movie does end on a solid bit of boxing. Stallone still looks relatively impressive considering his age...DeNiro not quite as much but he does have that epic nasty look in his eye. Both men do look just as impressive in the ring as they did back in the day I must say, they both go at it hammer 'n' tongs and the movie doesn't shy away from the blood sweat and snot. I loved seeing all the old legendary grimaces and scowls from DeNiro during the fight, same can be said for Stallone with his more gormless facial expressions.<br/><br/>The film did poorly I have read but honesty I quite enjoyed this for what it was. Basically a purely nostalgic trip down memory lane or a leap back in time with your Delorean. Its pretty much our last chance to see these guys do what they did all those years ago, what made them famous (for Stallone at least). A simple sports flick with a happy ending and lots of retro appeal for guys and girls around my age and up. I really fail to see how any fan of both stars (or any movie fan) could not enjoy this, the films poster says it all and its a corker of a poster too.<br/><br/>7/10"

The jokes, well the ones you haven't already seen in the trailer, aren't funny which was surprising for a story line that was so absurd. They could have done a lot more funny self-deprecating jokes. <br/><br/>The story was very simple, I mean there we zero surprises in the story.<br/><br/>The characters were empty, by the time the fight came you really didn't care about them, or the fight. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie was the Tyson & Holyfield cameo at the end. Which was 10 seconds long. I was happy when this movie was over.<br/><br/>Very disappointing. If this didn't have Stallone and De Niro I think it would have gone straight to video."

"thomas-w15","3","3","6","23 January 2015"," Sometimes it's so unfunny that it is sad
","Grudge Match 2.5/10- I came into this movie with much higher expectations than Sylvester Stallone's other recent movies. I thought it could be good simply because I think that Stallone can only act well when he is boxing and he has in my opinion one of the best and most versatile actors ever-Robert De Niro. I believed that with the two together, the movie would be at least passable, and that is what it is, passable. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie was awful. They did not really mention boxing that much other than the fight between Henry ""Razor"" Sharp, who is played by Stallone, and Billy ""The Kid"" Mcdonnen, played by De Niro, that took place thirty years earlier in the first half. The jokes were off the mark and surprisingly Kevin Hart was not that funny. I was just really hoping that the second half would be better. Thankfully it was slightly better. The boxing scenes and training were at least entertaining enough to enjoy. Basically the second half of Grudge Match gets the audience to remember how great Rocky and Raging Bull. The thing that irritated me throughout the film was it seemed like the movie relied on the two actors previous roles in Rocky and Raging Bull to sell tickets. Someone should have told the director that it is nearly 35 years later since Stallone and De Niro's boxing movies and therefore they cannot be the same characters with just different names. The acting was not good to say the least. I think everyone could tell De Niro was not very interested in this movie because it was evident that he did not give his best effort. Sylvester Stallone is really just not that good of an actor and the studio knew that so they kept making references and quotes from Rocky to make him at least decent in his role. Too bad in did not work because I really enjoyed the most recent Rocky Rocky Balboa in which Stallone gave a great performance. Really the best part in this movie was Alan Arkin. But saying Alan Arkin gave the best performance in this movie is like saying he was the best looking person at an ugly convention, its just not saying much. Still, he was without a doubt the funniest person. <br/><br/>The thing that was probably the worst about this movie was the plot. There are things that do not fit in the plot. I do not want to ruin the movie for you if for some reason you decide to see this but there are certain common points that sports movies tend to follow and Grudge Match is no exception, but there is no build up to these almost essential plot points. The movie is cliché to say the least, and I have no problem with that, but if they decide to make the movie with Robert De Niro beginning to change so he can have a better relationship with his son, he will not just out of the blue decide to ruin that. This is just an example, there are plenty more. <br/><br/>This movie is terrible at the beginning but it does start to find itself toward the end, but unfortunately there is just too much bad directing, screen writing, and poor acting to really make this movie worthwhile. I do not recommend you wait till this movie comes out on DVD. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

Oddly enough, DeNiro was better suited in this film then Stallone was and Stallone just makes the movie more depressing then what it should have been, I'm not sure there's a comedic bone in Stallone's body.<br/><br/>It's not really a comedy, tho what comedic value the movie did bring to the table, saved it from being an utter fail."
"poe426","2","5","13","12 May 2014"," For xboxrz only...
","Professional boxing, it seems, has always been on the ropes in one way or another (lawmakers have been trying to outlaw the sport for hundreds of years). As Drama, boxing's about as pure as it gets. Consider Shinya Tsukamoto's powerful TOKYO FIST, for instance, or Rod Serling's REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT (either version); or John Huston's FAT CITY; Robert Wise's THE SET-UP; THE HARDER THEY FALL, with Humphrey Bogart; THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, with James Earl Jones; Russell Crowe in Cinderella MAN... There are others; there will be more. Unfortunately, GRUDGE MATCH is exactly what boxing DOESN'T need: another prefab fight film with more flab than jab. (A larger than life statue of Stallone was erected in Philadelphia in honor of the ROCKY movie franchise. No such statue honoring the late Joe Frazier- the Real Life Heavyweight Champion of the World, who fought out of Philly- was ever erected. In yet another bit of irony, Stallone's character in GRUDGE MATCH reveals that he's blind in his left eye- a medical condition that Frazier himself had but kept under wraps throughout his entire career.) Far more realistic than a pay-per-view bout would've been a charity exhibition between the two old timers. (A recent look at the Maidana-Payweather travesty- in which Maidana won nine rounds out of twelve, yet somehow managed to lose the decision!- is indicative of just how little most of the folks feeding us ""boxing"" really know about the sport. One of the know-nothing commentators actually suggested as a strategy that Maidana ""jab to the body."" While jabbing to the body might set up something ELSE- a follow-up body shot with the right or a hook off the jab to the body or a right over the top-, jabbing to the body alone makes no sense. In the end, it didn't really matter: Maidana LOST points for hitting his opponent, while Payweather was GIVEN points for each blow he took- and he took a LOT of them. Look at the laughable ""punch stats,"" which were CLEARLY in error. Home Box Orifice was bad enough, but now ShoTime's rigging decisions for its in-house fighters. Maidana summed it up nicely when asked if he wanted a rematch. ""Since I won the fight,"" he said, ""I'm willing to give the challenger a rematch."" On the other hand, when he started to hold up a cookie he was eating, the ShoTime toady with the mic snatched it out of his hand with a remonstration: ""Huh-uh""- meaning NO- while every single inch of the ring and the cornermen's clothes were adorned with corporate logos.) Stallone, more than any other actor, has cashed in BIG TIME thanks to boxing- but he's given little back. Why not start a Sports Channel with BOXING at its core (something we haven't seen since the early days of ESPN); someone with Stallone's pull could get it done. (James ""Bonecrusher"" Smith is trying to get a Boxing Hall of Fame opened in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Stallone could throw in with Smith...)"
"jimbo-53-186511","4","2","4","27 June 2014"," An embarrassment for both De Niro and Stallone with only a moderately humorous tone running through the film saving it somewhat
","This is probably one of the easiest films to sell to the public. We have raging Robert De Niro as Billy the Kid McDonnen and the Italian Stallion Stallone as Henry Razor Sharp. The film begins in the early 80's and shows a couple of matches between the 2 protagonists. However, when both men are in their prime, Henry Razor Sharp calls time on their final match and retires. 30 years down the line, both men are talked into having that big 'grudge' match again with the guidance of self proclaimed boxing promoter Dante Slate Jnr (Kevin Hart). Both men then begin training for the big match.<br/><br/>The first thing that ran through my head after the first 5-10 minutes was ""surely this is a joke"". I really found it hard to take this film seriously for the following reasons;<br/><br/>OK; let's start with De Niro, is it just me or was he basically a watered down Jake La Motta (the same character he displayed in Raging Bull). Admittedly, he was nowhere near as violent or self destructive, but he is arrogant and goes through the same motions as La Motta (albeit in reverse). I had the same problem with De Niro in this film as I did with his character in Raging Bull - he was a horribly unlikeable person. The difference with that film is that it was intended as a careful character study (even though I wasn't a big fan of Raging Bull I could fully appreciate the effect it was trying to achieve - it was technically brilliant where the only problem with it was an unlikeable central character). Then we come to Stallone, he basically is Rocky Balboa all over again - likable, humble and generally down to earth - this might be OK for the undemanding viewer, but I just thought that it was really lazy to cast De Niro and Stallone as characters that they've played before. If it was intended as a parody then that would be fine, but I feel that this was meant to be a serious boxing drama (even with the humorous theme that is running through the film).<br/><br/>There were other problems with the film such as the casting of Kevin Hart. WTF? Was his only purpose in this film to do his best impression of Chris Tucker? If that's the case, then he succeeds as a 'poor man's version' - although haters of Tucker will probably appreciate his performances more following Hart's weak rendition. Basinger's stars in a supporting role as a 'love interest' that causes added animosity between De Niro and Stallone (I won't say anymore for fear of revealing spoilers). Suffice it to say, her character was uninteresting and had very little impact on the film. <br/><br/>Grudge Match was a disappointing film which basically felt like a pastiche of better films that we've seen from both De Niro and Stallone (namely Raging Bull and all the Rocky films except Rocky V). It was humorous, but it lacked a solid emotional core. The final boxing match was also plagiarised from better boxing films and again felt boring and anti- climatic. I honestly couldn't recommend this film and would suggest watching Raging Bull or any of the early Rocky films instead. At least that way, you'll be seeing both actors at the top of their game and won't have to witness both De Niro and Stallone embarrassing themselves in this mess."
"GTeixeira","4","2","4","28 March 2014"," It came a few decades too late
","Sylvester Stallone is better remembered for playing Rocky Balboa, the underdog boxer from the Oscar-winning 'Rocky' and its subsequent franchise. Robert De Niro, among an outstanding career of many memorable characters, might be remembered firstly for his Oscar-winning performance as Jake LaMotta, a real-life boxer. Both characters and performances are noteworthy and quite consistent with real boxing.<br/><br/>'Grudge Match' pretty much screams the question of which was best, Rocky Balboa or Jake LaMotta, by means of pitting their actors one against the other in another boxing film.<br/><br/>The problem with this is the same that other recent Stallone films have had. It came too late. Like with Schwarzenegger in 'Escape Plan', or the other old action stars in the 'The Expendables' franchise, Stallone pits himself against another heavyweight old-timer far past the time where such pairing would truly have their impact (AKA the 80's and possibly early 90's).<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the whole story is just an enormous walking cliché; it feels like another entry on the 'Rocky' franchise. It is not just the confrontation that is outdated, but the entire plot; their rivalry, the underdog storyline Stallone often has on his films, a father/son redemption storyline, the emotional final fight and 'tense' 'who was the winner?' finale... It has been done so many times, it is tediously predictable.<br/><br/>The cast is quite good, though. Stallone does play a sluggish boxer well, which is pretty much why Rocky has kept going. Meanwhile, De Niro plays the same arrogant type he did with LaMotta; he is nowhere nearly as good as he was on that film, but he is still very good to watch. Alan Arkin is another really good one, playing the kind of cynical character he is often at best with; the actors playing De Niro's son and grandson are also quite good.<br/><br/>Kim Basinger is uneventful, another point in which the film seems to have come from the 80's (where I guess she was a big thing). I didn't like Kevin Hart at all either. Being labeled as a rising comedian star, I actually thought for a moment during his first scene that it was Chris Rock: unfunny, with an irritating voice and mannerisms and hopelessly bad acting. But then, considering many of modern comedians like Jack Black, Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell, he might get far. <br/><br/>Despite this all, I can't really be too hard on this flick. It is not meant to be serious, just a silly comedy with a interesting (at first glance) premise. It manages to be interesting at times, a lot thanks to its very good main cast, and the actual boxing scenes are good enough (plus seeing Chael Sonnen being knocked out was priceless); yet, even then, it is not a great comedy either and no moment where I can say I truly laughed out loud.<br/><br/>Then again, considering its director and writers, 'Grudge Match' is not half-bad. Just keep low expectations, and you might even enjoy it."

And for that reason I think The Kid should have won the fight. Throughout the movie Billy is presented as a self-centered who's trying to be a better person. This movie is about him redeeming himself and it would have been a perfect redemption story for him if he had beaten Razor, who had nothing to lose or to gain other than respect from The Kid. Billy however, could have gained respect from not only Razor, but also from his critics, and his estranged family. Again, I do think this is a good movie with a good story but the end is what stops it from being a good movie with a great story."

Now, in Grudge Match, they play two old boxers stepping back into the ring for one more fight.<br/><br/>Although this movie is set in Pittsburgh - Kim Basinger hilariously mispronounces CONSOL several times, which I know for a fact they hate - it was really filmed in New Orleans.<br/><br/>As a Yinzer, I find this incredibly upsetting. There are so many errors, like how there are signs for Pepsi Max in CONSOL, which is untrue. The now PPG Paints Arena only sells RC Cola. During the national anthem scene at a monster truck rally, a Winn Dixie sign shows up. There are none in this area. And in Pennsylvania, car dealerships can't be open on Sunday. Come on, Hollywood, red up your films and stop being such jagz n'at.<br/><br/>Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Stallone) and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (De Niro) were both famous boxers from Pittsburgh who have one loss on each of their records - courtesy of one another. Before the rubber match, Razor retires with no explanation, costing Kid a huge pay day.<br/><br/>Decades later, Razor is struggling to make ends meet and working on a shipyard. Promoter Dante Slate, Jr. (Kevin Hart), wants Razor to provide the motion capture for a boxing game, but Razor won't trust the man, as it was his Slate's father's bad investments that left the aging boxer destitute.<br/><br/>However, Kid is now a successful car dealership and bar owner who says yes right away. Razor only agrees because the $15,000 payday will cover the overdue health bills for his trainer, Lightning Conlon (Alan Arkin).<br/><br/>While clad in greenscreen suits and mocap balls, the two boxers get into a huge brawl, ruining a studio and going viral when the video is posted. Slate decides to promote a final match between the two, called Grudgement Day, presented by Geritol.<br/><br/>At the press conference, Razor sees his ex-girlfriend Sally Rose (Basinger), who cheated on him with Kid and gave birth to a son named B.J. (The Punisher himself, Jon Bernthal) before getting married to someone else.<br/><br/>Kid's trainer Frankie Brite (LL Cool J) is barely helping him, so he connects with B.J., who is a coach at Pitt, and gets in shape. As for Razor, he's blind on one eye and everyone wants him to call it all off. However, he needs this one last fight, as Kid took everything he loved away from him - boxing and Sally.<br/><br/>There's a great moment here where a montage recreates many of the Rocky training scenes, including Stallone dragging a truck that has the name Road Hawk on it, which is a nod to his role as Lincoln Hawk in Over the Top. And hey - it's Rich Little as an announcer!<br/><br/>The big battle is actually pretty great. It's shot well and is particularly brutal at the end, given that this is a comedy. It's actually pretty much a feel good picture, something we rarely feature on our site, so enjoy it while you can. People will be getting devoured and stabbed again soon enough.<br/><br/>Grudge Match was directed by Peter Segal, who was also behind the camera for Second Act, Get Smart, Tommy Boy, 50 First Dates and The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.

","I don't think this was meant to be anything more than a send-up of the""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"" films, with Stallone and De Niro in their senior citizen alter-egos of 'Razor' Sharp and 'Kid' McDonnen. It is a bit painful to see both men in their boxing trunks, though at sixty seven when the film was made, Stallone cuts more an impressive figure than De Niro at seventy. But hey, as a senior citizen myself, it's cool to see these two celebrity icons get it on for Grudgement Day, even if it was three decades after their prime.<br/><br/>Actually. the guy who stood out here for me was Kevin Hart trying to put together the match between the two aging pugilists. He's got most of the humorous lines in the story, closely followed by Stallone and Alan Arkin in his role as Razor's trainer of record. All of the principal characters trade gags about growing old and out of shape, and if you put your political correctness aside, they are kind of funny. Nice too, to see Kim Basinger growing older gracefully; her real life daughter portraying the young Sally Rose was a nice touch.<br/><br/>One might disagree, but what I thought would have concluded the story more appropriately would have been to call the bout a draw instead of a split decision win for Razor. Not that I'm looking for a sequel rematch, but it would have left both boxers saving face after a long standing feud spanning thirty years. Stick around for a handful of tacked on scenes as the credits roll, the best of which is Kevin Hart's character angling for a rematch between Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson. Compared to Stallone and De Niro, they still look like monsters."

Stallone does his Rocky, and DiNero does his LaMotta; nobody watching will remember the name of either's character from this film three days from when they see it. I will just remember Rocky and Lamotta, or Stallone and DiNero. The film was better than I had hoped. It could have been terrible six different ways, but the writer and director kept the decent storyline in tact. Stallone was still Rocky with another name, and DiNero was still Lamotta with another name. In a real fight, I believe Stallone would rock DiNero in just a few minutes."

","Grudge match started out strong with low ball guy humor. De Niro's character is a funny big mouth. Lines like ""I'm healthy I take all my shots! Jack Daniel etc"" are hilarious. Again,Stallone plays the quiet character with a past. Stallone is pushed into the fight, after making a video game and De Niro shows up early. The confrontation gets the boxing event rolling. The second half of the film is too much. Like an old joke or a big mouth who is funny at first, Grudge match get old very fast. Robert De Niro's character Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen is an major idiot, jerk etc that you cannot help but hate. You just know McDonnen is going to screw up. For anyone who has been disappointed or annoyed in life will just hate McDonnen. The viewer does not find McDonnen funny or even tragic likable, but sad in a pathetic way.

","I had heard mostly negative things about this movie, so I went into it with fairly low expectations and ended up enjoying the movie. I had a similar experience with another 2013 film of De Niro's, ""The Family"".<br/><br/>The movie's concept pretty much sells itself, it's Rocky vs. Raging Bull, the stars of the biggest boxing movies ever come together in a comedy about two rival boxers having one more fight thirty years past their prime. Stallone and De Niro are both pretty funny, and Kevin Hart and Alan Arkin are good in their supporting roles. Kim Basinger is just kind of there, her character has her place in the story but isn't particularly funny or memorable.<br/><br/>This isn't the kind of movie that keeps you on your toes or anything like that, it's a bit generic and the appeal of it is the novelty of seeing Stallone and De Niro together in a boxing movie, but it's still amusing and I'm not really sure what you can point to in it that makes it awful. De Niro has been criticized a fair amount over the past decade, with people saying that he's tarnishing his career with the movies he's been making recently. While I do think some of his movies have been quite awful (Little Fockers, for example), I highly doubt he'll ever tarnish his career. I've never met anyone who thinks of New Years Eve before Taxi Driver when thinking of De Niro, so I say let him do what he wants with his movies.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie.

Many LOL funny lines throughout helped by toe-tapping music in the beginning and an excellent supporting cast of Kevin Hart as Dante Slate: fight promoter, Alan Arkin as Lightning Conlon: Sharp's trainer, and Kim Basinger as Sally: the love interest. And, it is here that De Niro shines with comedic lines and Stallone had his share as well as did Kevin Hart who kept everything upbeat. Quite funny at times. Kudos.<br/><br/>And, a shout-out should go to screen writers: Tim Kelleher and Rodney Rothman as both combined to do funny stuff. <br/><br/>There are some bumps in the road, too, and we get sub plots that almost stop the fight from happening, but the fight does go on.

","I'm a huge fan of Rocky I-IV, but I'm ashamed to say that I've never seen ""Raging Bull."" The trailers for this movie didn't look great, but it looked interesting enough to warrant a rental from Redbox. How could you go wrong with Stallone and DiNero returning to boxing? Long story short, this movie wasn't bad, but it doesn't channel too much of the awesomeness that ""Rocky"" or I assume ""Raging Bull"" had.<br/><br/>1.) The script is pretty bland. None of the dialog in this movie will involuntarily cause your diaphragm to contract. Most of the laughs in this movie came from people getting punched and the video game sequences. Those were pretty funny.<br/><br/>2.) The script was pretty terrible, but it was nice to see Stallone don a pair of boxing gloves again. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think Kevin Hart is funny...He's loud, high pitched, and obnoxious. Maybe that's some people's idea of humor, but it's just annoying to me. Overall, the actors did the best with what they had to work with.<br/><br/>3.) Every time ""Razor"" and ""Kid"" met up there never seemed to be any REAL tension. It was just...""Hey, I'm really gonna kick your @$$..."" and stuff like that. I never felt any actual tension which could have made it funnier.<br/><br/>4.) Is it just me or was the product and brand placement out of control in this movie? I know boxing is heavily advertised, but almost every scene had some sort of product in it. If it wasn't Target, it was McDonald's or Budweiser. I just think that's bad form. Oh well.<br/><br/>5.) I don't want to completely rip this movie. The boxing scenes were good and it was nice to see that both actors can still get into shape at their ages.<br/><br/>I don't think this movie is good enough for me to watch again, but it wasn't bad enough that I regret watching it.

Stallone is the one who left his ring career behind, lost his fortune and works hard for a living and feels the financial incentive is the only reason for this sideshow.<br/><br/>De Niro who has a bar and is financially comfortable is motivated by revenge and still bitter. His character even hit it with Stallone's girlfriend years earlier (Kim Basinger) and made her pregnant and is all for the rematch to prove a point.<br/><br/>We are then left with these old has been getting ready for the fight. Stallone ropes in his old trainer (Alan Arkin) whereas De Niro needs to convince LL Cool J to give him some training and finally ends up with his new found son he had with Basinger training him.<br/><br/>As they near the fight De Niro gets too spend time with his son and grandson and bonds with them both whilst Basinger and Stallone also rekindle their relationship. At the same time their promoter Kevin Hart does a good job in reviving media interest in this grudge match as the fight moves to a bigger arena.<br/><br/>The film is actually more likable that I thought it would be as both actors take to the script in the right spirit. Not too seriously and not too lightly. Its still a rehash with Stallone dealing with similar themes of an old boxer stepping into the limelight a few years ago in Rocky Balboa, so it just looks too familiar. Even Arkin's curmudgeon is not that far removed from his Oscar winning role in Little Miss Sunshine."

And no need to praise Sylvester Stallone when it come to a movie based on boxing.<br/><br/>The trailer was different that what I saw today in the movie. It totally misled me, I thought the movie was about computer game where two ex champions meet, but it went way beyond to the final battle. My eye was on De Niro, his entry in unfamiliar arena, the boxing. For Stallone it is like the return of Rocky Balboa.<br/><br/>A little bit of fun and a little bit of drama. The story commenced with the early life of two rivalry boxers and moves all the way to the next 30 years. The uncomfortably settled life forces them to come together one final time and the rest of the story brief these legend's preparation for the grudge match.

When he loses his job and learns he's broke, he has no other choice but to fight.....<br/><br/>Its strange that Stallone has taken the lowest ebb in his career, and melded the two together. Stallone's plight in this, mirrors Rocky V's narrative, and then the element of comedy, to his proper fans of a certain age, Oscar and Stop! Or My Mom will Shoot, do not seem that long ago.<br/><br/>So I went in with great caution. And while Stallone will never suit comedy (one liners in action movies don't count) De Niro makes the whole thing worth watching, and it's always good to see Stallone in the ring once more.<br/><br/>Its a simple story, again, the video game part that inspires the titular fight is ripped straight from Rocky Balboa, but its exactly what you'd expect.<br/><br/>Age is a huge factor in this, and weight problems and other ageing problems are the butt of the majority of the jokes. The stars get into promotional problems, which usually ends up with them fighting each other or someone else.<br/><br/>So it's not original by any means, Basinger is wasted in this, Hart grates every time he speaks, channelling every annoying stand up comedian who thought shouting would raise more laughs.<br/><br/>Arkin is predictably the best thing as the 'Micky' type trainer, but, their is a decent twist in the movie, and the CGI at the beginning is pretty good.<br/><br/>If you flinched at the idea of this film you probably won't like it, but if you yearned for Rocky Vs.

","You can see the headlines now – Rocky vs The Raging Bull, Stallone vs De Niro a match made in box office heaven right? Too bad it's not the 1980's and rightfully this film fell harder than Stallone's comedic timing. Director Peter Segal's (who has shown some nice comedy touches in his directing career) comedy/drama is about 30 years too late to the party for in 2013/14 we find ourselves in an era where these 2 once great movie stalwarts struggle film to film to remain relevant and much of the charm they once both possessed in equal yet different measures is a mere flame where it once burnt brightly.<br/><br/>Surprisingly the idea of two way too old for boxing geriatrics going at it for one last bout is not as unbelievable as you'd think it to be but the two aging stars just don't have the fight within they used to have. Rocky has become a more lifeless and un-enthusiastic bore while Jake La Motta is nothing more than a smug arrogant smirker who tells all manner of jokes that are just not funny. Stallone has always failed in the comedy arena (Stop or my Mum Will Shoot!) so it's no surprise that his delivery here falls largely flat but De Niro is an actor who has often excelled at comedic timing and punch lines so his failings here can only be put down to a lack of effort or a desire to get his pay check and run. You often get the feeling moments within the film are about to ignite sparks between the two (an impromptu sky dive, a doctor's visit) but sadly their encounters lack the ""punch"" needed to garner chuckles or affection which is left to the supports to do.<br/><br/>In Stallone's corner we have character actor master Alan Arkin as the rude and crude aged trainer Lightning and in De Niro's corner we have one of America's most popular stand-up comedians Kevin Hart as promoter Dante Slate Jr who uses the Eddie Murphy playbook of comedy eg; fast, loud and obnoxious. These supporting players play an important part in the film remaining tolerable and have some quite enjoyable scenes together bickering while other supports in the form of The Walking Dead's Jon Bernthal and the increasingly unrecognizable (talk about plastic surgery) Kim Basinger are there to keep things grounded.<br/><br/>With such potential for two once great movie stars to be united in the common goal of bringing the laughs and the self-depreciating gags (there is a nice moment with Stallone and a cold storage facility though) it's a shame that Grudge Match produced a pretty tame and lame script with two instantly unlikeable main characters. This movie is very far from the knock out it could have been and instead is like a 15 round bout of endurance saved by some fun supports and the guilty pleasure of seeing Rocky and The Raging Bull belt each other silly.<br/><br/>2 green lycra suits out of 5 <br/><br/>P.S – be sure to watch through the credits for what is arguably the films best gag."

Now both have fallen on hard times, and an unscrupulous promoter (Kevin Hart) spots the potential in giving them both a re-match, but will tensions outside the ring throw a spanner in the works?<br/><br/>Sometimes, nothing can sell a movie better than a gimmick. Despite sharing many iconic screen performances between them, DeNiro and Stallone probably still hold most of the affection between them decades on for their respective portrayals of boxers Jake LaMotta and Rocky Balboa, and although the idea would have seemed crazy at the time, now they're both pushing on a bit, what better way to remind a new generation of cinema goers of their boxing legends than to make a new film playing boxers sending up the whole shebang? Sadly, despite the interesting novelty value, Grudge Match emerges as just another soggy, instantly forgettable DeNiro comedy.<br/><br/>The man's never seemed able to accept the fact his speciality is playing serious, intense, dramatic roles, and comedy is just not something he possesses a natural ability with. Which is a bigger problem than usual here, as he seems intent on taking centre stage and commandeering the whole show, really laying it on and giving it both barrels, whilst Stallone merely strides along the saddles, aware of what a one trick pony the whole show is. True, he can't really match DeNiro's dramatic expression and capability, but what he isn't showing is really saying a lot more than what he is. Meanwhile, a trio of supporting stars in the shape of Basinger, Hart and Alan Ardin don't get a lot to do, almost criminally under-used.<br/><br/>It's just a majorly belated, tragically one note show, depicting something that would never happen in real life and will be of little interest to anyone other than die hard Jake/Rocky devotees, who must be old enough to know better by now. **"

","I'll be completely honest. I (like a lot of people) didn't expect much from this film.

And there are points where that feeling pops up, but that aside it is a rather good film. I enjoyed it, found myself smiling and laughing. And for all the desperate comedy there are little glimpses of wit. For all the cheesy scenes there are moments of real sincerity. The main example of that is in the scenes between Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (De Niro) and B.J (John Bernthal). These two just seemed to click for me. Bernthal has great acting ability and after roles in this and ""Wolf on Wall Street"" he is more than capable of being a star in the future.

A promoter by the name of Dante King Jr. (Kevin Hart) stops by Razor's home, and offers him a large paycheck in order to do motion capturing for a new video-game.<br/><br/>Razor turns it down at first, but is convinced when he realizes that he does indeed need the money. He tells King that he will do it, as long as Kid is booked to motion capture his on a different day. The two never got over their bad blood for each other.<br/><br/>Can you guess what happens next? Kid shows up, the two argue on the set, and boom, social media gets a hold of it. The video is popular, a fight is suggested, and the two former rulers of the ring set out to prove that they are not dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Ex-girlfriend Sally Rose (Kim Basinger) re-appears after thirty years, and tries to spark up a conversation with Sharp. Due to her formerly being romantically involved with Kid as well, Sharp is not very interested. This will be built upon as the film progresses.<br/><br/>The films run-time is around two hours, so they decided to fill it with every single known cliché in the books. This is a sport movie that is identical to every other sport movie. You have a romance that is as fun as watching paint dry. Family problems that shamelessly escalate by being forced in order to make a character realize a change is required.<br/><br/>Calling out exactly what happens can be done by viewing the trailer. I will admit that it has a few cool scenes such as the boxers appearing at an UFC event, and getting into an argument with the fighters. It also succeeds at being funny at times.<br/><br/>The laughs are more subtle than the overly stupid approach many comedies are resorting too these days. Stallone provokes a few giggles, as he repeats some of the things he did in Rocky films, but makes fun of them. The acting was not bad for the most part, and some were even great.<br/><br/>Kevin Hart did a fabulous job, and lightened up the screen as King. Alan Arkin did a fine job as Razor's trainer, while Jon Berthal of Walking Dead fame was believable as the son Kid never attempted to meet.<br/><br/>Grudge Match did not need to be two hours. Everyone who had interest in this film cared about seeing Stallone go against De Niro, and not the generic plot devices that would be used to build it. I did not expect this to have the depth of a film such as The Fighter, but my ultimate point is just that the majority of it was slow. I was tempted to hit the fast forward button more than once.<br/><br/>All the build leads to a final fight, which is somewhat not worth the long journey of waiting for it. The fights in the Rocky movies or Raging Bull were superior, and the winner was clear from the start. So were the clichés that went down before the winner was announced.<br/><br/>My favorite part was the post-credits scene with Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield being persuaded by Kevin Hart. It was actually laugh out loud funny, and allowed the film to end with a smile on my face.<br/><br/>Die hard boxing film fans will even be disappointed by this one. It includes a few laughs even if you do not like boxing, but none that will make it worth rushing too. Stallone and De Niro were able to get in convincing shape, and the idea sounded awesome on paper. The execution just failed to live up to the idea.<br/><br/>Read More at: http://thycriticman.com/"

","Sylvester Stallone made another boxing movie but it's not Rocky 7. It's Grudge Match and Robert De Niro is Stallone's co star. The premise is two boxing rivals, Razor and Kid come out of retirement to have one final match.<br/><br/>How was it? It was alright, it could have been worse. The writer thinks frequent S bombs is funny and most of them were forced. There's some vulgar humor, only a little would have been better. Some of the jokes were forced, a huge deal or flaw. The grudge match was lame, it was lazy. The ending was abrupt.<br/><br/>The acting was good. De Niro's the best actor here not to my surprise and he didn't phone it in. Stallone may not be a great actor but he can act when he wants to which he did here. Rocky and Rambo are opposites and Stallone was good as both characters. Razor was like Rocky. Kid was rude, overconfident and womanizing. Kevin Hart plays Dante, a loud mouth fight promoter. He was funny and he reminded me of Chris Tucker who is funny also.<br/><br/>I liked the story. The grudge match allowed Razor and Kid to go back to their pasts. Razor reconnected with his ex girlfriend and Kid met his son and grandson. Maybe a lot of people found Razor's story boring. No one can say it's better than Kid's story. This movie is similar to Grumpy Old Men.<br/><br/>This movie was originally scheduled for January and it was pushed forward to December because the test score was high. Maybe that reason was false. I understand why the odd person thinks this is good. I will watch it again eventually, maybe I will laugh a little instead of barely. My hopes weren't high, I didn't think I would laugh out loud ten times or so. You could see this on the big screen but waiting for the DVD is better."

De Niro is an awesome goof, and Sly was his usual self, and that's exactly what you want from these actors in that kind of movie. Somehow I found the training montage more impressive in this one than in Rocky Balboa. It was good to see Kim Basinger again, she's aging well. Overall, the movie was really funny, I smiled and laughed from beginning to end. The various nods to Rocky were well done, and Sly appeared to be in fantastic shape (actually, he looked in better shape than for Rocky Balboa or Rambo!). De Niro not so much, but still decent.

As bizarre and unlikely it is that two boxers would reprise their boxing skills after 30 years is, these two talented actors make you believe it. If you have an opportunity, give the movie a chance and I think you'll be delightfully surprised. I was. Kim Bassinger as the belated love interest does a credible job and looks lovely as ever; Alan Arkin almost steals the show his delivery is, as always, spot on.

A rather shallow story with the Hollywoodean way of resolving challenges where the main character very swiftly overcomes his objections and forges the plot forward.<br/><br/>As the day of the rematch approaches aside from the fact that we have constant displays of two men well past their middle age acting like foolish children, there is little anticipation for the big day and when it does arrive to see two men beating each other up like this is just sad.<br/><br/>Whilst we should be excited to see films where older people take centre stage and the great shape in which these two particular older men are, the whole conception and execution of this project did no justice to the aforementioned principle."

","Grudge Match (2013) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Disappointing teaming of Robert DeNiro and Sylvester Stallone has them playing aging boxers who never got to have their third bout to see which one was the better fighter. The two agree to the third battle but soon all sorts of personal drama makes them question their motives. GRUDGE MATCH is an incredibly disappointing film but hey, you gotta think that teaming ROCKY and RAGING BULL would have been a good idea. Well, it would have been a good idea perhaps twenty-years ago but it's just a tad bit hard to swallow no matter how hard they try to push it on you. Perhaps it's just me but I just can't see DeNiro being able to stay in the ring with Stallone. With that said, there are so many problems here that keeps this from being more entertaining and especially the sloppy screenplay that throws one cliché after another at you. Of course there's going to be a woman (Kim Basinger) in the middle. There's going to be a son coming out of nowhere. There's going to be health issues. Money issues. Then there are the various boxing clichés that come up throughout the film. I think both DeNiro and Stallone offer good performances but the screenplay just gives both of them so few chances to actually try and do something. The film is either trying to be too sweet or too funny with bad jokes. Alan Arkin plays a character better suited in GRUMPY OLD MEN. Kevin Hart, wow, this guy just wasn't funny here. The jokes are usually aimed at the old but they're just not very original. It really does seem as if someone thought it was a great idea to have ROCKY fight RAGING BULL but after getting the actors to agree to it they just got lazy and did nothing else story wise. There are so many things that could have been handled better and director Peter Segal deserves a lot of the blame. Even the final boxing match contains very little to no excitement. GRUDGE MATCH would have been a miracle to pull off and sadly they didn't do it."

","'GRUDGE MATCH': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Film icons Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro (who last appeared on screen together in 1997's 'COP LAND') star in this boxing movie about former boxing champions who decide to have one last bout together, 30 years after a tiebreaking title match was supposed to take place. The movie obviously could have been titled 'ROCKY VS. RAGING BULL: THIRTY SOME YEARS LATER', which probably would have sold more tickets. As it is it's a decent boxing comedy drama film and is about what anyone should expect going into it (No more, no less).<br/><br/>Stallone plays Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and De Niro plays Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen. They're both retired Pittsburgh boxers who each held the title and won one fight against the other. They were supposed to have a tiebreaking match thirty years earlier but Razor retired the night before the big fight. Kid has been wanting to fight Razor again ever since and when a boxing promoter named Dante Slate, Jr. (Kevin Hart), the son of the promoter who arranged Razor and Kid's earlier fights, proposes a new match between the two Kid of course jumps at the opportunity. Razor is (of course) not into the idea at all at first, largely due to the fact that Kid slept with his ex-girlfriend, Sally Rose (Kim Basinger), thirty years earlier before the cancelled bout. Due to financial difficulties Razor agrees to do the fight. Alan Arkin also co-stars in the movie as Razor's old trainer and Jon Bernthal (of 'THE WALKING DEAD' fame) plays Kid's son (and Sally's) who he never knew.<br/><br/>The movie is full of all your usual clichés and cheesy drama but it is funny and a lot of fun. If you're not interested in seeing a boxing match between Rocky and the Raging Bull, thirty some years later, than this isn't the movie for you but I love the idea of it and got what I paid for. Stallone and De Niro are both great in the film (and looked like they had a lot of fun doing it) and the supporting cast is all decent as well. Peter Segal (who also directed films like 'TOMMY BOY', 'ANGER MANAGEMENT', '50 FIRST DATES' and 'GET SMART') does a decent job directing and the script (by Doug Ellin, Tim Kelleher and Rodney Rothman is adequate). Of course it's not a great film but it's not a bad one either and it's definitely a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gmBnRGZV8o"

","On paper the premise for this movie would seem too ridiculous for words, a 73 year old man boxing a 67 year old man (Stallone and DeNiro's ages). However, I have to give the makers of this film just credit because they take this seemingly insane idea and make it work. So many people have commented that it was appropriate for Stallone and DeNiro to work together on a film like this. DeNiro won an Oscar for playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull and Stallone played our most beloved movie boxer Rocky Balboa. Maybe they should have made this film back in the 1970s when both of them were in their primes! Stallone is basically playing Rocky in this film, a decent, honorable blue collar guy who is too proud to reveal he is blind in one eye. He and DeNiro are so funny to watch in their constant bickering, especially that part where they tear the studio apart in that computer simulation. I hadn't seen Kim Basinger for a while, but she still looks awesome and is really wonderful as the love interest of the two men (she is sort of the ""Adrian"" of the film). There are parts of this film that are sort of affectionate homages to Rocky. There is a scene where Stallone drinks a glass of cracked eggs and another where he is about to punch a side of beef but then his trainer tells him that is unsanitary and he only wants dinner (Alan Arkin has an amusing bit here as Stallone's geriatric foul mouthed trainer, he is supposed to be like Mick in the Rocky films). I really found myself rooting for Stallone's character because DeNiro, while doing his usual brilliant acting job, basically plays a horses ass! I didn't like that part where he endangers his young grandson I don't know how his son was so forgiving towards him. My other beef with the film is that training sequences that show the two elderly gents suffering the agonies of the damned seemed very forced (however I have to admit I thought the scene where DeNiro farted while doing sit-ups was very funny). Then ladies and gentleman we come to the conclusion, the great fight between these two old warriors. Will they remember to take their Geritol? It may be hard to believe, but the final fight is very exciting and realistic and like the bouts in Rocky. SPOILER ALERT Sly gets to win (duh doesn't he ALWAYS get to win) We see that the two men have laid their personal demons to rest and now have mutual respect for one another. Oh and by the way, sniff sniff, DeNiro hugs his estranged son and tells his grandson to call him ""grandpa"". What a happy ending. I have heard that this film is really getting slammed by the critics and I want to come to its defense. I also wanted to mention that you should stay for the closing credits because they have one last laugh in store for you. They try to get Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson to have a rematch!"

","GRUDGE MATCH feels a little like the boxing version of THE EXPENDABLES at times. It fears a world-weary Sly Stallone (a typical type of character for him, these days) playing a former boxing champion who comes out of retirement for one last match with his old rival, played by Robert De Niro. Yep, it's a simple film built around the premise 'Rocky vs. Raging Bull', with no more depth to it than that.<br/><br/>Well, there is depth, but it's TV movie-style sentiment and family affairs-type material which I tend to avoid like the plague. It's a pity, as both Kim Basinger and Jon Bernthal have given great performances elsewhere but are wasted in minor roles like this. Stallone remains as likable as ever but De Niro plays a largely unsympathetic role, which is mainly down to the script. As a comedy, this isn't very funny at all, as it's way too mean-spirited and ugly with constant jokes aimed at physical appearance and the like. The only good thing about it is the brutal final fight, which is almost worth the wait."

","Although this works as a concept, having two old boxers who hate each other have one last match, it just keeps on making wish that I could have seen a movie where Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone had made this movie when they were both in their prime, cause that would have been explosive. As for the movie we do have, it is not a terrible comedy, but it is far from great. The main bright spots are the interactions between Kevin Hart and Alan Arkin, who keep yipping at each other and basically steal the show.

","Review: The best way to watch this movie is if you totally don't take it seriously. It's more like a comedic Rocky with the two old timers proving that they still got it in the ring. Some of the scenes are funny, but I grew up watching the Rocky movies and I was a big fan of Raging Bull so it's a bit weird watching Stallone & DeNiro kicking butt in there later years. I couldn't keep up with Kevin Hart because seems to have verbal diarrhoea throughout the movie which did get on my nerves, but apart from that, it's a watchable film with an impressive showdown at the end. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: It really does amaze me how much DeNiro can change from one role to another. In some of his films, he still looks young, but in this film I think that they deliberately went with an older look. Stallone just looks the same in all of his movies and his acting style isn't really that versatile, but I will always watch his movies, because I have grown up with all of his franchises. I didn't really like the guy who played DeNiro's son because he seemed to slow the film down, but I liked all of the cameos, especially Tyson & Holyfield at the end.<br/><br/>Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $42.3million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there boxing movies about 2 veteran boxers who want to settle a old score. 6/10"

","Yes De Niro and Stallone are pretty old by now. But this is not so much about the boxing (just in case you were wondering), although it will feel your need for that too. This is a comedy with really good actors who are having a lot of fun with it. Is there morality in it? Yes, but it is so nicely packed into the comedy that you really shouldn't mind at all about that.<br/><br/>The script is nicely written too, with some added jokes during the credits, so stay tuned and don't prematurely end the movie.

","You gotta hand it to the producers of Grudge Match. They managed to get both Rocky Balboa and Jake La Motta into one movie. Unfortunately they were so glad with this achievement they forgot to take care of the most important thing in a film: a good script. <br/><br/>The story of two old champions who battle it out to determine who's the best is okay at best, but most of the time you get bored by what happens on screen. The film can't choose between drama and comedy and therefor doesn't hit any target. The only reason you keep watching is the cast: DeNiro and Stallone are okay, but it's nice to see the still beautiful Kim Basinger (who turns 61 this year) and the always brilliant Alan Arkin at work. Kevin Hart as wannabe box promoter is pretty irritating though. On the bright side: at the final fight the movie delivers and as a viewer you can live with the end result. But if the leads weren't played by actors who had a famous movie boxing history like Stallone and DeNiro have, this movie would probably have been quite unwatchable.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, there is a sort of after credits scene in Grudge Match and sadly this one is the funniest scene in the whole movie. I guess that says enough...<br/><br/>6/10"

I felt it started slow at first but gradually picked up near the end and became one of my favorite comedies of the year. While the jokes of old age are filled within the film they're not forced onto the audience as they have been in other films i've seen this year (ex: last Vegas). Sylvester Stallone, Robert DeNiro , Kim Basinger ,lan Arkin and Jon Bernthal all do great acting in this especially Jon Bernthal who I'm very glad is getting roles after the walking dead. Kevin hart on the other hand of all these actor's comedy was very stale and annoying as you will at times wish he could disappear. This film had a much deeper thought provoking plot where during the late second to third acts do delve deep into a good story that i wasn't expecting in a comedy and i feel elevated the film even higher than where i would have ranked this movie had this plot not been in the film. Stallone and DeNiro i feel i have to talk about as you truly believe these two downright hate each other and will never get along this kind of chemistry also pushes the film as does the chemistry between Bernthal and DeNiro as well the chemistry between Stallone and Basinger.

I left my family on Christmas Day and went to see this movie in my Italian stallion robe and boxing shorts. Neadless to say, it was worth missing out on most of Christmas Day! The movie started out slow and the jokes were pretty bad. There was a moment of panic when I was thinking to myself ""oh no. They butchered this movie."" But as the story moved along, I fell in love. It was like getting into a pool for the first time. You slowly get more comfortable the further in you get. That's what this movie did. They threw all these one liners in the beginning of the movie that were so bad they made me cringe. But as the story moved along, they really got in the groove. I was literally slapping my knee at most of the scenes in the movie and it was such a pleasure to see these two boxing warriors back in the ring again. In this movie, it's more than age, it's about heart. If your so passionate about something, how can you live with yourself by giving it up? I felt their pain and struggle of not be able to do what they want anymore even though they love it. Yea, there were a lot of missed opportunities when it came to jokes or scenes they really could have knocked out of the park, but in the end it was really something that i will remember for the rest of my life. that i finally got to see Sylvester Stallone in the ring again.

Some say it's very clichéd, but whatever, I enjoyed it. I liked how they pit two of Hollywood's greatest film stars against each other in a boxing match that could spell out victory for whoever wins the last match they ever do.<br/><br/>This is the second movie I've seen where De Niro stars in a Comedy and I must say, it is a lot better than the previous movie I saw with him in a Comedy, Analyze That. He's actually funny in this one, and doesn't take himself too seriously.<br/><br/>I didn't exactly expect a Comedy at first crack, but then after seeing a brief description on it, I was prepared for what was to come, and this movie delivered on many fronts. It balances the border between serious moments and funny moments keeping the film going at a consistent pace. It's not perfect, but it's very smart.<br/><br/>After seeing the two in some very intense movies like The Expendables and Heat, it was refreshing to see the two in a more comedic but still consistently placed movie that has a great story, and interesting characters.<br/><br/>The movie isn't without its flaws though. I liked Kevin Hart's performance in the movie, but he didn't exactly play an important role, he was just there to be funny, which would have been great, except his role was not a strong one. Nothing against black people, but it would have been better if his role was more important to the story. Maybe it's just me but that's how I felt.<br/><br/>Also, there were some parts in the movie I didn't find funny because the jokes were a little tiresome and a couple of parts did leave me bored.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie is great, and those flaws I mentioned were only a mild hindrance to what I got out of it. If you're looking for a clever, and hilarious script, I would definitely recommend this movie. It's not perfect, but it's very well made compared to other films in recent years. I give it an 8/10."

","'Packs a punch' . . . 'It's a hit' . . . 'Swings and misses' – I cannot promise a complete absence of the inevitable '*boxing puns in a review of something to do with boxing'. The ones that do make it in, however, will hopefully be of a quality higher than this fistful (*there's one already) of examples. That being said: ring the bell (*right), it's time to review Grudge Match.<br/><br/>Opportunistically billed (*already?) as a fight '30 years in the making', Grudge Match teams up two undisputed *(mmm) legends of their trade, Stallone and De Niro, for a sports comedy-drama that few would really have been 'waiting for', but succeeds for the most part in being a bout that you're glad they found time for. Of course this is, figuratively, Balboa vs La Motta, with both stars possessing the relative experience, training and filmography under their belts (*loose, that's loose) that goes back to the 70s and 80s with Rocky and Raging Bull. The output in terms of action in recent times has been in Stallone's corner (*yep), with the comedy in De Niro's; in any case, fighting for box-office is what these guys do.<br/><br/>Indeed, comparisons to Rocky Balboa hit right in the first round (*obvious?), with the out-of-touch use of the computer games industry being the catalyst for bringing the feud of Henry 'Razor' Sharp (Stallone) and Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen (De Niro) screaming into the 21st century. Certainly things don't look great from the outset. Following a hastily created and much-bettered attempt at using a Digital Head Swap technique for the opening montage showing Sharp and McDonnen in their prime, there's a cranky, and downright sloppy opening third which does not fail to establish the humour involved with some decent jokes already hitting their intended target (*very well) but does set the tone for the poor editing and confusing camera-work which is consistently distracting through most of the film. A new drinking game could be invented which responds to the amount of bizarrely unfunny and pointless exit lines from scenes which don't know how to end, and there are more than a few poorly chosen camera angles and cuts which are at their best annoying and at their worst immersion-breaking. There is also an undeniable laziness in the genericity of the characters and the construction of the narrative, as well as some cheap, dated and out-of- place racial stereotype comedy.<br/><br/>Soon enough, however, Grudge Match starts to find its feet and a great deal of momentum as the plot slowly thickens, and the match draws ever closer. Maybe it's the introductions of the great casting choices in the brilliant Alan Arkin and John Bernthal , playing Sharp's old trainer and McDonnen's estranged son respectively, or the undeniable charm and spirit that is delivered throughout via smile-inducing references and seeing the stars really relish their roles (especially De Niro). There are the expected Rocky-style montages, but they are intelligent and designed to fit with the characters' conditions – though not the actors', of course, as Stallone and De Niro are certainly not that out of shape! Granted, you're more likely to have that smile on your face if you grew up watching these guys in action, similarly if you can relate to the mockery created from amusing running gags on the uses of smart-phones to make silly events go 'viral', social networking, product placement and the wearing of green latex suits to capture performance art.<br/><br/>If you've made it to the middle section still at least mildly intrigued as to where all this is going, the best gags, the most touching dialogue and the strangest sights await you as Grudge Match lands hit after hit (*thought we'd moved on) in the face of cynicism and shamelessly believes in itself in an admirable kind of way. Director Peter Segal (50 First Dates; Anger Management) knows when to add that drop of sentiment in at exactly the right times - though this is arguably the least subtle of his films at doing so - and succeeds in creating a believable love- triangle story between the fighters and Sharp's ex-partner Sally, played by the occasionally missing, yet still strangely reliable Basinger. Arkin constantly threatens to steal the film in both dramatic and comedic terms, adding to the strong foundation of a supporting cast which, had it been weaker, would probably not have supported the film even with this headline act in place.<br/><br/>By the time the main event is unveiled, a decent amount of prep work has been put in place to make it entertaining if not outright enthralling. With a combined age of 137, you have to respect the energy both Stallone and De Niro have exerted in putting on as good a show as they can. Further, the film makes the decent gesture of attempting to transform the viewers' perspective from what the characters can't or didn't do to what they can and have now chosen to. There are quite a few critics already throwing in the towel (*yesiree) on Grudge Match, but I for one did not have the heart to, nor did I believe that would be doing any justice to a film that at least tries to gradually explore the age vs. ability question, as opposed to having them constantly state 'I'm old' in a cheap, Schwarznegger-comeback type way.<br/><br/>The drama may be bantam-weight in the end, but the comedy is more hits than misses (*I give up), leaving Grudge Match with a win on points on my scorecard. (*pun-o-meter full)<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"

","Contains Spoilers: It is not another sequel to Sly's or De Niri's movies however it does refer to them with frankly hilarious jokes (""What you gonna do, beat up the meat? No, that's not sanitary""). But also the jokes aren't just material derived from their old films, their is a lot of good humour that is original. Lightning was a great character that makes me laugh more often than not. De Niro was also a fantastic in this film, he and Stallone deliver and deliver well. I also enjoyed Kim Basinger's character Sally Rose, she was real. A nice person who made a stupid mistake that she tries to fix. I liked the chemistry between her and Stallone. Now, Kevin Hart I thought I was going to hate, I thought damn, that's going to get old and fast. Nope, I loved him; great delivery. Dante (Hart) and Lightning were amusing to say the least together. I think the only bad side to this movie is it will send you into a nostalgic spiral that will have you watching Rocky and Raging Bull (though is that such a bad thing?)."

Then suddenly we get more characters involved in the story, and it becomes genuine, and no longer just a joke. Kim Basinger looks great, and really polarizes the Stallone side. Jon Bernthal and the Grandson really pull the Robert De Niro﻿ side of things into shape. Once you have all of these new players this turns into a really good movie that only gets warmer, and more full of heart the harder the punches get thrown.

"maurice_yacowar","7","1","4","16 January 2014"," Really old ex-boxers resume 30-year rivalry
","Grudge Match does three things: (i) contend that Us Old Farts can still rise to an occasion; (ii) show True Love finding a way after a 30-year break; and (iii) exercise the knowing wit of intertextuality. The first two are obvious in the plot so I'll just focus on the third.<br/><br/>This is less a film about its characters than a film about the stars' personae from their earlier work. The Kid (Robert De Niro) is an ex-champ who lost the title when he was out of condition and now runs a supper club where he does stand-up comedy. That's extended shorthand for De Niro's Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull. Razor (Sylvester Stallone) is fully drawn out of his Rocky persona, the blue collar lug with heart who wins his fights by sustaining brutal punishment. As in their earlier roles, De Niro is the more violent and irresponsible, though the last round of their battle allows him redemption.. <br/><br/>The more you know of the earlier films, the more chuckles of recognition you will enjoy here. Scene after scene plays wittily against the actors' persona, or continuing image. When Razor's trainer Lightning (Alan Arkin) tells him not to punch the hanging carcasses, he's stopping Razor/Stallone's replay of the meat-beating scene in Rocky. The lowered horizon shot of Razor jogging behind Arkin's wheelchair is a bathetic echo of the first film's poetic training. The later Rocky's recovery of his alienated son is here transferred to De Niro while the classier sex prize goes to Stallone. Fair swap.<br/><br/>For that matter, all of Alan Arkin's many jokes — by and against him — cohere with his recent cycle of Acerbic Geezer frolics. The film's satire of the sport's hucksterism, all the promotional gimmicks and media play, reflect ironically on the film's very being. Like the hapless promoter's schemes, this film is a deliberate commercialization of its stars' established images. But the top-notch script and Peter Segal's direction admit that and leave us to enjoy the fun. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com."

Alan Arkin is Arkin like and it.is good to see Kim Bassinger again.<br/><br/>The plot is on the thin side but the idea is high concept with the two stars and they carry the movie.

","Sylvester Stallone didn't really want to do this and Robert DeNiro talked him into it. Sounds like part of the plot of the movie. I'm sure glad Stallone did take this role and yes it does go into Rocky a lot however it was done right. The eggs, the meat and the training sequence (I won't go into all of the other references as I read another review that mentions more then I could count.) Stallone acts again without killing or blowing up any one. Of course there are no cry scenes unfortunately because he can cry up a storm if he had too.<br/><br/>There are a lot of homages then just Rocky, there's The Sunshine Boys (2 rivals getting together again), a tad of Nobody's Fool (Robert DeNiro and the grandson) Grumpy Old Men, and very little (I'm surprised) of Raging Bull. When I saw the trailer I thought of The Sunshine Boys as DeNiro took on the George Burns role and Stallone the Matthau role and yes it turns more like a Grumpy Old Boxers then The Sunshine Boxers but I didn't care. I was still entertained by this movie and love to watch it again.<br/><br/>Of course this movie doesn't get edgy (Raging Bull, Taxi Driver) or is academy award driven like The Sunshine Boys and I didn't expect that but it was well acted and I felt for the characters. The difference was in Rocky you wanted Rocky to win and this movie it was a split. You wanted both to win.<br/><br/>All the other actors are quite good. Kevin Hart wasn't all that annoying, Alan Arkin plays the old guy who steals the scenes he's in, Kim Basinger, Camden Gray but I have to give a big big hand to Jon Benthal (Snitch and his most famous, playing Shane in The Walking Dead). He's picking out the right medium roles with the likes of Dwayne Johnson (Snitch) and of course Stallone and DeNiro that someone said he's going to be a big star and I agree entirely. Him and DeNiro played well together. I also just found he's in The Wolf Of Wall Street (a movie that didn't interest me until now) and a future war movie w/Brad Pitt, yes he's going to be a big star to contend with.<br/><br/>All in all I did love this movie. When I watch a movie I watch like everyone else then I start to get a feeling and that feeling is like a high and the higher it gets the more I can't put this movie down. There's nothing to put down here. I'm one who did watch Batman and Robin and enjoyed it and a few others I liked that others would question. There are not many movies that I didn't enjoy, good or bad."

And, I had never heard of Kevin Hart until this movie!<br/><br/>Stallone and DeNiro have proved more versatile, over the years, than most of their fans give them credit for. The latter, in particular. Prior to AWAKENINGS, DeNiro only seemed able and/or content to play the same type of character; a blue-collar loudmouth who swore in thirty-second spurts every five minutes like clockwork! But, I'm glad to say that changed (or, perhaps, just my appraisal had) in the twenty years following that.<br/><br/>Even so, it's nice to see him back in the type of film role that helped make him a household name among all those who weren't old enough to see TAXI DRIVER in movie theaters.<br/><br/>As for Stallone? He and Alan Arkin--as ""Lightning Lou"" Conlon, ""Razor"" Sharp's aging coach--have great screen chemistry. From their hilariously straight-faced parody of Stallone's now-classic use of frozen beef as a punching bag. To Arkin's accapella ""mating"" dance while Razor is on the telephone, trying to arrange a date with his ex-girlfriend (played by the still-beauteous Kim Basinger).<br/><br/>The only thing that keeps me from giving this a perfect ten? Kevin Hart's performance as Dante, Junior. I'm sorry, but there's no gentler way to put this.<br/><br/>Hart sounded like he was competing in a Chris Rock Sound-alike Contest...and losing!<br/><br/>Other than that, I enjoyed this film, immensely.

","Grudge Match (2013): Dir: Peter Segal / Cast: Sylvester Stallone, Robert De Niro, Kevin Hart, Alan Arkin, Kim Basinger: Cliché filled cheap embarrassment about higher potential, which this film sadly lacks. It stars two ageing boxers, Sylvester Stallone as Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and Robert De Niro as Billy ""the Kid"" McDonnen who both scored victories over each other during the early 1980's but a tie breaker was never realized. With technology booming both boxers are sought after for a video game but an unfortunate encounter brings bad memories and a fist fight that makes it viral world wide. From there it becomes a routine training session for the way late big fight as both guys clearly dislike each and are indulged in stupid publicity stunts that visualize their age disadvantage. The climatic boxing match is actually better than expected pitting Stallone of Rocky and De Niro of Raging Bull against each other. Unfortunately everything leading up to it has them reduced to overacting. Sharp discovers that he is blind in one eye and struggles to reconnect with the woman who was involved with both men. McDonnen is met with his grown son whom he takes on as a trainer. Kevin Hart overplays it as a promoter, and Alan Arkin plays a hearing impaired former trainer to Sharp. Kim Basinger plays the woman with a past with both fighters and a presence less inspiring. Director Peter Segal has done better with comedies such as The Naked Gun 33 1/3 and 50 First Dates. Theme regards how despite age we all leave a legacy. Unfortunately this film leaves its audience with the only grudge to bare. Score: 4 / 10"
"dave-mcclain","8","0","1","27 November 2015"," ""Grudge Match"" is an entertaining film about art imitating life imitating art.
","Surprises are nice. Surprises are interesting. Surprises are fun. It's surprising when a pair of aging boxers show that they can still bring it. It's surprising when aging actors show us something fresh and new. It's surprising when people who have very good reasons to hate each other find common ground. And it's surprising when a movie that you expect to be formulaic turns out to be much more.<br/><br/>Life imitating art imitating life is what ""Grudge Match"" (PG-13, 1:53) is all about. The film stars two actors in their late 60s playing boxers, while both actors had famously played boxers on film in the 1980s. This movie is not Jake LaMotta versus Rocky Balboa (although that would be interesting since the former was a real person and the latter is a fictional character). This pairing of screen legends who have played boxers before and are now playing different boxers who, in the story have boxed before is plenty interesting in its own right.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and Robert DeNiro is Billy ""Kid"" McDonnen, boxers who came up in the sport as rivals and grew to hate each other, but decide to reunite – professionally, if not personally. When the two light heavyweights first fought each other for the championship, Kid won. In the rematch, Razor won. The tie-breaking grudge match that everyone wanted to see never happened because, for very personal and private reasons, Razor retired from boxing while still in his prime.<br/><br/>Fast-forward 30 years. Razor is living a lonely life and barely making ends meet. Kid is a local businessman who is moderately successful, but still nurses a grudge against Razor for refusing to allow him to redeem himself after his one lost fight. When a motion-capture video session for a new boxing video game featuring the two boxing legends leads to a physical confrontation that is caught on cell phone cameras and goes viral, the son (Kevin Hart) of Razor's former boxing promoter brings the two old enemies together so the world can finally see them finish what they started.<br/><br/>But before the fight can take place, both men have to overcome their personal animosity, mend fences with others from their shared past and, of course, get their well-past-their-prime bodies into fighting shape if that's possible. Razor's old friend Louis ""Lightning"" Conlon (Alan Arkin) trains Razor, while Kid is trained by his estranged son, B.J. (Jon Bernthal), who often has his precocious son Trey (Camden Gray) in tow. Kim Basinger plays Sally, a woman who has something of a history with both Razor and Kid.<br/><br/>""Grudge Match"" doesn't take the easy way out of anything – and the effort pays off. The professional, physical and personal challenges that both men face aren't easily overcome. The drama feels genuine and is perfectly balanced by well-earned laughs. Basinger (a previous Oscar winner) gives the story just the right amount of gravitas and Kevin Hart provides the comic relief, with more than a little help from Arkin and Gray, not to mention the stars themselves. Stallone and DeNiro could've mailed in their performances, but instead, they both give us some real quality acting. DeNiro is alternately funny and heart-breaking, but without falling back on his grumpy guy routine of which we've seen a little too much in the past few years. In fact, DeNiro's character is no comedian, but is the more upbeat of the two main characters. Meanwhile, Stallone is sullen, without being depressing, funny when appropriate and seems to show genuine emotion as he works through a number of personal challenges.<br/><br/>But the appeal of this movie doesn't just come from the talented cast. The story is original enough to be engaging and is further enhanced by well-paced and balanced directing and seamless editing. The movie also contains a very appealing soundtrack, with a great mix of well-known tunes and some very cool new music. Even the film's obligatory training montage feels fresh and the climactic fight sequence manages a surprise or two. And speaking of surprises, don't be in too much of a hurry to head for the exits when the credits start to roll, or you'll miss two very clever final scenes.<br/><br/>""Grudge Match"" tells an interesting story, with plenty of laughs, scenes that'll make you smile and even a touching moment or two – and does it all with an unexpected amount of originality. This film fought through some well-worn territory and emerged as a very pleasant surprise – and with an ""A-"" from me."

","""Grudge Match"" stars Sylvester Stallone and Robert DeNiro as two former rival boxers who decide to duke it up in their geriatric time in a grudge match. Speaking of which, I have held a grudge against many Stallone movies not including ""Rocky"", ""Rocky 2"", ""Cop Land"" and ""Cliffhanger"". As far as DeNiro goes, I am not going to put up a fight here because a good 80% of his movies have been worthy, but even Bobby D. has been knocked down by a flew clunkers himself. I would not call ""Grudge Match"" a surefire winner but it still fell marginally into my ring of worthy comedies for 2013. Stallone stars as Henry ""Razor"" Sharp, the mild-mannered but off-putting of the two who unexpectedly retired before the initial scheduled grudge match 30 years ago. DeNiro co-stars as Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen, the womanizing alcoholic who discovers he has as adult son from a previous affair; who by the way, the woman happened to be in love with Razor thirty years ago. Director Peter Segal added some fun to the piece by satirizing the Stallone & DeNiro infamous 70's boxer characters; Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta, respectively; but then again, he did not knock me out with his orchestration of the picture also. Stallone and DeNiro were adequate with their performances, but it looked more like an easy-peazy fun time for them. Kevin Hart was not exactly a formidable acting supporting sparring partner for Stallone & DeNiro with his over-the-top performance as an eager promoter. In the other ring, Alan Arkin looked lackadaisical with his performance as Razor's longtime trainer. Kim Basinger shows up here also as the woman that had a split decision as Sally, yes that girl, who romanced Razor but fooled around and fathered The Kid's kid three decades ago. Please don't have a grudge against me if ""Grudge Match"" is not your cup of tea; as I said, it's not a champion of a movie, but it had its moments; as most boxers do. *** Average"

","Henry 'Razor' Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) and Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen (Robert De Niro) were the toughest of rivals. At the height of their rivalry with a big fight coming up, Razor abandons his boxing career and retires after Billy gets his girlfriend Sally Rose pregnant. Now 30 years later, Razor is working a lunch box job while Billy is still living off of his past success. Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart) is the son of their late former promoter who comes to them with a job for a video game. Billy ambushes Razor at the video game taping and starts a fight. The fight goes viral and Dante has a new opportunity. He offers them $100k each to fight for real. Razor gets his old trainer Louis Conlon (Alan Arkin) to help. Sally (Kim Basinger) and the long lost son B.J. (Jon Bernthal) re-enter their lives.<br/><br/>It's not as horrible as I feared. The big problem is that most of the jokes don't work. Even the red hot Kevin Hart can't solve that problem. He's not in it enough anyways. This movie almost works with the dysfunctional personal drama, but it's a little too slow. Kim Basinger and Stallone have very awkward chemistry. DeNiro has a better time with his new family. It's a lot of geezer jokes and geezer training. There are a couple of smirk-worthy moments like Razor almost punching the slabs of meat or Alan Arkin having fun with Kevin Hart. The movie has its moments but the ending drags on and on. It turns into way too serious of a fight. Stallone just can't let go of Rocky. Peter Segal is not a favored comedic director of mine. This does not improve my opinion of him."

","What could have easily been a cheesy, weak, terrible effort by all involved is actually a heartfelt, entertaining movie with two actors who didn't take themselves too seriously while also having some pride.<br/><br/>For all those who would have loved to see Balboa vs La Motta match 25 years ago get a little taste of it but with some more slapstick, lightheartedness sprinkled in. Both of these actors could have easily mailed this one in for a quick paycheck, but instead they gave us some great moments and seem to really care about the characters they were playing. Kevin Hart and Alan Arkin deliver some of the more humorous moments, breathing in a little more life and an additional layer to this solid flick. Don't get me wrong no Oscars will be handed out for this one, but you'll find yourself laughing far more than you thought and invested enough in both characters you won't know who to cheer for when they finally square off.<br/><br/>Bring the family, all will enjoy."

","Wow! This movie turned out to be a lot better than I thought. It has a fun and enthralling story, fun humor and good pacing. It's just entertaining from start to finish, there just wasn't a moment where I felt I was bored and even has heart to go with it. The plot is about a grudge match that takes place between ex-boxers after 30 yrs. Yeah, sure one fighter might be more likable than the other, but the other has a heartfelt backstory so it balances out. Sylvester Stallone basically plays Rocky Balboa and Robert De Niro basically plays his portrayal of Jake LaMotta. Overall I had a good time with this film and for the most part thoroughly enjoyed it.

While I can't say this is a great movie or one I would watch over and over it was very fun and enjoyable to watch. There were a few in-jokes about those two movies which made it that much funnier. I do recommend this and even though I had high expectations going in I wasn't disappointed at all. Overall, funny and just a fun ride.

"estebangonzalez10","4","0","1","5 April 2014"," Rocky versus La Motta
","""You are planning on embarrassing yourself, Kid. A great performer knows when to leave the stage.""<br/><br/>It's ironic that the characters Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone play in this film resemble pretty much their current careers. Both had a great run in the 80's, but they have made some poor career choices over the past decade (with the exception of De Niro's supporting roles in David O. Russell's movies), and this was another painful choice they made. I feel sorry for young audiences that never got to experience these two great actors in the peek of their careers, Robert De Niro's work with Scorsese being the true definition of greatness. It's rather unfortunate that their most iconic characters, Stallone as Rocky and De Niro as La Motta, are the actual ones that are being made fun of here. If made with grace I wouldn't have a problem with it, but there is no substance to this film and everything felt pointless. They banked the entire success of the film on marketing it solely on these legendary characters, but they didn't give it any substance. Grudge Match is lazy film making at its fullest and the talented cast is completely misused.<br/><br/>The premise of this film is pretty simple as it follows the general conventions of most sport comedies. A huge boxing rivalry took place during the 80's involving two fighters that hated each other. The first time these two men were in the ring together the victory went to Billy ""The Kid"" (Robert De Niro) after a long hard battle, but the rematch was easily won by Razor Sharp (Sylvester Stallone). The fans along with The Kid demanded one final fight, but Razor decided to quit boxing after his girlfriend Sally (Kim Basinger) had an affair with Billy that left her pregnant. Now 30 years later after a youtube video of a grudge between the two retired boxers goes viral, a promoter named Dante Slate (Kevin Hart) convinces the two to give the fans what they want. Razor finally accepts because he needs the money to help his trainer, Lightning (Alan Arkin), who in exchange also promises to train him for the fight. The Kid on the other hand decides to train with his son, B.J. (Jon Bernthal), who he just met. Sally also shows up asking Razor to forgive her for what she did. The stage is finally set for the grand finale between these two aging boxers.<br/><br/>There were very few genuinely funny moments in Grudge Match, but I wouldn't blame the performances. I still consider De Niro and Stallone to be great actors, it's just the material they choose to work with what I have a problem with. Director, Peter Segal, who is known mostly for his collaborations with Adam Sandler, doesn't seem to add anything to this film other than trying to capitalize on the two iconic films I've mentioned. The buildup for the final fight doesn't work either and the dull jokes don't help the pacing of the film either. Arkin and Hart have some funny lines, but they are just too spread out and way to few for such an overlong film. The film targets a senior audience, but I don't think they will be too pleased to see their beloved iconic films treated like this in such a poorly written screenplay."
"ricodigiorgio","6","0","1","16 February 2014"," Knockout ""Grudge Match""
","Now, before I start, I will admit I'm a little biased. I love Stallone, and I love De Niro. And I love boxing movies (Rocky, Cinderella Man, The Fighter, and of course Raging Bull). But I can totally admit that Sly and Bobby have made some bad films in their careers (Avenging Angelo and Little Fockers leap to mind). But what actor hasn't? Moving on. 30 years ago, ""Razor"" (Sly) and ""Kid"" (Bobby) are Light Heavyweights who each won a match against one another, but by the 3rd match (and tie breaker), Razor decides to retire. No explanation is given, and thus, the ""Grudge"" is born. Both men move on, with lackluster jobs. Kevin Hart comes along as a Junior fight promoter, and hires both fighters to provide motion capture for a video game. As the two fighters meet face to face, a fight ensues and it become viral, with the world wanting a rematch. To train Sly, comes the brilliant and hilarious Alan Arkin. Full of one-liners, Arkin comes off as a sweeter Mickey, but still just as tough. Sorta like... honey sprinkled on vinegar. Fan of Walking Dead? Then behold as Jon Bernthal shows up as Kid's son who never knew who is real father was. And the mom's Kim Basinger, whom I felt was pretty miscast. She's an old flame of both men, and that's where the Grudge kinda started. There's other reasons, but I'll let you see it. Loads of references of Rocky and Raging Bull are peppered around the film, and as a fan I was looking for them. They never became too much, or obvious. Some were actually pretty subtle. Now, this isn't a film that's supposed to be about the cast's acting (since they put Kevin Hart in the flick, that should be obvious). The film on paper sounds like a direct to DVD sorta film. ""Rocky VS Raging Bull"". Sly and Bobby have fun. And that's the point. This isn't Rocky, or the Fighter, or even Cinderella Man. This IS ""Rocky Balboa VS. Jake LaMotta"". The fact that both men (especially DeNiro) got into the best shape that they could get at their age is great. And all for a possible direct to DVD release. Made me think they're still being serious, even while having fun.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved the film. Yes, it has it's faults. Yes, the plot comes off as a bit much, for a simple boxing film. Yes, Kim Basinger offers nothing in the film (and I guess Talia Shire was too obvious. Cathy Moriarty would've been a nice touch). And Yes, it took FOREVER for the match to finally start. But damn, was it worth it. I was jabbing and cheering on two of my heroes, not really caring who won. And you know who won? Me. I won a good 'ol time. ***."
"s_campanale","7","0","1","29 January 2014"," Who would win a fight between Rocky Balboa and Jake La Motta? ...This film won't answer that but you will get a warm 80's style feel good movie
","30 years ago, rival heavyweights Kid McDonaugh and Henry Razor Sharp were bitter rivals, each winning a match. But the great rematch never happened because Sally Rose, Sharp's great love punished his obsession by sleeping with his greatest enemy, giving birth to an illegitimate son which he is kept from. Now, after a punch up between the rivals at a video game motion capture goes horribly wrong, all the world wants a rematch. It means getting back into shape, and facing some old demons which must be put finally to rest if they are to ever find peace.<br/><br/>Yes, this is one of those films where you know exactly what is going to happen and how the moment it begins. Yes, it is rather silly and the two big stars are laughing at their own proud filmographies. No, it has no real reason to exist and no, you won't remember it the day after you saw it. It is lightweight fluff, but the question is, is it well made and entertaining fluff?<br/><br/>As befits a film starring three stars of the 80's, it has a very Eighties feel to it. The humour is quite tame and respectful and it is unashamedly sentimental and manipulative ( you can predict to a nanosecond when the piano and strings are going to come in) but always keeps on the right side of maudlin and vomit inducing saccharine. There is humour, most of it the obvious "" old guys can't do it so well anymore kind"" and easy shots on their former roles as Rocky and LA Motta. Of course after some long overdue training the old guys CAN do it, and better than the youngsters like the arrogant MMA fighter they knock out, or L L Cool J who gets floored in his own gym. However, for the most part its a straight drama (80's style) with obstacles and tests put in the returning champions way like arena challenges from The Hunger Games. Kid has to belatedly get to know the estranged son he had with Sally back in the day ( and his annoyingly cute 8 yr old grandson) while Sharp has to finally face his demons and rekindle his suspended relationship with the now handily widowed Sally, and accept his share of the blame for her vengeful wandering. Then there's Kid's wandering ways and Sharp's partial blindness to contend with too. Naturally the fight goes ahead, though anyone expecting fireworks will be disappointed. This looks exactly like two pensioners slugging it out in boxer shorts, which is as slow, clumsy and frankly disturbing as you would imagine. Of course, having established both the crusties as good guys, you watch wondering how they will deliver the inevitable happy ending for both despite the fact that one has to win and one lose.<br/><br/>Acting wise, everyone does their part well. Stallone naturally plays a riff on Rocky, solid blue collar dignity and humble reserve while De Niro is in sleazy drunken womaniser thug LA Motta mode. Basinger, who unlike the others has been notably absent from the big screen, gives Sally a quiet nobility and maturity, and makes us care about her return to Sharp's life and future happiness. Jon Bernthal is equally noble and dignified as Kid's illegitimate son, a sort of better version of his father with all the graces and none of the vices. Alan Larkin, who thank God is still brightening up movies in his dotage, is on sharp wisecracking form as a sort of Mickey mixed with a Borscht-belt comedian, while Kevin Hart, the youngster of the line up, does his usual screechy ghetto wiseass routine as the son of the crooked promoter who engineers the rematch.<br/><br/>Don't except a laugh out loud comedy fest nor a hilarious meta satire, nor a tough boxing movie. It's a warm and fuzzy old school feel good pic, and if that's what you're after the this one should please."

","I'm never bothered about people saying, ""Sly and DeNiro gotta eat"" or ""why the hell is DeNiro making this type of movie"" or ""Its sad to see these hero's sink so low"". I ignore that sort of talk. Sly and DeNiro have made iconic movies by great directors. They also make fun movies and a lot of them are great fun, both can do comedy well in their own way even if sometimes they send themselves up, they have the charm and charisma to do so. So no matter if a film is good, bad or ugly, most of the time they got the charisma to pull the movie through. And in case you didn't know, they have been making light-hearted films from day one. <br/><br/>And once again their charisma shines through in this film. This is an easy going feel good movie with plenty of laughs and an entertaining build up to the climatic showdown but what really works here is the chemistry between Deniro and Sly and so by the time it gets to the ring, you really care about both of them.<br/><br/>The last time I saw a film with Sly and DeNiro together was in Copland and while they didn't share a helluva a lot of screen time together in that movie, when they did they sparked. And they spark here too. <br/><br/>The film storyline is no great shakes and at times it does pull the obvious ""too old for this"" joke a few too many times but still, there is a fun sincerity to it and Alan Arkin also adds a few chuckles as ""damn is he still alive?"" trainer.<br/><br/>Kim Basinger plays the grandmother love interest...and she looks lovely at 61, in fact more than lovely! Nice to see her looking ""naturally"" good on screen. Go granny! Of course there isn't much for her to do...this is the Sly and DeNiro show.<br/><br/>DeNiro is awesome, he's somewhat of a scoundrel, he's likable and funny but you also know he needs a big punch in the face (tiny echoes of Raging bull...very tiny OK, this ain't that sort of film). As for Sly, he's the same old Rocky Balboa personality. A simple man, with no great ambition, just rolls through life as a construction worker and murmur his way in the way that only slurry Sly can do. Its a perfect clash of personalities and that's where all the fun is in this movie.<br/><br/>There are little side plots to pad out the drama which gives the two ageing boxers more incentive to kill each other. Unfortunately, there are also a lot of flat jokes. No escaping that. I don't know who the actor playing the promoter is but he strikes me as someone trying to bring back Chris Tucker style of comedy to the screen...not a good idea. Chris Tucker came and gone for a good reason. Making fun of being black and short is also a little risqué in this day and age but it seems to have brought a chuckle from the audience in my screening (all 6 of them).<br/><br/>As for the training and boxing match itself...for me, it was actually worth the wait. Of course don't expect great things from these pensioners and sure, the film editing cheats more than Lance Armstrong to make them look fast. It is obvious how slow Sly punches are but I tell you, they both looked great fighting each other. Raging Bull and Rocky, old but in decent enough shape to make the fight convincing and painful! DeNiro was fighting in the same style as he did in Raging Bull, that cowering bore into the opponent style...there is a geeky delight to be had in that. As for Sly, well I actually like his body shape more here than in the Expendable movies. He looks more ""natural"". In the Expendables, he looks like he was pumping some of that Bane juice into his veins. Here he looks natural, you don't see those veins pumping out too much and I like that.<br/><br/>If you are a hardcore Sly or DeNiro fan and hate to see these guys doing light comedy and getting old then stay away and watch your steel book remastered blurays of their classics.<br/><br/>But if you love these guys to enjoy every little ounce of what's left in them to deliver...and they do give it all they got in personality and physicality, then honour their ageing efforts and have a lightweight rumble with them.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Oh and stay for the early part of the credits, there is a hilarious sketch...in fact the funniest bit in the whole film. Totally surprising and well executed."

","This sporty, entertaining yet warm film from Peter Segal, is a great outing with the two legends Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro which scores with its original screenplay by Tim Kelleher, Rodney Rothman and Doug Ellin, which shows the best of the rivalry and the punches within the film's developmental graph, the supporting cast (Kevin Hart, Alan Arkin, Kim Basinger , Jon Bernthal and others) that are warm and humane, adding great support to the protagonists. Then last but not the least, comes the riveting and killer performance by Sylvester and De Niro whose chemistry and charisma are actually the shining points of the film, making it worth a watch. The film becomes draggy due to its emotional overdose in between and even the editing lacks the slickness, especially in the pre-climax portion, but rest of all, it's a perfect weekend getaway for Hollywood lovers for sure! My rating would be: 4/5﻿"

","To me, 6/10 = pretty good.<br/><br/>I had thought originally that the commercials were duping me into expecting Rocky vs Lamotta but that the actual film would be more unique than that. Alas, it really was essentially Rocky vs Lamotta... well, ""Lamotta Light"".<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Grudge Match"" was certainly entertaining, never dull, and it was kind of fun to see these two famous boxing movie characters go head-to-head. Stallone seemed like he was less into it than Diniro, who really amped up his performance for comedic effect; however, I couldn't get past the way it felt like it relied on movie clichés to reel the audience emotions.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend it for light meaningless entertainment."

","I don't know if i should take this film seriously or laugh because this certainly is one film that has the both the serious tone & makes you laugh with the quick one-liner p**s taking banter which really dose make you laugh.This film is like watching rocky vs raging bull which is good for boxing film fan as this film is pretty realistic it hold no punches in the ring. Even tho Stallone & Robert de niro are looking there age now they have proved no matter how old you are they ca still go a few round in the boxing ring.What funny with these two ageing boxing is when they start throwing insult at each other it start in a big fight it like watch a campus fight with two students, you get what i mean when a fight breaks out the camera come out it go on you tube & through the film its mostly like this which is seriously funny with Kevin Hart it just makes it even more funnier. The same goes for a funny Alan Arkin as Stallone's trainer who also plays the same type of character that he always does. So there's nothing truly unique about the movie, but it doesn't take itself too seriously and that's kind of a good thing. It focuses on the funny for the most part, but also adds some depth to the characters when it shows the struggles they're having in their personal lives. A lot of people will probably say this film is going to be a bad but its surprisingly a great film to watch it has the funny moment as a well balance serious tone that make this a pretty well made film that's well written congrats to the Director: Peter Segal for making a good film.This is a worth while film to watch you wont be disappointed if your a Niro or Stallone fan because this is a great afternoon film."
