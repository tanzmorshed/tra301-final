","Many people say the cried at the end of this movie... Huh! Knowing the plot already, I (a grown up man) can barely hold my tears from the very beginning whenever I watch it. Much more than just a ""cute and sad fairy tale"", this movie is a true piece of art. This is one of those rarest cases when a bunch of talented and truly, but truly dedicated people set out to create something beautiful, some chemistry occurs and ... a miracle happens. Fortunately for all of us, this miracle immortalized on film.<br/><br/>Throughout the human history, the wisdom of generation was conveyed through fairy tales. This tale is no exception. This story, told in magic simplicity, actually has some deep philosophical meanings. While mercilessly debunking the true nature of human beings, this tragic story really tears your heart, and yet it fills it with hope. That is the true and, perhaps, the only purpose of art, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Why do we need music, painting, theatre, poetry? Is there a real excuse for their existence? To me, the only purpose, the only excuse is to help people go on, to give them hope. And it's well worth it!<br/><br/>To sum up, easily Tim Burton's best, this film is a masterpiece, my favorite American movie, and probably one of the best movies of all times. 10/10"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","255","287","18 November 2003"," A dark fairy tale about a man who only wanted to fit in
","I have watched Edward Scissorhands ever since I was a little girl, this movie has always held a very special place in my heart. I think because I could relate to Edward no, I don't have scissors for hands, but what I mean is that this is a fairytale story, but this is a simple story of a man who just wants to fit into a society of ""norms"". This is completely Tim Burton's creation and story, he's a very criticized director, he's either loved or hated. Some consider his stories to be too dark and strange, but when you get inside his head, you realize this is a man who is pure genius. He thinks completely outside the box and doesn't just resort to what Hollywood wants, he knows his audience and doesn't insult their intelligence, he brings us a charming story about Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>An elderly woman tells a story to her granddaughter of a man with scissors for hands named Edward, the creation of an inventor. He raised Edward as his son and tutored him in various subjects, but died while in the act of offering a pair of hands to Edward. Many years later, local Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs, after failing to make profits in her suburban neighborhood, visits a Gothic mansion on a hill. There, she finds Edward, and convinces him to have her take him in. Edward befriends Peg's young son, Kevin and her teenage daughter Kim. Peg's neighbors become curious and thrilled at Edward's masterful skills at hedge clipping and haircutting. However Kim's jock boyfriend Jim dislikes Edward immediately. Edward's innocence becomes an easy target for everyone to take advantage of him as often as they can. Wither it's destroying his reputation or putting him in danger, Edward was never prepared for this harsh world when he was given the kindest heart.<br/><br/>From the acting, Johnny Depp's first real leading role in a movie, he's so young and so incredibly talented. He plays Edward with perfect sympathy not over or under acting it, to be honest I'm a little surprised he wasn't nominated for an Oscar, but it's such a bizarre role, I think it was very over looked. He makes Edward into a charming beautiful character that you fall in love with. Dianne Wiest, one of my favorite actress as the Avon lady, Peg, who takes Edward home with her, the reason I love her so much is she brings so much class into whatever role she is playing. She seems like the most lovely woman you could meet and makes Peg into a delightful woman who just wanted to help this man and didn't realize the world she brought him into. Winona Ryder, who was dating Depp at the time, had great chemistry and was absolutely beautiful. To the sets, which this world was just bizarre and stands out against so many other movies, like a strange Leave it to Beaver nightmare, all the houses in the suburbia are different pastel colors to this one hill with a dark castle. To the outstanding make up effects, can only imagine the pain it took to get in and out of that costume for Edward. Edward Scissorhands is truly a masterpiece and in my opinion will always remain a treasured classic, because all in all this is one of the most beautiful movies of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Monica4937","9","155","173","8 February 2004"," Beautiful employment of color, sympathy and human nature
","Tim Burton should have won an academy award for this film. It is truelly a masterpiece. Never have I felt more sympathetic for a character before in my life. Edward Scissorhands...a creation...an unfinished product made by an inventor, his father. When his ""father"" dies he is left alone in the mansion to fend for himself and discover things on his own without any guidance. Next an avon lady comes in and detaches him from his isolation and throws him into a society where everything is pastel, everything is precise and everyone is stiff. Edward Scissorhands gets thrown into a world comPLETELY unlike the one he was used to. Now he is the outsider.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp should have also won an Academy Award for his performance in this film. Although he had very few lines in this film, less than 100, his facial expressions and actions spoke loudly. Every detail he gave his character was so perfect and precise. When Edward examines the water bed, and takes his first sip of (what I'm guessing is) scotch, or in the beginning when he takes his first ride ever in a car into town. Just the look on his face when he finally gets to see what the outside world looks like was pure genius.<br/><br/>I hold this movie very deeply to my heart. In my opinion it encompasses every human emotion and nature. When Edward first arrives the locals accepted him and he became a famed hair/bush stylist. In the end they turn on him and see him for what he looks like, a monster. My rating for this film: 10/10"
"MR_Heraclius","10","38","40","22 February 2020"," One of the greatest fable of the 90s.
","Tim Burton all time favorite artist of all time. Not just one of the greatest directors of all time, not just one of the greatest imaginative writers of all time, not just versatile camera works ever put to film, but a versatile genius of art. That's how I think of Tim Burton. Edward Scissorhands is his personal film that he ever put to film by his heart. When I saw this film for the first time, my heart burst of love. I was always in love with his films, I don't start loving Batman because of him, nightmare before Christmas is my all-time favorite holiday film, Ed wood, Big fish, big eyes, Beetlejuice, Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, all of them. But only one that is true to his heart and that is Edward Scissorhands. Edward Scissorhands is a versatile work of art ever put film, with darkness and colors combined together to make into a perfect rainbow is Edward Scissorhands. As for me this film is a work of art and yet one of my favorite films of all time. This prestige film is my childhood, my everything. As for Tim Burton, is everything you need to know about his charismatic of film. Grade A perfect 10"
"Dark Eye","10","138","156","7 December 1999"," A Story Told In Beautiful Simplicity
","Edward Scissorhands is really an amazing movie.  The plethora of lush cinematography, beautiful musical score, and great characters are extremely entertaining.  The storyline is simple yet very moving.  I still get misty-eyed at the end, even though I watched it many times already.  The musical scores by the amazing Danny Elfman in Edward Scissorhands are one of his best work.  It is achingly beautiful.  Everytime Tim Burton and Danny Elfman worked together in a movie, magic happens.  Burton's gothic style and Elfman's halloween-like scores always blends perfectly.<br/><br/>The story surrounds an unfinished creation named Edward, played brilliantly by Johnny Depp.  The talented actor managed to make Edward a simple being that radiates vulnerability as well as restrained passion suggesting the real, imperfect humanity within.  Edward's intimidating scissorhands and strange black & white physical appearance looked out of place amongst the pastel-colored suburban surroundings.  He is unique; we both laugh and sympathize when we see Edward having a hard time trying to eat a single green pea with his scissorhands, but then we become slack-jawed to see that his expression of artistry in sculpting are effortless, masterful, imaginative, and passionate.<br/><br/>The movie ends rather sadly, yet beautifully at the same time.  The tragic incident at the end over Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) is a single act of both unvented frustrations over the injustices done by Jim, as well as to protect Kim Boggs (Winona Ryder), the love of his life.  This shows that although uncompleted, the fearsome scissorhands merely masks our eyes to his feelings, conflicts, and the imperfections of that of a real human being. His body is not completed, but his heart is."
"llltdesq","10","278","325","31 October 2000"," If Tim Burton never did anything else, this film would be enough to call his life worthwhile
","There is absolutely no way I can view this film in even a remotely objective manner, so I won't even try.  Like eveything I've seen by Tim Burton, this film is at one and the same time, warm and frightening, tender and heart-wrenchingly evil, uplifting and dark.  The good and bad in humanity are shown in stark relief quite clearly for everyone to see.  But in the final analysis, the most important message the film has to offer is this: Love truly does make the world go 'round and redemption and just living to see another day is a kind of victory.  There will always be bullies, just as there will always be kind souls who actively try to make things better (and who sometimes make things worse through their efforts).  The most important thing is to be true to yourself, treat others as you wish to be treated and that if the bad guys win, we all lose-including the bad guys.  Excellent cast, fine script and just overall a worthy effort not to be missed.  One of Vincent Price's last performances, if not the last.  I love this film!  Most highly recommended."
"dbdumonteil","9","80","91","1 February 2003"," the rise and fall of Edward Scissorhands and the inhabitants of a small town
","You could have thought that Tim Burton would rest on his laurels, following ""Batman""'s huge commercial success. Well, not at all. ""Edward Scissorhands"" appears like a more serious, more mature and even touching movie. This modern fairy tale links skilfully elements from the basic fairy tale (the castle) and elements from the social life (Peg's job as representative for a cosmetics firm) and it can be divided into two parts: the first one that epitomizes Edward's rise: thanks to his scissorhands that give him gifts as a hairdresser and a gardener, he becomes the idol of the town. The second one that shows Edward's fall, following a burglary in which he was inconveniently involved in, he becomes the town's bête noire (and the movie becomes painful) Tim Burton tells this modern fairy tale by introducing a lot of poetry, and during his movie, he tries to create an aesthetic beauty and he succeeds in, especially with the gardens of the castle, Edward's sculptures and Edward himself is good-looking in spite of his scissorhands. But ""Edward Scissorhands"" is also a movie of contrasts. There's an obvious contrast between the brightly coloured town and the dark rooms of the castle but also one between the bright town and its inhabitants who are scornful or mocking. Besides, they're the object of a satire of the actual society and Burton tries to underline its weaknesses. Of course, the inhabitants appreciate Edward but only for his gifts. Otherwise, they're mistrustful towards him because, in their eyes, he's different and eccentric (you could be one of the inhabitants!) and the single mistake (the burglary) can lead to unexpected consequences... Whereas Johnny Depp, he's simply extraordinary and finds here, one of his best roles. He provides to his character, a lot of tenderness, affection and above all, a deep sensitivity. At last, Tim Burton knew skilfully how to blend several cinematographic styles in just one film. In ""Edward Scissorhands"", you find everything: comedy, fantastic, horror and drama. Moreover, Danny Elfman's gothic music is widely gorgeous to create an intense emotion. It's sometimes difficult to hold his tears... All in all, a movie which is both tender, cruel and Tim Burton's best movie after ""Ed Wood""."

","BIG SPOILERS.<br/><br/>""Give it to my loved ones?"" - Edward Scissorhands. <br/><br/>Created by an inventor who dies before finishing his creation, and so leaving him with razor-sharp shears as hands - Edward Scissorhands (JOHNNY DEPP) isn't like other people. <br/><br/>When kindly Avon lady Peg Boggs (DIANE WIEST) finds him one day, hidden away in a Gothic mansion on top of a hill, she takes him under her wing and decides to take him back to the suburbs to live with her. <br/><br/>When we see Edward in this pastel paradise for the first time, it is apparent that he doesn't belong: his wild, dark and frightening appearance contrasting against the immaculate, sweetly colored people and homes of the suburbs. It's an ironic contrast too, as both of these 'worlds' reflect feelings and thoughts that should not associated with them - as Edward is a good-hearted person, whereas the people of the suburbs are unkind and intolerant.<br/><br/>When Edward arrives there he is welcomed and loved, due to the way in which he can sculpt hedges, dogs and hair into amazing works of art. But eventually, due to human trickery and greed, and Edward's want of acceptance and love, Edward is painted by the townspeople as a monster when he is told to rob a house by the boyfriend of Peg's daughter, Kim (WINONA RYDER), and he is ostracized by the town. <br/><br/>Throughout the course of the movie, Edward falls in love with Kim. Originally treating him as an outcast, she falls in love with him too, realizing what a kind and remarkable being he is. In the end, she is the only one who accepts him, when the entire town turns against him. Kim's boyfriend, Jim, enraged by jealousy of Edward, tries to kill him. In defense of Kim and himself, Edward plunges his scissor-hands into Jim's chest and kills him. Realising both that by what he has done they can never see each other again for his safety they share a final kiss and part ways, Edward remaining in his mansion and Kim returning to the shocked town below. The ending of this movie is one of the most wonderful I've seen. Poignant and bittersweet, it is hard to forget quickly.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is outstanding as Edward Scissorhands, showing a kind of curious and bemused innocence within in the character, but at the same time a restrained passion. Every expression on his face is full of raw emotion: every cautious smile, and every time of hurt and confusion. Johhny Depp is Edward Scissorhands. <br/><br/>This is a wonderful fable from the brilliant imagination of Tim Burton. It's a twisted and sophisticated Gothic fairytale with a dose of comedy, and a good helping of morality, too. While a family movie, it's not really for kids - some things in there even shocked me.<br/><br/>This movie is amazing, and I was entranced by it the very first time I watched it. I'm not usually one for ridiculous hyperbole about movies, but there is very little wrong with this one. I love this movie. <br/><br/>10/10"
"MovieAddict2016","7","129","158","21 October 2004"," Burton's Best -- and Most Emotionally Touching.
","Tim Burton is a brilliant visual director but with Edward Scissorhands he managed to combine these talents with pure, classic storytelling  Scissorhands is his best overall film, abandoning the slight characterizations and special effects-driven spectacle of the (albeit hugely enjoyable) Batman and serving up a convincingly detailed left-of-center fairytale romance.<br/><br/>The story is fairly basic, being the standard Frankenstein-esque tale of alienation and the empowerment of love. Edward (Johnny Depp) is a lonely man with scissors for hands, crafted by an eccentric inventor (magnificently played by Vincent Price in flashbacks) prior to his death. After Edward witnesses the death of his creator he stays locked away inside his mansion all day, which is located atop the otherwise cheerfully picture-perfect local neighborhood community.<br/><br/>Then one day a nosy neighbor decides to investigate, and ends up bringing Edward to reality. He falls in love with a local girl (Winona Ryder), and is witness first-hand to the joys of life, until accidentally injuring a young boy and becoming the enemy of the overzealous town. Soon everyone is out to get him for no good reason  the climax is beautifully done and, because Burton has allowed his characters to expand so much, it's also very touching.<br/><br/>The movie is decidedly odd but in a good way  the only problem is that it is occasionally quite thin when it comes to actual depth. Burton's never been as good at telling believable stories as he has mythical, exciting fables (see Sleepy Hollow for a similar example). Even Burton's Big Fish  arguably his most story-oriented film of his career  was somewhat shady. The mix of screwball dark comedy, horror, drama, romance and elements and familiar happenings of other genres results in a very different combination. You can literally ""feel"" the vibe of this picture, its heart pulsing black blood.<br/><br/>The movie was a childhood project of Burton, who drew sketches of Edward as a boy and used to alienate himself from his hostile surroundings by taking refuge in fictional stories involving the scissor-handed hero. As a result Burton's true affinity for the subject is evident  it's clear that he takes this entire project very seriously.<br/><br/>The acting is marvelous  Depp's performance is one of his finest and, arguably, one of the most convincing and fun of all-time. Depp has formed a Scorsese/De Niro-like companionship with Burton over the years, teaming up for various pictures (including Sleepy Hollow and the upcoming Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). He's always had fun relishing his over-the-top and absurdly dark roles, such as Ichabod Crane in particular. In Scissorhands he gives the equivalent of a Travis Bickle  a man who feels shunned by society, only to open his heart and have it feel crushed again. This is possibly one of the reasons the film is able to affect its audience so well to this very day. The tale does not grow old because the values are timeless.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands, despite its occasional flaws, finally gave Burton the chance to unleash his talents as a visual filmmaker along with a pretty solid story mold  the result being a sublimely dark rom-com-drama that never conforms to the typical genre clichés and becomes quite a unique film in its own little world.<br/><br/>4.5/5"
"mixedvixen77","10","41","48","1 April 2006"," Enchanting!
","I would have to say that Edward Scissorhands is by far one of the best films done by Tim Burton. It is a very beautiful story. They couldn't have chosen a better cast for this movie. Johnny Depp is phenomenal as Edward. He brings the characters in his movies to life so well that it is hard to believe that he is acting. It seems as if when he learns about the movie and goes over the scripts that he transforms in the character. This film is definitely one of them. This movie is nothing short of enchanting. This movie was the reason that I fell in love with Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. If you like movies that leave you bug eyed, make you think, and leave you wanting more then this is the film for you. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good fairy tale."
"joeestlinbm","10","109","138","18 February 2005"," As good as any movie ever made
","This movie impressed me to such an extent, that I had trouble sleeping for the first few nights after I saw it, not because he scared me. I just kept thinking about this guy who had scissors for hands, and was so unfamiliar with the world,<br/><br/>He had a wonderful talent for making things with his unique hands, but he was still confused about the way the world worked.<br/><br/>He finally wound up back where he began, which in a macabre sort of way was where he belonged, because his background just wouldn't let him fit into a so called normal world.<br/><br/>The ending was very sad. I'm a relative old man, and it made me cry. Watch it!! It's probably the best movie you'll ever see."
"BaronBl00d","Null","78","97","25 July 2000"," Hauntingly Poetic
","I really cannot add too much more to the wealth of praise directed toward this film...much of it very deserved.  Tim Burton really shows us his ability to transcend mere comedic situations(Pee Wee and Beetlejuice) and tell a story of humour love, pity, conformity, and so on in an eerie and entertaining way.  The way this film is constructed is amazing...the sets are wonderful as they depict something so real and yet so far away.  Burton takes us into a kind of fairy land of Suburbia...with a haunting, empty castle at the end of the block that just happens to house a man with scissors for hands.  The music in this film helps create a great deal of atmosphere and really lends to character development;  I particularly enjoyed his use of the music of Tom Jones.  The acting in the film is superb on all accounts.  Burton got a subtle and effective performance from Johhny Depp, whose talents cease to amaze me.  A nice Burton touch was the use of Vincent Price in one of his final roles.  Although only in three scenes, seeing Vincent again was a real joy."
"Apollo89","10","48","60","2 June 2005"," A Truly Magical Movie For All Ages, Burton's Finest
","This is one of Tim Burton's most powerful movies. Though the title-character seems strange he represents the goodness in the world and what can happen when society just doesn't accept difference. The Gothic look of the castle, combined with the glorious colour of suburbia creates a strong contrast and shows things may not be as they seem. Edward comes from the dark and scary castle but is gentle, kind and loving, the place he wants to be accepted into is the colourful suburbia, which is backstabbing, vicious and evil. This story shows the betrayal of a person who desperately wants to help and to love but does not realise he is being used. The only people that seem to understand him are the wonderful Peg Boggs (played brilliantly by Dianne Wiest) and the beautiful Kim (played superbly by Winona Ryder). Tim Burton has created yet another beautiful fairy tale to captivate adults and children alike. Johnny Depp shows his great talent as an actor and Danny Elfman's music for the movie is some of the most beautiful you're ever likely to hear. A great movie for Christmas and all year round, and while it is a classic story it also deals with the prejudices of society, friendship, family and love and I advise anyone who hasn't seen it to see it, it is an experience well worth it and a movie you'll never forget."
"dave_psyattica","10","31","38","16 December 2004"," An emotional charismatic and off the wall Dramatic Movie!
","This film hit me with two main feelings. One, of an overwhelming feeling of sadness for Edward as his position is one that is just impossible to bear. To know that you are in love with a person to that degree and finding out they love you in the same way but knowing that you cant give that person what they seek, because of your hands. This was summed up in the scene where Kim asks Edward to hold her, but he just says, 'I can't'. Packed with emotion this film got to me with the acting particularly of Johnny Depp and the music. Very Cleverly written and accented, this added to the movie greatly. 10-10, this is a film i'm gonna keep for a long time, and most importantly, watch again! Classic!!"
"J_DXXXXX","10","28","37","9 March 2005"," A must-see movie that you must see over and over again!
","Edward Scissorhands is heart-warming, poetic, tragic, and comedic. An all-in-one movie. The story about a half-made man named Edward, who has the misfortune of having scissors for hands, (Johnny Depp) is one of those rare creatures who's soul is bigger than his heart. His outward appearance (the black and white face, the hands) is out of place in the colorful suburban neighborhood he was brought into, but so is his innocence, vulnerability, and compassion. Depp's performance as Edward is one of his most original yet! <br/><br/>It's not just the character, its the background of the movie that makes it good also. THe underscore is haunting, and beautiful, it can alone bring tears to your eyes. The makeup is outstanding, and the way the camera captures the character's emotion and state of being is just breathtaking. And of course, without the help of Tim Burton's Gothic style, the movie wouldn't have the same effect.<br/><br/>Kim Boggs (Winona Ryder) falls in love with this man, and their tragic romeo and juliet based romance makes the audience long for them to be together. You hate Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) for breaking them apart, and the rest of the community for that matter! All in all, the mixture of music, talent, and story plot make the movie a must-see that you must see over and over again! I give it a 9 out of 10"
"TheJewishMonkey","10","47","68","12 May 2005"," Best Movie of all time
","This is a beautiful movie, and most people I know have never seen it. If you haven't, Make sure to see it! The ending is really sad and beautiful, and it leaves you with a happy/sad feeling. Also, the music just grabs you. There is a boy's choir that sings throughout the movie, and they just capture the emotion you are trying to let out, but don't know how. You should really see it, if you've never have. The movie 'Simon Birch' reminds me a bit of this 'Edward'. This is the perfect casting. Johnny Depp just seems so innocent, and untouched, and Winona Ryder is a snobby little girl who learns to look beyond a handsome face. I've never seen such a heartwarming movie- I don't think I ever will."
"beckyandcutie","10","11","15","7 November 2005"," The Best Movie Ever in History
","When I first watched Edward Scissorhands, my favorite movie of all time, I was 13, and the only reason I saw it was because I was an avid Johnny Depp fan, loving his looks and acting abilities. When I saw Edward Scissorhands, I was deeply moved. I saw Edward as a sweet, caring man, a special individual, a type of person I have only seen once. At the end of the movie, I had come to love Edward, and valued him as an unforgettable movie character. At the end, I cried so hard. I was sobbing. It was horrible, yet sad, happy and beautiful all at the same time. Now every time I watch, I swear, I always cry. I'm just a romantic, sensitive 14 year old. There are so many reasons though why this is my favorite movie. The least important one is that is has beautiful scenery. The pastel neighborhood looked like Easter colored candies. The house where Edward lives is hauntingly beautiful, with the black, decaying house, yet the radiant garden of sculptured bushes and beds of flowers spread over the grounds. The scene with the Snow Angel. Oh. My. Goodness. That scene took my breath away. It was angelic, exquisite, magnificent poetry that captured the innocence of Edward, and the beauty and creativity he possesses. The next one is the wonderful job of the cast, crew, music and director. I have to say that Tim Burton is my all time favorite director, this was the piece that moved me the most. It is his greatest work, the way he told the story. The cute beginning with the grandmother and her granddaughter, the way he introduced the audience to Edward, the way he tells the story, throwing in the quirks and jokes without being dirty or crude like so many directors with no talent today. The way he told the ending, the way he made us say, "" Oh, that was so sad!!"" The next reason is probably a little foolish, but . . . this was the very first movie to make me cry, I mean sob. Until then, at a sentimental part in a show, play, movie or song, I was neutral, showing no emotion. Now tears trickle down my cheeks when I hear Puff the Magic Dragon. The most important reason is this; this movie made me appreciate the beauty, kindness and sensitivity of the human heart, those qualities that all humans possess, but pretty much never reveal. More critical than that is it showed me the importance of love. The ending, really made me realize that, and not blush about it. Today I am one of the very few youth who realize the power of love, compassion and kindness, the beauty of the heart. Most people say that Edward was ""trying to fit in."" Personally, I think it is something else. I think he was looking for the feeling of being loved, of knowing that someone cared about him, of knowing that if he were alive, someone would care. In reality, is that not what we all want, maybe deep down? We all want to know that someone cares for us, more than anything. That someone would care if we were hurt, lonely, sad, happy, angry or whatever. In the end, I cannot really fully explain why Edward Scissorhands is the epitome of film. I do know it's beautiful, gorgeous, touching, cinematic poetry. Edward Scissorhands is not only great entertainment, but it is a flawless piece of sentimental art that every person should appreciate. Edward was a sweet, caring person with a heart of gold, something so rare that of all the people I know, there's only one person who is really comparable to him. That's sad, really. All I can say as I begin to end this review is that Edward Scissorhands is probably the best cinema that has ever been created, the best story that fully captures the depths of the heart, touches you and makes you sad and happy at the same time. If you haven't seen it, you should. I would give this movie infinity/10, but it wasn't an option. Edward Scissorhands is cinematic gold."
"zurnd","10","7","9","15 June 2013"," Burton's Magnum Opus
","Here we go, Edward Scissorhands. Tim Burton himself has gone on record saying that this is the work he is most proud of, for it captures the very nature of what his films are all about. Whatever his perspective is on the film, this masterpiece is certainly my favorite of his filmography and for various reasons. For one, it was the first collaboration between Burton and Johnny Depp, and this relationship still lasts to this very day. Depp has been the main player in many of Burton's flicks and it's hard to imagine some of the movies without him. Second, it marked the swan song for one of my all time favorite actors, the master of macabre Vincent Price, who Tim Burton had idolized since youth. He even made a short film about Vincent Price in 1982, fittingly entitled Vincent. Third, the film hearkens back to the 1931 Frankenstein film and makes the mad scientist's creation sympathetic and pitiful. Fourth, the main character of Edward is such a whacky yet contemporary character that I can't help but relate to him at times. Then again, I think we can all relate to Edward Scissorhands from time to time.<br/><br/>The film constantly shifts atmospheres, but it works greatly in this flick. One minute, it can be a dark, Gothic horror related atmosphere, the next, it's the bright, sunny and upbeat suburban neighborhood. The film also has one of the all time greatest film scores, performed brilliantly by Danny Elfman, who's Ice Dance score fills me with butterflies every time I set my ears to it. One time, when I was younger, a saw snow falling outside on a cold winter's night, but the darkness didn't stop me from seeing each individual snowflake. I immediately thought of the Ice Dance theme. It's the very epitome of a beautiful tune. In fact, all the film's compositions are great, especially the theme that plays in the opening credits of the movie where we see a montage of the old inventor's lab equipment. Perhaps my favorite scene out of the entire movie is the scene where Edward sees a can opener and has a flashback of the inventor's cookie making machine. The inventor, played by Vincent Price walks in, marvels at his contraption, takes a heart shaped cookie and holds it up to the chest of the lettuce slicing robot that would later be transformed into Edward himself. It's a very touching moment and shows just how great ideas can be born from great minds. <br/><br/>The acting in the film is also something worth writing a book or two about. Johnny Depp's debut in a Burton film is probably his best. Even if he has little dialogue, Depp makes up his performance through his body language and movements. Depp based the movements of Edward off of Charlie Chaplin and it really shows, for several scenes show Edward waddling about and making facial expressions the Tramp himself would make. My favorite line of his from the film is after the neighbor Joyce (played by Kathy Baker) tries to seduce him in the beauty salon and he meets up with the Boggs family in a nearby restaurant. When asked by the father (played by Alan Arkin) on how his day went at the beauty salon, Edward tells him that Joyce lead him into the back room where she ""took all of her clothes off"". The delivery and the way Depp says the line makes it not only the most humorous line out of the film, but also the most perfectly time line out of the film. The other players are also grandiose with Anthony Michael Hall taking a break from playing the nerdy wise guy in John Hughes films and instead playing the dirtbag jock who torments Edward throughout most of the film. Winona Ryder, straight from Burton's Beetlejuice is also the apple of Edward's eye and comes off as the pretty girl many boys her age would love to date. <br/><br/>But one of the main reasons why I love this film to pieces is that it was Vincent Price's last and arguably his best performance in a motion picture. He plays the role of the inventor as a kind hearted, noble fellow who was on the verge of creating a creation like no other. Unlike Dr. Frankenstein, he's not an insane fellow obsessed with his work, he's just a kind gentleman with a passion to build things and enjoy the very things he constructs. The scene where he passes is a heartbreaking scene, for he was about to give Edward normal hands, ridding him of the sharp scissorhands he was bound too for so long. Still, Price is a child at heart in this film and his performance sums up his entire career in the Gothic horror/macabre genre. The scene in which he teaches etiquette to Edward is a memorable scene that will have you laughing and tearing up all at once.<br/><br/>What more can I say about the movie, it's magnificent. Sure, some may question where Edward got the ice for the ice sculptures at the very end, but that's a glaring issue. Edward Scissorhands brings us the best humor, the best imaginative elements and the best performances out of any other Burton film. Some think of it as a retelling of Shelley's Frankenstein, others say it's ET, I consider it a collage of many things, both from the horror and fantasy genres as well as the works of 19th century authors and their tales of weird beings and creatures of the night. And like I said earlier, I relate a lot to Edward, for he was a outcast, like I am an outcast, like we are all outcasts in certain times of our lives."
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","6","5 December 2015"," On paper, Edward Scissorhands sound weird, but after watching this movie. It indeed rocks! It's cutting edge. A very beautiful film. A winner.
","Don't cut yourself, from this movie. This movie worth, being connection to. Written & Directed by Tim Burton with help from screenwriter Caroline Thompson, this nostalgia romantic fairy tale hybrid is an American Masterpiece. Without a doubt, Burton's best movie, so far. The film tells the story of an unfinished artificial man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who has scissors for hands. Abandoned by his creator, a lonely inventor (Vincent Price, in what was his final film appearance); Edward is taken in by a blind optimism saleswoman, Peg Boggs (Dianne West), and her suburban family after she discovers him, alone in the ruins of a once great laboratory. Peg tries really hard to get Edward to fit in, with society by showing his talents for yard decoration, pet grooming and eventually hairstyling. However, there are those, within the community, who doesn't like Edward, because of his indifferent, yet innocent kindness. Driven by envy, jealousy and hate, they try to cast out, Edward, out of the town. Can Edward win the hearts & mind of the people, or will the people slowing turn against him, due to his monstrous appearance and his mysterious, yet frightening past? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, I love the mixer of Victorian Era Style Gothic Horror with that of the 1960s Americana Style of Comedy. It made for a very unique watch. The movie had some really wonderful set pieces. Some of them, remind me of the old German Expressionism set pieces of the silent era. The movie also had some of the best make up, I have ever witness. Great work from make-up artist legend, Stan Winston. Another beautiful thing from the film is the music by Danny Elfman. It was so enchanting to hear. I can still hear, it's haunting, but memorizing tune. It's also nice to see, that this film, started the long collaborate between Tim Burton & that of character actor, Johnny Depp. This movie indeed, shows, how good, a character actor like Johnny Depp would later become. Great acting from him. This movie also, felt like one of the last, charming performances of Winona Ryder, before she fell into mediocrity, in my opinion. She had great chemistry with Johnny Depp in this film. Supporting actors like Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker, and Alan Arkin also add to the wow-factor of the film. Even, Anthony Michael Hall made a huge impact. It was so weird, seeing him, morph from a skinny-nerdy guy in his earlier films into a tough-looking bad guy here. Despite all, the praise, I gave the movie, I'm also willing to state out, that this movie does some flaws. Some of the biggest ones, come from the weak logistics of the story. It's full of jarring plot-holes, bad exposition and daydreaming direction. Some of the biggest examples are what were the reasons, why Edward was even given, scissors for hands? Another is whatever, happened to the body of Edward's so call, father? Last one, is the most jarring. Where does he get the ice to make snow in the first place? How can we even comprehend this!? The movie never answer those questions and some more. However, in my opinion, it doesn't really need to, since it's a fantasy film, and people should take it, in face-value, but I understand, if they don't. The story does seem a bit uncompleted. Another problem that people have, against the film is that it seem like it ripping off, author Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. In my view, I see the movie more like a homage to Frankenstein than a rip-off. Like Frankenstein's creature, Edward, is born virtuous. Full of tabula rasa in the beginning, it's only, when he sees the ugliness of the people, through their intolerance, that he began to withdrawn himself, from such an ignorant society. I can understand, why certain people might hate the ending to this film, since it was indeed depressing, but in my thoughts. I saw that movie tragic ending, does works within the confine of the story. Changing the ending would had, a lesser impact on its audiences. They was no other way to end the film. There is an obvious purpose on why the suburban houses look nearly identical, oversize and full of bright colors. It's to show, that despite, the majority of Americans saying, they're for a melting pot, there are still somethings; they're unwilling to accept. It's a satire joke, well played by the director. A lasting thought, to take home and think over. It's also a good, sad social commentary on how our society, mistreat those who might have different culture, or those who are sick or ill, or those of a different social status. I don't care, if it's depressing, I care that it leaves a very thought-provoking message in the end. After all, there is a good reason why the movie shows the Ice Dance flashback, before the credits. It's to tell, the audience, that despite, cut off ties, we all, still connected, by one great human emotion, and that's love. So in the end, it's not too tragic, but bittersweet. While, the movie only a modest success at the time, in part because of the strange premise. The film has since gained a large fan base, and turned out to one of the best collaborations between Burton and Depp. In 2005, it was adapted into a ballet by British choreographer Matthew Bourne and thoughts of a musical Broadway play, are not off the table in the future. Overall: Edward Scissorhands is a great movie, not only because of its sheer beauty, but its strong message of self-discovery and tolerance. Thank you Tim Burton for making a great film."
"kuringai-1","10","7","10","27 January 2006"," Burton's best film.
","Edward Scissorhands is, simply put, incredible. I often wonder if Burton's detractors have seen it (I suppose they have), or the thirteen-year-old ""biggest fan""s who think that he directed The Nightmare Before Christmas.<br/><br/>How can anyone not be touched by this movie? How can anyone not love Edward? How can anyone not think Kim is cute?<br/><br/>By far the most touching of Burton's works- his ""2001: A Space Oddyssey"", if you will. And it is also his best film, though Ed Wood does come close.<br/><br/>The neighborhood Edward lives in represents everything wrong with society (even if it is set in the 50s)- gossip, alienating those that do not fit in etc.<br/><br/>An example of this is a scene near the start, were everybody in view of the camera does the exact same thing, in almost the exact same order, showing how mundane, unimaginative and repetitive life is.<br/><br/>Edward symbolizes the readiness with which we discriminate those who are different- the gossiping ladies, who instantly swing from one side of the spectrum to the other, and who can't live without a juicy conversation, are a little too close for comfort.<br/><br/>A lot of Burton fans will tell you that Ed Wood is Burton's best film- I disagree. This is, for me, my favorite Burton flick, and I also consider it to be his best.<br/><br/>Tim is always strongest when he works your emotions (as opposed to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Mars Attacks etc.), and this is his finest emotional film- I cannot believe it isn't on the Top 250.<br/><br/>Not to be missed."
"grace_laura_newman","10","7","10","21 September 2005"," Amazing
","I love this film because of how beautiful it is. It has a whole range of amazing sequences that look like real art. The snow scene is my favourite, when Edward carves a figure of an angel with Kim's face from a block of ice, while she dances in the snow below. However it is also capable of being very funny at times (for example, Edward's ignorance of words which mean something different from what you would think. ""Esmerelda: Have you sheep strayed so far from the flock? Edward: We're not sheep."") Johnny Depp's acting is incredibly passionate. He was the perfect choice for the role. I honestly cannot think of anyone who could have played it better. The bitter sweet storyline is enough to touch anybody (I still get misty eyed at the end), and I think this may be the single most beautiful film ever. Watch it, and who knows? Maybe you'll agree."
"triin-jerlei","10","7","10","20 August 2005"," A Modern Fairytale
","This is a movie unlike any other nowadays. E.S. should be called a fairytale for adults, yet it has a very deep meaning. I have seen it for about twelve times and still cannot get enough of it.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp makes an excellent performance despite the fact it was only his seventh movie (and the first one with Tim Burton). It is outrageous that he was not even nominated for Oscar.<br/><br/>What makes it a fairytale is the simplicity and purity of the movie. It is impossible to tell the time or place where it could be located, characters are beautifully drawn and still somewhat simplified. Burton accents the visual part, especially colors - it is genial how he has separated two different worlds just a few steps away from each other. The angel-like look of Kim, Jim's brutality and Peg's family's inability to see the problems as well as local housewives who are unable to use their own heads form a surreal reality so connected to Burton's creations. Burton shows our world in mirror.<br/><br/>The scene where Kim dances in the snow is one of the most memorable love scenes in the history of cinema, remarkable are also the giant sculpture of hand in front of the castle showing Edward's desires and the flashback that shows how dreams are sacrificed in the name of love. Every scene can be looked as a separate wonderful piece of art.<br/><br/>E.S. is a movie that is suitable for any age or educational level - everyone who loves fairy tales."

","Here's a story of a man we call a white crow but only a bit exaggerrated. A sad fairytale which looks like a real life too much - i'm sure you've met an Edvard Scissorhands in your life , not once , and even maybe you are him. People tend to judge each other by looks and are ready to use someone kind and naive, and irritation about soething unsubstantial easily takes over, and we often recognize a true love only when it's too late ,and there's nothing we can do, and it's alright. I think this film is one of Burton's best works - for me it's much better than Batman , i'm sorry , because it's way closer to reality."
"richard-wheeler","10","8","12","11 November 2005"," "" He's a highly imaginative character"".
","I first heard of this movie when I was 3. And then, I heard of many times and I wanted to know what it was about.It was a terribly sad movie which could bring tears to anyone's eyes.<br/><br/>Kim (Winona Ryder), Edward's (Johnny Depp) girlfriend told the story to her grandchild as a bed time story saying Edward was left incomplete when his beloved creator (Vincent Price)died from old age. Edward was left all alone in the mansion on the hill above the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Soon, a lipstick seller named Peg (Dianne Wiest) approached the mansion to see if she could sell any lipsticks. That mansion looked like the house from the film ""Taled Of The Crypt"". When she entered, she saw the front yards bushes were shaped like animals.BEAUTIFUL! And the mansion was very well maintained.<br/><br/>Inside the house, Peg wondered about and when she entered the attic, she discovered timid Edward. She was shocked to see that he had scissors for hands. And then, she decided to take him home with her to her so 50s suburban home. E.g.- All the husbands all left for work in the mornings at the same time and houses looked identical.<br/><br/>Edward was amazed to see what went on in the world which lived below him e.g- the people, the houses, mirrors and especially, Peg's daughter Kim. There was such a funny scene when Edward went into Kim's room and he accidentally popped the water bed. And when he was trying out his new clothes. He SURE did struggle to put on his clothes.<br/><br/>Suddenly, all the people of the neighborhood were interested to know who Joyce brought home. There was such a radical scene when Peg's son, Kevin (Robert Oliveri) took Edward to school with him for show and tell and when Kevin gave Edward a piece of paper, as quick as a flash; a long row of little boys and girls were made. AMAZING! Edward soon learned from Joyce's husband, Bill (Alan Arkin). He created a T-Rex out of a bush followed by the shape of Peg's family. And from here, Edward had flash backs when he was still living with inventor/creator. There was such an amazing scene with the machines working. They looked like people working together.<br/><br/>One day, all the people of the neighborhood came over to Peg's social at her house and Everyone was SO delighted to meet Edward. THEY LOVED HIM! E.g.- All the women wanted Edward to try their foods. And there were also some sad moments when Edward was battling to use scissor hands. For example, hard for him to use his cutlery at the dinner table, picking up glasses of lemonade, etc.<br/><br/>Edward was so delighted to meet Kim for real and he fainted. It was SO funny! And also when Joyce (Kathy Baker) asked Edward if he would like a glass of lemonade. Edward soon started to do the suburb proud. He also did fur cuts for dogs and he also became a hairdresser for women who wanted new hair styles. And all the women believed Edward did a good job on their hairs. And he also could unlock doors, e.g.- when Kim and her boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) were locked outside the house, Edward came along, put one of his scissor fingers in the key hole and 'click'. The unlock was unlocked.<br/><br/>There was another funny scene: when Joyce tried to make love to Edward, the both fell off the chair they were both on with Edward's legs up in the air. And then, Edward quickly got up and took off. OOH! That woman's nails looked like Count Orlock's nails painted RED! And later on in the film, Jim locked Edward up in his safe in his home, the alarm went off, and the police rocked up. The police thought Edward committed a crime! When in fact Jim put Edward up to it! SAME ON YOU, JIM!!! And then, Kim told the brute to go!! You go, Kim!!! On Christmas eve, Edward did something interesting. he created a huge angel out of ice. WOW!!! With great detail of the angel's robe and wings!!!! There was another sad flash back: it was when the Inventor bought Edward a pair of plastic hands as a gift and when Edward reached out to hug his inventor, the Inventor died. Just like that! There was one huge moment of love turning into hate, it was when Jim tried to beat Edward up and Edward cut Jim across the arm. Edward certainly nailed the bastard there! And suddenly, the whole neighborhood heads toward the mansion on the hill. And then, in the mansion, in the attic, Jim struck back! But he lost again when Edward pushed him out the window. WAY TO GO, EDWARD!!!!!! And then, Kim went outside to the people of the suburb to say Edward was dead and she showed them all one of Edward's scissor hand's. Kim saved her lover's butt from those maniacs! <br/><br/>And coming to the end of the film, as Kim spoke when she told her grand daughter the story of Edward Scissor Hands. Back in the attic of the mansion; Edward was making ice sculptures. The never snowed on that so 50s town until Edward began to make ice sculptures.<br/><br/>Like what my old Drama teacher, Mrs. Roux would say:""What a stunning film!"""
"Boyo-2","10","11","18","24 August 1999"," Burton & Depp's best
","I love this movie very much.  There are not many directors who would attempt a modern-day fairy tale, but Tim Burton creates the right balance of fantasty & reality in the telling of the story.  Johnny Depp is perfection in the title role - also great are Dianne Wiest and especially Alan Arkin (who insists on calling him ""Eddie"").  A movie for everyone to love."
"mark.waltz","10","4","5","7 September 2013"," The parallels of so many other stories are there in this sweet fantasy.
","I remember sitting in the theater when this first came out and totally blown away by the snow drifting over the 20th Century Fox logo and the sudden influx of the Danny Elfman music which drifted me off into the fantasy world of this strange suburb world where a castle on a strategically placed mountaintop once was the residence for a sweet old man so desperate for a son, he created the title character. In the prologue of this film, beloved thespian Vincent Price saunters along the corridors of his castle, preparing to give his invented son Edward (Johnny Depp) everything he needed, that is, besides hands, which unfortunately were never able to be placed on him.<br/><br/>Swing down to earth where unlucky Avon lady (Dianne Wiest in her most perfect mom role) decides to trek up to the castle and make a sale. There she meets the lonely Edward and brings him home. But as fascinated as the family is with Edward and his scissorhands, there's also a danger there as the enchanted neighbors take all sorts of interest in the newcomer to their community. Kathy Baker's flirtatious Peg obviously lusts over him with ambrosia salad, cheery Conchata Ferrell takes him into be sharpened, but there's also warnings from a religious obsessed neighbor who thinks him evil.<br/><br/>There is evil in the valley, but it's not through the Frankenstein Monster/Pinocchio/Jesus Christ like Edward. He instills joy both with his haircuts and with his trimming of the local shrubbery. It's through the boyfriend of Wiest's daughter, Winona Ryder, obviously jealous of the growing affection between Ryder and Depp. Anthony Michael Hall gives a disturbing performance as the cheery on the outside jock who is all nastiness on the inside, getting Edward involved in a crime, and resulting in a chase sequence that results in a confrontation back at the castle.<br/><br/>While the plot requires some sort of violence in order to create the necessary tension, that doesn't take over the film, which is a series of vignettes of how Edward fares in regular society after being alone for so long. His neighbors love him as long as everything is cookies and paper machete cut-outs, but once fear strikes into their hearts, Edward is an outcast. Even the injured war vet who once compared his metal leg with Edward's hands now calls him a freak, and cheery Farrell threatens to call the police after a misunderstanding. It comments on society how something new and unknown can be exciting but once the reality sets in, people no longer accept it. Depp is sensitive in his sweet persona, and his chemistry with Ryder is undeniable.<br/><br/>As the parents, Wiest and Alan Arkin are a constant delight. In a performance I felt award worthy, Wiest is funny and touching, applying Depp's face with all sorts of cold cremes (of all colors) to fix the cuts on his face from his own scissors. Arkin gives a totally unaffected performance, his character so in awe of life as it happens, his child-like qualities exploding, even when he insists to Edward that you can't pay bills with cookies. The presence of Price in one of his last acting roles truly is touching. Try not to tear up as you see the beloved master of horror doing what he does best, entertaining, and influencing today's generations of superstars and creative film makers.<br/><br/>There's some comical touches that are impossible not to stick in the mind; The old lady at the beginning, telling her granddaughter the story, has an irony of familiarity to her, and the poor little girl lost in the huge bed, is awestruck not only by the story but by the constantly falling snow outside. It isn't hard to figure out why the narrative is the way it is, and when the old lady says her last line and that Danny Elfman music strikes up again, be prepared for the tears to flow once again."
"Netscape_Navigator","5","32","65","10 July 2005"," disappointing, I really wanted to like this movie
","I really thought I would like this movie, I usually like interesting stories about alienated characters, but this was just too sentimental.<br/><br/>The movie's number one problem: the characters are too clichÃ©. I know they wanted to go for a fairytale style story, but that doesn't mean the characters have to be 100% artificial. Couldn't they have done a bit more to minimize the feeling that we're watching mindless, one-dimensional caricatures simply existing for the sake of the movie? The characters have almost no depth at all. For example, why did Kim ever fall in love with Scissorhands? She never had a reason to, and the explanation given was not good enough. She went from almost being disgusted of him to... LOVING him? Not just being his friend, not finally accepting him for who he is, or even just his best friend, but loving him...romantically. That's completely absurd. She was initially disgusted by him, but it's after seeing him on TV and finding out that he would ""do anything for her"" that she begins loving him, I feel silly just typing that. I'll tell you why she fell in love, it's because the plot called for it.<br/><br/>In the end when Ed saves the kid from being hit by the van, that felt like a convenient scene to throw in to show Ed as a hero and to draw empathy, but it makes no sense at all. Why would The Dead Zone's Anthony Michael Hall keep driving full speed after seeing the boy in the street? Even if he was drunk he would've made some attempt to swerve after seeing his girlfriend's brother about to be hit, and you can't tell me he didn't see him. I honestly wanted to like this movie, it's sweet and lighthearted, but ultimately failed because there was too much in this movie that was contrived."
"dead47548","10","5","7","8 January 2008"," One of the best and most heartbreaking films of all time.
","A hauntingly poetic, dark fairy tale filled with fantastic humor, amazing performances and possibly the most heartbreaking romance of all time. Everything about this film is perfect. Johnny Depp plays arguably his most bizarre and surreal character, which is a lot for him, and he portrays it perfectly. For his most bizarre character, Depp is at his most reserved. The story is ultimately one of a man who wants nothing more than to be accepted and belong in this happy, seemingly Utopian suburbia.<br/><br/>Of course the tragedy of the story is that, nearing the completion of his invention, Edward's inventor/father died tragically before he could finish his hands. So we see society's typical reaction to something new and bizarre. At first everyone is overwhelmingly interested by this new man and want to know as much about him as possible. We see his many unique talents (gardening, for instance) and for the first time in his life Edward feels like he belongs somewhere.<br/><br/>At the end of the first act, we are overjoyed by his acceptance and happiness in this world. And then the introduction of Kim leads to a slow, inevitable downfall of this tragic character. The scum of the Earth is portrayed through Kim's boyfriend Jim and the combination of his jealousy of Edward with Edward's infatuation/devotion to Kim creates some of the most painful scenes of all time. Jim takes advantage of Edward's lock-picking abilities and in an unhappy accident he gets thrown in jail, but his devotion to Kim means that he won't tell the truth; that it wasn't his fault. So now society turns. Some make up false stories of how he tried to rape them, even though it was her who forced herself upon Edward's innocence; but everyone turns their interest and adoration of Edward into spiteful fear and detestment. Everyone except for Kim, the golden light in this pathetically revolting neighborhood. We fall in love with her, just as Edward does, as she leaves her boyfriend and tries to do all she can to make Edward feel accepted.<br/><br/>But society won't have this. They turn every small mishap into the apocalypse and want to bring down the man they all admired so dearly a few days prior. This isn't even the most tragic element of this story. The most painful scene of all time is unleashed as Edward and Kim are standing alone in a room. 'Hold me' Kim asks the man with scissors for hands; she wants comfort from the fear and chaos of the world outside but the only person who can give her this comfort is unable to because he could hurt her simply by touching her. It brings more tears down my face than I can ever remember happening. Such a painful scene in a heartbreaking film.<br/><br/>The finale is just as heartbreaking. Kim is a very old woman, almost on her death bed, and after years of not visiting Edward in his castle on top of the hill she realizes that it is too late to do so. Her heart crumbles before us as she makes the painful decision to let Edward remember her as the adorable and beautiful young woman she was; not the old lady she has become. Probably the most painful film I've ever seen, yet it still gives me a sense of pure joy every time I watch it. Maybe it has something to do with Danny Elfman's flawlessly gorgeous score, that I've now decided is my favorite of all time. Maybe it has something to do with Johnny Depp's uniquely outrageous performance. Whatever it is, Edward Scissorhands is a film that I will always hold close to my heart, no matter how much it breaks it."

"majolira","8","5","7","1 August 2005"," beautiful but....incomplete?
","When you first hear what the story is about: a man with scissor hands, its almost impossible to imagine how could a movie be done about this. Tim Burton is just an artist with an incredible imagination who decided to make a movie so different from others. Edward may be not so ""pretty"" on the outside but he surely is on the inside, and Peg didn't noticed about his look but the way he was so she brought him home trying to improve his view of life and his life itself. Then, poor Edward seems to be seen like a local celebrity in a place full of rumors and gossip. When Edward meets Kim, she freaks out at the beginning but starts appreciating him after a while but in a more honest way than the neighbors. Finally Kim falls in love with him.<br/><br/>The story was amazing and the acting was incredible. Johnny Depp played his part very well. Tim Burton is one of the best directors and it would be impossible to improve the story he created as a teenager. Isn't that incredible? a teenager created such an original and emotional story? About the ending: When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought the ending was upsetting. Later I saw it in DVD where I chose to see it with the comments of the director. Just at the end he said that he preferred to make Edward and Kim never see each other again than struggle for a long time trying to think about a way they could meet again. That upset me even more. When you love someone you are supposed to be with that someone. Would you resist having a loved person and never see him/her again, when you can just walk a few meters to see him/her? In some point of the movie, Peg says something that makes you think that Edward would be more happy if he lived ""up there"", that made the ending less painful but the fact that he and Kim never meet again? Quite absurd. It makes you think that when Kim told Edward that she loved him, the words she said were just words and not her real feelings. Anyway I give an 8 to the movie because it teaches us many things such as respect, but I think the movie's end was as unfinished as Edward Scissorhands was."

Due to the intervention of a determined and cheerful Avon lady (Diane Weist) Edward finds himself becoming the neighborhood celebrity when his creativity with his appendages is discovered. However he is only appreciated for his unique appearance while he longs to become an ordinary everyday person. ""But then there wouldn't be anything special about you. You'd just be like everyone else"" he is told. Even his love for the Avon lady's daughter (Winona Ryder) is doomed thanks to her bullying boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall). Director Tim Burton has created an imaginative tale that's unforgettably poignant."
"paul2001sw-1","7","6","9","14 March 2003"," The director's cut
","Tim Burton's whimsical fable is a visually exotic parody of small town values, exploring themes such as loneliness and conformity; a very unusual horror film; and a simple tragedy to boot.  With minimal plot but coherent vision and child-like wonder, Burton has made a film whose view of the world resembles few others.  What he has not done is made a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Some films build fantasy elements into the real world, and explore what might happen if such a thing came true: 'The Truman Show', and 'Being John Malkovich', are two obvious examples of this genre.  But Tim Burton does not make films like that.  Even his most realistic work (e.g. Ed Wood) takes place in a world that at times appears to be wholly imaginative. This is not necessarily good.  It means that one cannot look for ordinary human motivations and actions in his stories: in this film, for example, a small American town lies in the shadow of a Gothic castle which not one of its inhabitants has ever visited until a cosmetics saleswoman dares to make a call; and at many subsequent turns, the actions of the characters just don't square with what anyone real would actually do if confronted with a boy with scissors for hands.  At one level, this complaint is petty: the story is, after all, a mere fairy tale.  But this is precisely the point.  Though visually highly original, the film's comments about modern society can only be in a morally obvious fashion: the behaviour of the protagonists too stylised and contrived to allow for anything more subtle.  Which leaves you at moments the feeling you are watching little more than a live action version of Wallace and Grommit (with fewer jokes to boot; though the film is quite effective in spinning out its only real gag).<br/><br/>All Burton's films place style (albeit in quite a deep sense) over substance; the creation of a form over what goes on inside.  The strength of Edward Scissorhands lies in its simplicity; and in the bewilderment in Johnny Depp's eyes (even if he does resemble Malcolm McLaren!). Without pretence, it eventually draws you into its beautiful, but two-dimensional, world."

And it should be viewed upon as such. But at times this film gets a lot more corny than it should be (imho ofcourse). All the scenes where Edward does his ""magic"" with bushes, neighbors' hairstyles and dogs look exactly like that - him moving his hands around while leaves, hair and flakes of fur fly around him in enormous amounts. Makes you feel almost as if it's a kids movie or even a cartoon, which it isn't, I don't think (?). Otherwise, stylistically it is not bad at all.<br/><br/>I remember when I first saw this film (at the age of about 6) I cried myself to sleep because of how tragic Edward's fate was. Rewatching it now, as an adult, I didn't feel but rather acknowledged the tragedy. Which isn't necessarily Edward's fault, sometimes throught the film Johnny Depp makes you feel genuine compassion for him. But mostly it's just a fun character to observe.<br/><br/>One thing I like about this movie is how Burton made it pretty easy for the viewer to connect with Edward, who we know nothing about and might not even be human, but, nevertheless, is adorable. And how Burton made it even easier to despise the villagers, who marginalize Edward any way they possibly could. Something Woody Allen also does great I think, the director has a lot of characters throughout different films who are so easy to hate. Imo it take a lot of cleverness from both the director and the actors to achieve this effect.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands could've been a masterpiece, but unfortunately it's not. Still a pretty good film. 7/10. October 16, 2019."

","Tim Burton at his finest in my opinion. The imagination in the inventions and the beautiful heart in the relationship with Edward, his father and adoptive mum just connects with me in a way that not many films can. The complete tragedy that some of us will just never fit in - the world is just too cruel a place. Often those of us who identify with Edward, who love the idea of cutting hair, hedges and ice? to connect with others. This film, is funny, original, imaginative, looks brilliant, is well made, contains social comment and connects with vulnerable people through its kind soul. A recommended film for any misunderstood teen (and those of us who will always feel that way :-)"

","I had just watched Edward Scissorhands last night and I believe it is the most beautiful movie I had ever seen in my life. This story of an ""uncommonly gentle man"" will break even the hardest of hearts. I could relate to Edward's gentle, shy, loving character and you have to admit, he does look very huggable. I laughed at the beginning, when Edward's trying to get his bearings straight in suburbia after being isolated for so many years (I especially liked the water bed). I loved all of Edward's wondrous topiary, wishing he could do a little work in my yard.<br/><br/>And at the end of the movie, where Edward's famous goodbye to Kim was heard, my eyes weren't watering, they were pouring. I was literally sobbing. It's such a beautiful ending when the origins of snow are finally realized by the viewers.<br/><br/>Edward's story has touched me and many of my friends. It's a wonderful story of love, family, and a sense of belonging. I recommend it to the highest degree. Who knows? You may look at everyday things a bit differently now."

","I feel like it is impossible to objectively judge this movie, just not possible to judge all the dumb colors the houses were, the way Edward was cutting the bushes etc., it is just pure art by Tim Burton. He found the most simple background possible to purely reflect the true nature of a human. Everybody wanted to be friends with Edward at first, just to use his ''scissors'' for free, after things got tough nobody wanted to call Edward their friend, except for Kim.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie was very cheesy, the colours and actions were definitely funky to say the least, but it was meant to be that way and everybody should know and respect that, without that this movie would not have turned out as well.

"dee.reid","10","4","6","9 November 2005"," ""Edward Scissorhands""
","No matter what you may think of him, there's no question of director Tim Burton's gift for imagination, invention, and his mastery of storytelling. He also specializes in freaks (or more pleasantly, misunderstood outsiders); if you've seen ""Beetlejuice"" (1988), ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" (1985), ""Batman"" (1989) and his critical masterpiece ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), then you realize it's the truth. ""Edward Scissorhands,"" often cited as Burton's most personal work, transcends its fairy-tale origins to become something far greater, like a mature cinematic masterpiece. Only true Burton devotees know why the film is so celebrated today, 15 years after it was released. Though Burton has made two better critical efforts since this one (1994's ""Ed Wood"" and 2003's ""Big Fish""), it is ""Edward Scissorhands"" that stands as his most delicate and greatest masterwork. The film takes place in some quaint, unnamed suburb (that looks like something straight out of a '50s supermarket real estate guide), where local Avon lady Peg (Dianne Wiest), desperate for a sale, stumbles up to the dark castle located on the hill looming over her neighborhood. On her way up to the door, she finds the garden and the magnificent artistic creations housed in it. Once inside, she finds the remains of a factory and its sole occupant, Edward (Johnny Depp). The greatest, yet unfinished creation of his late scientific inventor (the late Vincent Price, in one of his last roles), Edward is a sort of Frankenstein monster, only he's not built from human body parts and he is not an object of horror but more of sympathy: The Inventor died before he could give Edward real hands, so he's stuck forever with these ""scissor-hands."" Peg invites him to live with her family down in the 'burbs, but she is in no way put off by his ""hands,"" which are comprised of razor-sharp knives and blades. I guess I shouldn't say it takes a while for Edward to grow accustomed to his new surroundings, but the locals are quite welcoming and warm to him (he even takes on the tasks of pet grooming, sheering, and eventually, salon styling). Why, he approaches adorability in this sweet, conformist society! There are others, however, like the native Christ-nut, sees foreboding in Edward's arrival, and Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), who is the rich, selfish and arrogant son of a local businessman, and who also happens to be the boyfriend of Peg's pretty teenage daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), sees menace in innocence. Edward is kind and benevolent but he's also human (somewhat), and is capable of anger and rage and it isn't long before various misunderstandings allow this dark side of his character to surface. Long before he was Jack Sparrow, Depp was Edward Scissorhands in one of the most recognizable roles of his career; who could have seen him becoming the top-notch performer he is today? As the harmless Edward, his face is scarred by the many scratches of his scissor-hands, making him incapable of touching anything or anyone for fear of destroying it. He has minimal lines but delivers his performance through calculated mannerisms and facial expressions. It's probably one of his first great roles. As for director Burton, he indulges in his usual cinematic weirdness (is there any other kind?), but it's given a strong emotional and human touch with a light dose of comic fare, which manages to separate it from earlier substance works like ""Beetlejuice"" or ""Batman."" He focuses mainly on the characters, and their reaction to the misunderstood outsider, and his reluctant acceptance, more or less, into their world. ""Batman"" remains my favorite Burton piece, but ""Edward Scissorhands"" is probably the best film he's made so far (from a fan's perspective). ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a dark, comic fable come to life, and lives forever and ever, long after the lights in the theater come back on.<br/><br/>10/10"

","With a Tim Burton-directed film, you get a lot of ""once again."" statements<br/><br/>Once again, we get a terrific visual film with wild colors and scenes you'll rarely see elsewhere. Once again, Johnny Depp plays the lead role and plays a very strange guy - maybe the strangest he's ever played. Once again, the story is kind of bizarre, some cool and sometimes stupid and entertaining all at once. And - guess what? - once again, the meanest person in the film a Christian. In this movie, it's the Christian lady next door! Hello! Here we go with more Hollywood religious bias. It's unbelievable how many times they have gotten away with this hatred for all things Biblical.....but no things in Far Eastern or New Age religion or Indian mystical religion.<br/><br/>In this movie, we get the stereotypical wild-eyed, hysterical religious crackpot. She's the next door neighbor who rants and raves that Edward is the spawn of the devil. Real subtle, eh? Filmmakers in the modern-era, since the morals code was abolished, have never been too shy about portraying Christians in a negative light every opportunity they see, even if isn't needed in the film. The Gothic-minded Burton just can't resist inserting his bias bias in almost every film he directs. It's like a Stephen King story.<br/><br/>Anyway, for classic movie fans, it was nice to see Vincent Price again. He fits into this quirky tale quite well. Depp usually plays very likable weirdos, and that's the case here, too. Speaking of weirdos, Winona Ryder, who was Depp's real-life girlfriend during this time, is the only one who truly understands poor ""Edward"" in this wacky New Age-preachy film. What a pair Depp and Ryder must have made.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I will always remember this film for the incredible landscaping as only ""Edward Scissorhands"" could produce. Unqiue and memorable."
"pharmhog","6","6","13","4 February 2006"," Awkward little film
","What goes through that man's mind? Tim Burton is a very imaginative director. Johnny Depp does a wonderful in playing the socially inept Edward Scissorhands. Burton shows us the duality of the world in which Edward finds himself. Edward lives in the dark, damp, and unkempt castle and the rest of the world in the contrasting bright, sunny, and pastel-like community in the valley. This is, however, a love story: a love which can never be, two people drawn to each other, who can never be together because society won't let it happen.<br/><br/>In this film, the Avon lady (played by Dianne Wiest) takes it upon herself to have Edward move in with her and her family. Of course, it's the recipe for a shear disaster waiting to happen. Enter Winona Ryder (love interest) and the tension mounts. Edward spends most of time now clipping hair and improving the look of the neighborhood. And what's up with Anthony Michael Hall playing the tough guy? Sorry, too much baggage to see him other than the nerd he is. Between him and the nosy neighbors, they push Edward to the brink.<br/><br/>I could not help but think of another Burton film (Frankenweenie) while watching this movie. Frankenstein came to mind a few times. Particularly, the scene where Edward is running from the police and the angry townsfolk are hot on his heels. It was very reminiscent of those two films.<br/><br/>If you like Tim Burton and his odd sense of vision, you'll love this film. It's a love story, but not in the conventional sense. Burton does a delightful job in presenting the story. Although I do not give this one a high rating, I still recommend you give it a chance and decide for yourself."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","3","5","26 August 2007"," 'Wonderful' is the word that best describes it!!!
","Burton's films are usually set in a world of its own and in that regard Edward Scissorhands isn't much different. However, here he shows us two different worlds. One is that of Edward's house and the other is that of the neighborhood. While the neighborhood is inhabited by 'normal' people, Burton uses his imagination with the colourful houses and the people who are sort of from the 60s or 70s era. It's a typical suburban neighborhood where men drive to work and women gossip. Edward's mansion is more coloured in black and white (sort of reflects on the idea that he's an 'unfinished' experiment) and his garden is richer in green. The background score contributes well to the screenplay and cinematography is fine.<br/><br/>The story is simple but sublimely told. It's a little Frankensteinish, Edward (Johnny Depp) is created by his inventor, a scientist, who dies before giving him hands(he has scissor-hands). After the death of his creator, he stays locked inside the mansion until a kind lady Peg (Dianne Wiest) decides to take care of him. She takes him home. This arouses curiosity from the neighbors. Edward tries to adjust himself to this new world and falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). While the neighbors accept him (because of their own benefits), it does not take long for them to turn their backs against him. Edward mows their garden, cuts their trees in marvelous shapes of animals and humans, cuts their hair among so many other things that attract the neighbors, but soon he faces difficult obstacles where these people turn against him and things only get so much worse that even Peg's and Kim's efforts to save him hardly seem to succeed...<br/><br/>Burton tells this wonderful story beautifully. The characters are indeed very well-written and the climax is moving. The film is a little weird, especially with the combination of the dark humour, romance, drama and action set in the 'real' world but it works well. The film is said to be inspired by a fictional childhood hero of Burton who had scissor-hands. Clearly he's put a lot of heart into it. I just saw the film recently and it clearly has stood the test of time and one movie that will stay for a long time.<br/><br/>Depp in the title role is wonderfully outstanding. I can't imagine anyone else play the part. It was made for him as he did full justice to the character and immortalized it. Wiest is completely different from her other roles and only proves what a versatile actress she is. Ryder is charming and adequate.<br/><br/>To conclude, this is a simple, yet beautiful story of an outsider who is initially accepted by all, just to be shunned. While the people accept him for their own benefit they refuse to see his wonderful heart and eventually smash it. I know I'm using the world wonderful too often but that's the adjective that best describes 'Edward Scissorhands'."
"Hayfax_Jo","10","3","5","10 February 2006"," I feel so manipulated...
","I just don't get it. Here I am, rapidly approaching my late twenties, perpetually a heartless misanthrope, and yet this dang movie gets me every time. It's such a simple movie, with characterisations that are barely more than cookie-cutter ciphers, but it makes me well up every time. What's up with that? I've been fortunate enough, over the years, to see most of the movies in Tim Burton's oeuvre, but I think that it's this one above all that characterise him as one of the most idiosyncratic and imaginative directors around. Everything about this film gets me; the contrasts between light and dark, pastels and charcoal, symmetry and asymmetry... then, on the non-visual level, the mixture of satire, dark fantasy, occasionally moving drama and 50's pastiche... I think this is Burton's masterpiece, I really do.<br/><br/>There's the old accusation that this piece is rather mean spirited and encapsulates a deep antipathy towards suburbia, and that its whole purpose was to exorcise the demons of Burton's 'outsider' adolescence, but if that's what it takes to make something so beautiful, then what the hey. And true, it's not as profound as Kant or as mould-breaking as Kubrick, but neither of those chaps ever did fairy stories.<br/><br/>Anyway, my advice is this: don't watch it if you're drunk and remember that it used to make you cry as a kid.

"Pred3000","10","3","5","20 October 2005"," One of my favorite movies
","Edward Scissorhands is brilliant on so many levels. It is a wonderful Lynchian satire, a touching story, a wonderful visually design, and poetic music that remains one of the best movie scores ever.<br/><br/>The plot seems a lot like the movie version of Frankenstein mixed with The Elephant Man. A struggling Avon Lady (Weist) tries to sell her product at an abandoned mansion. There, she discovers Edward (Depp), a pale man covered in scars and with scissors for hands. She takes him home, a suburban neighborhood caricature, and becomes acquainted with some of the neighbors, sculpting their lawns and cutting their hair into wild forms. Edward also meets the Avon Lady's daughter, Kim)Ryder) and falls in love with her. Unfortunately, she already has a boyfried, Jim (Hall), who tries to frame Edward for breaking into his house.<br/><br/>The film is a sort of traditional Hollywood film, except told in reverse. Normally, this formula involves the freak being loathed, only to show some hidden talent or perform a good deed and then becomes loved. Edward starts out as being loved for his unique talents, only to become hated later. Obviously, Burton was worried that he would eventually succumb to Hollywood pressures and saw himself as being loathed after being celebrated for his popular films like the original Batman. Indeed, Edward even looks like Burton, with his fright wig.<br/><br/>The people of suburbia are perfectly portrayed. They are caricatures and are only described by their stereotypical traits, including the oversexed housewife and the disgruntled army vet. Then again, the only sore spot comes from one of these characters, O-Lan Jones's religious nut who is convinced Edward is a demon. She really adds nothing to the story is just a very poor addition. (Although there is one amusing sight gag toward the end involving her. ) Many people have faulted Winona Ryder's character for being to bland and not being able to draw sympathy. She is, in my mind, the character that develops the most. At the beginning, she is simply another stereotype, in this case the high school cheerleader. Edward loves her, yet she brushes him off. Eventually, after the supposed break in she was involved that was placed on Edward, she sees Edward for what he really is: a lonely figure that wants acceptance. She realizes that her life with Jim is not the way life should be. It is certainly a step for a cheerleader character to sympathize with a ""loser"" instead of a jock.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's music score is also used to the maximum effectiveness. The Ice Dance seen, in which Edward carves and ice sculpture for Kim, would not nearly be as effective without the hauntingly poetic voices in the score. The scene is told dialogue free, and yet shows more emotion than any other scene in the film. Other nice little additions, such as the violin during Edward cutting hair, really help with the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is Tim Burton's masterpiece. He makes his characters as engaging as his sets and the music. It works as comedic satire and as drama. Next to Goodfellas, this was the best film of 1990, and remains one of the best films ever made."

","I saw this one in the theater when I was small, and later many times at home. I never get through it without crying. The score is lovely, never overpowering the story. Edward himself is fragile, yet he had such a desperate nobility to him, and he was so alone...he stands in marked contrast to the apes around him, normal on the outside, but cruel and flawed inside. If you look closely, the neighbors seem to embody one or more of the Seven Sins, while Edward is the tragic innocent.This movie works on so many levels, and still holds up today. Vincent Price shines in his last performance as the Inventor, a small but crucial part that no one else ever would have got right. A truly excellent film, but don't watch it without your hankies ready."

"TheLittleSongbird","10","4","8","7 June 2009"," A simple, but dark and poignant film, that is definitely Burton's best!
","Other films that are genuinely moving are The Elephant Man, Fearless and Camille. Edward Scissorhands is a film of darkness and beauty, that makes it such a wonderful and unique film to see. One thing that I really liked about Edward Scissorhands was the music score by Danny Elfman, which was very beautiful, sensitive and mysterious. A good example is in the beginning credits, with the angelic choir accompanying the Christmas-like images on screen. The cinematography was gorgeous, with bright imaginative close-ups contrasted with genuinely Gothic scenes, like when we first meet Edward in the dark house. The script, while not the strongest category of the film, was still very touching, and added to the charm and suspense that was already ensured in the film. The direction by Tim Burton had all his trademarks, very dark and suspenseful, evident in films like Batman and Sleepy Hollow, if a little odd at times, which is fairly typical of Burton. While there were one or two funny moments, the film is genuinely poignant, with a heart-rending ending. I will say I was most impressed with the acting, topped by Johnny Depp's tragic and poignant portrayal of the title character, and then Winona Ryder as Kim, while not quite as convincing is still very sensitive. I was shocked that Depp didn't get an Oscar for his performance, he doesn't say much, but his facial expressions fully justify. There was also sterling support from Dianne West, Kathy Baker et al, while Vincent Price in a minor role as the inventor also impresses, such a shame he died three years later, he was a brilliant actor, if you see him as the truly Machiavellian villain in Great Mouse Detective, or the sadistic Matthew Hopkins in Witchfinder General, you'll know what I mean. As I have already said, the ending is so heart-rending, that I will confess I got through half'a box of tissues. Overall, a remarkably beautiful and poignant film that had me speechless. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen it, and is planning to, have a box of tissues at the ready, it is that sad. 10/10 Bethany Cox."

"Jonny_Numb","6","4","8","27 October 2005"," uneven, but hits the right notes...
","""Edward Scissorhands"" is an affecting, minimalist fairy tale and one of Tim Burton's better cinematic outings. It chronicles the story of an artificial 'boy' named Edward (an understated Johnny Depp) with shears for hands, as he tries to fit in with the denizens of a 1950s pastel vision of suburbia; the townsfolk embrace the outcast, who carves out immense topiary and gives lonely canines and housewives haircuts; the weak conflict comes in the form of Anthony Michael Hall, as a single-dimensioned goon who clings to the object of Edward's affection (virginal suburban daughter Winona Ryder). The unusual setting and the laid-back attitudes of the characters provides its share of unexpected laughs, but the core of the film comes in moments of quiet beauty, when Burton's cinematic eye, Danny Elfman's beautiful score, and the unspoken emotions of the characters truly hit home. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a film as touching as its lead character, and rife with passages of sheer, poetic wonder and beauty."

"gheremond","10","2","3","19 August 2015"," Burton's melancholic masterpiece
","Let's start out by declaring this my all time favorite film without reservations. And when I say favorite I do not mean that in the way I can say The Goonies is one of my favorite films. No no no. I mean that I consider this, artistically, the finest movie I've seen so far - and I'm not a young man anymore. It has held this place for me for decades and even though I still secretly wish some new film will come along and sweep me off my feet the way Scissorhands did, I deem this more unlikely by the year.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I didn't have much respect for Burton before watching Scissorhands. I was still young during his first films, and being a child through the 80's raised on Spielberg fare, I simply couldn't understand and appreciate Burton's dark vision in the first two Batmans (which I disliked back then). I still remember watching Scissorhands on T.V. for the first time and going through half the movie with a ""this ain't that bad, but it's not anything special either"" attitude until that Ice Dance sequence came along and then thinking ""what the hell just happened?"". <br/><br/>Theme is an important factor when determining a favorite film. No matter what the artistic quality of a movie, some themes are bound to resonate more with some specific audiences than others. As it happens, Scissorhands has essentially the best treatment of the theme that resonates most strongly with my tastes: loneliness and being different in a hostile environment. ""Oh, this is so emo!"", you will counter. But this is the same story behind Frankenstein. Or Oedipus Rex. Or Star Wars for that matter. Hell, there is hardly a story worth telling in literature or cinema that doesn't incorporate this element. The hero is the hero precisely because he is different from everybody else, otherwise he would be an extra in his own story. Some will hate him and some will love him for that and the entire point in storytelling is how the hero's differences eventually play out in the grander scheme of things. <br/><br/>Burton chose to hit the nail right on the head and didn't hesitate from turning individuality, loneliness and the outsider into the central theme of this film. Right after his Batman success and being given essentially free reign to do whatever he wanted, Burton decided he would craft his most personal work. It isn't hard to see there was a lot of input from his own life going into the character of Edward, a man that is doomed to be both highly creative and highly destructive. Scissorhands is a work of love for Burton and it shows.<br/><br/>Story-wise, this isn't but a retelling of Frankenstein. The inventor creates an artificial man but dies before finishing his work, leaving Edward incomplete and all alone. He eventually attempts a foray into the world outside, which reacts as expected in such situations, at first with curiosity, then with suspicion and eventually with persecution. By the end of the movie, the crowd is assembled, pitchforks and torches in hand to claim the monster's head. The moment Edward steps out of his castle on the hill, he becomes the author of his own tragedy. His creativity and talents draw people to him, while at the same time spread jealousy and hatred against him.<br/><br/>Burton and his screenwriter Caroline Thomson manage to turn this story into a live action magic realism piece that doesn't shy away from comedy and manages adeptly its heavy material without going all doom and gloom on us. Many have tried to do magic realism on screen and failed miserably and Scissorhands is one of the few exceptions that does the genre justice. The story starts as a bed-time story, with the simple question ""why does it snow?"" and by the end of the film, under Danny Elfman's masterful score, you finally get your answer in a perfect cinematic circle the equal of Forrest Gump's feather sequence, or Twelve Monkeys. <br/><br/>The main character is brought to life by a captivating Johny Depp, who gives at a very young age a performance that is one of the best of his illustrious career as the tormented protagonist, essentially a silent role, relying mostly on physicality and eye expression. A similarly young and radiant Winona Ryder accompanies him, along with a cast of well known stars like Dianne Wiest and Alan Arkin and even Vincent Price in his farewell performance as the inventor. <br/><br/>Burton was at his creative peak at the time and his vision is fresh and uncompromising, from his Gothic character and set designs to the pal suburbia that hides more dangers than a castle ever could. His directorial prowess here is a sight to behold, with every sequence very thought out and immaculately executed. There are so many scenes in Scissorhands that stand out. The lyrical opening titles, the cookie factory sequence, the Ice Dance, the devastating finale. Or the moment of the inventor's death, where Edward's first touch with his creator only leaves a bleeding wound... perfection.<br/><br/>There is so much talent involved in the making of this movie it is hard to find fault in any department. Collen Atwood would go on to win 3 Oscars and many nominations with her costume designs, Bo Welch is a Burton staple and Richard Halsey was the Oscar winning editor of Rocky. All of them give some of their career best in Scissorhands. The great Stan Winston created the scissor effects. And then there is Danny Elfman, who composed his best score ever to complement this dark masterpiece, arguably one of the best scores of the decade."
"FilmCriticLalitRao","10","2","3","13 August 2015"," Edward Scissorhands : American director Tim Burton has made a fairy tale for viewers of all age groups.
","In American film 'Edward Scissorhands', director Tim Burton has questioned the curious attitudes of a small section of American society. The focus is on the arrival of a young man with some 'special abilities' whose alluring charm has mesmerized everybody. His film describes some people from a small town who are not ready to accept the presence of somebody different in their midst. For 'Edward Scissorhands', a lot of creative imagination has been used especially in depicting how the lead character was created and where he has resided for a long time. As a popular entertainer which has received both critical as well as commercial acclaim, this Tim Burton film is a fairy tale for viewers of all age groups with a lot of potential to learn. It is also a different kind of love story which could not develop due to various differences. The message of this film, if there is any, is very clear : We must learn to live with difference around us."
"schroeder-gustavo","10","2","3","16 July 2015"," This movie hits all the right notes
","Edward Scissorhands is a very unique film. It's dark, funny, sad, Gothic, but most of all, beautiful. The movie is powered by strong performances from Depp and Ryder, in a movie that sends a powerful message on ""judging a book by its cover"". Everything in this movie is so well done: the cinematography using the trademark Burton style using models of the town as seen in Beetlejuice; the acting, the soundtrack, the amazing makeup and costumes, it all fits in perfectly to create what is arguably Burton's best movie. What's most funny about the movie is the town filled with housewives that gossip about pretty much everything and anyone. They are full of themselves and just fake and shallow, but it's presented in a great, funny way. The romance in the movie is also great.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is a masterpiece, a beautiful movie that will transcend and continue to cause emotions on viewers for a long time."
"willcundallreview","9","2","3","3 July 2015"," A sweet film even with dark style
","Rating-9/10<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands, a Tim Burton movie boasting heart, humour and Gothic design, not exactly one film that isn't unique. This is the kind of film that really tugs on the heart but in a way that isn't really sad, Edward is just so sweet(even though he looks kind of dangerous), but the whole point here is that we shouldn't judge based on what someone looks like, a nice message and one I feel Burton gets across well.<br/><br/>The story actually doesn't move that fast, and although things happen, the location is pretty much just one street all the way through. I found Edward to be the person who makes this funny, his new surroundings gives him such a playground of fun, it makes for great scenes. I think really when it comes to the plot it's hard to talk about it in length as mentioned, this really doesn't move much, although definitely fun though.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is Edward and he portrays him well, at times he can seem shaky but that is the thing, Edward is meant to seem awkward and very scared looking, so Depp get's him off to a tee. With the others in this movie none shine more than Depp which works well as he is the star, the acting isn't all top notch but the cast such as Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, and Alan Arkin give it a good go and all work together well with Depp and the awkward personality he gives off.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is truly the man behind this and near all the credit for this needs to go to him, he writes it well but directs it even better, he seems to know exactly what he needs to do and his eye on this is perfect. I think the trademark style of Gothic design coupled with the just overly dark/light juxtapositions make for an interesting watch, it's the kind of movie that is fairly interesting to look at, it should make most enjoy it, but if not, at least engaged.<br/><br/>The emotion that flows through this is very high, I mean Edward isn't exactly the sweetest character ever but it is hard not to like him and he is an extremely intriguing creation too. Again Burton seems to mix that sweet centre with a beautifully dark humour/story, it of course is a film that the family can all watch, but it still contains those more dark themes in the comedy even, but never to the extreme. <br/><br/>Yet again another thing that makes this just awesome is the score, the ever on form Danny Elfman creates a fantastic piece of music and really shows his credentials off well. The way in which the story moves also works well with Elfman's creation, the parts where very little happens but there is a lot of comedy, the score only goes to make this not only more fun, but also create a more emotional experience. <br/><br/>All in all this has to rank as one of Burton's best if not right at the top, this is done oh so well and created in a fashion where you just know, this is top quality. It's not in my opinion hard to dislike though, I think many will feel the style is not to there liking and the story for some may be a slight bit dull but in my opinion, they are neither and this finishes with a unique storyline to boot."
"lisouille","10","2","3","15 June 2015"," A strange but beautiful story !
","General information about the movie:<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is an American movie directed by Tim Burton, written by Caroline Thompson and produced by Denise Di Novi and Tim Burton. This film was directed in 1990, and we can find : Johnny Depp who plays Edward, Winona Ryder as Kim Boggs, Dianne Wiest as Peg Boggs, Alan Arkin as Bill Boggs, Robert Oliver as Kevin Boggs, Anthony Michael Hall as Jim and Vincent Price as the inventor. Edward Scissorhands was the fourth feature film collaboration between the director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman. The orchestra consisted of 79 musicians. The head of the set was Bo Welch. This movie was awarded 12 prizes, the Hugo prize, the Saturn award and many others Edward Scissorhands received critical acclaim from critics and audiences : « A fantastic family show » ; « Straight from the heart a stunning final that knocks you sideway » ; « At once modern and old fashioned, playful and melancholic and exactly right for this most sweety stirring of family shows ». This movie was very successful and in 2008, « Empire » magazine ranked it 66th on the list of 500 best movies of all time !<br/><br/>Personal opinion :<br/><br/>This is a Tim Burton movie, for sure. Tim Burton offers us an incredible fairy tail as only he knows how to do and we like that ! The story is simple but every detail has a meaning ! Edward is not quite a man as he was created by a inventor though he was appalling, is more human that anyone else ! Burton strongly lives up to the hype, though a conformist society and perpetual judgment. It's a poignant and naive tale yet both sad and terrible. Terrible in the accuracy of the representation of jealousy, hypocrisy and wickedness of man, this is the real message of the director in this movie. It's masterfully interpreted, all actors take ownership of their role perfectly but it's sadly funny at times. Tim Burton is a genius in the art of getting you through emotions with a beautiful set but also music that is very well chosen every time. We see some similarities between some of Tim Burton's movies, for example, the house of the hero is often isolated as in Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and Batman."
"moviemattb","10","2","3","12 October 2014"," A Wonderful Fairy Tale
","Tim Burton had made three great movies during the 80s such as ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure;"" ""Beetlejuice;"" and ""Batman."" Now as we enter in the 90s, Burton makes a movie about a man with his hands that are razor sharp scissors and my thoughts on the movie was wonderful. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a wonderful fairy tale that is Gothic; funny; sad; and totally original. This is the first movie that Burton collaborates with Johnny Depp before they go on to make movies together such as ""Ed Wood;"" ""Sleepy Hollow;"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory;"" ""Corpse Bride;"" ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street;"" ""Alice in Wonderland;"" and so far ""Dark Shadows."" Don't know what they will work on next. I know everyone gets sick of Burton for casting Depp and Burton's wife Helena Bonham Carter to be in movies together, but I have no issues with that whatsoever. Anyway, I thought Depp did such a fascinating job for playing the main character of the film's premise. Also, I thought Winona Ryder was really good in her role as Edward's love interest. Anthony Michael Hall and the rest of the cast all did great. I thought Danny Elfman's music was beautifully well scored, and I thought the look of Depp's character is extremely well done. I don't have any problems with the movie, but I know that this movie is one of Burton's greatest achievements. I give ""Edward Scissorhands"" a 10 out of 10. Check it out!"
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","10","2","3","11 October 2014"," Oh, those interfering Avon Ladies...
","What's truly amazing about this movie is not only the wonderful story, but the performances of the actors/actresses. Vincent Price plays one of his final roles as the caring inventor, Winona Ryder plays suburb teenager Kim, Anthony Micheal Hall plays ignorant jock boyfriend Jim, and Johnny Depp does an excellent job playing the Gothic and creative character of Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>When an Avon lady, Peg, goes up to a mansion that everybody usually steers clear of, she is shocked yet curious to find a teenage-looking man with scissors for hands living alone in the mansion. When asked about his parents, he replies, ""he didn't wake up"". Realizing his parents must be dead, she doesn't want to leave him there and takes him home. The family is very accepting, but the gossiping Stepford Wife-like ladies of the neighborhood are not. One in particular, a religious fanatic shut-in named Esmerelda, suspects he may be ""the work of Satan"". As time goes by the neighbors all learn to accept him; he even gives them new creative haircuts and topiary hedge animals. Soon though, when a skank named Joyce tries to seduce him and he refuses since he has no idea what's going on, she claims he raped him to hide the real truth. This sends things in a steady but downward spiral and soon the only one who really loves him is Kim, Peg's teenage daughter, who at first hates him but realizes how much he cares for her when on Christmas she sees a dazzling ice sculpture he has made of her.<br/><br/>Kim's boyfriend Jim becomes jealous and the neighbors get curious, soon the cops are involved, and Edwards only choice is to hide in the mansion. What none of them realize is that Edward was never a person in the same sense a them; he is sentient but he was an invention created by the inventor who owned the house. Before the inventor could give Edward human hands (plastic ones), he dropped dead from a heart attack, Leaving Edward unfinished with very little sense of what the modern world was like. When Kim finds him in the mansion they reunite, but Jim shows up and tries to kill Edward, and Edward's last resort is killing Jim by stabbing him and shoving him out the window. Kim lies to the horrified neighbors, holding up a fake hand and saying Edward has died. Joyce and Esmerelda regretfully look on and realize what they've done, and then everybody leaves forever. Edward is still alive, an elderly Kim reveals to her granddaughter years later, still in the mansion making ice sculptures of Kim decades later.<br/><br/>This movie is incredible, somewhat morbid but still an amazing experience to watch. The soundtrack was beautiful, the characters creative, the scenery surreal and original and the plot is the most original I've heard of in a long time! Edward Scissorhands vaguely reminded me of The Lovely Bones (2009), Gremlins (1985) and American Gothic (1988). It's comedic, dramatic, sad and altogether stunning, one of Tim Burton's best films."
"GusF","Null","2","3","28 September 2014"," A very, very close second to ""Ed Wood"" as my favourite Tim Burton film
","Johnny Depp is simply wonderful as the title character, whose frightening appearance belies the fact that he is an extraordinarily gentle and sweet young man. It also has a very strong supporting cast. Outside of the first scene, Winona Ryder does not appear until 40 minutes into the film but nevertheless makes for a great leading lady. Kim has a great character arc, going from being terrified of Edward to adoring him. In spite of the fact that this happens over quite a brief period of time, it nevertheless seems very believable due to both the excellent writing and Ryder's performance. Anthony Michael Hall, cast against his previous nice, skinny, nerd type in the John Hughes films, makes for a great villain as Jim. <br/><br/>Dianne Wiest and Alan Arkin are excellent as Peg and Bill Boggs and I adored Vincent Prince's cameo as the Inventor, which sadly proved to be his final film appearance. The rest of the cast is very good as well, particularly Kathy Baker and Conchata Ferrell. Burton has a great eye for casting. I don't think that anyone in the film gives a bad performance. Actually, I think that is true of all of the five Burton films that I've watched recently except for ""Planet of the Apes"".<br/><br/>Part of the reason why I think that the film works so well is that Edward resembles the villain of one of the innumerable slasher films released during the 1980s. Burton and the screenwriter Caroline Thompson completely subvert the audience's expectations of Edward in that respect. Edward is such a compelling character because none of his problems are of his own making: they are all as a result of lies, misunderstandings and accidents. They result in him being completely misjudged by the Boggs' neighbours and thereby call attention to the isolation and discrimination often experienced by those who are different. This sense of isolation is also helped by the contrast between Edward's appearance and the Inventor's dark, murky castle on the one hand and the vibrant yellows, greens, reds, blues and pinks of the neighbourhood on the other hand."
"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","Null","2","3","20 June 2008"," Tim Burton, in his best
","Edward Scissorhands achieves the nearly impossible feat of capturing the delicate flavor of a fable or fairy tale in a live-action movie. The story follows a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who was created by an inventor (Vincent Price, in one of his last roles) who died before he could give the poor creature a pair of human hands. Edward lives alone in a ruined Gothic castle that just happens to be perched above a pastel-colored suburb inhabited by bread winning husbands and frustrated housewives straight out of the 1950s. One day, Peg (Dianne Wiest), the local Avon lady, comes calling. Finding Edward alone, she kindly invites him to come home with her, where she hopes to help him with his pasty complexion and those nasty nicks he's given himself with his razor-sharp fingers. Soon Edward's skill with topiary sculpture and hair design make him popular in the neighborhood--but the mood turns just as swiftly against the outsider when he starts to feel his own desires, particularly for Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Most of director Tim Burton's movies (such as Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Batman) are visual spectacles with elements of fantasy, but Edward Scissorhands is more tender and personal than the others. Edward's wild black hair is much like Burton's, suggesting that the character represents the director's own feelings of estrangement and co-option. Johnny Depp, making his first successful leap from TV to film, captures Edward's childlike vulnerability even while his physical posture evokes horror icons like the vampire in Nosferatu and the sleepwalker in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Classic horror films, at their heart, feel a deep sympathy for the monsters they portray; simply and affectingly, Edward Scissorhands lays that heart bare."
"insane-romantic","10","2","3","3 September 2006"," Fantastic!
","I absolutely loved this film. It is the first film in ages where I have gone out and bought it almost as soon as I saw it! Johnny Depp plays Edward so well, and I don't think any other actor could have done the part justice, he is so cute and you can tell how he is feeling all the time, even though he hardly speaks throughout the entire film. I love the message in this film too, that the townspeople are so prejudiced again Edward because he is different although all he did was love. It is a beautiful film, as always from talented director Tim Burton, which is very unique. It is a fairytale film about Love and people, and even though it is unrealistic, I think it has a great message. I love the ending, which makes me cry every time! I would recommend this film to anyone!"
"jmcd7910","10","2","3","2 September 2006"," One of my favorite ten movies ever
","I saw this wonderful movie in 1990 when it first came out. I was already a Tim Burton fan of sorts, but this made me a Burton fanatic. I saw it first with my wife, and I remember thinking at the very beginning, when Danny Elfman's haunting, beautiful score was only a few notes old, that I was going to love this film. And I did. It just hit me right in the heart, in the most vulnerable, deepest part of my soul. I know that sounds pretentious, but it's the best I can do with my limited writing ability. Now understand, I was 39 years old at the time, a pipefitter/welder by trade, certainly not someone people would think of as ""sensitive"" or ""artistic"" by nature. I've been in more than my share of fistfights, ride a Harley, and love guns, power tools, and anything that explodes. But by the end of Edward Scissorhands, especially at the Ice Dance scene, I was sobbing like a little girl. My wife had to help me out of the theatre, because my eyes were so tear-swollen I could barely see. I admit I have a weakness for characters that are outsiders, or (to borrow from Heinlein) ""strangers in a strange land"", but what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp did with this scissor-handed man was nothing short of magical. I took my 16 year old daughter to see it the next day, and I started tearing up at the beginning this time, knowing what was coming. As we left the theatre, Liz was stone-faced, and I was desperately clenched against the flood of emotion I was holding back. I didn't want to look like a fool in front of her. When we got into the sunlight, we looked at each other, and I saw that she was trying as hard as me not to break down. Which is exactly what we both proceeded to do, right there in front of the theatre. We held each other and sobbed. And I felt closer to her than I had in a long time. Thank you, Tim Burton, for that moment."
"deppburtonphan","10","2","3","22 August 2006"," A tragically beautiful film!
","Even after several viewings, this film still moves me to tears! It's the story of Edward, a normal human being who came to be in a not-so-normal way. The man who created him, whose name we never find out, died right before he was to replace his shears for real hands.<br/><br/>Edward is all alone for who knows how long. Then one day, Peg Boggs, the local Avon agent, notices Edward's mansion on the top of the hill in her rear-view mirror, and decides to investigate.<br/><br/>After climbing several flights of stairs, she discovers Edward in the attic, all alone and incomplete. Out of the goodness of her heart, she takes him back to her picturesque neighborhood.<br/><br/>The neighbors, used to a life of routine and so-called ""perfection"" just can't quite embrace him. His hands mask who he really is. Only the Boggs family can see past his scissorhands.<br/><br/>After several events, Edward is forced to flee the neighborhood, where he is followed by Kim, Peg's daughter. After a fight with Kim's overly-possessive ex-boyfriend, Kim then tells Edward those three little words that mean so much: I love you. She then leaves the mansion, never to see him again.<br/><br/>Edward ends up all alone again. It's the tragic tail of a broken heart that opened up to the world, only to end up back where he started.<br/><br/>The ending is heart-wrenching, the story wonderfully surreal, and by far one of Johnny Depp's best performances. If you have not seen this movie, you must! Trust me, you won't regret it!"

","I watched this movie long time ago, not long after it was filmed, when I had about 10 years, and I loved it. But of course at that time I liked many movies and cartoons, that I don't like anymore at all. So recently I decided to watch this movie again, even though I was expecting disappointment. But it didn't happen. This is one of the rare movies that I liked then, and I still love now - I only have forgotten how good it really was - to me maybe even better now then it was before. It's just a beautiful story. Some people said that this is totally unrealistic film. Of course it is! What did you expect? It's not supposed to be realistic. Why should it be explained how exactly was he created? Does The lord of the rings explain where exactly is middle earth supposed to be? It's also not supposed to be a comedy or horror, it is just supposed to be a story, a story so touching that my eyes got wet many times in the film. It's also a moral film that teaches you shouldn't judge others by the way they look. But most of all it is a love story - pure and innocent love that happens so rarely. He couldn't even touch her, but he would do anything for her - even let her go... When Edward says that he knew it was Bill's house all along and then Kim asked; ""so why did you do it then?"" and he answers: ""because you said so"". This part of movie really blew me away. If you haven't watched this film yet, then what are you waiting for?"

","This was such an excellent movie. I'd say one of Tim Burton's best, actually. It kept you interested throughout the whole film. One of Johnny Depp's best performances. Throughout the whole movie, I kept thinking, ""I feel really bad for Edward. I feel really bad for what he gets into and all that."" All and all, I really think that this is one of the best films I have ever seen. I've seen what kind of movies Tim Burton makes and this is just one of them. It's funny, it's creepy, it's sort of Gothic in a way, but what I mean is, it really sums up what the movie should be like. Burton's personality fits the film perfectly. Also, Johnny Depp's acting style. I think this is a good role for Johnny. He makes Edward look so innocent and caring, when the character actually already is. It's really great acting. Johnny just portrays the character so well. It's perfect, really."

I like the way how it is about a boy who is trying to fit in, and wants to fit in, but no matter how hard he tries to try and put his differences aside he can't, it relates to anyone who has ever felt left out at school or anywhere else.

"lilacpilgrim-1","10","2","3","26 July 2006"," Beautiful, wonderfully written...
","If you haven't seen this film yet, you must be insane because this film is a true cinematic masterpiece. Edward is found by Peg, the local Avon representative, when she goes up to the mansion/castle he lives in to look for customers. Seeing that he is all alone (his father, the Inventor ""never woke up"") and has frighteningly large scissors in place of hands, she decides to bring him home so that she can give him a new lease of life. When Edward arrives, the quiet little neighbourhood goes into a frenzy over the sweet, innocent young man who has scissors for hands. However, falling in love with Peg's daughter and getting in with the wrong crowd gets Edward into trouble, and things can only get worse... Edward Scissorhands is one of Tim Burton's best creations, and deserves more than 10 out of 10. The acting is all very good, especially from Johnny Depp as Edward, and Vincent Price's small part as The Inventor. It is so symbolic - Edward reaches out for help, but who would be willing to take his scissors in their hands? The part in which the Inventor dies when presenting his creation with his set of hands, skewering them onto Edward's scissors as he collapses really shows that Edward will never be 'normal', he will never be finished without them. Like other young people, he wants to be normal, and when he is presented with the chance to get real, normal hands, he is excited, but unfortunately, he never gets the chance. That is very symbolic of the young person's wish to change, just to be like everyone else, and the painful realisation that it cannot be done. Edward's scissor-hands reflect differences in people that make others unwilling to accept, and many young people feel the same way as Edward does. I believe that this wonderfully spectacular film represents the situation in which a society is unwilling to accept people who they feel are different, something I think we can all relate to."
"schwamme","10","2","3","20 July 2006"," Beautiful but rough life!
","I would consider this one of the best Tim Burton's movies ever! Why? It has a little bit of everything. People may think, after hearing the name of Tim Burton, that his movies are too much filled with fantasy and things that has nothing to do with life. That all of them are quite alike because almost in every Burton's movie you can see Johnny Depp's face. But you know what I would say to those people? - Have you seen more than too Burton's movies? And I wouldn't be surprised to hear answer - no! Because if you have seen many Burton's movies you can agree with me at this - each and every movie, keeping it's fantasies level still is different from each other in a great way. Even though you see Depp's appearance in many movies, they're still not the same. And it's the same with this movie - Edward Scissorhands. The small town, where the movie takes place, is so colorful, so not real kind of stylish and that's maybe the thing that makes us think - what the hell are we watching? But at the moment when you see Edward, everything changes. From the looks of him, you would think he is rough, ugly and bad, bad character. But after few moments you understand that he is the innocent, sweet, mild and sensitive thing! All his life has been outsiders life. Living up on the hill, all by himself. Spending each day like the other. When he's brought down to the little town, he actually realizes the beauty of the outer world. But still not understanding how rough can it be. How it can judge you, not even knowing you. I think this movie shows us better than the others, how rough the life is. How senseless people can be. The true feelings about this film isn't writable. So all that I can say - WATCH this movie and it will open a new page in your life. New page in your mind and heart."

He is an outcast, only out casted because although he has a heart and a brain, he has never been taught the meanings and principles of the real world.<br/><br/>All the way through this film you feel for Edward as he learns to live in suburbia, one of Burton's most bold coloured set that I have ever seen, as he is accepted by the family and the neighbourhood until Beauty kills the beast, a sub story is that he falls for Winona Ryder but things happen and one thing that he doesn't need teaching is that a heart can be broken.<br/><br/>A creepily emotional story as you go through curious, cheerfulness, acceptance, anger and upsetting, a story that makes you wish that something could be done and even knowing the film is not real you still feel it is."

I wish that Tim Burton could make more films like this besides Big Fish or Planet Of The Apes, which were eggs not yet ready to hatch. I do not have any cons with the film, I still cry at the ending. If you ever get tired of this film, then let give it to me, because I'll never be tired of Edward Scissorhands, let me see, watch and love it forever. It is simply wonderful and it shows how talented Tim Burton is."
"neon47","10","2","3","5 May 2006"," Burton's untouchable.
","Some movies will never have an equal, some just shine above the rest untouched by everything else. Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands is one of those. The cast is great with Johnny Depp as Edward Scissorhands and Vincent Price as his creator (and also in his last role ever). Edward is an artificial human who was perfect in almost every way, left unfinished by the untimely death of his creator, only known as The Inventor, with scissors for hands. After living by himself for awhile, Edward is discovered and taken home to experience a world outside of The Inventor's lab and thus begins his adventures. Edward's fable is told like a children's story, starting off with a child lying in bed and the grandma telling her about where the snow comes from. Tim Burton shows his imagination at its best here. While The Nightmare Before Christmas was really good, Edward Scissorhands still stands as his strongest film. If any of Burton's movies are to go down as classics this will be the one. Brilliant."
"Lt_Coffey_182","8","2","3","19 October 2005"," Burton's Great Tragedy
","This was Johnny Depp's breakthrough performance, the first of his many offbeat roles and his first collaboration with Tim Burton. Edward (Depp) is an unfinished creation who has blades where his hands should be and has been living in solitude since the inventor who made him (Vincent Price) died. This all changes when a certain Avon lady calls.<br/><br/>Edward's introduction to the neighbourhood is done with great humour, when he bangs his head against the car window is one of my favourite film moments. Tim Burton is on top form regarding the village and its inhabitants. The landscape is vibrant and imaginative and all the villagers are quirky in their own special way.<br/><br/>Edward's inevitable downfall and the villagers' rejection of him when things go wrong encourages great sympathy from the audience and is also where Edward's live in family shine. Alan Arkin and Diane Weist are both good actors and handle their roles very well. The romance between Edward and Winona Rider's character is very poignant and diverts this film from comedy to tragedy very quickly.<br/><br/>This is possibly Johnny Depp's best performance. He is terrific at portraying a character unsure how to convey emotion and shows a great sense of innocence. The naivety of Edward is what makes the audience love him despite it making him vulnerable to Jim's anger and Joyce's advances.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score does well to add to the dark element of the film and makes it a lot more like a fairy tale. In my opinion, this is Tim Burton's best film and wonderfully captures the imagination of adults and children. The film does well to provoke emotional extremes and lasts in the mind for a long time after being watched."
"FrankBooth_DeLarge","9","2","3","10 September 2005"," Much like the title character, a bit odd around the edges, but inside, it has a good story and a great message
","Edward Scissorhands is Tim Burton's masterpiece. He is a visual genius who can create unique images and weave a great story into all of it.<br/><br/>The story follows Edward Scissorhands. He was created by an inventor who lives in a castle, but was never given hands because the inventor died before he could finish him. He was uncompleted, but had scissors as hands(hence the name ""Edward Scissorhands""). One day, a local woman finds him and brings him home. She tries to teach Edward the normal ways of their suburban life, but he has a hard time fitting in. He discovers a talent for trimming hedges into shapes, and later he discovers a talent for grooming. Despite being useful for these types of things, he isn't looked at in a positive light by the local neighbors. Edward tries and tries, but finds it very hard to fit in with the everyone else.<br/><br/>This is a great film. One can easily look at the cover and think it's a weird film, but you have to really look beyond the oddness and realize the great message and great story that is being told. <br/><br/>The cast is great, with an exceptional performance by Johnny Depp. Anthony Michael Hall makes a different turn with his acting and image. In Weird Science and The Breakfast club, he plays the nerdy character. In this, he plays the tough guy character who is more of a nerd torturer.<br/><br/>There are a lot of moving moments in this movie. There is also an underlying love story, and there's a great message about looking beyond someone's surface and looking deep inside to realize what they are really like.<br/><br/>Like Tim Burton's other films, this is a visual treat to look at. Every shot is like magic, the way everything looks is fantastic. Every moment in this film is great, and many of the moments are very moving.<br/><br/>The film is dark, like Tim Burton's other films, but at the same time, it is a beautifully told story, and it even has some underlying humor. <br/><br/>This is easily one of Tim Burton's best films. If you want to see more great films by Tim Burton, I recommend Beatle Juice, Batman, and The Nightmare Before Christmas."

","My favorite Tim Burton movie, ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a once-in-a-generation fable that has stood the test of time. Its charming, haunting score and set design are just as striking upon repeat viewings as they are to new viewers, thanks to director Tim Burton's facility with visual narrative conventions and remarkable attention to detail. However, this movie wouldn't work nearly as well as it does were it not for Johnny Depp's touching central performance: Tender, sensitive and unique, it's the type of performance that could have gone wrong in someone else's hands and ruined the movie, but instead managed to become the movie's signature triumph."

","THE masterpiece of the master himself, Tim Burton!<br/><br/>In the beginning you get a strange feeling when you see the setting of the village and the behavior of the people who live in it. You soon realize that this is not going to be the standard movie that you are used to watch. When Edward (Johnny Depp) appears, you just know for sure that this will be a special movie. What follows is a magical spectacle about an extraordinary man who can do extraordinary things with his scissors as fingers. A movie full of humor, tolerance and love. It seems like a place where everything is perfect... until the drama strikes and everything that I just summed up will be in jeopardy.<br/><br/>Let me talk about Johnny Depp. Does it still have to be said that Johnny Depp is the most fantastic actor to play this kind of role? I don't like to see him play roles that are ordinary and close to the usual, but I see him so eager to play roles that have something abnormal.<br/><br/>The vision of Tim Burton, the acting of Johnny Depp and the soundtrack of Danny Elfman ensure that this is the family film that you can watch on Christmas Day. Every time, it leaves a warm feeling that won't escape you!"

","It's tough now, to look back and imagine a time when Tim Burton was a gothic indie darling and Johnny Depp an enigmatic underexposed young actor, but indeed once they were - and Edward Scissorhands is probably the apex of that time in both their careers. Having not seen it for quite a while, a recent one night cinema showing gave me the opportunity to reappraise it as the jaded adult that I am now. <br/><br/>Peggy Boggs (Dianne Wiest) decides to visit the grim dilapidated mansion that towers over the American suburban estate where she resides, as part of her Avon cosmetics round. There she discovers Edward (Depp), a creation of the inventor who previously owned the mansion, who passed away before he could provide Edward with the human hands to replace the scissors that make up his current appendages. Though Edward is initially popular in the suburbs, misunderstanding and prejudice soon start to raise their heads, particularly around Peggy's teenage daughter (Winona Ryder). <br/><br/>The film really in unmistakably Tim Burton. The decision to use practical sets and models rather than CGI was a good choice, as the film still looks great. Maybe the aging prosthetics on Ryder in the opening and closing wrap around scenes doesn't look that impressive, given what CG can do there - but that's the exception rather than the rule. There's an unreal fantasy aspect to the town and its looming impossibly stylised mountain range that is beautiful and memorable. The costume and hair design is brilliant too. Danny Elfman's score too is another iconic collaboration with Burton, though he chooses a more orchestral and sweeping pieces here, over the ""Plinky Plonky"" themes he was often providing at the time. <br/><br/>The story is a little undercooked, a variation on both ""Frankenstein"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" it could have done with another couple of moments to heighten the believability of the love story, and the way that the town turns on Edward, once he rejects the advances of Kathy Baker's bored housewife. The script though is good and often laugh out loud funny. Alan Arkin steals a lot of the film as Peg's husband, entirely nonplussed about the events going on around him. Vincent Price too, with his glorious cadence is great in his scenes. <br/><br/>Sad both in terms of the actual plot and when viewed against the triumvirate of misfires Burton would direct, the lost years of Winona Ryder's career and the eventual overexposure of Depp; ""Edward Scissorhands"" is imperfect but beautiful. Timeless but evocative of that period in Burton's career. Artificial yet genuine and you should definitely see it."

So all these years later I decided I needed to finally check it out and am very happy I did. Far from perfect there is still a lot to enjoy about this film: Danny Elfman's score is magical and moving, Johnny Depp is actually quite good, and Diane Wiest in fantastic. The sets, costumes, and overall look is fun and interesting. Yes, this film touched many emotions, it's funny, sad, and moving altogether.

Newly invited into the conservative community, problems begin to arise.<br/><br/>You can clearly see that this film is supposed to serve as a parabola rather than a realistic plot. It succeedsin creating great emotions towards the main character and his fateful love for the daughter of the family. Personally, I didn't like the set design all too much, but that's just a question of preferences and you can clearly see the typical Tim Burton style shimmering through. The story is not really creative or innovative but it is told nicely and the acting is great.<br/><br/>All in all this is not a must-see but it can serve as an example what exclusion can cause in people and how we are all responsible for creating a society that is worth living in."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Edward Scissorhands (1990)<br/><br/>The movie that started the long-running Tim Burton/Depp collaboration. This movie is not just one of my favourite Depp or Burton movies, it's one of my favourite of the decade. I LOVE it.<br/><br/>Tim Burton was one of my new favourite directors when he made this. Thanks to Beetlejuice in 1988 and Batman the year after, I was already a fan when he made this classic. I don't think he put a foot wrong for over a decade. And it was this movie, that made me a fan of Depp.<br/><br/>Personally, I think Depp should have been nominated for an Oscar. He is superb. In fact, I think Burton, Dianne Wiest, Danny Elfman's score and the movie itself should have been nominated. As it was, it's sole nomination was for Best Makeup.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder (who began dating Depp during filming, and would become engaged) is fine and Conchata Ferrell is an actress I adore and Anthony Michael Hall is perfectly cast as the movies bad boy.<br/><br/>I think the movie is so touching and moving, it's a joy. Depp himself stated that he ""cried like a baby"" when he first read the script. At the time of his casting, Depp was wanting to break out of the teen idol status which his performance in 21 Jump Street had given him. Fox executives were so worried about Edward's image, that they tried to keep pictures of Depp in full costume under wraps until the release of the film. To prepare for his role, Johnny Depp watched the films of silent movie actor Charles Chaplin to get an idea of how to emote without dialogue. This would also come in handy a few movies later. <br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands grossed $56 million dollars at the domestic box office to end 1990 as the 20th highest grossing movie of the year."

"aaronlbacks","8","1","1","25 December 2017"," Fantastic Movie From the Mind of Tim Burton
","Tim Burton crafted a wondrous and fantastical character in Edward (Johnny Depp) that directly contrasts and exposes the flaws in the mundanity and repetitiveness of suburbia. This contrast is first noticed, quite humorously, in the looming, dilapidated, haunted house on a hill lurking just at the end of the neighborhood's cul-de-sac. Peg (Dianne Wiest), a loving Avon saleslady, approaches and enters the mansion in hopes for a sale, and comes across the frightening Edward sitting in a corner with blades for fingers - a result of the inventor's (Vincent Price) sudden death. What sounds to be a cheap horror slasher movie ends up being a heartwarming tale as the town accepts (mostly) Edward for his unique hedge trimming and haircutting talents. It's not until Edward is unintentionally framed in a misdemeanor that people begin to doubt that the scissors are for good. Peg's daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder), is the only one to see through to Edward's good intentions, but that does not stop the town from going on a rampage, driving Edward to accidentally kill someone and supposedly commit suicide as well. 
It displays an interesting commentary on society as a whole. Unique traits will be heralded when they are used to promote the well-being of everyone, but if the trait is misinterpreted, they will be cast away just as quickly. It's well intended that Edwards hands are made of blades, an instrument that is firstly seen as a dangerous tool and secondly as an artist's paintbrush. And it's well intended it is Edward's hands that are the affected area because hands are the most human of all body parts and he cannot physically embrace or connect with someone, representing the distance between him and everyone else. People wish to use Edward for their own gains first rather than to spend time with his as a fellow human being. But in a very beautiful twist of fate, Kim hugs him tightly and kisses him, showing that there is hope for those who are born differently. 
A lot of care obviously went into set design and costume design, especially for Edward and his hands. I often wondered during the movie how they crafted the prosthetics to have moving fingers and the scissors to still be operable. Most characters were well written, except for Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) I think because his motivations felt a little underwhelming or confusing at times. Sometimes it felt as if he was needed more as a plot point to drive the story forward, especially at the end. I think if the story shifted the main antagonist to the society as a whole in which they lived, it could have ended on a more satisfying and introspective note. But either way, that's still a minor gripe. I also saw the ending monologue coming from a mile away. Overall, I really enjoyed it and it made me tear up a little, and that is always a plus."

","Of all the horrendous ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" films I've had to watch this December, I'm so glad to be back to a truly wonderful film. I admit it is kind of a stretch to call this a Christmas movie. It is featured, but it's not very relevant to the plot. Still, it's in there and I wanted to see something good and boy was I rewarded! It's a great film for any occasion. What I was impressed by this movie was how it really wasn't that dark. Tim Burton was known for being dark in his movies but this one wasn't really that sinister.<br/><br/>Okay, it gets worse near the end and it's not really a feel good movie, but I truly found myself rooting for the characters in this. Most of the people in this movie are in fact quite nice. The story is that a scientist created a human but died before he could give him hands leaving him with literal scissor hands. The flashback where it shows him dying is probably the best part of the movie. He was just about to give him normal hands but died at the last minute. For a good portion of the movie, people are rather accepting of Edward.<br/><br/>The ending's pretty bittersweet but it doesn't have a hopeless atmosphere and for the most part, Edward learns how to use his scissor hands to adjust to society. I admit that the romance wasn't that well written. It's still great because honestly, everyone really does work hard to act realistic in this movie. As realistic as a movie about a guy with scissors for hands could be. It's not really far on the fantasy scale and often just tries to paint a picture of common American suburbia. It's a rather quaint movie with great performances by Johnny Depp and everyone else. ****"

Paired with an enrapturing soundtrack makes this film a modern day (at the time) fairy tale that will capture your attention and never let it go.<br/><br/>There is a hint of magic and sadness and innocence and danger throughout the narrative while people first go around their normal lives and then try to get to know this mysterious character.<br/><br/>The colour details are simply mesmerising. The gaudy coloured houses and cars, the lawns and dogs and everything that makes this the perfect neighbourhood where lonely housewives don't have much to do but gossip. Everything is bright and everyone is the caricature of happiness, but in a very realistic manner, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>As soon as things begin to turn darker for Edward, so do the colours around him. Then of course there is the magical scene of Winona Ryder dancing in the 'snow' and the crescendo up to the gruesome finale just sucks you in. The eeriness that kept creeping with the mansion's flashbacks finally culminates into a very broken heart for yours truly.<br/><br/>It is not meant to be a realistic story.

","I had never seen this movie, I shied away from it because I don't normally enjoy Tim Burton, but this was a wonderful fairy tale with a lot of emotional depth. Edward is a gentle soul, sheltered away from society until a kind lady happens upon him in his castle and takes him home. The mom, Peg, is who we should all strive to emulate, because she immediately accepts Edward despite his ""differentness"". Her love for Edward as a son remains steadfast, even when the whole town turns against him. Speaking of the town, it's a microcosm of every type of person in society. You have the town ""whore"", the religious nut, the busybody and gossip. They all admire Edward at first, because of his talent for gardening and cutting hair (both human and animal). He is somewhat of a curiosity to the people of the quiet little town, and they all want a piece of Edward's time, so they can say ""I'm his friend"" But it's all for appearances and not real admiration. Things soon turn badly for Edward though, because of a few misunderstandings. He saves a little boy's life from being hit by a drunk driver, but in the process of doing so, injures and scares him with his scissor hands. This quickly turns into a witch-hunt, and the whole town adopts a mob mentality. The ending was quite poignant, not how I would have wanted it to end, but it's Tim Burton, you can't have a happy ending. It ended the way it should have though, if that makes any sense. The whole story is one of tragedy, love and the realization that maybe people who are that different really can't live in a society that is so caught up in appearances."
"JamesHitchcock","9","1","1","15 January 2017"," There's a pink one and a green one and a blue one and a yellow one..
","""Edward Scissorhands"" is a variation on the Frankenstein legend, relocated from Europe to American suburbia, or perhaps I should say to an exaggerated parody of American suburbia. It is presumably set in either Florida or Southern California, as we learn that the ocean is not far away and it is the sort of place where people can walk about in shirt sleeves even at Christmas. The set designer seems to have been given a brief to produce something straight out of Malvina Reynolds' song ""Little Boxes"". This is a community whose inhabitants do indeed live in little boxes made of ticky-tacky which (apart from colour) all look just the same, and as in the song there's a pink one and a green one and a blue one and a yellow one..<br/><br/>Dominating this otherwise flat and boring community is a hill crowned by an eerie Gothic mansion, the home of an elderly, eccentric inventor who, like Frankenstein, is working on an artificial human. Unfortunately, the old man dies before he can finish his creation, whom he has named Edward, leaving him with scissor blades instead of hands. (Why the inventor should have wanted to fit Edward with scissor blades in the first place is never explained, but fantasy is a film genre which enjoys a certain exemption from the laws of logic).<br/><br/>The film explains what happens when Edward is discovered by an Avon lady named Peg Boggs and adopted into her family. (Did Tim Burton realise that ""bog"" is British slang for lavatory?) Although Edward has no hands as we would understand the term, his scissor blades mean that he is an expert at anything involving cutting or chopping, and he is able to earn a living as a hairdresser (catering for both the local housewives and their dogs) and as a gardener, carving hedges into elaborate topiary sculptures. He also has a sideline in ice sculpture.<br/><br/>At first Edward is a popular figure in the neighbourhood, but then two incidents turn local opinion against him. Joyce, a middle-aged housewife, tries unsuccessfully to seduce him, and then goes about saying he tried to rape her. Edward is then arrested after Jim, the unpleasant boyfriend of Peg's daughter Kim, tricks him into taking part in a burglary. Although Edward is released, hostility eventually reaches such a point that he is forced to take refuge in his original home, the old mansion on the hill, where he is confronted by an angry mob led by Jim. (By rights Jim should be grateful to Edward, who has never revealed his part in the burglary, but he is jealous of a growing attraction between Edward and Kim).<br/><br/>The film begins and ends with an elderly woman telling the story of Edward to her granddaughter; at the end it is revealed that the old woman is Kim Boggs, which implies that these scenes must take place around the year 2050. Burton does not, however, give them a futuristic look; indeed, they look very traditional, emphasising the fairy-tale nature of his story.<br/><br/>This is one of my two favourite Tim Burton films, the other being ""Big Fish"" which also has a leading character named Edward. The two Edwards, however, are very different, as are the films in which they appear, even though both can be classed as fantasies. The Edward of ""Big Fish"" is much older, a jovial old extrovert, an adventurer and a teller of tall tales, a modern-day Baron Munchausen. ""Big Fish"" has a happy ending and is outward-looking in the sense that Edward's adventures take him all over the world. ""Edward Scissorhands"", by contrast, ends poignantly and is inward-looking, with all the action taking place in one small community.<br/><br/>This was probably the film which made Johnny Depp a major star, and in my view it remains one of his best performances. He made the role so much his own that it is strange to think that he was not the first choice; that was Tom Cruise, who was not available. Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks both turned down the part; after seeing the completed film Oldman was to state that he regretted his decision. Depp's Edward, unlike his namesake in ""Big Fish"", is a shy, withdrawn young man, socially awkward and introverted. (His unkempt hair and pallid complexion suggest an affinity with the Goth movement). For all his awkwardness, however, he is good-hearted and capable of love, something which Kim instinctively recognises. (Jim has never loved anyone or anything except himself). The other notable performances come from Dianne Wiest as the kindly Peg and Vincent Price, in his last feature film appearance, as the inventor, who is seen in flashback. Depp's real-life girlfriend Winona Ryder as Kim makes a sweet heroine, although someone should have told Burton that the lovely Winona looks a lot better as a brunette than she does as a reddish blonde.<br/><br/>""Edward Scissorhands"" deals with a number of interrelated themes- self-discovery, the search for personal identity, social conformism, disability, the nature of artistic creativity and the problems of those who are perceived as ""different"" by society, but fortunately Burton and his co-scriptwriter Caroline Thompson deal with these weighty themes in a relatively light, poetic manner and not in a heavy-handed or preachy one. There is also a fine musical score from Danny Elfman. This is one of those films you can discover more in every time you see it. 9/10"
"Hitchcoc","9","1","1","29 December 2016"," We Hate What We Can't Understand
","This has all the wonderful qualities of true fantasy. It is a story that becomes timeless of an artificial creature who is unfinished by his creator. Edward would have been like a human if his maker had not passed away. He ends up with sharp scissors instead of hands. Because he is quite docile and mute, he is taken in by a family and loved. But his strange being causes others to reject and vilify him. Whenever anything happens concerning his hands, it is immediately assumed that he had evil intent. Johnny Depp plays Edward with a true sensitivity that resounds in the film. He becomes a love interest for one character. This part of humanity is beyond his thought processes. Others want to be rid of him although one wonders what sort of threat he offers. Everything eventually comes to a head when the world seems to turn against him and he returns to the place of his ""birth."" This is an outstanding, original film."

","first of all by the end of this movie i was trying my level best to hold in my tears, had me really choked up inside. a remarkable movie about feeling belonged, isolation, sticking true to yourself and most of all finding love in the place where you least expected. this movie is about the innocence of a man as he tries to feel connected with the world around him, in the way he'll meet some really selfish nasty people, but as he soon realized there is more good in the world which makes it all worth it. as much as he wanted to feel belonged, i cant help but feel the most visceral emotional bond form with a fictional character in the entirety of my existence.

"Leofwine_draca","6","1","1","31 October 2016"," A highlight of Burton's early career
","I'm not a huge fan of director Tim Burton although I seem to have seen all of his movies over the years aside from his early shorts and his most recent couple of offerings. I saw EDWARD SCISSORHANDS years ago and liked it for the fairy tale ambiance and allegoric story about being an outsider and the search for acceptance into society.<br/><br/>Watching it nowadays, I'm pleased to report that EDWARD SCISSORHANDS holds up a lot more than Burton's contemporary work like BEETLEJUICE. It's a film which is sentimental without ever being sickening, and oddly heart-warming in places. It's not a perfect film because I found the depiction of suburban America to be too derivative and over the top to work (and it's been done far better in the likes of THE STEPFORD WIVES and even DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES). The supporting performances are over the top and the less I saw of Winona Ryder's supposedly sweet love interest the better.<br/><br/>Still, there's good stuff here too. Johnny Depp is good, there's no denying it; he's hidden inside his character and playing it quite subdued without any of the annoying attention-seeking that would come to blight his career. The cameo from old-timer Vincent Price is heart-warming and oddly upsetting given how close to death he was at the time of filming. I enjoyed the darkness and tragedy inherent in the storyline and the ending is particularly strong. Watch out for former geek Anthony Michael Hall, now unrecognisable playing a jock - what a change!"

Edward Scissorhands is a unique character, so lovely and beautiful despite his grim dark looking. Innocence defines him best. The whole movie scene puts together all society sins: false news, preconception, lies, harness, greed, cruel intentions towards good intentions.

The beginning and End, he is alone. It means he is loneliness. He looks like people, but he is not real people. I think it is also indicates loneliness. The audience may sympathize with Edward. People live in that city are afraid of Edward although there is no evidence which Edward is dangerous. It is too bad situation. I think this situation sometimes exists in modern society.

He is rescued and also the neighborhood folks become suspicious of the new guy in town. He can cut alright just but anything.

","Tim Burton at his best as he not only directs this but was one of the writers. The ultimate ode to the oddball. Whoever you are and in whatever quality you may've been treated wrong because you were different, whether for race, creed, religion or whatever, this will speak volumes to you. This is one of these pieces that urges to show the viewer who the real monsters are, and where true beauty really lies, and in a way that applies to so many situations in the daily life. But this isn't easy, self-indulgent or gratuitous. From the pastel-colored neighborhood and houses, to the utter uniformity of its people from the way their dress to the way they behave, the conform/biased understanding of right and wrong... both highly interesting and applicable food for thought. The story is so perfectly crafted to accommodate its plan, and it never lets out; we're given about 1hr45 of strongly crafted, constantly renewed plot and story, with each scene and more largely each section depicting a particular emotion, lesson or deep symbol. This is only strengthened by excellent score music from Elfman, in parts highly moving, and visually the film is greatly and so delicately poetic all the while being so unique and authentic. No film had ever felt like Edward Scissorhands, and no film has since."

Directed by Tim Burton, has a screenplay by Caroline Thompson and counts on the participation of Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder.<br/><br/>This film is a modern Christmas tale and, for a decade, was very broadcast on televisions around this time of year. The story is very beautiful and touching, and makes us think about issues such as the right to be different from others, the difference between being and seeming, the exaggerated importance we give to appearances and the little importance we give to what is genuine, and how our society corrupts what is naturally good (Rousseau revisited?). Despite it usually have a parental rating accessible to children, this film seems to have been designed for public since the age of ten. The cast is reasonable but not surprising, except for Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, actors who had, in this movie, the first major opportunity to shine, and where Depp inaugurated a long and fruitful partnership with Burton, which lasts until today. The photography and the visual effects are very good. The sets and costumes are interesting, helping to get the message proposed in the film, and the soundtrack is marked by the main theme, composed by Danny Elfman.

Not just that; the fact that the teens in the movie allegedly led Edward to his ultimate demise. Its a sad and poignant movie.

After receiving the DVD I first carefully watched it with the Director's commentary, then Danny Elfman's (composer of the musical score) commentary, then the original theatrical release. That's well over five hours and it took me several days, but I was reminded of the film's creativity, beauty, over-the-top production design, and sweet story. Twenty-five years later Johnny Depp has gone on to be a big movie star, other actors in this film have become better known (including the ubiquitous but always watchable Alan Arkin), and Vincent Price has sadly left this earth.

"OllieSuave-007","9","1","1","9 October 2015"," A mysterious, intriguing and uplifting Tim Burton film!
","This is one film you will have to suspend reality and let your imagination run wild with. Tim Burton directs one of his most iconic films, a story about a man named Edward (Johnny Depp) who was created by a scientist who left him unfinished, leaving Edward a near-complete man with scissors for hands.<br/><br/>Edward lives in isolation in a mysterious, dark castle on top of a mountain, which overlooks a quiet, simple, Utopia-like suburb. It's pretty intriguing having an isolated castle located near a normal community, providing a taste of mystery and suspense for the characters in the film and to those watching the movie. When Avon lady Peg (Dianne West) visits the castle in hopes of getting a sale, she instead grows interested in Edward's well-being and brings him back home. It's heart-warming that the kind Peg shows passion to a completely strange person and it's fun seeing Edward show his skills and tricks to the community, from him making grass sculptures to giving the women haircuts with his scissorhands.<br/><br/>It is also nice seeing the chemistry between Edward and Kim (Winona Ryder), brilliantly played and uplifting, and the friction between Edward and Kim's boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall) eventually leads to the more serious misadventures and bad doers in the movie. But, this film shows us that humanity and understanding exist in the world and kind souls do prevail over evil in some way, even though ***spoiler ahead*** not all stories end up happily ever after. I just wished some of the evil-doers got a taste of their own medicine and Edward got cut with some more slack ***spoiler ends*** <br/><br/>Overall, it's a film with great acting, great music score by Danny Elfman, great direction by Tim Burton and a well-paced story.<br/><br/>Grade A-"
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","1","6 October 2015"," The beauty of horror
","That's probably the first really great and creative film by Tim Burton. He used a very young Johnny Depp who is marvelous and surprising in composure, retained and controlled emotions just as if he had none and was feeling nothing. It is true that the fact he has no hands makes his body language a little bit deficient. But his face has to be emotionless too and only his eyes express some human feeling. His nature is not exactly sure, certified and guaranteed. Is he an artificial man like the creature of Frankenstein? Vincent Price was a specialist of that kind of horror movies with ""The hilarious House of Frankenstein,"" but also and above all the films adapted from Edgar Allen Poe and other authors in that line of human horror. So as a mad scientist he fits the role.<br/><br/>But Tim Burton was following a line that was common in many stories of haunted old castles and mansions and that Stephen King at that time was making famous in literature: not the mad scientist but the haunted house at the top of a hill surrounded by some suburban neighborhood. The mad scientist is just one more Dr Frankenstein building, fabricating, constructing a human creature though he does not have time to finish him: he has no hands and has scissors and blades of all sorts instead. But that's not the real subject of the story. The real subject is the contact of this man and the human society in which he is nearly by accident introduced. Surprisingly enough he can cope, at least not too badly, and he finds some simple middle way, meeting area where he can be of service and thus be accepted.<br/><br/>At this moment there is a bitter and sharp criticism of suburban America that can only accept a difference if it is interesting, meaning without any danger or risk, and if it can be useful for their own needs and interests, mainly financial. The point is that this suburban community is reduced to the wives of the community with a couple of children, a couple of teenagers and a couple of men. Sexist? Maybe? Realistic? Probably. These women bring up all kinds of interests of their own. Some are only interested in his carving hands to beautify their dogs, to sculpt their bushes and hedges, to cut their hair. For a plateful of cookies and nothing else. That's the middle class in all its beautified selfishness. Some others are only attracted by the physical change such a man can bring up in their love life which is without any love but only hormonal secretions. Some high school teenagers are only attracted by his great way at opening all kinds of locks in order for him to be the key to the house they want to burglarize.<br/><br/>Two women are different. Mrs. Avon Calling is just trying to make him feel normal, happy, rested and satisfied with some human warmth. She will finally realize at the end that she did not think of what his own reactions could be when he started being rejected because she forgot to think that the others will be hostile after a while, after their curiosity was satisfied and they found out they could not use him for everything they wanted and for ever. And that's all. No escape from the haunted castle at the top of the hill. Go back there and survive like a ghost, and don't forget to die sooner or later. Only two people show some empathy. The cop chasing him and shooting in the air to make people believe he is dead, but they don't; and the poor Mrs. Avon Calling's daughter who fell in love with him, or rather with his eyes but could not cope with the conflict her asking him to do something wrong for the sake of her supposed boyfriend was going to bring up in the form of a hostile reaction, practically some lynching of old.<br/><br/>That's where Tim Burton is great and at the same time unnerving. He always looks for the darker side of things in any situation and there is no escape at all: you have to drink your sour potion right to the last drop. Your sour potion? You're kidding. His sour bitter and rough potion that is in no way magic but a real curse on humanity. Tim Burton is a morbid entertainer who wants to make us lose all confidence in any future development or improvement of humanity because deep deeper and deepest man and woman are evil, evil like hell and evil like burning blazes in your backyard. It is great, it is good, it is dissuasive if you want to make friends with the weirdo newcomer in your suburban village. You better run first and thank God you escaped.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

The change of attitude from loving his skills, to jealousy and hatred is great. The sheer frustration of the setting Edward up to fail shows the compassion towards his character by the viewer and by Kim.

"GeorgeRoots","8","1","1","22 September 2014"," Tim Burton's Best.
","Apparently ""Edward Scissorhands"" was a very personal movie for Burton, the story was conceived when he was a child as he always felt like an outcast in suburban California. What isn't there to say about Johnny Depp? He's one of the greatest actors of our generation, and this marks the first of many collaborations with Tim. Both have gone on to create some of the most truly interesting characters of Gothic storytelling.<br/><br/>An Inventor (The last performance by the wonderful Vincent Price) sadly passes away before he can finish his final work which is Edward, a robot who is all complete except for his hands which are scissors. Someone eventually drives to the abandoned mansion on top of the hill, and after finding Edward decides to take him home. Given the people in this film, I think everyone can somewhat connect to the isolation and thoughts of Edward. Everyone looks down on him, judge's him then makes up bull about him. It's disgusting to see how many snobs prey on his naiveté and shyness. I suppose you could argue that he wants to just be accepted within society, but the way some people act he's probably better off on his own.<br/><br/>Even after everything, Edward remains the best person in the community. Though he is just really there to experience new things such as society and love, before he ultimately leaves it all behind for the better thus leaving a bigger impact within the community. I saw the film at 10 years old and I thought it was wonderful, essentially a modern take on the ""Frankenstein"" story put through a cartoonish landscape. It's always so interesting to see how the most innocent can end up with so much hell through little lies, and just for being himself in such a destructive area. All these things are elevated through a wonderful score by Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Probably the strongest Gothic film Tim Burton has to his name. It really is something bleak, yet beautiful. 8.5/10."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","9","1","1","9 July 2014"," An absurd drama with real believability
","Johnny Depp is known for many roles in his career. Not only does he give his characters charm but also makes his fans feel like the character he plays is real. Before 1990, Depp had been in a number of productions but none were truly noted until after he became famous, like being in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or Platoon (1988). This however, is one of Depp's most critically defining roles and most likely what shot him to the top of popularity. This is also Depp's first collaboration with director Tim Burton, and we all know where that went from there. That is, at least the people who know of Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>What takes place is a drama that centers on a small town with nosy inhabitants. When something new comes along, word spreads very quickly. What's new in town is Edward (Johnny Depp); a human with scissors for hands or scissor-fingers. After a mother discovers him all alone, she takes him home to live a normal life. There, Edward begins his transformation as a human being; going through various stages in life that a person could experience. The most significant of them is falling in love with the family's daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder). This particular subplot is not only magnetic in its execution but also plays a much bigger part in its story telling. This is where the heart and emotion of the story lies. As Caroline Thompson's first theatrical screenplay, she did a great job.<br/><br/>Ryder and Depp have great chemistry and portray the emotion with power. Ryder is very beautiful here and has the proper character development. And although Depp says little throughout, he comes across as innocent and likable. Also, because this is a Burton production, he's going to add a bit of his influence, thus giving Edward his iconic and Gothic wardrobe. Along with these two leads, the cast also includes Alan Arkin, Anthony Michael Hall and the very last theatrical appearance of Mr. Vincent Price himself. Of all things that weren't wrong with the movie, this was my only complaint. Price plays ""The Inventor"" of Edward, but it is never explained what was the inventor's intention of replacing Edward's hands with scissors, nor was it explained to what the inventor himself did as a person. Apparently he ran a cookie factory but was that his life's work? There could've been more exposition on Price's character; especially since it was his last movie.<br/><br/>However, this is the only problem. Everything else is entirely well constructed. Stan Winston did an amazing job making Edward's hands feel so lifelike and dangerous at the same time. That's Winston for you. Bo Welch's production design is heavy on being simple but loves to accentuate them in a big way. An example of this would be of ""The Inventor's"" factory at which Edward lived, or, even the hedgework that Edward created. It was all big and grand. Then there was Stefan Czapsky's cinematography, which contrasted the difference between the town's elementary colors and Edward's get-up, which made him stand out. The same year Czapsky also worked on Child's Play 2 (1990) where a parallel can be drawn to the color scheme. Finally was Danny Elfman's score, which was an enormous proprietor to the emotion. By incorporating vocals and several crescendos, viewers will more than likely have goosebumps on their arms. It's that good. It is definitely worth the time to see this.<br/><br/>Aside from having one of the more important characters under developed, the rest of this film is absolutely wonderful. It is a fairy tale that excels beyond the clichéd ideas of the past with its riveting music, emotional acting and almost perfect story."
"TheFilmGuy1","7","1","1","21 June 2014"," A Creative And Frankenstein Like Story
","Edward Scissorhands is a film that benefits from Tim Burton's creative mind. People always make jokes about how Burtons films can be similar and contain extremely similar themes or even music, but I would say that this film makes it work. It's a Frankenstein-esque story that has a great fairytale feeling.<br/><br/>I think my favorite thing about this movie is it's visual style. I love the way the neighborhood looks and feels. It's like some strange mix of fantasy, 50's and late 80's. Very unique and fun. The was Edward is designed and how he works he's unique look into the look of the neighborhood is great too. He creates art work out of hedges and gives the women and dogs haircuts. It all feels very weird and surreal. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is pretty interesting as Edward. He plays him almost innocent, like a little boy, and it's fun to see. Lots of humour is infused in the film, but it also has many darker or sad moments. It feels like a kids movie but also has adult content, so it's more like an adult fairytale. Winona Ryder isn't the best actress in this, but I feel like she kind of visually fits the role, and she gets the job done.<br/><br/>This is a very unique movie, and I think based on that alone it's worth a watch. Tim Burton's style works so well in the film, and it's a joy to see."

","Tim Burton's richly entertaining update of the Frankenstein story is one of the most romantic and haunting film's in the past twenty years.<br/><br/>Burton has fun showing Edward's struggles to get dressed, use silverware and sleep in a water bed without wreaking havoc. Not only that, but Edward eradicates the blandness of the suburbs of where he lives by sculpting the town's hedges into exotic topiaries of animals and people. He gives elaborate haircuts to the neighborhood dogs and then moves on to their owners. Edward is a sensation, and what a terrific performance by Johnny Depp. <br/><br/>As in Burton's other films, the outsider soon becomes the outcast, and the laughs are soon tinged with melancholy. Burton shows how the townspeople's curiosity about Edward turns to suspicion and hostility Edward is denounced as a freak, which is not the usual Hollywood norm in films like these. <br/><br/>Where the film becomes somewhat of a tale of beauty and beast is where Kim comes to cherish Edward for his imagination and devotion. He creates ice sculptures while she dances in the flakes to Danny Elfman's engulfing score. It's a cathartic moment — the artist sharing his feelings through his art. Both Depp and Winona Ryder (who is a gifted actress), give the potentially sappy scene a potent intimacy. Later, when Kim reaches out to Edward, he pulls back his sharp, cold hands in despair until she tenderly wraps her arms around his chest, which gives us the most ernest and sincere lines in the film.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands isn't perfect, but it is a magical movie nonetheless."

","Oh, how I LOVE Edward Scissorhands! He is just such a good guy and is soo cute in a way because he is so innocent! OK and his outfit is badass. It just is. I had to write a paper about this movie and totally broke it down and all that jazz, but I had already loved it before that. I like that all the houses were so colorful and the neighbors were so ridiculously nosy but we all know those people! And that lady who was hot and heavy over Edward was hilarious! I hated that freakin boyfriend of Kim's. He got what he deserved! Don't you just adore Kim and Edward's relationship? He has such a pure heart so their love is innocent.

At first, the neighbors are mostly fascinated by him with the exception of Esmeralda (O-Lan Jones) and Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall).<br/><br/>Tim Burton is an original. His vision is like no others. Johnny Depp is once again a great enigmatic lead just like 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' 3 years later. He is truly adorably damaged.

","Edward Scissorhands is a romantic fantasy that shows the story of an artificial man named Edward, an unfinished creation, who has scissors for hands. Edward is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter Kim.It stars Johnny Depp,who plays the title role. The supporting roles are portrayed by Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, and Alan Arkin.The screenplay was written by Caroline Thompson and it was directed by Tim Burton.<br/><br/>An eccentric inventor lovingly assembles a synthetic youth named Edward,who has all the essential ingredients for today's standard body, with the exception of a pair of hands. For what is initially thought to be a temporary period, he is fitted with long, scissor-like extremities that, while able to trim a mean hedge, are hardly conducive to day-to- day life. When the kindly inventor dies, however, Edward is left lonely and cursed with some very heavy metal for hands. He is eventually taken in by Peg Boggs, an Avon lady who takes pity on him after seeing his bleak existence. Edward, in spite of his inherent ability to slay anyone he comes across, is a gentle soul whose only wish is to be loved. His impromptu family has, at best, a limited understanding of Edward, but he finds himself drawn to Peg's weary but sympathetic daughter, Kim, who is dating Jim, the neighborhood bully. Meanwhile, Edward finds himself a local celebrity after the town realizes that his talents include creative hedge trimming and an unrivaled ability to cut hair. His so- called friends are proved fair-weather when Edward is accused of a crime, after which his only supporters are Peg and Kim. <br/><br/>This film is a magical modern fairy tale with Gothic overtones and a sweet center.Also,it blends comedy, fantasy, and romance to make a sentimental fairy tale that both teens and adults will enjoy. It's visually pleasing and an easy film to like, even if it never gets out of shallow water as far as its story goes."

","This film is about a boy whose inventor (played by Vincent Price) gave him scissors for hands. I first saw this film when I became a fan of Johnny Depp three years ago. Johnny Depp is great in the role and he looked unrecognisable with all the makeup he had on. Winona Ryder did a good job of portraying the teenage daughter Kim Boggs. Diane Wiest and Alan Arkin were a good supporting cast as the husband and wife Bill and Peg. Peg reminded me of Renee Zellwegger, there voices are similar. When I first saw Wait Until Dark on telly I never realised Bill (the Dad played by Alan Arkin) was the villain who terrorises Audrey Hepburn. There were a few scenes that bugged me were when after Edward gets arrested why didn't Kim tell her parents or the police that Jim tricked Edward to breaking into his house."

"native_girl333","10","1","1","26 December 2007"," Friendly Scarecrow
","""Edward Scissorhands"" represents the most essential part of career of genius director Tim Burton. Burton himself created the story and lovely characters. Burton made even today successful brand in the area of horror-romance and showed that the most peculiar and most freaky creatures can be very lovable and kind.<br/><br/>Edward (brilliant Johnny Depp) looks like a scarecrow. He has terrible scars all over his face because of scissor that he has as hands instead of pair of hands. With this description you would think Edward is a monster, some kind of Frankenstein but he is the most kindest and sweetest creations you could ever imagine. Inventor of Edward (horror legend Vincent Pryce)dies before he manages to make hands for his creation. Poor Edward is left alone in the big, dark mansion on the top of a hill in small American town. One day a cosmetic saleswoman Peg (Oscar-winner Dianne Wiest) knocks on the door of the mansion. Peg is warm-hearted woman and takes Edward under her wings and take him to her home to the over the top colored suburb. Then Edward falls in love with Peg's beautiful daughter Kim (Winona Ryder)...<br/><br/>Being different in ""normal"" society can be tough. Burton uses sweetish and neon-colored suburbans to impress the Edward and his world even though he is sweeter than most of the ""happy"" suburbans. Maybe the message is that even tough someone might appear to be something completely different and frightening he can be more normal than everyone else. Burton has infallible eye when it comes to criticizing so called normality and typical society.<br/><br/>Musical wizard Danny Elfman has composed one of the greatest soundtracks in the history of movies. ""The Ice Dance"" is beautiful and clearly visual trough the ears straight to the heart. Burton and Elfman's collaboration works because they have same kind of vision what great picture will look and sound like.<br/><br/>The story of Edward is heart-warming, funny and touching. The movie can be recommend to every age. Just lovely, magical movie from Tim Burton!"

","~ Once upon a time there was a man who had scissors for hands ...<br/><br/>He lived in a castle on a hill that looked down upon a small suburban town. An elderly inventor (Vincent Price) created the man, giving him all the body parts required of a human except hands, for the inventor died before he could finish his creation ...<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands (Johnny Depp) lived alone in the castle for many years until one day someone raps hard at the door and in walks the local Avon Lady, Peg (Dianne Wiest). Disheartened by the way Edward is living, she invites him to leave the damp and dismal castle and live with her family back in colorful suburbia ...<br/><br/>Here he settles in and befriends Peg's husband, Bill (Alan Arkin) and their son, Kevin. He quickly falls in love with their daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder)and astounds the neighborhood with his 'chopping talents' that range from topiary to haircutting. But it soon becomes obvious that his scissor-hands are deadly sharp ...<br/><br/>Throughout the film Edward is transformed from freak to celebrity and inevitably back to freak once more, as the townspeople - who are initially enchanted by his oddball talents - soon tire of him. Once trouble rears its ugly head - mainly in the shape of Kim's jealous boyfriend, Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) - Edward is rendered an outcast once more ...<br/><br/>The final confrontation aptly takes place one snowy Christmas Eve, a nice touch for this modern-day fairytale ~ What Tim Burton has created here is a modern-day Frankenstein, loved by a few but shunned by an angry mob, who inevitably fear and hate him. Like Mary Shelley's creation, Edward is the Other, an outsider who knows little about life in the real world and finds it equally hard to adapt to his new life and surroundings; he is extremely naive and vulnerable, imaginative yet misunderstood like many of the characters in Tim Burton's films (see Ed Wood).<br/><br/>For the film's setting, Burton offers two strikingly different locations - a stereotypical 1980s suburban village and a Gothic castle - which works perfectly when comparing the uninspiring and viciously petty suburbanites to the lonely gentle spirit that is Edward.<br/><br/>Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review."
"dancingrl112688","10","1","1","30 October 2007"," An Impressive, Excellent Movie by Tim Burton
","Edward Scissorhands is an excellent movie, brilliantly conceived by Tim Burton and Caroline Thompson. Everything from the wonderful cast, to the amazing score by Danny Elfman, to the interesting script, make for a phenomenal movie-viewing experience.<br/><br/>The movie is about Edward (Johnny Depp), a man created by an inventor. However, before the inventor is finished with his creation, he dies, leaving Edward with razor sharp, scissor hands. Left alone, he has no contact with the outside world or other people until the local Avon lady, Peg (Dianne Wiest) decides to drive up to the old, almost deserted, mansion for one last chance to sell her products. Instead she finds Edward. She decides to take Edward away from the mansion and she brings him home to live with her family. Edward now has to learn how to survive in the real world and discover how to live with real people and their prejudices.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does an amazing job as Edward. What makes him so good in this role is his ability to convey so much with so few words. He is clearly showing what it is like to be an outsider and someone who does not quite fit in with the rest of the population. While his 'scissorhands' are good for making beautiful ice sculptures and trimming the neighbors bushes and trees into all sorts of creative shapes, he is not able to perform simple activities like eating a pea. He is also unable to come into direct contact with other humans. He cannot rub his eyes or wipe a hair off his face without cutting himself. Johnny Depp is excellent in portraying this man's difficult and complex life. Edward is completely innocent, yet taken advantage of by everyone simply because he is different. Also notable in the cast are Dianne Wiest, Peg, the Avon lady who brings Edward out of the mansion and Winona Ryder, who plays Peg's daughter Kim.<br/><br/>What Tim Burton is able to do extremely well is to create movies that speak to the viewer on some level. Although none of us will ever quite know what it would be like to have scissors for hands, many of us will feel like an outsider at some point in our lives. On some level, we will be able to identify with and sympathize with Edward. Although the situations in many of Burton's movies are fantasy based, it somehow feels real. There is a familiar feeling in his movies, in Edward Scissorhands, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and even The Corpse Bride that make the viewer feel as if they are experiencing the events right alongside the characters."

","This movie utterly changed my life. It was just so beautiful, the scenery, the make up, the writing, the music, everything. The acting too, especially Johnny, Winona, and Diane were the best. Johnny only had a few lines but he let his eyes say everything. Winona was perfect for this suburban school girl role. Diane nailed her caring suburban mom part perfectly. Also, the neighbors were chosen perfectly for their parts. This movie inspired so much emotion and you'll find yourself getting an emotion attachment to it. I was depressed and bawling about that bittersweet ending, I found myself adoring Edward like I would an old friend, and I relate to so many of the characters and some of the situations they were in. For the first time it made me genuinely grateful for my hands. I can honestly say that this movie changed my life, and my outlook on it. Its changed my perception on how I see other people and how I judge character. You'll never understand what I mean until you see the movie. If you are a girl or a sensitive guy you'll probably be bawling like a baby afterwords. We need more people like Edward in the world. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are my new heroes."

","So there are lots of good film makers out there. Stars in each genre. Action, drama, romcom, gross out..... Just one simple question What category is Edward Scissorhands in? Tim Burton and his team created something unique. The story at one level is a romance of a girl with an outcast. It is the story of the power of the esoteric over the mundane. It is a parody of the shallowness of 50s America. It shows the surreptitious power of wives over wage slave husbands. It has elements of fairy tale. It has elements of comedy. It has elements of tragedy. They all combine to make a unique, enchanting, stunning, unmissable film. Without a doubt this is top ten movie magic - the man shows his genius here."

It's incredibly spell-binding, you can't help but be drawn into Edward's world, his mind. Incredible performances all around, but the star of the show was Johnny Depp. He completely nailed it.

Johnny played Edward perfectly. No wonder he is so popular! He is great! The movies script was not weak at all! It was perfect. The only thing I found strange was the name clash of ""Kim"" and ""Jim"".<br/><br/>The story is brilliant. Edward is a man created by an inventor(played by the gem Vincent Price). The inventor dies and Edward is left at the inventors mansion, all alone. One day, a women, Peg(Dianne Wiest) enters the mansion selling AVON products. She goes into the attic where she meets a man with scissor hands. She is shocked at first by his hands and the scars on his face. She takes him back to her house and he meets her family, her son Kevin, husband Bill(Alan Arkin) and beautiful daughter Kim. Along the way, he falls in Kim, who is dating the jerk, Jim.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a gorgeous film."

","My Take: An imaginative and touching classic. A burst of imagination as only Tim Burton can conceive. <br/><br/>Before I was a movie buff, I thought that ""Edward Scissorhands"" was a horror film, a counterpart of Freddy from ""The Nightmare on Elm Street"" (Yeah!I really did). But when I finally watched many years later, I was surprised at how magical and magnificent it was. This film really should be in the classics list, a really wonderful movie it was. This was Tim Burton's first collaboration with Johnny Depp, which led to other film success like ""Ed Wood"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"". But this was the best. Burton has never come up with a more fantastic that can surpass it. Johnny Depp really made his best performance, he should have won an Oscar for that.The rest of the cast including Winona Ryder, Dianne Weist, Alan Arkin and Vincent Price, in his final screen performance, give excellent support. Danny Elfman's music is outstanding and the settings and costumes are well done.<br/><br/>This film is really great. So if your a movie collector, or simply a movie buff. Make sure you leave a space in the classics' row (and in your heart) for ""Edward Scissorhands"".<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

He really brings out how sweet, innocent and pure Edward is. Dianne Wiest also did a great job, using a soft voice and sweet smile to illustrate her loving character. Winona Ryder really shone in the ending scenes, as the romantic heroine who finally realises the feelings of Edward and her own for him. <br/><br/>This story really explores some important themes about the dark side of human nature, prejudice and well.. the angry mob.

"jtaqd","10","1","1","20 December 2006"," The Strange World of Tim Burton
","I'll start this off by saying I am not a die-hard Tim Burton fan. I don't love ""Big Fish"", I hate ""Batman Returns"", and I can't say I have ever watched ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" all the way through. That said I want it known that I am devoted to ""Batman"", I can't help but love ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""The Corpse Bride"", and ""Sleepy Hollow"" is one of my guiltiest pleasures. Even though Tim Burton doesn't always deeply impress me I do know that he is easily one of the most interesting contemporary filmmakers. And I can say without reservation that ""Edward Scissorhands"" is one of the most touching and enchanting films I've ever seen. After reading a very negative review of this beautiful film, from legendary critic Roger Ebert, I decided that it was necessary to comment on the only true masterpiece to be issued entirely by Tim Burton's imagination.<br/><br/>Lets start with the premise of the movie. A young man with scissors for hands is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love. Can any idea be any further away from Hollywood formula? The very fact that this film was made is a testimony to Burton's power in Hollywood in the early 90s (post-Batman he could do anything I guess).<br/><br/>Ebert's remarks seem to center on how Burton has great ideas but he simply lacks the ability to tell a story well. Nothing could be further from the truth. The plot, aside from the scissors for hands part, is rather clichÃ©d. We've all seen this plot a dozen times. ""Troubled youth is adopted by a kind family and tries to fit into a new community."" Hell, if you removed Edward from the script and slapped in a stock troubled teen you would instantly have a so-so teen angst picture. Get Rob Reiner to direct it and we have a ready-made sequel to ""Stand by Me"". Really the only reason Edward Scissorhands is remarkable is because, before ""Planet of the Apes"" mind you, Tim Burton was probably the most original director making big-budget films in America. His unique visual style and artistry made this film great, just like they did Ed Wood and ""Beetlejuice"". Even ""Batman"" (a film I will always love) is nowhere near the caliber of this film. And what especially attracts me to this film is that Burton here, more than any other film he's made, is very obviously pointing out how formulaic and conformist all other studio films have become (notice this in his depiction of suburbia and compare). He's also just plane making fun of the suburban lifestyle, and as a kid from the suburbs I have to laugh, because he's absolutely accurate in his vision.<br/><br/>It's rare to find a movie with a remarkably distinct visual style, a wonderful narrative, and actual social commentary to boot. Somehow Burton managed to have it all in the most unlikely of stories. This film proves that movies which defy standards and accounting practices are the only ones which can be adored, and I will always remember it as Tim Burton's biggest success. Also it ended Vincent Prices' contribution to films while simultaneously launching Johnny Depp's career. In retrospect it really should have won an Oscar for something."

The music itself gives life to the movie, gives it some personality. Another highlight is the acting, especially Johnny Depp as Edward, and Winona Ryder as Kim, Peg's daughter. Not only do they act by speaking, you can tell exactly what their characters are feeling just by the simplest expressions they make. You can really relate to the characters, and it's really an emotional movie.<br/><br/>This is the only movie that's ever made me cry. It can really mean something to someone.<br/><br/>10/10.

The only thing which makes me give only a 9 is the fact that Edward is treated by lots of characters as an object, obviously I understand that Burton wanted to point it out, but I still think Edward deserved a better Ending. I also feel a little annoyed to see that part of hairdressing and dogs , and also using Edward's hands to cook the meat during the barbecue. Some might say I'm being too critical, but imagine you're a newcomer to any place you may go. Would you feel comfortable cooking in a barbecue, cutting everyone's hair and doing stuff? I mean of course he needed to be integrated. But I Disliked the idea of when everyone needs him he's requested, but than, when something Happens, he's considered the black-sheep just because he's different. well... I know it's just like real life... but anyway he's passed from the attraction of the neighborhood to something they despised. Well still , it may look I don't like the film, but it's one of my favourites. It's just now I've seen it so many times, and I'have grown up I see things in a different way.

"iwerewolf_werewolf","10","1","1","7 October 2006"," Stunning
","This film just leaves me breathless every time I watch it. It's visually stunning, Tim Burton merges beauty and hideousness to create one of the most incredible films visually. The Suburbia is neat and tidy looking, but is actually quite ugly when you look at it, whereas Edward and the castle on the hill at first glance looks dark and horrific, but Burton has captured so much beauty in something you would not expect to find it.<br/><br/>Besides being beautiful to look at, the story is so heartbreaking and wonderful; it's telling the popular story of an outcast in a truly unique way. Edward, looking something out of a horror film is actually the most gentle and sweet creature, whereas the majority of the 'normal' suburbanites are the monsters.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is on top form as Edward and conveys so much emotion in a look. His performance is perfection and no one could else could have played Edward with such conviction.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is timeless, and will remain a classic. Burton and Depp have worked together 4 times since this film, but have never come close to creating such a memorable and beautiful film as this. Many will argue that the superb Ed Wood is a better film than Edward Scissorhands, but Scissorhands leaves you with a feeling you can't explain or shift for days after viewing it. Although Ed Wood is indeed a fantastic piece of cinema, it doesn't quite leave such an impact that Edward Scissorhands does.<br/><br/>Best Bit: There are so many. The Ice Dance sequence is possibly the most memorable, along with the stunning ending. As I mentioned before, a certain look from Depp can bring you to tears. An incredible performance.<br/><br/>Quote Of The Film: Kim: Hold me. Edward: I can't.<br/><br/>This film is arguably Burton's best, and is one of the greatest stories ever told. I defy anyone to watch this film and not fall completely in love with it."
"EijnarAmadeus","7","1","1","2 October 2006"," The first and arguably most magical Burton & Depp movie.
","In a pastel, plasticly and dull low-time town we meet Peg, a joyous housewife who rings the bell and tries selling facial-products. Having a bad day she notices a crow-castle at the end of town, fascinated she enters the castle and finds a gentle and pale white young man who happens to have scissors for hands, named Edward. As she decides to take care of him, bringing him into the town, it's obvious that this man have never been outside the castle's walls - and the only thing he's really good at is to make big, impressive figures of garden-bushes. But Edward doesn't only discover the outside-world, he also discovers Peg's beautiful daughter, the lovely Kim.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp makes a perfect act with his bittersweet face, all covered with scars and with a chaotic, exploded hair-style. At first glance he looks like bogeyman #1 wearing a skin-tight leather suite and having huge scissors as hands, but you soon realize that he is as gentle as a lamb and that he doesn't wanna hurt a fly. Winona Ryder also fits her character splendid, a young and disturbed teenage girl facing a nightmare as she finds Edward lying in her bed at night and turning it all upside-down as she finally falls in love with him; because it's a great and peculiar love-story, and that's probably why Burton hit bullseye from the first place; Edward Scissorhands is simply a love-story between the charming weirdo and the beautiful girl. Tim Burton's unmistakable trademarks are everywhere, whether it's the Gothic touch of Edward's history or the purely cartoon town where Peg and her family lives. Edward Scissorhands is a fabulously enjoying movie and fits for the whole family."

","This is definitely one of THE best films I have ever seen! The way that Depp brings the characters emotions out without having to say much is incredible. My favourite scene is when Kim comes home and walks it her bedroom, completely unaware that Edward is in her bed, and when she spots him and screams, he bursts the water bed! And then, when Peg makes Kim say hello to Edward properly, he is drunk (after Kim's dad has told him the whisky was lemonade and he drank it in one go) and makes an odd noise before collapsing!

Well...I hope You get this movie a try because it's beautiful!"
"jluis1984","10","1","1","26 April 2006"," Beautiful Masterpiece!
","Tim Burton was a rising star in film-making when in 1988 he released his successful mix of dark comedy and horror ""Beetlejuice"". This success took him to direct the ambitious adaptation of ""Batman"" in 1989 and gave him enough freedom to develop his own personal projects. The first of them was this little film. ""Edward Scissorhands"", a charming fable about a misunderstood young man, is probably the first film where Burton expresses his personal views on the world and at the same time, expands his vivid visual style to new heights.<br/><br/>The story begins with Peg (Dianne Wiest), an Avon door-to-door seller who discovers Edward (Johnny Depp) living lonely in the haunting mansion that rises above the little suburban town where she lives. Surprised at the fact that Edward seems to have scissors instead of hands, she takes him home in order to help him to adapt to the community. While at first he is accepted, he'll discover that human relations are more complex than he imagined; and things will complicate even more when he falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder).<br/><br/>Burton creates a modern fairy tale that is not only visually impressive, but also very entertaining and most of all, very meaningful. Edward is a man who is just experiencing life, but due to his handicap he can't fully fit in Peg's apparently perfect world. His love for Kim also creates problems when Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) makes Edward's life even harder. Edward is an outcast whose inability to touch gets in conflict with his desire to love, while at the same time faces the suburban community which seems more frightening than the haunting Gothic castle where he was living before.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp changed his image of teenage heartthrob and with this film he began to show his great potential and superb talent to literally become one with his character. He portrays the emotions of the confused Edward with feeling and power, and gives life to Edward's mix of fragility and naiveté. Winona Ryder also was a rising star at that moment, and while her character is nowhere as complex as Depp's, she plays the role of Kim with dignity and grace. In this movie she displays the talent that would convert her into one of the most promising young actresses of her generation.<br/><br/>Burton imagination has no limits and his eye for visuals excels in ""Edward Scissorhands"". His care for detail creates haunting images and beautiful compositions; from the haunting castle where Edward lives, to the grass sculpture that he creates, everything fits in this bizarre fairy tale and complete the perfection of this movie.<br/><br/>It is hard to find a flaw in the film, as it is probably the first masterpiece that Tim Burton would create in his career. While of course it has some logical plot holes, as a whole the film is one of the best movies ever done in history, as it successfully mixes fantasy, drama and romance with a small dose of Burton's black humor. Depp and Burton would continue working together in many films, including Burton's masterpiece ""Ed Wood"".<br/><br/>With the exception of ""Ed Wood"", Tim Burton has never been this good. ""Edward Scissorhands"" definitely has earned its classic status on its own right, as it is one of those movies that touch the deep parts of the soul with its inventive originality and almost-magical charm. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is simply unforgettable. 10/10"
"uno-20","10","1","1","21 April 2006"," There is no word for such amazement
","If there is a movie that has pure magic in it, I would think off the top of my head of Edward Scissorhands. There is simply all innocence and imagination in this film. Burton has created a masterpiece with Caroline Thompson and Danny Elfman as his team. I see now, that while together, they created a film that has all necessitous in it. It contains comedy, crucial to keeping an audience. It contains fantasy, something that all of us have drifted into at least once in our lives. It's nice to view the imagination of another, to see how we relate, because in the end, we find that humans all-together, are not so different. It's the small things that separate us like a titanium wall. I think that was what Burton had tried to do while explaining and creating this film. Also, he had used great actors to capture the innocence or the guilt of their character. Both Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder had played an astonishing act and has led me to believe that there is such beauty in the world."

","I finally got round to seeing this movie, and I absolutely loved it, it is really one of a kind! Like most people I read fairy tales when I was little and this modern fairytale is just as great as any of those the Grimm brothers wrote.<br/><br/>Edward is a great character which, like most of his roles, Johnny Depp plays excellently. I found myself giggling at how adorable and innocent he was with his actions, yet almost in tears at how tragic it was to see him sad and the ways he was treated. The great thing about the film is how it plays with your emotions like that, and as with most great fairy tales, includes some kind of moral. The dark edge to it makes the film that more mysterious, definitely one of Tim Burtons greatest movies. A timeless classic."

"moviemanMA","10","1","1","5 July 2005"," Edward Scissorhands cuts into your heart
","Living a life unable to come into contact with people must be pretty hard. This is the situation for Edward Scissorhands who has...you guessed it, scissor's for hands. Johnny Depp plays this outcast in Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands. The story of how a man made man comes out of exile and tries to live in suburbia.<br/><br/>Depp as the lovable yet intimidating Edward Scissorhands is triumphant. His character is someone who fears people but also puts fear into people. When Peg Boggs (Diane Weist) attempts to make a sale for the Avon makeup company she works for at the old mansion in her neighborhood, she stumbles upon frightened Edward. With kindness in her heart, she takes him in.<br/><br/>In her home Edward meets the daughter Kim played by Winona Ryder. She is at first taken by surprise, unlike her brother who thinks he is an interesting specimen. The father is very accepting. The family realizes that Edward has a gift...cutting. He can erect huge lawn statues out of the bushes and also give the local females a new hairstyle. Edward is used over and over again until the father believes he should make a profit. The story goes off on the contrast between Edward and their society. With Kim's boyfriend played by Anthony Michael Hall always picking on him and forcing him to do things he shouldn't, Edward is thrown into awkward, sometimes frightening situations.<br/><br/>This is one of Burton's greatest pieces of cinema and is one for the ages. With great writing, a story that really hits the heart, and a great cast, this movie does well. As Peg Boggs says, ""Blending is the secret!"" One of the most interesting and imaginative plots out there, Edward Scissorhand's is a timeless treasure that might bring a tear to your eye.<br/><br/>A man cut off from society in more ways than one is a story many can relate to. Not being able to make physical human contact is hard to do and Edward was just made this way so he can't help it. This struggle of his longing for people is one that is showcased beautifully. Burton's mind for great movie making is not wasted on this film. Edward Scissorhands is a masterpiece."

","This is an amazing film! I've watched it at least 5 times, and I still think that it's one of the best movie I've ever seen. Tim Burton's movies are just incredible. The story is great, the actors are good. I personally think that Johnny Depp was excellent in his role. Edward is so likely and kind, you can't be touched by his performance. I just loved the film till the very first time I have seen it when I was a little girl. It has totally marked me. Every time I see it, there's a tear that rolls down my cheek.

"bored_intellect_scorpio","10","1","1","25 June 2005"," One of the best movies of all time but not for everyone.
","I'd have to say right now... not everyone will enjoy this movie. Edward Scissorhands is about knowing you should fit in, you want to fit in, but no matter what, you can't. I'd have to say the people that don't like it just don't understand what the message of the story is and/or they can't identify with it. My parents actually had to persuade me to rent it because i was reluctant but...WOW. In the very beginning how the old Kim said that Edward was left ""incomplete and all alone"", my heart jolted. Edward Scissorhands was so wonderful! It was beautifully done with all the acting (johnny depp, Dianne Wiest, ANthony Michael Hall, Wynona Rider, etc), of course you can't forget Tim Burton and Danny Elfman! This movie isn't just a comedy or love story, it's so many things... one second it's hilarious the next heart-wrenching. Johnny Depp's Edward Scissorhands character just makes you want to say ""Aaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww"" lol. After seeing it for the first time, after it ended i actually cried and instantly fell in love with it. I often just watch it once a day because it never gets old. I'd have to say that from watching this movie you'd never know it was made in 1990, it looks like it could have been made in 2003. Overall, i'd have to say Edward Scissorhands is a pure timeless classic."

But, when a thoughtful Avon Lady finds him and takes him home with her.<br/><br/>As the plot thickens, the town's people struggle to handle the hands of Edward.<br/><br/>This film is a classic and has a moral which is unmissable.

","This movie is wonderful - it has a good cast, great story, and great director. The story was touching, and I think we all can relate to it in some small way. Edward's character was sweet, depressing, and somewhat creepy all at the same time. He tries to fit in but this world can never accept him - he has ""friends"" for a short while but in the end most people will always look at what he is on the outside. Although it is just a movie, Edward Scissorhands is a movie that draws you in and brings each character to life - I don't think I have talked to one person who hasn't said that, at some point during the film, they honestly felt empathic toward Edward.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's acting abilities shine in this movie - although anyone who watches this film expecting to see the young, charming, good looking Johnny Depp, may end up rather disturbed."
"malkane316","10","1","1","22 February 2005"," Quick Reviews!!
","The movie that established Depp in our minds, in probably his best performance as the deformed, unfinished creation of an eccentric scientist. Rightly called a modern fairy tale as it has all the hallmarks of those classic stories- a strange character, some sort of moral, a dark side, a world almost like our own but slightly warped, a story anyone can enjoy. Edward Scissorhands combines this story with some wonderful acting and characters, memorable score, beautiful cinematography and imagery, which makes an excellent, tender film with the typical Burton trademarks.<br/><br/>The story is told by a grandmother to her granddaughter, and we get to hear it too, beginning with Edward's creation and development. He grows and is taught about manners, etiquette and other things by his father, but is alone, never seeing or interacting with the outside world. From his room he can see the nearby neighbourhood, within touching distance, but as he is different he cannot go to them. One day his father dies, leaving him unfinished- with giant scissors where his hands should be. He does not understand, and stays in his massive dark house alone. When a local Avon lady, annoyed because of the lack of interest by her neighbours in what she is selling, she decides to try the scientists house, unaware of what is inside. No-one has been there before, it is a typical small town haunted house in the eyes of most. She enters the house when no-one answers, meets Edward and decides to take him home to her family as he is alone and a mess. Looking past his 'hands' she accepts him, and her son and husband also try to. Soon he becomes a ray of interesting light in the bored neighbourhood, everyone wants to meet the new guy, and he shows his talent for hedge and dog trimming. However, Edward is enchanted by Kim, the daughter and falls in love. Kim is with a bully of a boyfriend, and soon he and the rest of the neighbourhood take advantage of Edward- he just wants to be nice. Soon though his novelty wears off, and most people see him as evil and dangerous, something to disrupt their daily lives. They chase him away, and the story looks like it will end in tragedy.<br/><br/>Everything in the film works perfectly, every corner of the cast from actors to set designers all do amazingly well. It is one of those rare times when everything seems to come together and fit completely. Dianne West is ideal as the mother Peg, only wanting to help Edward, not trying to score points off her friends. Anthony Michael Hall as Kim's boyfriend is also an ingenious choice as he emits that typical jock persona, believing he can get whatever he wants, trying to overpower everyone but scared of his father. Vincent Price is the inventor, and gives an admirable and touching performance, a fitting way to end his illustrious career, and the rest of the family and neighbours are all uniquely odd, made even more strange by the routine they live in and the idyllic place they live. Ryder as Kim is also intensely sympathetic, first scared of Edward, but growing to understand and eventually fall in love with him. But overall, in acting terms it is Depp's film, and no-one could have done better. He completely takes over the role, adding little touches, eye movements and such to add to the character, so that we too love Edward by the end. However, his performance is such that we too realise he cannot be part of the community, he will never fully understand them as they cannot understand him, whether he is in love or not, and this could be harmful for him and others. He does not want to hurt anyone, and so must be on his own. He is a tragic figure, and the movie seems to be saying that the outcast can be heroic, beautiful and tender, but must remain an outcast to keep these characteristics.<br/><br/>Again Burton gives the Gothic look he has become famous for, and this is undoubtedly his most visually beautiful film. Batman had more stunning sets, camera work and stunts, but the charm factor here is almost overwhelming. The Gardens, snow, the ice sculptures, the picture perfect coloured houses and cars all juxtaposed against Edward and his habitat. Edward himself is a work of art, scarred but not horrific. Edward's home is a wonderful excuse for Burton and the designers to show off, full of shadows and weird inventions. The music adds immensely to the film, raising our emotions that much higher, and it is probably Elfman's best. Favourite scenes include Kim dancing under the falling ice, and Edward sitting on the pavement with the dog, but every shot and scene is excellent.<br/><br/>The only fault i can find with the film is that it isn't long enough, or rather, i wish it was longer just so we could be part of that world for a few minutes more. There could have been more scenes between Kim and Edward. It leaves you with a good feeling, and I cannot see any other faults with it. Some may feel it is overly sentimental, but it isn't, some may feel it is simple, but it is meant to be. A film for outcasts everywhere, but one which should be enjoyed by all, as we all feel like outcasts at some point.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"judigrrrrl","10","1","1","24 January 2005"," Awesome entertainment. A must see!
","This is one of Tim Burton's absolute Best films. If not his very best of all time. It will make you laugh, cry, and say ""aawwww, isn't that cute?"" All within minutes of the opening. The story line is very original and emotionally compelling. Tim Burton brings to life all of the milk of human kindness, in the community's ability to accept this less-than-perfect creation. Immediately followed by the all too common judgmental and quick-to-condemn nature of that same group. In this film there are wonderful examples of the human condition, in all senses, the good and the bad, the ugly and the beautiful. If you have not experienced many of Tim Burtons, wonderful and brilliant works, I would recommend that you check out Beetle-Juice(1988), Mars Attacks(1996), Sleepy Hollow(1999), and Big Fish(2003)(one of my most recent favorites!) Next time you rent or buy, keep Edward Scissorhands in mind! I guarantee you wont regret it!"
"latigre","10","1","1","13 November 2004"," One of the most beautiful stories ever told.
","OK first things first, though this film did move me to tears, it must be said that I am known for films doing this to me. However without Edward Scissorhands I do not believe this would be the case. This film opened me up to the emotions in film and allowed me to be affected in a totally different way than I had ever been before.<br/><br/>As a Burtonite I know all of his films well but I consider this to be his masterpiece. This is firstly because many of his films are based around former premises and stories, whereas Scissorhands is all his own work and therefore a real look into the mind of the genius, and secondly because the film is just so good. Incorporating a story that will warm the coldest hearts of any age or gender with a subtle underlying commentary on the prejudiced world in which we live, Burton delivers the film in such a way that anyone from the casual film-goer to the knowledgeable filmbuff can appreciate the film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance is masterful, using very little speech (apparently he only says 169 words in the entire film) he relies mainly on mannerisms and his obvious feel for the character. Without Johnny Depp there would be no Edward Scissorhands, he makes the character almost iconic, also without Edward Scissorhands there would probably be no Johnny Depp, seeing as this film catapulted him into near superstar status. Also worth a mention, the performances of other actors such as Dianne Wiest are well played and engaging and although you may have to suspend your disbelief on various occasions during the film i.e. in the ending sequence with the ice in the attic this is not the case with any of the acting.<br/><br/>Finally, the sets in the film that represent a stereotypical American suburb are beautiful as a comparison to Edward's Gothic retreat, and even though they are colourfully painted, Burtons darkness still shines through as they seem ominous and almost carnival like. Edward Scissorhands is a timeless classic which will be enjoyed for generations to come and personally I can't see a single fault in it.<br/><br/>*****/*****"
"blue_third_eye","10","1","1","13 November 2004"," A tragically romantic tale
","I found Edward Scissorhands to be special in a personal way. The trio of Tim Burton (Director), Johnny Depp (Actor) and Danny Elfman (Music) really comes together to create such a romantic atmosphere in this movie. Depp plays his role well, by keeping the character of Edward as an outcast from humanity and yet making him seem humorous and a character you just fall in love with.<br/><br/>Elfman's music really brings this movie to the height of emotion though. The music is often referred to in the music communities I visit and has inspired film music and music in general. The theme song is what I like to call Elf-esque, as it plays those lovely glockenspiel two-key chords, in harmony with the strings and the choir. <br/><br/>The symbolism of this movie is superb as well, as you see all of edwards dreams and hopes dashed in his flashback to the death of Vincent Prices character, as his hands are also destroyed.<br/><br/>I give this movie a perfect 10, because to me it just brings together all aspects of a movie that are important to me. Emotive, but not over the top music, a lovable lead character played by a good actor, and a the director and producer to pull it off. I recommend this music only to those who are willing to place themselves in a movie and just go with the flow. I'll admit that nostalgia plays a bit part in my like of this movie. But the general romantic tale of Edward Scissorhands just captures my heart in the way that I love. A truly tragically romantic tale."

","When I was little girl of four, a wonderful movie premiered on the big screen. That movie was called ""Edward Scissorhands"". Having once watched ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" (still as a little four year old) in the dark of night with my parents, the idea of Scissorhands just didn't appeal to me. So for the next fourteen years, I avoided and shied away from every golden opportunity to see the film. I ALWAYS thought it was a horror flick. But one day, as a high school graduate of eighteen, I decided to watch a little bit of it with my mother before heading to work. I fell in love immediately! That little bit I saw was the funniest thing I had viewed in a very long time. I hadn't laughed so hard since I still can't remember when.<br/><br/>So during my lunch, I rented the DVD. When I got home late that night, I popped it in right away. And although I still laughed hysterically at my favorite parts (waterbed scene...all-time favorite!), I was almost moved to tears by the end of the film. With the combination of Tim Burton's excellent directing skills and Danny Elfman's heart-wrenching movie score this movie has become one of my very favorites. Because if a movie has a happy ending, I'm upset by it's cliché qualities, and if it has a sad ending, I don't ever want to watch it again, but when a movie has a bittersweet ending, the good and bad emotions I feel are so jumbled that I can't help loving the film."

","This film is one of my favourites of Tim Burten's, and it is amazing to see Johnny Depp and Tim work together as they both as director and actor make films truly magical. The film is about a man who was being made by a very old professor, yet unfortunately he dies before finishing Edward the man made man. Edward lives in a creepy old mansion at the top of the village and has to live with scissors as hands, (handy for gardening not so good for everyday things). A woman in the village one day takes Edward to her home and looks after him, it's all happy until he falls in love with her daughter (Winona Ryder) and does things he regrets. This film did make me cry at the end as it was such a wonderful fairytale, written and acted marvellously, and starred my favourite actor Johnny Depp. The ending was beautiful, sad and happy all together, which is what I think made it excellent. This film I would say is a comical, romantic fairytale and I do recommend it anybody with a liking to great films."
"vandeand","10","1","1","12 May 2004"," Beautiful and Haunting
","Edward Scissorhands is one of those movies that doesn't fit any sort of mold, yet still manages to to touch people on so many levels. It's funny, sad, romantic, and scary all at once. Alternating tears and laughter, there are few movies do it this brilliantly. Boasting great performances from Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Winona Ryder, and the incomparable Johnny Depp it shows both the best and worst of human nature and does it beautifully. Tim Burton creates a setting that draws you into another world, all the time seeming like complete reality. It's a story about a man who was invented and is one day taken to suburbia by a kind Avon lady. Combining classic fairy tale elements with brutal reality it becomes a story about acceptance and love. Truly unique, and one of my favorites, Edward Scissorhands is simply a classic."
"DavidSim240183","10","1","1","3 May 2004"," Arguably Tim Burton's best film.
","Tim Burton will always be one of my favourite directors. His unique visual style and imagination always translates well to the big screen. He is always an inspiration to me as an aspiring writer. Edward Scissorhands is my favourite Tim Burton film, because this beautiful combination of Frankenstein and Beauty and the Beast is such an enchanting story.<br/><br/>Set in suburbia, local Avon Lady Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) is making her annual rounds. She notices the Gothic mansion on top of the mountain overlooking the town. When she gets there, she finds a beautiful garden where the hedges and topiary have been cut and shaped to resemble animals and dinosaurs amongst other things. On the inside, Peg finds rusted inventions and assembly lines. But upstairs, she finds the most amazing sight of all, a man who has scissors for hands.<br/><br/>The man is called Edward (Johnny Depp) and it would seem he has been alone for many years. Peg decides the best thing for him is to come home with her. Edward is very curious about the outside world, but because he's had no contact with outsiders (ironic considering he is one) he is unprepared for the range of emotions he will feel, or the chain of events that will follow.<br/><br/>The townspeople are initially welcoming, and the women are particularly interested in Edward, especially since he can make a lot of creations out of their hedges. He can also do dogs, as well as womens' hairstyles. But it becomes apparent Edward is little more than a sideshow attraction to be gawked at by these people.<br/><br/>Things become complicated when Edward meets Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). He falls instantly in love with her, but can't open up to her, especially since he could never touch her without hurting her. The attraction eventually becomes mutual, angering her boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall in a brilliantly loutish role) considerably.<br/><br/>Things begin to change for Edward when Jim uses him to break into his wealthy father's house to sell a few things. But Edward gets locked in, and is subsequently arrested.<br/><br/>Edward feels anger for the first time in his life, after being set up by Jim. This starts to turn the townspeople against Edward. Gradually, he comes to realise that he has no place with them. This incident reveals the underlying prejudice they have had against him all along. Things go downhill from there, and Edward has no choice but to go back into isolation. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Edward, bringing a gentle fragility and wide-eyed innocence to the role. He is in a world he can't properly comprehend. Tim Burton modelled Edward on himself. He is like him in so many ways, with his unbridled creativity and uniqueness in the outside world.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder is very good, because her relationship with Edward is so heartbreaking. No matter how much they might want each other, the reality of the situation is they can never be together. Edward and Kim are just too different to ever really be a couple.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands also bears close similarities to Pee Wee's Big Adventure, because we are once again presented with Tim Burton's vision of suburbia. The pastel coloured bungalows are bizarre in the extreme, and we also have another outsider who doesn't fit in with the ordered lives suburbanites live day in and day out.<br/><br/>The hedge trimmings and topiary are just beautiful, as well as the ice sculptures Edward creates. This involves one of the most magical scenes in the film, when Kim is dancing in the snow coming off the ice being sculpted.<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes in the film involve Edward and his inventor (Vincent Price in a wonderful final role). These are revealed to us in a series of flashbacks, and show Edward's creation and maturity.<br/><br/>Edward started out as a machine chopping vegetables on an assembly line. The Inventor decided to make him into a man, and started to teach Edward about etiquette and poetry. <br/><br/>But sadly, Edward was unfinished. The Inventor died of old age before he had a chance to give Edward a pair of normal hands. I dare anyone to watch that scene without feeling like crying. It is so poignant and full of understated emotion.<br/><br/>At the films conclusion is the final confrontation between Edward and Jim. It is almost like a duel for Kim's hand. This is where Edward and Kim must sadly go their separate ways. It's certainly brave for a modern day fairytale to have a sad ending, and is a testament to Tim Burton's creativity.<br/><br/>The musical score by Danny Elfman is both haunting and whimsical. The visual style is superb, and the story compelling to the very end. The closing scene is very magical, and is everything I have come to expect from Tim Burton. Edward Scissorhands will go down in legend as one of the greatest stories ever brought to the big screen."

","I loved this movie. It was really cute and had a good storyline. It's a perfect film companion to movies like Beauty and the Beast or Shrek. The script was well-written and Johnny Depp was brilliant as Edward. Although he didn't have many lines, he portrayed his role with such emotion and by the end of the movie, it was no surprise to find tears in my eyes. Does Edward look different? Yes. But you can't help but love him. At a quick glance, the movie seems to be ""scary"" but really, it's not.

","With this one, Tim Burton delivers for the first time on screen the crazy world living in his mind. The philosophy is the same than in Beetlejuice, but this time it goes further in craziness. The tolerance message is more radical than ever, because I don't think that there's anything physically wrong with my black buddies, while Edward, by being this strange (close to horrible), forces you to go behind what he looks like (and I think that movies like this should be watched more often these days, when you hear people say about other kinds of people things that make no sense at all). But not only a political speech (that would be generous but maybe boring) this is a success in film-making : work on colors and architectures is, like always with Burton, wonderful, but most important, the movie stars Vincent Price for the last time - remember him, true horror fans !"

"sickerandsweeter","10","1","1","8 January 2004"," A GRAND FAIRY TALE
","Tim Burton (Batman, Ed Wood) Does a marvelous job at telling a tale of such haunting beauty. The film Is called ""Edward Scissorhands"" The title alone should tell you what you're about to embark on. The story is a modern fairy tale about a character, Edward (Johnny Depp) who was made from the heart of a cookie by  the inventor played by non other then the legendary Vincent Price. He starts out by making Edward out of a cutting machine. The Inventor never finished which left Edward alone and with scissors for hands. I'm guessing the story takes place maybe 20 to 30 years from that point, and we find an Avon lady, Mrs. Boggs (Diane Wiest), unsuccesfully trying to sell her make up. She works up the courage to try and sell to an old abandon mansion that no one ever goes to.<br/><br/>This is where we meet Edward. This is when the story gets interesting. The genius of Burton's direction that he does with Johnny and the score that his pal Danny Elfman draws out is fascinating. You get a gothic sense of beauty. You can learn so many things from this story. One paticular lesson I took to heart was from the town people and how they took Edward in and used him and threw him away. He wasn't treated like a person. As a result, he was taken advantage of. In the end the person who didn't accept him in the beginning will be the one that finally excepts him in the end. I recommend this movie to everyone 10/10"

"nathan19","Null","1","1","18 January 2000"," Artifice, art, and Edward.
","Film students often point out that Tim Burton's work usually contains an autobiographical edge.  I don't know very much about Mr. Burton, but it does seem that his most successful films usually involve several key elements -- the somber protagonist more often than not clad in black, at odds with the world around him, in love with an unattainable woman, and passionately devoted to a particular craft.  ""Batman""'s Michael Keaton, Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane, and Depp's Edward Scissorhands all share these qualities, but Scissorhands seems to come the closest in not only exploring the psychoses of the main character, but also exploring the line between the artist, his craft, and its audience.<br/><br/>Into the happy world of domesticity comes Edward, a man clad in black leather, with scissors for hands.  Standing out amidst the monotony of suburbia, his presence immediately causes a stir among the local townspeople.  When Edward begins trimming the gardens, then the hair of the dogs, and finally the hair of the women in town, he goes from certified mystery man/freak to local celebrity, on the basis of a gift he himself does not seem all that impressed with.  (He expresses a desire to have normal hands.)  His joy comes not from creating, but from seeing the joy creating gives to others.  All Edward wants to be is accepted, especially by Kim (Winona Ryder).  His art is a means to an end.  Through a series of tragedies however, Edward moves from celebrity to has-been to criminal. Eventually forced to flee domestic life, he wreaks havoc on the local townspeople, destroying the work he created and thereby inciting the town to riot.  At the end of the film, he is left alone, creating in solitude, designing ice sculptures to the one woman he has loved, and yet can never have.<br/><br/>The film's theme of a misunderstood genius who only wants to be loved is certainly unoriginal.  What is interesting is that it is imbibed with meaning by a filmmaker whose own life mirrors that of its protagonist. Burton's quirky early work (""Frankenweenie,"" ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"", ""Beetlejuice"") became art-house successes that led to commercial success and paved the way for 1989's ""Batman,"" a critical and commercial blockbuster. Burton never sought the kind of commercial success that ""Batman"" afforded him, going on record in interviews stating that he preferred more personal statements as opposed to the big franchise success a ""Batman"" film would give him -- artifice as opposed to art.  There was obviously an audience primed and ready for Burton's take on the world, however -- both his Batman films, ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and even ""Edward Scissorhands"" were critical and commercial successes.  But, like Edward in the film, it is only a period of time before a misunderstood genius becomes just that -- misunderstood.  Thus both Burton's next two films -- ""Ed Wood,"" an homage to the brilliant (or brilliantly insane, take your pick) director, and ""Mars Attacks!"" -- were commercial duds, the second resoundingly so.  The artist had apparently fallen out of favor with the public, refusing to do a third ""Batman"" film or simply grind out ""hits"".  With ""Sleepy Hollow,"" Burton seems to have regained a measure of the audience's approval without sacrificing his values.<br/><br/>The fear of any filmmaker, or any artist, is the audience's approval, or lack thereof.  Any artist who creates for a mass audience relies on that audience to keep him funded, particularly in the film industry, where you are only as good as your last film's box office receipts.  Sooner or later, if your films lose money for the studios, you will find yourself without the opportunity to create, and although you could shoot on Super-8 for your family, if you have the drive to express yourself through film, you want people to be exposed to your work.  The audience however is frequently blown by opposing and contradictory winds -- what is popular this month is next month's old news.  The audience for Edward's work in ""Scissorhands"" is initially intrigued by his eccentric designs, then turned off by them as new fads come along (Edward asks Meg's brother Kevin to play ""rocks scissors paper,"" to which Kevin replies, ""It's boring!"").  When a filmmaker dares to put across a piece of personal work, the rejection of the audience is even harder to take -- in the film, Edward cannot detach himself from his hands, they are a part of him -- thus when the townspeople reject his work and begin to regard him as a freak, it is incredibly personal, especially for someone who has only sought approval.<br/><br/>Yet even in this, the film offers hope.  As the townspeople begin to turn from Edward, Kim begins to see Edward as more than a freak.  She begins to see his heart -- and slowly but steadily falls in love with him.  The most tender moment in the film is when she asks him to hold her, and (in a scene that would be comical in any other film, but here plays as tragically as Romeo losing his Juliet) Edward holds up his ""hands"" and says, ""I can't."" In a moment of trust, she steps past the hands that people once loved but now revere, and puts her arms around him.  What matters is no longer the superficial appreciation of an audience that was never meant to appreciate the work (all they cared about was what it could do for them -- it becomes a sign of status to have hair cut by Edward), but the sincere appreciation of someone who has come behind the work, and loved the man as he is.<br/><br/>If the film is a highly personal statement by Mr. Burton about the art and craft of filmmaking, vs. the business and artifice it can breed, it is a powerful one by a director who (at that time) was a top box-office draw of hope that filmmaking could be personal first and foremost, rather than being just a homogenized piece of entertainment.  (The continued success of razzle-dazzle franchises and slam-bang action films must disappoint him.) One however doesn't need to psychoanalyze the film or its director in order to appreciate ""Edward Scissorhands"" as a sweet, aching, poetic look at love, from the perspective of a young man who, despite his handicap, only wants to be loved the same way as everyone else is."
"Cass25","4","16","53","8 December 2002"," Sad disappointment
","What a sad disappointment this movie was.  I had heard good things, and Tim Burton is good director.  But, it was all for naught.  What starts interesting(scissors for hands, cool)eventually becomes just another movie, with a horribly generic Hollywood ending. Another problem stems from the fact that Edward isn't really all that unique.  Every character is a strange caricature themselves, so everybody is weird, not just Edward with his strange hands.  So, instead of this strong contrast with Edward to everyone else, we instead are greeted by a parade of weirdos, and focus is lost. And then there's the ending.  All I'll say is, very bad, very stupid.  But, at that point, I was just glad it was over. To be fair, the set design was nice, and Johnny Depp was good. But overall, a sad waste. Someone told me that if I had seen it when I was younger, I might have liked it more. Ah, to be young, stupid, and have no standards."

I did not like this since a lot of people has a faulty picture of Christians and this can enhance that picture. I also thought the character development of Jim was a bit to quick from mean to just crazy and psycho. So to conclude, good movie, with some flaws. I definitely recommend it!

I believe that Johnny Depp made a very good impression when acting as Edward. Vincent Price finished his acting job in a very fine end, as well! I have been doing this for my GCSEs, and I think that the relation between Edward and Kim is the most important part for me. You might say that you can compare Edward and Kim to a Disney film - 'Beauty and the Beast.' I might watch it again, but I wouldn't recommend it - Not if you want a happy ending. Also, it is left hanging at the end. If you have seen this, I would recommend watching Stand by Me. Stand by Me might not be a fairy tale, but it explored the relations between four boys, so that's why I would recommend people who have seen this to see Stand by Me - I think that Stand by Me is better. In summery, Edward Scissorhands is a good mix between a fairy tail and a thriller, but some things I didn't like. That's why I'm giving it a 6."

If you really want to see it,I recommend bringing lots of tissues because if you cry over things like lovers saying good-bye and stuff, you're going to be crying by the end of this movie. I cried for two days it was so sad! Overall, it was a heartwarming story about a guy who is like a much more friendlier version of Frankenstein. When his creator died, he lived alone in a dark castle until a nice Avon lady took him to live with her family. As well as telling how Edward is at first accepted but then rejected, it also tells of his love for the Avon lady's daughter, Kim, and how she comes to love him. Tim Burton was a genius when it came to this one. The movie was very, very sad, but it didn't make the movie clichéd as it would've been with a happy ending. This is a brilliant movie, but remember...bring lots of tissues!"
"moonspinner55","6","6","16","2 May 2003"," An icy pall hangs over the whole thing
","Never as funny as it's meant to be early on (with twinkly-cute Dianne Wiest as an Avon lady who calls on an artificial boy with scissors for hands)--nor as moving as it wants to be at the end (when the hero Edward is chased down by a mob)--this modern-day ""Frankenstein"" has all the nostalgic spirit money can buy, but a lump of coal for a heart. Director Tim Burton knows the notes but not the music; pathos escape him, and he's puzzled on how to effectively stage character-oriented human drama. He's not much better with the Dianne Wiest stuff, which seems coy and a little forced. The picture looks good and, with Danny Elfman scoring, it sounds fantastic. However, the writing is so muddled one comes out of the picture not even knowing how he feels about the damsel in distress (Winona Ryder), or for that matter Edward himself. Johnny Depp is perfect in the lead, but it's a stunt part on one-note. **1/2 from ****"
"TheNorthernMonkee","6","4","10","5 September 2005"," flawed Tim Burton, but even flawed the guy is still a genius
","SPOILERS Directors always leave their mark on a film. A distinctive style, you can often tell who has made it without even needing to read the credits. One of the most distinctive of these is Tim Burton. Aside from the obvious fact that he often casts Johnny Depp in his films, Burton's films are creepy, dark, disturbing encounters which stand out as a sort of comedy Gothic. Buildings which are black and twisted, characters who contain a dark side irrelevant of their goodness, all point towards the beauty of Burton's work. One of his earlier works, ""Edward Scissorhands"" follows the pattern to a degree. A great satire of the American suburb and the 'perfect' way of life, the film is distinctively lacking in several parts, but that doesn't stop it from pulling you in.<br/><br/>Peg (Dianne Wiest) works for Avon and is hardly the most successful of sellers. Phoning amongst her circle of friends, holding community barbeque's and having the tea on the table when her working husband returns, she and everyone around her are the epitome of the American perfect world. When Peg attempts to sell her goods at an apparently ruined old house, she encounters the completely unique Edward (Johnny Depp). Built by a scientist (Vincent Price in his final on screen film role), Edward never receives human hands and instead possesses blades instead. Feeling she is doing a good deed, Peg takes Edward home and for a while everyone falls in love with this unique character. This is Tim Burton though, life is never that simple.<br/><br/>What final opinion you have of ""Edward Scissorhands"" depends entirely on your perspective. If you watch with a desire to see decent acting, you're going to be disappointed. Depp, whilst far from awful, is lacking in the genius which he develops in future years. Wiest too is far too average, whilst Winona Ryder plays Winona Ryder. Nobody shines, and so anyone who thrives on superior acting will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Similar, if you view the film for even the remotest realism, you are both daft (this IS Burton after all) and in for a period of crucial issues. Whether Edward's diet (finding it difficult to eat with the family, where does he actually get food and how does he eat it?) or the way he magically manages to create ice blocks out of thin air, there are key continuity errors in this little tale.<br/><br/>Burton's style is also notably different in ""Edward Scissorhands"" compared with later works. Whilst the mansion is twisted and Burton like in feel, so much else of the landscape is all pristine and bright. This in itself is a masterstroke because he creates a world to match the characters imposed attitudes and the whole notion of this world is to ridicule a way of life which really is beyond saving. These characters ARE dark and more in tune with Burton's feel though. Whatever their lifestyle and false morals, they are people with a hidden evil inside themselves and who flick from one mood to another at the flick of a switch. Anyone 'normal' is designed to be disliked and the eventual change in Ryder's feelings feel forced and illogical. She is the only one Burton really attempts to redeem (Wiest is permanently nice and arguably more naive than Edward himself) and this might not have been the best move in the scheme of things.<br/><br/>So ultimately, there is little denial that with ""Edward Scissorhands"" there are considerable flaws which lower the quality of the film. So why should anyone watch this film? Well, for all it's faults, it is still a Tim Burton film and you do still get a feeling of his style. At the same time, his unique portrayal of America is clever, occasionally subtle, and well constructed. There are also moments of entertainment which are unique and often funny. Edward's introduction to alcohol for example. Or the incredibly stupid idea of putting a man with blades for hands onto a water-bed. For small treats like this, the mistakes are worth tolerating.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has done, and will do, better films than this. Released years before superior films like ""Nightmare before Christmas"", ""Big Fish"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"", this is a flawed affair which will agitate and probably disappoint. At the same time though, it does have it's moments, and there are definite glimpses of Burton talent (most notably in the satire of suburbia). A nice introduction to Burton, but you can find better films to watch."

","On her rounds in suburbia, Avon lady Peg Boggs spots the old castle at the end of the street that she has never sold to.  Upon inspection she meets a young man who lives alone in the castle since the death of his creator.  He is a normal boy with the exception that his creator never finished him and in place of hands he has scissors.  Peg brings Edward to live with them. Suburbia greets him with curiosity at first then open arms when Edward's scissors turn out to be a gift when it comes to cutting hedges or hair.  As Edward begins to fall for Peg's daughter Kim, the community slowly begin to revert to fear of the different.<br/><br/>Considering recently that he failed to really bring any spark of imagination or wonder to Plant of the Apes, it is worth remembering the impact that directors including Burton had and what they did.  Burton brought his own brand of weirdness to the mainstream cinema and must be given some credit for it's continued place in the cinema.  Of course I do not say he was a trailblazer but his style is quite unique in some respects.  Here he owes a nod of respect to David Lynch as it is he who's suburban picture Burton seems to have modelled his own town, although Burton gives his a much more surreal twist and fairytale naivety.  The community seems to be standalone as opposed to part of a large city and a castle stands at one end of the street  supposedly unnoticed!  The visual design of the film and the unique feel are the main reason to watch this film  it is full of invention as well as well staged cliché.  It's hard to describe but the suburbia-hell design are at once instantly recognisable but also inspired, visually everything has a wonderful `other-worldly' feel to it while still being very real.<br/><br/>The plot is pure twisted fairy tale and is really a tale of the odd-one-out teenager if you pare it down to it's bones.  It allows for much in the way of strange humour and strange happenings but it doesn't totally succeed to bring enough emotion out of the plot.  It has the odd moment here and there which is touching but really Edward is too weird for us to totally get behind  I found myself supporting him but still with a edge of not really getting him.  Because so much is made of his appearance and his hands I didn't know much about him and therefore couldn't really feel a lot with him.<br/><br/>Depp is good but is partly to blame for keeping Edward as a thin character, although not many other actors would have even tried to do it so fair play. He is amusing and few people can do weird like he does.  Ryder is good as the all-American cheerleader but the real wealth is in the support cast. The support is made up of a list of suburbia stereotypes all exaggerated for humour.  Wiest is strong in her role and I found Arkin to be absolutely hilarious in everything he did!<br/><br/>Overall the film looks fantastic and this is enough to justify watching it. It is quite funny and is also weird enough to sustain the interest.  Only where it needs real emotion or a strong heart does the film feel a little hollow and incomplete  just like Edward himself."

We have a sweet guy with scissors for hands and people take advantage of him in the most cruel ways. If you're going to be mean-spirited about it, have it get resolved in a satisfying way for your audience. How can you have a conflict that makes the experience unwatchable? Not only was this piece of garbage painful to watch, but there is nearly zero redeemable qualities about it.<br/><br/>The overall message is awful and when the guy gets treated like crap, no one does anything to stop it. It basically tells us that if you get mistreated, just kill the jerks and everything will be okay. Seriously, this is one of the most overrated movies ever made and people are oblivious to how unimportant it is. I'm giving it 2/10, because I did like the sets and costume design. Other than that, avoid this like the plague!"

","As a movie fan throughout my entire life, I can definitely tell you that the only movie to ever make me cry was Edward Scissorhands. Now it didn't make me cry last night, but when I watched it for the first time 10 years ago, it did. I don't know how, but apparently, the romance between Edward and Kim got to me. I can't hate them for it. The story itself is beautiful, heartwarming, and really moving. Edward Scissorhands is a Johnny Depp character at its finest. Even with his sharp touch, he's absolutely harmless. Every time you see Edward Scissorhands, you feel for him. This movie also benefits from the style of the cinematography and the production design, which perfectly blends in with the odd story to convey that emotion. Director Tim Burton and Johnny Depp would go on to collaborate on more movies ever since, but Edward Scissorhands remains as a masterpiece for both of them.<br/><br/>Score: 99/100<br/><br/>Recommendation: Anyone"
"lisafordeay","8","2","4","18 March 2015"," In my opinion the best Johnny Depp film I have seen out of his career
","OK to get things clear I am not a fan of Johnny Depp's at all as a lot of his movies tend to be creepy and he acts rather creepy in his movies. But in this film let me tell ya he won me over as the shy Edward Scissorhands. Edward Scissorhands you see was created by an inventor who tragically passed away(played by Horror actor Vincent Price) who was going to give him prosthetic hands for Edward,but instead he ends up with scissors as hands and finds it awkward. All that is about to change for Edward as he is taken in by a lovely lady who happens to have a daughter named Kim(who happens to be the narrator aka the old lady you see in the beginning of the film played by Wionna Rider)who Edward begins to fall in love with. But will she love him for his scissor hands and his scars?<br/><br/>Bottom line this was a very beautiful fantasy. The plot reminds me of Beauty & The Beast for some strange odd reason and Johnny Depp was very good as Edward Scissorhands who is a very modest young man (sporting a Micheal Jackson hairdo)and his charcther Edward you actually feel really bad for him as people are out to get him,including this one guy who tries to kill him and Edward fights back. <br/><br/>Overall I recommend this film to anyone who loves fantasy and Johnny Depp in total. Also the score by Danny Elfman was very haunting and beautiful and Tim Burton done a marvelous job behind the directors chair.<br/><br/>8/10"
"RossRivero99","9","2","4","30 December 2014"," Burton's best work since both Batman and Ed Wood
","Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands is an effort that to me is a near perfect Burton film, his film was inspired by a drawing he did as a teenager. As the movie opens we see an old lady telling the story of Edward Scissorhands to her granddaughter (in which this scene reminded me of Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride (1987) because both the beginning and ending scenes to both films are very similar), as the story is being told we see an Avon representative (played by Dianne Wiest) who is trying to sell makeup to her fellow neighbors who are really busy at the moment, after her makeup selling attempts are over she sees this creepy looking mansion and goes to it to see what is in there and as she gets to the attic portion she sees the creepy looking Edward (played by Johnny Depp) who is unfinished invention who happens to have scissors for hands and the Avon rep. ends up taking him to her place where he also happens to meet her husband Bill (played by Alan Arkin), her son Kevin (played by Robert Oliveri) and have a good time together for the first few days, and a few days after living there the oldest daughter Kim (played by Winona Ryder)comes home and Edward scares her half to death, and then becomes the local barber. Burton's film is a very delicate character study about Edward and the good and bad times that he has faced during his few weeks in his temporary new home. Before the movie is over things start heading downward for Edward because of the scenes where he gets beat up and insulted and put down by Kim's ex boyfriend Jim (played by Anthony Michael Hall)and officially becomes and outcast. The film is just one of those fairy tales that some people won't understand but will end up enjoying it depending on if you like Tim Burton and Johnny Depp or not."

","I was a little girl when the first time I watched ""Edward Scissorhands"". Even then I said that it's the best movie in the World! And even then I understood that it has an incredible story and beautiful, but unlucky love. This movie fascinated me. About twelve years passed away and I still think the same. Every time when TV shows this movie, I watch it, because I just can't don't watch. And every time it's very interesting like the first time when I watched it. This film made me to move to tears. All scenes are well played and made. Everything is amazing and I don't have any rebukes. Like every good film, ""Edward Scissorhands"" made me to feel concern about characters. The plot is full of values. It is very nice and good, in my opinion. Tim Burton is my favourite director, 10 points for him. For Johnny Depp too. Unique duet: Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, I love it. I think, ""Edward Scissorhands"" is worth to have 10 points. This Johnyy's role is one of his best.

"hoxjennifer","10","2","4","26 October 2014"," Absolutely Beautiful..
","Direction, cinematography, acting, and plot... all beautiful. Just like the creations that Scissorhands creates in the film, every element of this movie is hauntingly beautiful - artistically pleasing, with undertones of hurt and pain.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is the creation of a brilliant inventor, who successfully created a fully functional human from machine parts. However, he dies before he is able to give Edward his last finishing touch: human hands. Edward remains isolated and alone inside his dark castle, longing to know about the outside world while passing away his time letting his imagination run free in the elaborate hedges he creates in the garden. It is not until a curious Avon representative, Peg, goes to the castle and meets Edward that he becomes integrated into her pastel-perfect community - finally finding the human interaction he so craved...unfortunately although things start off looking good, it doesn't quite end so well.<br/><br/>""You can't touch anything without destroying it,"" is one quote that really stuck with me in this movie. The fact that Edward is missing hands is significant - human hands are symbolic of touch, of connection - and without them Edward is forever disconnected. He has so much talent within his scissorhands, but he is unable to establish a true human connection - in a way, this can be interpreted as a reflection of artistic prodigies in general (Michael Jackson, Tim Burton himself) - able to create and entertain, but are inherently isolated and lonely. <br/><br/>A deeply touching movie, a must-see for anyone who hasn't already watched."

He barely says anything but you can tell so much from just looking in to his eyes. That is great acting right there. Tim Burton's style of making movies is very interesting and fun to watch, and that is one of the reasons for this movie to be as great as it was.

"cwbellor","10","2","4","6 November 2013"," Frankenstein meets The Cure in Tim Burton's masterpiece about the social obstacles in front of orphans with prosthetic limbs.
","<ul><li>SPOILERS - Diane Weiss plays Peg, a woman who one day enters a creepy hilltop mansion yelling ""Avon calling""... umm, more like ""woman intruding!"" Diane enters a room in bad need of roof repair. That's when we're introduced to Ed, a creepy looking dark dweller with black hair, white skin and scars on his face. But this guy isn't as Emo as he looks. Well, come to think of it, he actually does look kind of depressed. What I mean is, despite the scars on his face, he doesn't cut himself on purpose. Edward is an orphan who has yet to discover the aphrodisiacal quality of ambrosia salad and Diane with her motherly instincts, decides it's time to introduce Ed to mediocre middle classdom. At first, things seem hopeful. Wynona Ryder appears as a bodacious blonde after living under a black cloud in Beetlejuice and becomes Eddie's snow queen if only for a few beautiful seconds. But suburban life ultimately proves difficult for Scissorstein. Peas are less than easy peasy, lemonade is as sour as Anthony Michael Hall's jealousy and the line between happy hair cut and happy ending becomes blurred. He also wets the bed.</li></ul><br/><br/>Ed bares a slight resemblance to that other black haired, white faced man of mystery, especially if you look at the album cover of Bad. While the similarities to Michael Jackson might seem superficial, they are in fact significant for the fact that he experiences a similar plight to that of Jacko's own fall from grace. Society's reaction to Ed will go from adoration and fascination to fear and paranoia faster than you can say poodle do. After initially accepting Ed and his talents, the white bread burbies become weirded out by him. That's when Ed is faced with the question of moonwalking out of Dodge or staying and being the neighborhood hedge/dog groomer. <br/><br/>When you sit down to watch this film and you see that it's set in cookie cutter suburbia, you might think this is a warm and fuzzy fable. Then Johnny Depp emerges from the shadows as a leathery lad with a puckery pale face and Robert Smith's hairdo. Naturally, this makes for a more complex tale. And while it may not be warm and fuzzy, it is definitely warm-hearted. Don't be fooled by the sharp fingers, Edward Scissorhands will touch your heart without cutting it."

"StevePulaski","9","2","4","6 June 2013"," Burton's unrefined, unmatched masterwork
","Tim Burton has an easy time creating sets and atmospheres that spring right from the bowels of his imagination, but he often has a more difficult time humanizing the eccentricities of his specific creations. With Edward Scissorhands that problem doesn't exist. Burton has successfully created his most personal story yet, combining true human emotion with characters that at first seem to be basic parodies of themselves. This kind of approach could've been fluffy and condescending, but Burton and screenwriter Caroline Thompson's maturity prevails over all.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Edward (Johnny Depp), a young boy who lives in a mountaintop Gothic mansion with the man who invented him. However, because the inventor died before giving Edward a pair of hands, Edward has hands that are long, metal, and sharp, rendering him as forever incomplete or unfinished. Far below the mountaintop is pure-whitebread surburbia, where everything is plain and colorful. It's a miraculous look in the way of set-design and architecture. One day, a local Avon representative named Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) is traveling through the neighborhood and ventures up the mountaintop to solicit to whoever is living there. When she finds Edward, shy, pale, and lonesome, she takes him home to live with her husband and two children so that he can have the feeling of a real family.<br/><br/>Edward is clearly an outcast in this suburban wonderland, until he discovers that he has a talent for hedge-trimming and yardwork thanks to his scissor-hands. He makes something of a hobby going around the neighborhood and cutting everyone's hedges into a beautiful sculpture. But when Edward finally meets Peg's beautiful daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), he begins to have feelings far beyond any he has ever had before. It's unfortunate, however, that Kim is dating Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), a narcissistic and hopelessly arrogant man who belittles Edward despite his charm and kind-spirits.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is likely the only person who could play Edward Scissorhands to the full extent, without channeling self-parody or unnecessary childishness. Depp is one of the only actors working today who chooses many ""one of a kind"" roles, meaning he can't go back to older films to see how another person played a character. And if even he could, like with Burton's later film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, he still infuses so much creativity and personal-preference into the character that any shred of a carbon-copy is unrecognizable. Depp gives Edward enough leverage emotionally and personally to make him likable and a worthy protagonist.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder works extremely well in the picture as well, working far beyond any pretty-girl notion that one would suspect from someone like her. There is a masterful scene in the film where Edward is sculpting a giant statue out of ice, shredding it at rapid speed, causing light flaky-snow to fall down. It is the first time the suburban neighborhood has seen snow or anything like it and right below Edward is Kim, basking in the falling snow as majestically as a teen girl could. The scene is warm and presents one of the nicest films in any film Burton has done.<br/><br/>But ultimately, the themes of discovery, isolation, conformity, and ignorance take full presence in Edward Scissorhands. The character of Edward is a perfect one, indeed, and the setting for the story - a plastic suburban village - is perfect as well for a story like this to be told. Suburban areas are often conducted in a certain fashion, where everything is done a specific, orderly way and no questions are asked. There's little room for difference mainly because the elements of predictability and control are so heavily capitalized. The character of Edward shows an initial suburban area's reaction to a harmless, but different character, who proudly refuses conformity and a melting-pot lifestyle simply by getting by with what he has. While stories emphasizing originality and uniqueness aren't uncommon in movies, it's stunning to see a story like this portrayed in mainstream cinema so boldly, emotionally, and effectively. The case of conformism and being your own person is amplified so differently here just by the choice of character and supporting characters that it creates an astonishingly working blend of craft.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is, in fact, Burton's masterwork, clearly personal, richly detailed, and aesthetically beautiful in many regards.<br/><br/>Starring: Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Weist, and Anthony Michael Hall. Directed by: Tim Burton."
"bkoganbing","10","2","4","15 July 2009"," The Gentle Frankenstein
","In case no one has noticed it actor Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton have collaborated on six joint projects, certainly enough to qualify them as a screen team like Wayne and Ford and DeNiro and Scorsese. But in my humble opinion they have not topped Edward Scissorhands their first and best work together.<br/><br/>I think the part of Edward Scissorhands, the gentle Frankenstein like creation of Vincent Price, was Johnny Depp's real breakout role. Around this time Depp was at a real critical point in his career. He was a teenage idol due to his role on 21 Jump Street, but he had it in his head he could do some really serious work. It would have been easy to go with the flow and stayed with the series a few more years and make a pile of money. Sad to say though once teenage idols lose their vehicles very few have careers of the first rank, no matter how talented they are. <br/><br/>Instead Johnny Depp remained true to himself and confident in his abilities and it paid off. This role was so unlike what he had done before and his is a career that keeps reinventing itself with every film. This was his first reinvention and it remains my favorite film of his.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is a fable like a modern Grimm fairy tale with nods of acknowledgment to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Peter Sellers character in Being There. Edward is a creation like the Frankenstein monster, but it's no criminal brain that's commanding his body. He's as innocent as a babe, a real live boy, but with a pair of hands made from garden clippers, sharp as a razor. His inventor Vincent Price died before giving him human hands leaving an innocent with what could be deadly weapons.<br/><br/>His innocence is preserved when Dianne Weist the Avon Lady from the neighborhood goes to the Gothic house that looms over her neat suburban pastel neighborhood. I've got to hand it to Tim Burton for those pastel suburban sets showing the stultifying conformity, contrasting to Vincent Price's place. The shots of the ordinary suburban types doing their daily thing say more than 100 pages of dialog.<br/><br/>Weist takes him home, Depp has survived in the place, God only knows how. She seeks to integrate him into life. Those scissorhands prove to be quite popular as he sculpts designs in the suburban hedges, and then goes into hairdressing where he works at a fantastic pace.<br/><br/>Depp's as innocent as Peter Sellers let out into the real world in being there. But said to say it all works out like it did for Boris Karloff in Frankenstein.<br/><br/>Besides those I've already mentioned, pay note to the performances of Winona Ryder as Weist's daughter, Anthony Michael Hall as her jock boyfriend whose jealousy starts Edward's world unraveling and Kathy Baker who stepped out of Desperate Housewives for her role. <br/><br/>This was Vincent Price's farewell performance on the big screen. He did one more made for television film and then after he died a cartoon version of Arabian Nights which was shelved for 20 years was released. In the Citadel Film series book, The Films of Vincent Price, Johnny Depp paid a fine tribute to Price saying he was a wonderful man to work with and a real inspiration. Price also gave him some good financial advice. Buy art as the best hedge against inflation in hard times. And Vincent Price certainly knew his art.<br/><br/>With all these fine people in it, the film is owned body and soul by Johnny Depp. His performance in which his dialog is kept to a minimum due to the character is an object lesson of how much emotion one can convey with both lack of dialog and heavy makeup. Speaking of which the only Oscar this film was nominated for was in the Makeup category and it lost to Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy. How Johnny Depp didn't get a nomination at least is a disgrace.<br/><br/>You watch Edward Scissorhands and I recommend you watch it as a triple feature with Frankenstein and Being There and it will blow you away."

Even the godfather aka voted no 1 has far more 1 ratings. This is due to the fact that this is a good film. Although you may not get it and love it'll be very rare if the words rubbish come out of your mouth.<br/><br/>This is an original film based on young man who was created. Okay maybe stole from Frankenstein there but hey. Anyways he was created by an old man. However the old man had died before Edward was fully created the last thing that wasn't done was his hands. Hence the name Edwars scissorhands. So he lived by himself in a lonesome castle and well it seemed obvious that he was depressed and alone. Till one day a chirpy, avon sales woman found him and took him to the peachy keen suburbs.<br/><br/>So the film is based around that and funny and upsetting moments ensue. It is a great film. However i would suggest those who are really young don't watch just for the fact that it's an unusual film that could scare REALLY young children. Oh i forgot to mention his hands wern't finished so his hands are scissors. I thought you may have guessed that though lol.<br/><br/>I recommend you watch."
"Quinoa1984","9","2","4","8 April 2006"," a sweet film that portrays the good and bad in suburban life with originality
","Every couple of years I sit and watch Edward Scissorhands when it's on TV, just as a reminder of how much Tim Burton can do so well storytelling on a kind of universal level. As the film is much like a fairy tale like the Ugly Duckling, it can work for young and old. But it would be just a very good children's film if not for Burton's iconoclastic kind of vision, which has its form here in one of its most pure sightings (as he rarely writes his own films, this is one of the few that mark as his completely). The characters are not complicated at all, and anything standing between the two who fall for one another- Johnny Depp's Edward and Winona Ryder's Kim- is just attitudes in a small town kind of atmosphere. It's actually a film even more based on behavior than actual plot, and despite the absurdity nature given to the look of the town and the obviously Gothic look of Vincent Price's Professor's castle, it's as much a tome of American drama as American Beauty is, in its way.<br/><br/>Depp is in his breakout performance here, with the role that took him apart from his 21 Jump Street days as a character who could just as well work, if not better, as a silent-film character. In fact, the kind of Lon Chaney characteristic that's been applied to Depp in the past years is more than evident in this film, as his wounded Edward has a vulnerability that Depp rarely gets to play this well. The roundup of supporting actors is quite good too, with Dianne Weist as the housewife who finds him in the castle and takes him down to the town. Ryder too is in a good role too, especially when playing off of the very against type Anthony Michael Hall (yes, the Breakfast Club nerd) as a jock who becomes quite an antagonist. The little scenes of Edward acclamating to the small-town life, cutting and shaping hair and bushes his specialty, are interesting and amusing. But it's in the final fifteen to twenty minutes when the darker portion of this tale takes shape. And, it's likely, aside from scenes in Big Fish, the most affecting Burton's ever fashioned.<br/><br/>One of the better films of 1990."

","I'll tell you off the bat that Tim Burton is my favorite director and when I was reading up on this movie and I rented it I was skeptical because it seemed a little too weird. However this movie was yet another showcase of the brilliance of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The atmosphere Tim Burton sets is like Sleepy Hollow and Nightmare Before Christmas in Edwards mansion and a lot like the town of Spectre in Big Fish in the town they live in. The basic synopsis of this movie is a door to door saleswoman named Peg finds a frankenstein-esquire character, Edward Scissorhands, in a mansion and takes him in. He struggles to learn and live life with other people because he has scissors for hands. This movie may sound strange but it is deep and brilliant and a modern classic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone."

","""Edward Scissorhands"" is a romantic drama about a lonely young man with scissors instead of fingers, who leaves the isolation of the Gothic castle in which he spent his whole life and comes into town among people. The story of isolation, socialization, human hypocrisy, stupidity and fear of everything that is different, but also about sincere friendship, love, and sacrifice. Edward is obviously inspired by Frankenstein's monster, with which he has a lot in common, although this is not a horror, but a warm and sad fairytale, and therefore Edward is also much milder ""monster"". Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder have excellent chemistry, which is understandable considering they were a couple during the shooting of this movie. Besides their love, on the set of this movie the friendship between Depp and Burton was born, and Depp has become a frequent occurrence in Barton's films. Burton rotates the same handful of actors through all his movies, but why would he change a winning combination. Barton's signature is obvious in both the story and the visuals - the film is magical, surreal and a feast for eyes. If you're even remotely sympathetic to Barton's style, ""Edward Scissorhands"" will keep your attention from the beginning to the end and leave you overwhelmed with emotions.<br/><br/>8/10"

He was then found by a lady who took him to her house to show him the ways of normal people.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is a great story. The writing was fantastic. The story was amazing. It was funny, scary and intense all at the same time! The acting was also pretty good. Johnny Depp did a great job. He made you feel sad a happy for the character. The music by Danny Elfman was astonishing! It was sad and happy. It also made you get involved with the movie.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is a great movie. It is a Tim Burton movie I would recommend."
"Better_Sith_Than_Sorry","7","0","0","27 October 2018"," Logic Takes a Holiday
","Interesting re-telling of ""Frankenstein"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" but comes up a bit short on logic, even for a fantasy film.<br/><br/>Plot in a nutshell: a creator's human-like invention (Johnny Depp) struggles to adapt to a world he's never known, including falling for the girl (Winona Ryder) he can't have.<br/><br/>There is some undeniable charm to this film. And it is noteworthy for being the first pairing of director Burton and actor Depp. Depp really nailed the character, despite his sparse dialogue (169 words in the entire film). But ""Edward Scissorhands"" is far from original (see 1935's ""Bride of Frankenstein"" for a misunderstood 'monster' hated by the townspeople); and while the sets are great (the castle, the pastel houses), this is hardly groundbreaking stuff. Sure it's nice to look at. But lay off the 10-star rating please.<br/><br/>The film is enjoyable overall and I didn't feel like it was a waste of my time. And yet, there are several plot points in the story which really, really do not make any sense. These plot points hurt the film and remove it from any sort of 'masterpiece' ranking. (Roger Ebert only gave it 2 stars out of 4, but I'll be a little more generous.) Spoilers follow!<br/><br/>* Why oh why does Edward have scissors for hands in the first place? We are shown that he was not intended to keep them, as the inventor gave him 'real hands' as a gift but died before they could be attached. But what is the point of giving him scissors for hands at all, even temporarily? It certainly was not necessary. Just leave it at nothing. The scissors were a threat not only to others but also to Edward himself (as we saw all of the self-inflicted scars on his face); there is no reason he should ever have had them. Would you give your creation something that in essence is actually a dangerous weapon? You wouldn't, of course, because it's illogical. But then...you wouldn't have a film I guess. This is a big negative.<br/><br/>*Edward apparently can't hold or handle eating utensils at the Boggs house. How then did he eat anything before he came to town?<br/><br/>*How does Edward go to the bathroom? Does he ever have to go? Yes he's artificial but he needs 'energy' of some sort right? We're meant to think he's human, but then think...he's not human? I don't know. Confusing.<br/><br/>*Who pays the bills for the old mansion to keep it going? Anyone? Or does Edward just somehow exist there without paying real estate taxes, etc.?<br/><br/>*Kim has multiple opportunities to explain away Edward's 'transgressions' to the authorities and neighbors but never does. If she really cared about him, this is inexplicable.<br/><br/>*At the end of the film, with the dangerous boyfriend Jim out of the way, Kim is now free to maintain a friendship or relationship with Edward. But no. Instead she never sees him again, despite the fact that he only lives down the street. Instead she grows old and tells stories to her grand-kids of how she let the love of her life get away....what? He lives RIGHT DOWN THE STREET! Heck, he's still there! Wow that's just dumb. She can explain that it was a misunderstanding. Or, if the people won't listen, then she can forsake the world and go live with him. But she does neither. Really? That's just poor story-telling.<br/><br/>6.5/10. ""Edward Scissorhands"" has its merits but also has its flaws. 7 stars (rounded up) is probably a little generous but the film is decent enough, if you are willing to suspend logic for two hours. Would I watch again? (Y/N): Definitely maybe."
"Yeary72","7","0","0","24 July 2018"," Enjoyable Fun watch!
","This movie originally made in 1990 is another staple in Tim Burton's timeline of enjoyable, fun, and environmentally original pieces of work. Though the story is bogged down by cliche conflicts and sometimes annoying plot devices this movie is still a great work of art and a prime example on how Burton's style flows though a movie. But Burton's style though bright and fun sometimes lacks on the story side of the coin. Characters seems sometimes come off flat and have unclear motives. The movie focuses on one neighborhood and how the residents come to see and accept this very different person into their lives. This is an interesting idea for a movie but it not totally original or done well in some areas.
 
Overall, Burton's sometimes boiled down, cliche story can bring down the movie but his patented Burton style still helps it rise it above others in its genre. A joyful ride with good performances all around."

"Gymnopedies","9","0","0","26 June 2018"," Not Just Some Whimsical Fairy Tale
","Edward Scissorhands (played by Johnny Depp) is about a man who has scissors for hands. The film begins with a friendly Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs (played by Kathy Baker) who visits this abandoned mansion on the edge of the town and discovers Edward and she takes him home with her. From there on we Edward trying to fit in with the locals and discover the world that has been closed off from him. The film poignantly depicts Edwards early years through flashbacks of his past and how his 'owner' (played by Vincent Price) treated him. Edward becomes popular among the neighbors and are impressed by his adept hedge-trimming and hair-cutting skills. He begins to fall in love with the Boggs' beautiful teenage daughter Kim (played by Winona Ryder), despite her initial fear of him. Edward throughout the film expresses some sad utterances such as ""I'm not finished"" or ""Hold me, I can't"". When people don't understand something or somebody their feelings turn to that of fear, hatred and envy and this sadly applied to Edward because he was socially inept and some characters such as Jim, Kims boyfriend, takes advantage of him. Unfortunately as the movie progresses we witness Edwards popularity dissipate and we see this once popular and respected member of the community driven back to where he came from. Kim leaves Edward alone forever more because wants to remember him the way he was in her youth. Edward unable to understand the harshness of people and unable to fit in returns to the one place where he felt wanted and comfortable, on his own. It is ultimately an extremely poignant story about a man's rise and demise and who only ever wanted to fit in. Edward Scissorhands explores themes such as isolation, loneliness and self-discovery. It is not just some whimsical fairy tale, under the surface it is full of metaphors and subtext that represents or portrays society. It is essentially a dark tale about a man who only wanted to fit in. It is just hauntingly poetic."

","Tim Burton was ones among them most loved and respected directors and writers in the business with his first films like Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) been some of them and today I will review the later. In Edward Scissorhands, we follow a typical suburban family, who discovers Edward, a gentle, quiet and lovable man, who has a ""small"" issue, he has scissors for hands!! OK, that seems wacky and nuts, but this Burton we are talking about and his style is intense to say the least. <br/><br/>After-wards the family brings him in their home ,where the rest of the community starts to come to see that person ,ho frankly is as unique as it comes. Something I admire is that how they approach Edward, it was totally realistic ,think yourself how would you act if you saw a dude with scars in his face ,in goth clouting and wit huge scissors for hands, this how!! In general the film feels like a modern fairy tale with the mix of Gothic and suburban colorful image. <br/><br/>One other thing that I have to praise is Johnny Depp as the title character. Also this was his first major big screen role. And unlike the ones we all have known and at this is point bored to see, he was completely unrecognizable as Mr. Scissorhands, very little dialogue and he mostly expressed himself through saddle facial moves and body language. Which is also really realistic for he was isolated for years and he didn't have any human contact for years up to now, so yes it is reasonable for him to be a little awkward.<br/><br/>To continue we have also a romance in the film ,which is handle so beautifully that at times you feel sorry for our protagonist for even though he is quit nice, his fantasy , as it is showed by his enterprises when he uses his hands, is of the chart, he can't hang or pet some because of his hands. Pretty sad if you ask me, I mean we often hear about persons, who have incredible strength or possess a deep knowledge of martial arts, but they are unable to be physical with others out of the fear that they would cause intentionally any injury. Now think that Edward has literally sharp blades for hands, it is if not worse, then the next worst thing after the previous examples.<br/><br/>All in all this a modern classic ,with a ending that will make you cry and it is high recommended to any couple or film-buff in general. Also like Princess Bride this is the one of the thousand romantic films that everyone can enjoy!"

","This is a fantasy film that describes the heartwarming mingling of the android which has a genuine feeling and a human girl. Edward is an android who was produced by an inventor. However, the inventor died suddenly, so he is left alone with metal scissors for hands. After that, a kind saleswoman, whose name is Peg, takes her home with him. In her home, he sees the picture of her daughter, whose name is Kim, and he falls in love with her.<br/><br/>Edward is really pure and admirable in spite of his hands are metal scissors. Johnny Depp can play this android nicely. Immediately after Edward comes to Peg's house, he is a general favorite. He makes an effort to bring joy to Kim and other residents of the town. However, he is exiled from there taking advantage of an incident. I thought Edward was really poor because he is apt to be misunderstood by his outward appearance.<br/><br/>In addition, the ending is also little sad for him. I thought that there might be other ways of ending."

","A reclusive inventory is in the business of automatic cookie making machines. How very nice and sweet, if the machine didn't look like a devilish contraption with all sorts of hissing and blades and dangling arms. Then he has the idea to build a living machine that will serve as his son, as an answer to his loneliness. For some reason or another, he decides to fasten ten long scissor blades instead of fingers, and just as he is about to attach human hands, he drops dead right on the spot. How very twisted, and how very Burton. <br/><br/>The decrepit mansion that Edward resides in recalls all the Gothic horror of the past, with its arches and curling stairwells and ominous statues. This doesn't trouble Peg Boogs at all. Dianne Weist is such a tremendous actress; she carries an endless motherly quality about her, with her creased smile and squinted eyes, and even when she is angry she is not really angry, but huffs and puffs and tries to reconsider. Here she considers all the ominous signs of the abandoned mansion on top of the hill, sticking out like a sore thumb in the barbie house neighbourhood, and approaches it anyway. She titters as she prances up the spiny, dusty stairway: ""I'm your local Avon representative!"" Burton shows awareness of the classic monster stories (Frankenstein, Beauty and the Beast). He clearly sets Peg up us the unwitting victim, crawling into the trap of the horror. So it is a pleasant surprise when Peg starts recommending beauty products to cover up his scars, and then decides to up and take him home with her. What a ticklishly funny image; the ghostly white, oversized Edward hunched in the front seat, and the ever-smiling Peg driving along as if she was just picking up a friend.<br/><br/>The town is a cute little caricature, with a chic colour scheme full of lime greens, bright pinks, baby blues, and so on, more garish and lurid as time goes on. Even the cars are colour-coded, and when they pull out of their driveway, they do so in sync with each other, and drive off to work in a conga line. So Edward's freakish appearance seems the complete antithesis of such a bright neighbourhood, but in reality he fits right in. The women gossip and fawn over his ability to garden and style their hair, and force feed him their food like a baby, and the men slap him on the back and bust his balls. Bill encourages him to charge for his services, and even to open his own business, so it is no surprise that the freak is normalised as soon as he finds a use for his bizarre tools. <br/><br/>Depp is a cartoon character come to life. His hair sticks out in a messy manner of different directions as if he is being constantly electrified, and when his hands whir and get to work, we get the same type of cartoonish animation, with bits of hair and bush spitting out and flying everywhere until he reveals his masterpiece. The performance is a strongly physical one; what could be said in a few whispered words, Depp prefers to show in his body language. Edward is in a permanently hunched state, his gangly scissorhands dangling down from his already long limbs, giving him the appearance of a grotesque monster. But it is one of those 'it's more scared of you' situations; Depp's wide, frightened eyes betraying an innocence that clashes with his appearance, and when he stalks out of Kim's room after both frightening each other, the mechanical awkwardness in his strides and the way he holds his hands is first endearing, then scary. <br/><br/>It is all wrapped up in a somewhat convincing love story. It is the beauty and the beast finding unlikely love, except in this instance the beauty has an arrogant, thuggish boyfriend that defies belief that anyone could fall for him. He is the designated baddie, the fall guy (literally), and therefore only slightly imagined and fleshed out. For the viewer it is only a matter of time before Kim and Jim become Kim and Edward. But even the latter only lasts for a brief moment, with Kim making the sacrifice for the sake of Edward's safety. The film is framed by a lovely narrative device plucked straight from a children's fairytale. You can almost hear the little boy tuckered up in his sheets, asking ""Granny, where does snow come from?"""

Possibly a mistake.<br/><br/>STILL have no clue as to why ""The Inventor"" gave his creation not only scissors for fingers BUT long, unwieldy, multiple fingers ! The hands are not only useless but in the way. This plot hole is INCREDIBLY distracting !!! That plot problem aside ... the MUSIC is the best thing about the picture. Danny Elfman is the best when it comes to Burton films.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, Wynona Ryder and Diane Wiest shine at what they are given to do. Peg is one of the best film moms ever. The supporting characters acting-wise are aces. The villainous bully boyfriend is hateful and hated so he was also doing his job.

It made 618 261 entries in France.<br/><br/>Personally I really liked this film. The music matches this film. We can see it's a Tim Burton film because the decor is very original. This is a suburb but a special suburb because the houses are identical and people's lives are identical. The story is very good too: Edward a young man with scissors instead of hands meets Peg. He is greeted by Peg, her husband, Bill, her son, Kevin, and her daughter, Kim. Edward discovers real life and fall in love with Kim but she has a boyfriend, Jim. But after a while Kim falls in love with Edward. Jim is so angry, when Edward accidentally hurts Kim, Jim calls him a freak. Edward flees and destroys everything out of anger. But he sees Kevin and he saves his life but he accidentally hurts Kevin. As a consequence to this misunderstanding, the neighborhood would like Edward go back to his mansion. A sad Kim goes to Edward's castle and tells him: ""I love you"" Edward kill Jim to save Kim's life and Kim tells the neighborhood that Edward is dead. Edward sculpts an ice angel of Kim dancing and thus creates snow.<br/><br/>I love the last scene: Kim is a grandmother and she explains why it is snowing to her granddaughter. The story is very sad for me, mostly the last scene in the future.<br/><br/>It reminded me of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, another Tim Burton film. This film is full of fantastic, typical of Tim Burton's world. This film is amazing, people are crazy like in Edward Scissor hands. Peg's suburb is like the chocolate Factory, colored and joyful.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, I think that it was a very good film with an interesting story and very good actors."

","Johnny Depp is superb as Edward Scissorhands, an orphaned creation of a kindly inventor(Vincent Price, wonderful)who died before he could fit hands onto Edward, who has continued to live on alone in a castle on top of a hill until an Avon lady finds him, and takes him home to her bewildered family(Husband played by Alan Arkin, and daughter played by Winona Ryder) At first, the neighbors are fascinated by Edward, who performs various tasks(like hairdressing and shrub-pruning) until an arrogant bully(played by Anthony Michael Hall) starts to make trouble, and soon almost everyone turns against Edward, who must flee...<br/><br/>Well-directed(by Tim Burton) fable about social acceptance vs. social alienation, based mostly on appearances and what's considered ""normal"" is endearing and clever, though dramatically uneven, and at times(intentionally?) tacky.

"rickbu-297-808100","9","0","0","3 January 2013"," A deeply felt coming-of-age story
","I think ""Edward"" strikes an emotional chord with so many of us because we recognize our own struggles with adolescence that Edward experiences as he's first introduced to society. Those who've experienced the sometimes-bitter and painful process of growing up in modern America will immediately recognize and empathize with his shy innocence, his awkwardness, his feelings of isolation and ""different-ness"" and difficulty fitting in. Whose heart doesn't reverberate in sympathy with Edward's first experience with love, and the joy and heartache and rage that it can bring? I think most can recognize his feelings of ""incompleteness"" - visually represented by his ""scissors hands."" And, who wouldn't recognize his feelings of (suddenly) being a misunderstood monster, with a beauty inside that seemingly no one else can see, or cares to, and whose own emotional inexperience and clumsiness leads us to have hurt those we love most? When he's told ""you can't touch anything without destroying it!"" - who hasn't felt that way about themselves? I think that's part of why this film can carry such an emotional punch, as Burton touches on themes of sometimes sweet, and sometimes painful experiences many of us can immediately relate to, because we recognize similar experiences in our own adolescence.<br/><br/>Depp's portrayal of Edward is sublime - I find his range of expressiveness - fear, curiosity, puzzlement, joy, love, anger, rage - so eloquent, yet often transmitted only via his eyes. His facial expressions are limited and stoic, partly by make-up, but also, I think, deliberately. Yet he manages to convey a remarkable emotional range - and somehow, he takes me with him.<br/><br/>The story arc has been told and re-told here - stripped bare, I admit, it's almost silly in its apparently banal storyline. In fact, when I first heard of the premise of the movie, I thought it sounded ridiculous. Until I saw it.<br/><br/>In addition to Depps' performance, Ryder has some beautiful moments here, and Wiest and Arkin are strong throughout. I found the Esmerelda character to be a bit, well, ""off"" - I'm not sure her role was strictly necessary. But on-balance, the neighbors and the neighborhood are pitch-perfect, at least to me - perhaps this is more about ""me"" and people of a certain age, but the suburb and its inhabitants as depicted was a stunning recreation of the late 60's/early 70's Southern California suburb where I grew up.<br/><br/>The early mood of a modern sweet fairytale diminishes over time, as the events surrounding Edward become more ""real"", more banal. I assume this was intentional on the part of Burton - but still, the penultimate act of violence is jarring, and I wish Burton found a less brutal way to resolve the conflict. I'm sometimes afraid that some may turn away from the movie at this point, and fail to see the heart-wrenching, and redemptive final scene.<br/><br/>Because despite a few flaws, if the final scene doesn't bring tears to your eyes, I don't know what to say. I can barely watch the movie now without almost inexplicable tears.<br/><br/>I don't know that this movie is for everyone. But for those who ""get it"", it's a touching and memorable film."

I mean, he uses themes associated with evil for the protagonist, and everyone's first impression is that Edward is an evil man, but Tim Burton clearly shows to us that Edward is a light-hearted man who has a very soft heart. I also absolutely LOVED the character of Pegg, the kind woman that actually adopts Edward! I found her hysterical!

It tells the story about when Edward comes out of the isolation of his inventor's house and mingles with human society. It is essentially a human story about an outsider with Gothic overtones. Depp's performance is a sheer and moving character study of innocence-cum-alienation. I was moved to tears towards the end. The best Burton-Depp collaboration till date.

","As a big fan of Johnny Depp, I just had to watch this movie. In a nutshell, this movie depicts how an 'artificially created' person, with scissors in place of hands is suddenly brought into a suburban society and how he struggles hard, maybe too hard to be accepted. While at first he gains popularity through his fairy tale like artistic cutting creations and innocent and pleasing personality, the hypocrisies of the real world start taking it's toll; to the point that his deeds of trying to help people with the purest intentions are misunderstood and more often than not deemed threatening. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp puts in an out of the world performance as Edward. Right from his facial expressions of an artificial man portraying innocence, confusion, love and child like excitement (when he sees the suburbs for the first time) to his body language portraying nervousness, wholehearted indulgence (while creating his works of art) and the frustration of being a misfit,it is just a treat to watch him enact this simple yet complex character.<br/><br/>The movie has created a number of emotionally captivating scenes; ranging from how Edward first senses Kim's feelings towards him but realizes that very moment that he does not fit into her world to the scene where Edward is presented with a pair of real hands by his creator but in a moment of misfortune loses it before he could even use it.<br/><br/>The music score provided by Elfman just adds extra magic to the emotionally rich scenes throughout the movie.<br/><br/>One of the best movies that I have watched in recent times.

Edward lives alone in a Gothic mansion on a hill, left to him by his creator, Vincent Price(yes, the old b movie actor). An Avon sales woman, Peg, visits him and feels sorry that he has no one, and so she takes him to her home. He meets her husband, Bill, their son Kevin, and daughter, Kim(Winona Ryder). He uses his hands to trim their hedges and becomes a sensation in the neighborhood. A woman suggests opening a hair salon with her and she attempts to seduce him. He resists, and she later accuses him of trying to rape her. He picks a lock for someone else, and gets in trouble with the law. At Christmas time, Ed makes an ice angel sculpture, and the shavings create snow, which Kim dances under. He accidentally cuts her with his hand, and is accused of a jealous neighbor of attacking her. He flees back to his house, and is followed by Kim.

","It is movies like this that remind me why I love movies so much. As I sat and watched ""Edward Scissorhands"", I had a smile on my face almost from beginning to end. Once upon a time, there was an eccentric inventor who lived alone in a large mansion. Making gadgets was something he loved to do and there was something he created that was different and unique: a man with scissors for hands which he fittingly named Edward Scissorhands. The inventor planned on giving him real hands, but as he was old, he died before he could do so. This left Edward with those scissors for life. He continued to live up in mansion until a lady found him alone and decided to take him in. She showed him what it was like to live in the real world and he quickly fell in love with her daughter, Kim and became the center of attention for the whole town. As of 2012, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have worked together in exactly 8 films, this one being the first. Johnny Depp does a fantastic job as the innocent and often clueless Edward Scissorhands and his performance and acting style blends perfectly with Tim Burton's bizarre fantasy stories. Tim Burton is my favorite director of all time because he is able to produce movies with stories that are exactly what appeal to me and have appealed to me since I was a young child: dark, intriguing, creative, unique, and often creepy. I have only have one complaint about this movie: the neighbors were painful and quite annoying to watch. But the good scenes were so great that they helped compensate for these painful scenes. And Edward is not just a character; he is a symbol for those who are different than others and who don't quite seem to fit in in life and I am here to say that this alone made the him one of the most likable characters I have ever seen in on screen."

","I could relate to Edward so closely except of the scissor hands of course, but we are both outsiders in a judgmental and hypocritical society. Tim Burton's film tells the tale of an elderly inventor (Vincent Price in his final role) who was set on creating the perfect man (Johnny Depp in his Burton film), but the Inventor soon died of a heart attack; leaving his creation with scissors for hands. Later, a local Avon saleswoman (Dianne Wiest)comes upon the isolated young man and takes him home to leave with her husband, son and daughter (Winonna Ryder). This film is one of Burton's most sensitive and beautiful story about a misunderstood man in a world that does not support differences. Depp's performance as the title character is one of powerful emotion, pure talent and genius. Any Burton fan would be lost if he or she has not seen this wonderful movie."
"krazyguy100","8","0","0","30 June 2012"," A troubled, Frankenstein-like man was created by an old inventor, and given scissors for hands. Gothic drama ensues.
","The year was 1990, and from the dark, Gothic mind of Tim Burton came perhaps the most overtly dark and Gothic movie of his career: Edward Scissorhands. Sometimes the formula works, like in the cases of Sleepy Hollow or Sweeney Todd. Other times, we end up with weird messes of movies like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Alice in Wonderland (notice, in each example, Johnny Depp is featured prominently). Fortunately, this film is an example from the former category. Featuring some excellent performances, an outstanding musical score, and typically Burton-esque visual flair, this film is one for the ages.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands, as a character, is a very interesting guy. We're not quite sure if he's a flesh-and-blood human or some sort of cyborg, but we do know that he is capable of love and affection. Having been a recluse in an abandoned mansion for many years, these are acquired skills for him. He's a tragic and highly misunderstood man as well as a sort of embodiment of an emo wrist cutter's psyche. However cool a concept, I don't think Burton was trying to be subtle with the whole 'scissors for hands' idea.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Edward is a fantastic character. Despite his physically grotesque nature, we as an audience grow to love and pity him, and become emotionally invested in his story. Johnny Depp gives one of the best performances of his career here. Also worthy of note are Winona Ryder and Dianne Wiest, who are sympathetic and relatable in their roles. Anthony Michael Hall plays a great antagonist that everyone loves to hate, and Vincent Price has a great cameo as the inventor (his very last performance, sadly). Depp and Ryder have great on screen chemistry, and share some truly touching moments.<br/><br/>Backing these moments and others is an amazing soundtrack from Danny Elfman, another common Burton collaborator. These men make real movie magic together here, and add a whole new dimension of dark emotion. Through the perfectly orchestrated music we feel joy, sorrow, or rage along with these characters. It gives the film more artistic quality, and continues to resonate long after you've finished watching. I must admit, every time I watch the movie I sit through the entire end credits scene, just to enjoy more of the music.<br/><br/>And while the film is certainly a treat for the ears, it is also very nice to look at. Costume design, makeup, set pieces, cinematography These are elements of film that Burton and Co. have down to an exact science. The dark and distinctly Gothic look of Edward himself, the mountaintop mansion, and most of the nighttime scenes contrast beautifully with the happy and colorful suburban neighborhood setting. There is typically a lot of the color black, and a fair amount of steampunk machinery, juxtaposed with garish women's clothing and jolly Christmas season decor. It's what fans of these films expect from Burton, and he delivers it in perhaps his most stylish fashion yet. Even now it feels very original, especially when compared to his more recent, contrived outings. Dark Shadows, we're looking at you.<br/><br/>As a work of art, as simple entertainment, or as a visual representation of Tim Burton's insanity, Edward Scissorhands succeeds. It is an excellent modern fairytale and a must-see, and I give it 9 out of 10 stars."
"patryk-czekaj","8","0","0","28 June 2012"," Some flaws in the story, but a very powerful message within
","I have always admired the unusual way, in which Tim Burton is able to communicate his opinion on old-as-our-world topics. In Edward Scissorhands he confronts the viewer with the constantly recurring problem of personal alienation and rejection from the society, because of differences that might seem too hard to comprehend or actually too scary for most of the 'normal' people.<br/><br/>In the deeply satirical, and highly unconventional manner Burton tries to persuade everyone that good heart and pure kindness won't be enough to be accepted, and that it sometimes takes less than a few minutes to change the way others perceive us. The extraordinary often tends to bore people after a while and they simply throw out human beings like trash bags when they don't need them anymore.<br/><br/>With fantastic special effects and spectacular optical illusions Edward Scissorhands is able to astound in the sphere of visual experiences. However, due to some flaws in the storytelling department it is still not such a fine piece of work like Beetlejuice or Batman.<br/><br/>In a strangely artificial world, where all houses are painted in high-contrast pastel colors, and people wear deliciously ugly and glaring uniforms, there is also a place for a gloomy 'haunted' house standing on a hill. The only person that occupies it is a boy named Edward. Because of the death of his creator, a mad scientist (Vincent Price), he is left with pairs of huge temporary scissors instead of hands. <br/><br/>Ono one shiny day one of the loony housewives, Peg (Dianne West), who lives in the city with her husband, son and daughter, comes knocking on his door, and after just a few moments she decides to take him home. In a community, where everybody is nearly as weird as Edward is, people don't find him strange or frightening. What's more, they are truly amazed by his fantastic abilities, namely the special gift of forming beautiful figures in bushes and ice blocks, and turning regular haircutting into an art form. He is glorified by the local news channels and loved by all the creepy ladies. He is the talk of the town, a one of a kind 'toy' that brings so much fun into this bizarre scenery. There is even some place for romance between him and Kim (Winona Ryder), the family's daughter. However, as it always happens, there are some people who don't appreciate an eccentric man with scissors as his fingers running around posing as a proper citizen. Soon, after a series of unlucky events, Edward is wrongly accused of breaking into a house and all of the fame and love starts to fade away as quickly as it came. And even though what happens next to Edward is truly sad and unfair, the ending is merely as predictable and Hollywood-like. Hard-pressed and angered, the main character is forced to resort to violence and kill the oppressing forces.<br/><br/>The collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp is nearly as perfect as ever. Without the fantastic character that they both created the movie wouldn't ever be as watchable as it is now. Depp shines on-screen, other characters maybe not so much, but what counts is that through this bizarre and visually impressive movie Burton was able to spread out the word about discrimination and loneliness in the most peculiar, yet really admirable way."

","Edward is a lonely boy, living in a spooky old house, up on a hill overlooking a pastel suburbia. Thankfully Avon comes calling and ""rescues"" Edward from his loneliness. Peg (Diannne Wiest) takes Edward (Depp) home with her when she takes pity on his lonely existence. Edward is introduced to Peg's family, and is soon infatuated, with her nubile young daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Edward soon attracts the attention of all of the Pastel colored neighbors. Hooray, everyone loves the new kid in town.<br/><br/>Why all the attention to for the new kid in town? It may have something to do with the fact that Edward looks like Robert Smith, circa 1985 from The Cure, except he has scissors for hands. Via some flashbacks we become aware that Edward's creator/dad (Vincent Price) (Yay !) passed away, before he could complete Edwards hands. This peculiarity is soon put to ""good"" use by the towns folk, as Edward has a natural proclivity for creating top-notch topiary and trimming women's hair. It would appear these hair cuts also manage to cause some sort of female ecstasy. Point in fact, Edward is such a hair cutting virtuoso that some of the women want to help him open his own hair salon.<br/><br/>Wow a Tim Burton film with a happy ending! Well lets not go getting ahead of ourselves shall we. It soon becomes apparent that these neighbors motivations are not quite as they would initially seem. Unfortunately, many of these supposed friends simply want what Edward has, and or enjoy the novelty of his unique gifts. Edward's doe like naivety is soon taken advantage of, by his supposed friends, including Kim's conniving boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall).<br/><br/>Finding himself on the wrong side of the law, the majority of Edwards supposed friends quickly turn on him. They reveal themselves to be a selfish, prejudiced mob. As Edwards new friends abandon him, he is soon left with few choices and is more unhappy than he was at the outset of this tale. What exactly is Burton trying to tell us about human nature?<br/><br/>While some may regard this film as a story about the exploits of Edward, that was not quite the interpretation I came away with. This is in fact the story of Edward's neighbors, the seemingly happy inhabitants of the small slice of suburbia beneath his home. While the on the surface these folks appear as friendly, and loving, that is sadly not the case. They are in fact a fickle mob, who chew up, and spit out Edward, like a disposable commodity. Even those who supposedly love Edward, abandon him in the face of strong currents of public opinion against him.<br/><br/>It was refreshing to revisit a quality film from Burton/Depp, after suffering through the sub par Dark Shadows recently. Burton explores the concepts of judging people on appearances, mob mentality, and if it is better to have love and lost, or to have never loved at all, in this solid film. Strong performances by Depp, Wiest, Price, and Hall (where has he been?) all add to the quality of this film. In addition, the creepy castle, that looks a lot like the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland, provides a stunning juxtaposition against the supposedly tranquil pastel suburbia. If you have not seen this film you should certainly give it a watch. <br/><br/>check out our site at 3guys1movie.com"

","My final movie of Tim at the Cinematheque is maybe is best: As ""Nightmare"", it results from the collision of two impossible ideas: here, suburbs and fairy tale. The mix is simply funny and deeply romantic as well. <br/><br/>The suburban life is indeed the trademark of all the great American filmmakers and all the ones that I like (Tim, Spielberg and Lynch) have the same desire to blow up the boring, calm, peaceful life there. The concept of bored housewives is maybe born here and Tim illustrates it with many characters and outstanding visual concept: the pastel pavilions, the dancing cars, the garden!<br/><br/>Strangely, the mess inside comes here not from Poltergeist, lost extraterrestrial or lodge spirits but about welcoming a new neighbor. This first collaboration with Depp is maybe his best because as a bit introvert person, he fits the character like a glove. The second collaboration with Wynona is excellent as well: I prefer her in black but it's funny to learn that blonde is her real color. Her family is a bit particular but they are very tolerant and heart giving and it's a good lesson for today world where our neighbors have become totally strangers. The ice of the cake is the beautiful romance that arises as well and the ice dance is a perfect moment of fairy tale that even Disney never has match. Danny's score sublimates the emotion of the moment and his entire soundtrack is the ultimate proof of the genius of the little maestro and it's really a shame that he never has won so far an Oscar. <br/><br/>******<br/><br/>Now that my run at the Cinematheque is over and that I have seen 12 Spielberg's movies and as much of Tim, i can try a comparison between those two: For me, Steven is ahead of Tim because he is most versatile and above all, he is a better storyteller (with a great eye for the camera) and thus can bring big emotions. The biggest lacking of Tim is the persistent use of the same cast: when it's Jeffrey Jones, Micheal Keaton, Wynona or Lisa-Marie, it's good but the pairing of the two introvert Depp and Bonham is just boring and the list of movies that they killed becomes long. Tim's assets are that he has a more artistic side than Steven's and he is above all more open to women. In relationships, romances or strong woman characters, Steven is very shy and a bit cold. Now, if cinematheque should start a new cycle, i would vote for Coppola so wait and see!"

","An uncommonly gentle young man, who happens to have scissors for hands, falls in love with a beautiful teenage girl.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands marks the first film I've seen by Tim Burton, the man behind all these weird but engaging films. The concept intrigues and the man behind it all seeks your wonder, and Edward Scissorhands succeeds! I was on Netflix, lost of what to watch. There's films that I've seen, films that do not intrigue, and films that are critically criticized. I've never wanted to watch one of Tim Burton's films, because they all seem to be presented campy and strange. While I do love films like this, Tim Burton seems to be getting somewhere else. But nevertheless, I watched it and simply loved it. Edward Scissorhands is possibly one of the greatest characters known to man. Johnny Depp plays him wonderfully, and his emotions were sad and lost, but you can read them easily. The character is put into a world just like today's, and doesn't exactly know what to do. I loved this concept, because it's real and entertaining, and also lots and lots of heartfelt put into it. The movie also has this bizarre feel to it. It wants you to be feeling for this character, but also feeling an comedic side to it. Tim Burton succeeds at presenting the film with great dark-humor, and I was chuckling at scenes that weren't meant to be chuckled at... What I liked most though was the ending. Yeah, yeah, endings are mostly a hate/like relationship, but Edward Scissorhands wins at all directions. It takes a fantasy-esque direction, and ends it with the feeling of sadness and happiness. The ending was fantastic, and it was great to see this emotional dept to it. So all in all, if you can take your daily dosage of bizarre-ness, and also understand Tim Burton's perspective, you'll love this film. Even if you love romantic films (which Edward Scissorhands presents real and true) this film is going to be loved. Now I'm going to be right back while I watch another Tim Burton film. 9/10."

","""Edward Scissorhands"" is pure brilliance when it comes to movie-making.<br/><br/>For example the moral that true love comes from within. Edward is considered as a hideous creature by Kim at first. But she realizes that he's the only man that loves her the most. This film also comments on the life in small communities. Gossiping woman meet on the corner, the people look into each others houses...This films really shows the hypocrisy of these people. The locations and decors are outstanding, to say the least. Edwards house and garden are perfect shots of beauty and macabre at the same time. Great work. And finally there are the acting performances. Johnny Depp does his best work under Tim Burton. The 3 film they made ( until now) are just perfect. Also, it's just impossible not to love Dianne Wiest in this film, she's the perfect cast in the role of the loving mother. So is the father played by Alan Arkin. And then there's Winona...Let me tell you, you haven't seen beauty until you see her dancing in the snow.<br/><br/>Classic movie."
"classicsoncall","8","0","0","24 March 2012"," ""I guess it would have to start with scissors.""
","It's virtually impossible to find a movie that's completely unique with an idea that's never been done before, and that's one of the reasons I find ""Edward Scissorhands"" to be such a compelling film. It has a fairy tale like quality in a modern day setting, relating it's story in a plastic, pastel suburbia complete with snoopy neighbors who can't wait to find out who the local Avon Lady (Dianne Weist) just brought home.<br/><br/>The strange thing about the story is how it juxtaposes the way people usually react to something strange within their midst. With Edward (Johnny Depp), there was no revulsion or fright at the sight of his disfigurement. Instead, they all marveled at his ability to transform shrubbery into animal shapes, and trusted him to do wonders for their hairstyles. It's only after they get to know Edward and accept him into the community that they later turn against him due to an unfortunate incident for which he's virtually been framed. I was surprised that the story took such a tragic turn with the boyfriend/bully (Anthony Michael Hall) at the finale, and wonder if director Burton couldn't have made his point without resorting to violence.<br/><br/>As a fan of Vincent Price, I recall how pleased I was when the picture first came out to see him perform in what would be his last screen appearance. In a way, the creepy mansion at the end of the road reminded me of ""The House on Haunted Hill"", an early favorite when I was just a kid that managed to scare the bejeezus out of me when I first saw it. In time, Price's pairing with Johnny Depp in this picture will be one of those neat trivia questions for movie goers to puzzle over.<br/><br/>The one thing that throws me about the movie though is the way it ends. Presumably the story takes place in the present day when the picture was made (1990), as the characters and setting all appear to be of that era. Which would mean that Winona Ryder's character having aged some sixty or seventy years would transport the end of the film well into the mid twenty first century. I guess if this is a fairy tale story it wouldn't matter at all, but somehow the transition was just a bit disorienting."

","The thing about Edward Scissorhands is that it is a VERY required taste. If you think about it, most of the movie is terrible, with plot holes and such. For instance, why put Edward on a water bed, why not just put him on the couch bed in the first place, you know, the one that doesn't have water in it. Its also obvious that none of the people in the town leave the town, since they have nothing better to do than gossip. ""Hey there's someone I haven't seen before in Peg's car, lets just f***ing tell EVERYONE I know!"" (only those who reside in the town obviously.) The dad seems like he's always stoned out of his mind, which may be on purpose, and how can Kim just fall in love with Edward with about one week of knowing him, and though he barely talks at all. It may just be consolation from being mad at Jim but still, it doesn't quite compute. Also, why would the inventor give Edward scissors for hands, he could have made him less lethal by just not putting anything at the end of his arms. I know it's the point of the movie, so don't judge me. And no one seems to be super freaked when they find Jim at the end, just a simple gasp.<br/><br/>But regardless I still love this movie. It is visually captivating, the acting is amazing, and artistic visualization is phenomenal. My personal favorite lines are when Edward comes back to the house and finds Kim and the classic ""Hold me."" ""I can't"". It's very unique, there is definitely nothing like it, and nothing will ever match up to it."

","I love this movie, not so much because it's my favorite Tim Burton movie, but it's really the first one that he did which you can tell nobody else but Burton would have made. Previously he managed to find material that suited him well and that he could import some of his style to. But this story really feels like Burton all the way through, from the wonderful casting of Winona Ryder, Johnny Depp and Vincent Price to the visual scheme of the movie and the whole theme of the misunderstood outsider, only temporarily redeemed by art.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands (Depp) is the unfinished creation of a classic style ""mad"" doctor (Price). When the Avon Lady (Dianne Wiest) comes calling and finds the boy all alone, she takes him down to her house and tries to help him fit in with what passes for normal life in the suburbs. He falls for her preppy daughter (Ryder) and gets into a conflict with her jock boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall). While temporarily becoming a celebrity due to his unique hairstyles and lawn decorations, Edward's freakish nature and his innocent and underdeveloped emotions eventually cause the neighborhood to turn against him en masse like the villagers in ""Frankenstein."" Under about 100 layers of makeup and prosthetics, Depp manages to turn in a very poignant performance as Edward mostly thanks to his ability to emote with his eyes like a silent actor. Ryder, who's been discarded by Hollywood in recent years, shows the kind of qualities that made her one of the few true teen stars of her time. The parents, played by Wiest and Alan Arkin, provide some of the film's most hilariously low-key moments of situational comedy. Arkin seems like the type of guy who doesn't really understand anything that's happening around him, but who has a graceful acceptance of the degree of chaos that his do-gooder wife brings to the family.<br/><br/>There's a brazen sort of coloratura in the extreme contrast between the pastel burbs and the perpetually dark and stormy castle that seems to exist right in the heart of town (without anyone taking much notice of it). In a sense it's the uneasy marriage of the comfortable Gothic beauty of ""Batman"" with the crazy funhouse colors of ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure."" The film's success really depends on one's willingness to accept the romance between Ryder and Depp, which develops without much narrative or dramatic impetus. It can in a sense be seen as a deep flaw in the film, since it's hard to see Ryder's initial warming-up to Depp's character as anything other than pity. Accepted on its own terms however, the story is as tragic as anything Hollywood has turned out in the past few decades. Edward is this guy who absolutely cannot have any contact with human beings without accidentally scarring them. The premise of the movie would indeed fall apart if Burton and his writers had tried to force a happier conclusion."

","Tim Burton's 'Edward Scissorhands' is a beautifully constructed modern fairy-tale detailing the life of an unfinished humanoid named Edward. His inventor died before he could complete Edward so he is left with a frightening set of razor sharp blades for hands. Edward remains isolated in the darkness of his inventor's hilltop mansion until a kind Avon lady comes to him and offers to let him stay in her house within a sickly prim, proper and perfect suburban neighbourhood where your every move is judged by the unforgiving inhabitants. Unexpectedly, Edward finds a love interest yet his naive inability to distinguish between right and wrong leads to him slowly being denounced by the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is simply an astonishing actor. His character of Edward is heart-warming and extremely lovable. With very little dialogue to work with, Depp's body language is perfect, embodying Edward as shy but very benevolent. He carries the film in a performance that would withstand his position as one of the most versatile actors in the history of cinema. Perhaps he could have got an Oscar nomination for his performance. <br/><br/>Burton has never been one of the most conventional film-makers and 'Edward Scissorhands' is no exception. Elfman's haunting track is brilliant over the almost clichéd fairy tale shots of the great mansion on the hill. This film is almost like Burton's homage to all fairy-tales or rather a telling of his very own. <br/><br/>Such a film will always be open for any interpretation in terms of meaning. It could be a satire about the crushing effects of judgmental American suburbia or some see Edward as a metaphor for Jesus. However outlandish you want to go with your interpretation of the film, 'Edward Scissorhands' is a great mystical film that is surprisingly poignant. <br/><br/>8/10"

Who in their right minds would take a fairy tale and include a man with scissors for hands? Burton's sheer strangeness continues after his beautiful Beetlejuice and Batman in this darkly colourful fantasy drama and throws the fairytale convention out of the window. Burton is an inspiration to the film industry, a man who does everything differently and there is no one else out there like him, and his finally cut creation, inspired by one of his own drawings, is a sentimental spark in his collection, his most touching to date.<br/><br/>For those fairytale lovers out there don't worry. This 1990 picture follows the convention of an outsider trying to make it in a land of troubles and difference, also including a beautiful girl and a touching if slightly obvious love story.<br/><br/>Like many Burton films he gives us a wonderful imaginative other world.<br/><br/>The oppositions encoded into this drama are fantastic. From the cold hearted dark home of Edward's to the unbelievably organised and colourful suburban town below, Burton's imagination allows viewers to see two opposite worlds living next door to each other.<br/><br/>These settings are exquisite in establishing the characters. The similar styled houses are those tidy and sophisticated homes you expect the rich and posh to live and sure enough all the middle aged gossip loving women live next door to one another. Their tidiness and appearances create that stereotypical shallow middle aged woman that shapes the story in so many ways.<br/><br/>The darkness of Edward's home is brought to life through the cold machinery. The inventor's house is a dark walled, miserable and negative creation and marks the quietness and shyness of central character Edward.<br/><br/>Who would believable Captain Jack Sparrow and Edward are portrayed by the same actor? You see Jack's cockiness provoking Elizabeth Swan with his quiet ruthlessness, and then you see Edward hiding his face from Kim with his Scissorhands. How Depp was never nominated for as Oscar for this performance will rage on until the end of time. Words cannot describe how he makes this character.<br/><br/>Good support is given by Ryder, West, hall and beautiful protagonist Joyce is created by Kathy Baker's ultimate fake charm.<br/><br/>Burton has waved his wand again to cast a dark and imaginative spell over the conventional fairytale and turned it into a bubbling dark and touching fantasy"

","My favorite Tim Burton movie.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the eponymous eccentric, a patchwork man created by an old inventor (Vincent Price) who dies before he can give him hands. A tragedy of sorts ensues when he's adopted by a suburban American family, only to ultimately discover that there's no place for him in the ""normal"" world.<br/><br/>""Edward Scissorhands"" covers many of Burton's recurring themes: the artist as mad genius; the lack of tolerance for anything different from the norm. But what I like about it is the intense heart beating at the center of the movie. It's full of love, really, and of kind people. The community is quite accepting of Edward at first. Only when they become scared do they fall into their ""follow the herd"" mentality, but they're not bad people. The character of Edward himself is a miraculous creation, the first sign of what Johnny Depp's idiosyncratic acting choices were capable of. Edward is filled with nothing but kindness and the desire to be kind to others. And the inventor loves his creation the way a father would love his child.<br/><br/>The film is sentimental to be sure, but it's sentimental in the way that a fairy tale is, and it works. Every time I see the scene when the inventor gives Edward a heart made out of a cookie, or the scene where Edward creates an ice sculpture while Winona Ryder dances in the ""snow"" created by the ice shavings, I have to fight down a lump in my throat.<br/><br/>And let me say that this film would not be what it is without Danny Elfman's marvelous score, one of the best ever written for a movie.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","An excellent movie. I started to watch it only because I saw Johnny Depp in the cast but the unique story of the film, the idea, theme and on top of all Jhonny Depp's acting, which we all expect from him, makes it top class. Edward (Johnny Dep) was abnormal in the way that his hands were actually scissors but he has imagination of an artist and he can make anything he want with those hands. He was brought to normal world by a kind local Avon lady, Pegg Bogs (Dianne Wiest). The so called normal world couldn't accept him despite his talents and efforts to please them and this makes him run away to where he came from. The end isn't that bad but not good either. I wish if the people could knew the truth about him and the reality about Jim and what ever happened with them, right from the start (i.e. robbery till murder). It was emotional. I was so happy to find out Edward didn't die in the end but I believe he deserved better. He was promised that a doctor can fix his hands and he can become normal. Would have been great if that promise was fulfilled."

","This story has many elements of a classic fairytale, it opens with an old lady being asked by her grand daughter why it snowed, she then tells the story shown in the film...<br/><br/>In a strange mansion a scientist (Vincent Price) has made a man, unfortunately he died before he could attach proper hands leaving him with strange hands made of large scissors, it is never explained why he gave Edward (Johnny Depp) hands made of scissors before adding his permanent hands but such an explanation isn't really needed. Edward is ""rescued"" from his solitary like by Peg, the local Avon Lady (Dianne West) and taken to live in her house in the suburb below.<br/><br/>Almost all the locals are curious about her new house guest and are keen to meet him, soon he is busy using his scissors turning their hedges and shrubs into amazing topiary, cutting their dogs' hair and eventually cutting their hair too. Things start to go wrong however when Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) and her thuggish boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) return... she is understandably scared when she returns home from a few days camping and discovers Edward in her bed. When they learn that Edward can use his scissors to open locks Jim decides to get him to break in to his father's house to help him steal various items which he claims were stolen from him, when Edward is captured by a security device the others flee leaving him to face the police alone, from now on the locals distrust Edward is soon demonised although Kim sees her boyfriend for what he is and attempts to protect Edward.<br/><br/>In some ways this is the opposite of a traditional fairytale where one would expect an unpopular character to become loved. The acting is good, the direction is classic Tim Burton and the setting is great; the perfection of the pastel shaded suburbia is more creepy than the Gothic mansion upon the hill and the ordinary townsfolk are far more sinister than the strange Edward.<br/><br/>As to what this all has to do with snow... well you'll have to watch the film to learn that."

","Peg Boggs is an Avon saleslady who decides to call at the strange mansion on the top of the hill. There she discovers Edward, a young man who has no family and has scissors for hands. Determined to help him, she takes him home and he is enchanted by her family, but he struggles to fit in ...<br/><br/>After his big success with Batman, this is the film Burton really wanted to make, and it's arguably his best (for me, a toss-up with Sleepy Hollow). Written by Burton and Caroline Thompson (who also scripted The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride), it's a fabulous modern-day combination of Pinnochio and Frankenstein, with good humour, great stylings, crafty social satire and poignant melancholy. Okay, the premise may be a bit absurd, but who cares - Edward perfectly represents the beautiful socially inept outcast, and the movie wisely pulls no punches as it ends in tragedy and loneliness. When Kim tells Edward she loves him and he closes his eyes it means more to him than anything in the world, but he can never live in her world. Depp is wonderful in the first of his many collaborations with Burton; he goes for a grand physical performance more reminiscent of Bela Lugosi or James Cagney than modern film acting, all bugged-out unblinking eyes, stuck-together lips and delicate steps. But he also performs a real range, mixing Edward's nervousness and clumsiness with rage and a more subtle intelligence - it's a fabulous performance, with great supporting turns by Wiest, Arkin and especially Baker as an oestrogen-soaked suburban glamour-puss. The secret of the movie is the switching of the characters; at first everyone seems normal except Edward, but as the story progresses we realise that only Edward is okay and most everybody else is screwed-up. Burton is in his element visually, brilliantly contrasting the superficial blandness of the pastel-coloured neighbourhood street with Edward's Gothic mansion full of exotic topiary, bizarre inventions and cobwebbed corridors; Bo Welch's production design is extraordinary, and the look of Edward himself (designed by Stan Winston) is truly unique and hypnotic. The other crucial element of the movie is Danny Elfman's score, which is absolutely magical and adds so much atmosphere to the drama - his gently cascading lullabies, dark-edged themes and amusing musical extravagances paint almost every scene in humour and pathos. Elfman is one of the best movie composers currently working, and for me this is his signature score - don't miss it. All in all, this is a marvellous movie; it looks and sounds stunning, it has a great story, its themes are rich and resonant and the star-making performance by Depp is a treat to savour. This was Vincent Price's last movie appearance (he died in 1993); he made about a hundred films in his career (not counting his high-quality TV work), and had done the narration for Burton's wonderful 1982 animated short, Vincent. He's irresistible here, particularly since his death is so tragic, and his relationship with the young director was undoubtedly a primer for Burton's subsequent Ed Wood. A truly great actor in a truly great movie."

","Edward Scissorhands (1990, Dir. Tim Burton) <br/><br/>In a castle high on top of a hill, an inventor had created his greatest creation. He had created Edward, a near complete person. The creator died before he could finish Edward's hands. Instead, Edward is left with metal scissors for hands. Edward always lived alone, that is until a kind lady called Peg discovers Edward and welcomes him into his home. At first, everyone welcomes Edward into the community, but soon things begin to take a change for the worst.<br/><br/>'Edward Scissorhands' is one of those breathtaking pieces of cinema, which open up the imagination completely. Directed by Tim Burton, Music Composed by Danny Elfman and starring the wonderful Johnny Depp. All the ingredients to make not just a perfect Burton movie, but an overall perfect movie. The movie is amazingly created with a tale which you would have not heard before. The costumes are fascinating and the casting is superb. What a better person to work with, for Vincent Price on his last big theatrical role. What really stands out though, is the amazing colours placed throughout the film. Tim Burton goes for his usual dark scenery, but once away from the creepy old castle, the screen comes alive with every colour imaginable.

"CharleyRavens","9","0","0","20 January 2008"," A Small Masterpiece
","Tim Burton's small masterpiece follows the story of an outsider thrown into a civilisation where everything is precise and everyone is stiff. Johnny Depp stars as the title character, a man - made boy whose inventor father dies before he could replace Edward's scissor hands with human hands. Living alone in an old mansion, the local Avon lady visits and takes Edward under her wing, introducing him into a society through his topiary and hairdressing skills. There, Edward learns that the power of love in some people can overcome physical appearances, while in others; it merely causes fear and anger.<br/><br/>Depp's performance is, in one word, extraordinary. Even with very few lines, he has this incredible ability to be as physically expressive as silent stars; he is (I believe) one of very few actors who can achieve this expertise today. Always a very attentive performer, Depp creates an Edward that is rigid, self - conscious, and apprehensive in many ways. The various emotions that play across his face throughout the film is why Depp is, or if not should be, classed as one of our best character actors in the 2Oth Century. From the first moment I saw Edward, I immediately felt sorry for him. Subject to his facial expressions and the way he talks and acts around the unusual surroundings he encounters, Depp's character is almost like a little child lost in a world he has never known before, which he portrays brilliantly.<br/><br/>Burton's creation of fantasy films seems to come naturally to him, which is why this film works so well and shows off his outstanding talent and imagination. How he manages to create a world that is so intristic, yet to the audience it doesn't seem legitimate, amazes me. He dreams up a town that is so pastel and like everyone living in that town is stuck in this bubble, which in some way Edward seems to pop that bubble and open the residents to see the real world. No other director could make a film that contains that mix of fantasy added with humour and drama and actually make it work more than Burton.<br/><br/>The use or eerie music helps to establish each scene as individual and unique. Created by Danny Elfman, each piece of score identifies with the characters, more so with Edward, as when he creates his topiary; the fast score fits perfectly with the scene. In some way it displays Edward's concentration and talent while producing his ""art"" to its full extent.<br/><br/>For me, the best part of this movie is just how Burton combines the different genres used: horror, fantasy, romance, drama and comedy. His capability to do this blows me way and added with Depp's truly stunning performance, this film makes me want to watch it over and over again."

","Johnny Depp is ""Edward Scissorhands"" in this 1990 Tim Burton film, directed and co-written by him with enchanting music by Danny Elfman. The film also stars Winona Ryder, Anthony Michael Hall, Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker, and Alan Arkin. Into a bright, pastel suburban world, a kind Avon lady, Peg (Wiest) takes a strange young man (Depp) out of a bleak mansion where he seems to be alone and brings him into her home. Dressed in black, with black unkempt hair, white skin (kind of Michael Jackson-esquire), Edward has scissors for hands. He is the creation of an elderly inventor who died before Edwad could be completed. Though quiet, Edward exhibits great artistry with his scissors, making ornate art forms from bushes. Soon, however, he falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Ryder) and becomes a threat to Jim, her abusive boyfriend. Jim manages to turn the entire neighborhood against Edward.<br/><br/>The theme here is a common one for Burton, that people who don't fit in are people with souls who have something to give. He tells the story in such a poignant way - Edward rarely speaks except with his scissors, and the scissors create things of beauty. The end of the film is heartwrenching in one respect but in another says that beauty lasts forever, frozen in time, and that a spirit can go on and be felt even when the person himself is rejected. Certainly one of the great films. A real triumph."

","When I saw this movie, just a couple of weeks ago, I had no idea what year it was from. And I was really chocked when I found out that this masterpiece is created in 1990. Tim Burton is well-known for his way of making movies. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands... Every film he is involved in, you can expect something absolutely extra ordinary. And Edward Scissorhands is of course not any exception. We'll follow Edwards way into the real, human life. With a constant continual flash back of his early life, and how this have made him to what and who he is today. Edwards character demonstrate the way to acceptation for a newcomer, and then most of his actions, turns out to be wrong. The story and the world the characters live in, describes a very stereotypical view of things and situations. I get the ""Truman show""-feeling that they all are watched, and we are the spectators. Winona Ryder as Kim, symbolize the goodness and purity in the world, Johnny Depp as Edward, the unknown and exciting, and Anthony Michael Hall as Jim, the evil and illiberal. Dianne Wiest got also an interest role as Peg, the kind woman that brings Edward to her own house. She sees no vicious in Edward and accepts him for who he is.<br/><br/>There's so much to say and discuss about this movie, and every time I mention it, I come up with more and more interesting things about it. If you haven't seen Edward Scissorhands yet, I thinks that there no question about it if you should see it or not, you have to."

","I think, it is one of the best romantic movies ever made. Unusual, original and beautiful. I'm not a very big fan of romantic tales, but I just loved this film.<br/><br/>Still, ""Edward Scissorhands"" is not the flick only about love. Well, it is about love, but it is also about hypocrisy, betrayal and cruelty between people. Strange, different person always will be separated from other, 'normal' human beings. If some man is different in the outside, this means, that he is worse than others. 'Normal' people can be sick hypocrites, gossips or detractors, but still, they are normal and they can do whatever they want. Different person can be doomed for one mistake.<br/><br/>The flick also shows how worldly goods change people. And how anybody, that has everything, still wants more and more. This is bad thing, and director illustrates that.<br/><br/>This movie has everything. Sometimes it is funny, sometimes it is touching or even intimidating. It has some great actors, visuals and glorious music. People, who want a great entertainment, will love it. People, who like to see the movie with deep meaning, will love it too.

This is a stark reminder that everyone has their own strengths, and we must not judge others prematurely until we have uncovered their strengths. I also like the humour in the first half of the film, before things turns sour. The haircut scenes are hilarious! The second half of the film shows how powerfully destructive gossips can be. It saddens me to see such an ending. This film is touching and affecting.

","The one word that comes to mind when I think of this movie is- beautiful.<br/><br/>The movie begins in a dimly lit room, where an elderly woman begins to recount the story of the life of a man with scissors for hands by the bedside of her young granddaughter. His creator died before he was able to finish him, leaving the man alone in his large estate.<br/><br/>From there on out, the entire movie plays out like a kind of modernized fairytale- and the environment has everything to do with it. The town in which the story is set is utterly suburban and utterly isolated, as if were the only neighborhood on the planet. Every house is a different color and shape, but there is a kind of treeless sameness between them that pulls them all together, making them seem unoriginal and conformative. The same could be said of the cars, and how they all file out each morning in a bizarrely choreographed fashion to take the men that we hardly see to work.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is mostly about the women of the town, all different, but who all share the common ailment of gossip. Peg (played by Diane Wiest), one of the film's main stars is a bit of an outsider. She is tidy, hard-working and sweet.<br/><br/>After a particularly unsuccessful day of work as the local Avon saleswoman, she decides to try her luck at the oft-unvisited mansion at the end of the street. It is an almost exaggerated contrast to the sunny and ordered neighborhood right beside it. It is dark and towering, and the clouds hang over it so intensely that it almost looks to be in a different world. And that is probably what it represents.<br/><br/>It is here, that she finds the shy and awkward Edward Scissorhands. Being the sympathetic person that she is, she invites him into her home. Thus begins his adventure into maturity, acceptance, rejection and love.<br/><br/>We have to pause for a moment to make a note of the brilliance of Tim Burton. He created a character that looked like he's walked straight out of a horror movie, and is yet perhaps one of the most gentle and endearing characters you will ever come across. Edward's appearance is no mistake at all. Tim manages, to, without saying it overtly, challenge us not to judge on outward appearances and behaviors.<br/><br/>Edward basically desires two things. For one, he wants to have regular hands, so that he can be ""complete"" and normal like everyone else. The various ways in which he is treated display colorfully a myriad of stereotypes and opinions. More than one person tries to refer him to ""someone who can help him"" and others see his unusual hands as something that makes him special.<br/><br/>The second thing he desires is to be acknowledged by the girl that he is in love with- Peg's teenage daughter, Kim. It is through this that he gains more and more human emotions, such as heartache, jealousy, and anger.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp shines once more in this role. Yes, that's right- this is the same Johnny who bravely battles the undead in Pirates of the Caribbean as Pirate Jack Sparrow. His performance as Ed is flawless and displays his absolute attentiveness to detail. From the quirky and quick way that he walks to his everyday pursed lips, to the heart-wrenchingly pained look in his face when he is misjudged, it's all made to try and clue us in to how Edward is feeling inside.<br/><br/>Winona Rider did a great job as well in playing the part of Kim. At first she seems frightened of Edward, then annoyed at him, and later, sympathetic.<br/><br/>The supporting actors and actresses all do well in their respective roles, especially Kathy Baker as the neighborhood ""maninizer"". Whether you loved her or hated her character (I simply thought she was plain whack) I think you will probably have to acknowledge that she played the role to perfection.<br/><br/>It's sad that so many films seem to include a stereotypical Christian who sees evil in everything, but, alas, I even begrudgingly admit that Olan Jones was a good Esmeralda.<br/><br/>Even with a great setting, and a great cast, the movie would be incomplete without an excellent soundtrack- which is exactly what it possesses. The music has an eerie, wispy tone to it, and it fits beautifully with the surreal feel of the movie.<br/><br/>So what can we say in the end about Edward Scissorhands? I think it is a movie for the kind of people who like films that have an unconventional way of getting their point across. (Think, ""The Butterfly Effect""). Outwardly, it's just a story with a guy who has hands for scissors in a really bizarre-seeming setting. If you stop there, you might not enjoy it at all. Yet if you look deeper, you see that it is really a poetic love story. It's also not about Edward's scissor hands- it is about people who are different, and who feel incomplete. It is about people who feel that they are misunderstood because they don't quite know how to speak up, and the judgments that we often incorrectly make about them. Yet it portrays all of this in a concealed, and sometimes actually funny way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as poet K. Bradford Brown said, ""The problem: We see us by our thoughts, intentions, and ideas; They see us by our actions."" So true.<br/><br/>Equally true: This is a really good movie."

","An inventor (Vincent Price) creates a man from a robot, but passes on before the being (Edward Scissorhands, played by Johnny Depp) can be completed -- he still has scissors for hands and black leather for a body. After being rescued by a door to door saleswoman, Edward finds a new home in the city. But can the villagers accept someone so different? <br/><br/>I don't know if this is Tim Burton's best film, but it certainly is the most Burtonesque film of his, if that makes sense. We have plenty of the quirky aspects Burton likes (see ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"") and, of course, his love of all things goth (see almost all his other films). We also have two of his favorite actors (Depp, who has appeared in countless Burton films, and Winona Ryder, from his ""Beetlejuice"").<br/><br/>Visually, this film is stunning. The houses all pastel and in a row look very odd, but make a great statement about the uniformity of communities. The inventor's shop is a perfect Rube Goldberg machine in action. The ice carving scene is beautiful, and the hedges are clipped wonderfully. The only thing in this film I found actually difficult to look at was the contrast between Winona Ryder's hair and her eyebrows. Please, Winona, stay brunette.<br/><br/>We have comedy, romance... we have the meanest looking Anthony Michael Hall (what happened to the lovable nerd from ""Breakfast Club""?). You'll love the monster, you'll fear the monster. This modern retelling of ""Frankenstein"", unlike virtually every other retelling, is actually fun for the whole family and beautiful in its own way.<br/><br/>And, of course, we have the Danny Elfman soundtrack. I can't think of any good reason not to see this film. At least ,as long as you don't mind the really obvious bait-and-switch of dogs during the grooming scene (watch the breeds change during the snipping). Go ahead and watch this... the fewest words Johnny Depp will probably ever say in a movie, back when he had that baby face."

","If someone asked me what my favorite movie score is, I would instantly say Danny Elfman's ""Edward Scissorhands"". People don't normally recall scores, but there's no way for anyone to forget Tim Burton's film musical introduction and all of its wonderful moments that seem like a dream. ""Edward Scissorhands"" could be someone's dream: one of those long dreams that you don't want to wake up of.<br/><br/>Caroline Thompson (she's adapted novels as ""Black Beauty"", the characters of ""The Addams Family"" and the haunting ""The Secret Garden""), a very gifted woman, created the story of this film after having worked with Burton in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""; recently she's written ""Corpse Bride"". The three pieces are of a fantastic nature and situations that you probably wouldn't encounter at the corner of your house, but then that's the same with almost any Tim Burton film. <br/><br/>Edward is the classic Burton outcast, a character that fits in his movies whether it comes from real life or from a fable. Basically, he's got scissor hands, and when a charming lady (Dianne West 's Peggy) meets him, she takes him with her home to make him part of her family What are the chances? The father (Alan Arkin) is a grumpy and strict man, the son (Robert Oliveri) is a very curious kid; the daughter is the perfectly beautiful teenager Kim (Winona Ryder, of course) who, when meeting Edward, looks at him in a very special way.<br/><br/>Soon, Edward finds his place in Peggy's extremely superstitious neighborhood and gets along with its extremely over the top inhabitants. Because, like any other outcast, Edward has a talent; he can do magical things with his scissors (give form to plants, cut hair for people and dogs), which can be positive and negative, exciting and dangerousYou don't want to see Edward angry or upset; but that's the way he feels because, like Pinocchio wanted to be a real boy, he wants to have real hands.<br/><br/>This desire grows even bigger when he discovers that he has a fundamental reason for it: someone to share his heart with, his love feelings. With all this elements into place, the picture takes us into a short but exciting ride of powerful emotions that change very frequently. And that's where the magic comes from.<br/><br/>Together with Thompson, Burton here shows his capacity of going from one cinematic mood to another in minutes: he goes from humor to sadness, from sadness to romance, from romance to tragedy and from tragedy to total madness. It's true that the narrative may not flow so well, but in ""Edward Scissorhands"" it is a helpful characteristic, mainly because of what I've just explained.<br/><br/>Besides this, the movie's best moments come from Johnny Depp's extraordinarily understated interpretation, that paved the way for the rest of Burton's iconic main characters (Ed Wood, Ichabod Crane, Willy Wonka) and made him a usual collaborator; Winona Ryder's gift for creating innocence and, yes, Danny Elfman's flawless score. <br/><br/>I watched the movie for the fifth time a few weeks ago. When it ended, a friend said: ""It's a masterpiece"". It may not be Tim Burton's masterpiece, but it is a masterpiece on its own."

Though his role as Edward makes him even more beautiful, which shows that it's not all about his looks, in this movie you see his potential. His ability. And his wit. You might consider not watching as it seems a bit too arthousy, but trust me, none of that. In fact, it's a lot more mainstream than some people might want to state.

But he was only a strange toy for them and as soon as the novelty wore off these nice and courteous people turned into callous and narrow-minded mass.

This was a silly film with little in terms of a story, but it was so well executed and the MUSIC. Danny Elfman is the man. The two of them really do make a great team. I was talking to a friend of mine, Pat, what makes a movie enjoyable is the ability to make the viewer get drawn into the world that is created. Just knowing this is a Tim Burton film made it very easy. I was totally ready to get drawn into anything he threw at me. I loved Johnny Depps performance and I am starting to see why people think so highly of his acting ability (I was thinking he was just a pretty face who played a pirate). He really did a very good job with this role. I loved the world that Burton created and big props to the set design. I think the best thing about the movie was how Burton takes a ridiculous creation and made people love it at first and it was only until it started threatening their morals was he rejected. I loved how the town people loved their new haircuts and dog's haircuts. But they kept the styles even after they started hating him. The snow idea was brilliant and I have to say that it was very well written. I have to say that a lot of the movies I have been watching I am giving very high ratings, but I am only trying to watch movies that I feel as if I would like going in and I am getting better at choosing them."

The film really is about how normal people react around people who are different to them.The film surprisingly will be loved by kids as well and can spare the darkness for some funny moments.<br/><br/>The film hopefully will be remembered for years to come as it is an incredible and moving film and instant classic. The DVD is actually quite cheap and is worth buying."

","I just saw this movie for the 4th time and it got me again. Such a wonderful movie, with Johnny Depp in one of his best roles. He, Tim Burton (Director) and Danny Elfman (Music) make this movie unforgettable. And of course, Winona Ryder plays a great role. <br/><br/>Summary **Minor Spoilers**<br/><br/>An Inventor tries to turn a machine into a man, but dies before he can finish it. When a saleswoman knocks on the door where the Inventor lived, nobody answers. She walks into the house and finds the unfinished man, who has scissors instead of hands. The saleswoman takes the man, known as Edward, to her house and then an wonderful adventure begins...<br/><br/>Depp definitely deserved an Oscar for his role as Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>My Rating: 10/10"
"dijitalnomad","8","0","0","3 March 2007"," A portrait of an offbeat humanity
","Edward Scissorhands to me represented the inhumanity of the mass, the complacency of people when faced with the troubles of society, of the individual. In the beginning, everyone loved Edward, everyone profited from him. However, at the first sign of trouble the walls began to collapse. The crowd who joined to embrace Scissorhands turned against him as his flaws became apparent as the eerie and offbeat hedges he sculpted and that everyone seemed to enjoy.<br/><br/>A scene I can recall but that seemed to make this point was the confrontation between Kim's (Winona Ryder) boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) and Scissorhands/Depp. Jim, an embodiment of the cruelty of youth, was shoving Edward, who slipped and sliced Ryder/Kim's hand. He then chased Scissorhands away, while the contented father character, within earshot, continued to set up his Christmas decorations on the roof, confused about why the protagonist fled. That illustrated to me the father's inability to grasp what was beyond the obvious, and his neglect of his would-be stepson, the decorations a facade of an easy-going everyday.<br/><br/>Another point I liked was the end, after the mob had decided Edwards fate. What struck me was the fat woman, who casually said after the dramatic scene she wanted to go home, the first of the mob to disperse. It seemed cold, like a dog-eat-dog sort of scenario, and was a slice into the veil of civility people use to make for smooth but one-dimensional interaction. I think there's a difference between niceness and intention, and sincerity. Everyone's relation to the main character was this superficial show, and the almost mute Scissorhands was sort of left a mystery to the viewers, except when revealed by the only true friend he had, Kim.<br/><br/>The film overall related, to me, to the illusory layers of optimism that shield people from all the shortcomings of the world around-- and can be contrasted with the truer reality of mishap and conflict that usually lie beneath the surface, in an imperfect world. It seems to face the dilemma of whether to choose popcorn and bubblegum, or take things for what they are. Like in the movie, most seem to find it difficult to try this-- or to take the experience in stride-- and that's the inhumanity of it: the coldness, like ignoring a homeless person during winter-- and I found the film a very interesting depiction of this, even more so because of Burton's strange creativity."

","(r#105)<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands - which is in my opinion, hands down Tim Burton's best movie - is many things. It is a sweet and simple fairy tale, a colourful satire of suburban life, a quiet comedy and an emotional love story. How Tim Burton manages to combine these genres into something which feels anything but confused is beyond me. As a director he's an expert of combining stunning visuals with compelling soundtracks to create intoxicating and very entertaining movies. Still I wouldn't go so far as to call him one of the best directors ever - even if he is one of my favourites - simply because he's not the best storyteller, and his direction seems a bit confused at times.<br/><br/>However, Edward Scissorhands is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and whether Tim Burton simply had a good day while filming, or his heart was more into it than, say, Planet of the Apes, doesn't really matter. Everything clicks wonderfully, from the intoxicating and haunting score (by Danny Elfman - who else?) to the pitch-perfect performances, to the beautiful visuals, to the simple and compelling story. It's just a wonderful movie and shouldn't be associated with the sticky, manipulative Hollywood genre called ""romance"".<br/><br/>As the setting of his story, Tim Burton has created a small but memorable world in which suburban banality has been taken to an entirely different level. In this world every single woman is a housewife and all of their husbands drive off to work at the exact same time each morning to bring food to the table. Burton effectively parodies the suburbs without doing a ""Paul Haggis"" - i.e. driving home his point with a sledgehammer. The bright pastel houses and absurd dress codes are really hideous and the contrast between this exaggerated suburbia and Edward's Gothic hideout is glaring. If I had to choose, I'd pick Edward's castle any day.<br/><br/>Acting is excellent all around, Kathy Baker, Dianne Wiest and Conchata Ferrel, among others, play their prissy housewives convincingly and Alan Arkin's laid-back father figure makes for some nice comic relief. The much-praised Johnny Depp shines and is extremely entertaining, as well as likable, as Edward (no, he did *not* deserve an Oscar for playing a drunk pirate). Winona Ryder is a gorgeous leading lady, and Anthony Michael Hall makes for a genuinely nasty, if a bit dorky, ""bad guy"". Burton's idol Vincent Price gets some of the best scenes, even if they're just flashbacks, as Edward's inventor.<br/><br/>""Edward Scissorhands"" will not change cinema. It's just a sweet, well paced, well directed and superbly acted fairy tale with stunningly beautiful music and visuals. It's one of few romantic movies you can safely watch without gagging or feeling intellectually insulted. Relax, bring your girl- or boyfriend along, and enjoy this wonderful masterpiece of human emotion. One of my favourites of all time. I wish every romantic comedy was as good as this one."
"Arlis","9","0","0","10 November 2006"," Tim Burton and Johnny Depp now that's a winning team!
","Tim Burton might just be the most interesting director from the last few decades and there's no doubt in my mind that Johnny Depp is the best character actor to ever grace the big screen. Neither are my favorites but extremely high on the list. I have always said that Johnny might not be my favorite actor but he is definitely the best, and watching movies like Edward Scissorhands is proof of that.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is one of those movie characters that will forever be remembered and that's possible not only because of Depp, but Tim Burton's beautiful and artistic way of bringing him to life. The town and the castle on the hill and the perfect mixture of bright colors and dark ones to differentiate the moods and atmospheres surrounding those settings were on point.<br/><br/>I have noticed that this is the second feature film in which Burton really shined. The first being Beetle Juice, which was his breakthrough masterpiece, also had this direction style that took on a life of its own. When a director can just add so much beauty to a scene and do one of those shots that you just cant take your eyes off of that's rare and Burton does it so well.<br/><br/>The actors were amazing and are almost as memorable as Edward was. I was so happy to see Vincent Price in what I think might have been his last role. Price is a legend and like Ed Wood tried to do for Lugosi, Burton wanted to showcase the legend that Vincent Price was.<br/><br/>This movie is amazing and a historical cinematic gem. Watch it and I promise it will forever stick with you"

","I seriously don't see anything actually Bad or not well done or boring about this film. Really there is no reason why this isn't one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>I mean think about it, Tim Burton's directing was at its peak, Johnny Depps acting was sweet and drawn in. The rest of the cast was just great.<br/><br/>The storyline was just so...sad and...well, just the idea of a man so unattached from the world and then suddenly thrown into the mix, hard, its just so tear jerking. Especially the love he has for Winona's character.<br/><br/>So what really is wrong with this film, well, technically, absolutely nothing."
"policy134","8","0","0","14 October 2006"," The definition of Burtonesque and lets not forget Elfmanesque
","Not Burton's absolute greatest, that honour goes to Ed Wood but everything I associate with Tim Burton is here. The moody atmosphere where everything, though seemingly pretended to be so ordinary, is just a little off. The characters are not well defined from the absolute beginning and it takes a while before we even know what the events portrayed are supposed to lead to.<br/><br/>As for Johnny Depp, what can you say other than ""Excellent"". He may have the least amount of dialog ever for a lead role (except maybe Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson) but what a performance, and keep in mind, this was his one of his first lead roles. He had a bit in Platoon and maybe he did ""Cry-Baby"" before this but Burton really lets him have a field day here. This is almost like seeing Chaplin come back to life.<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast, Dianne Wiest is absolutely the definition of a suburbanite with too much time on her hands. The color of her dress says it all and the choice to give her glasses is just spot on. Alan Arkin's role is virtually taken out of an old sitcom. Just listen to him trying to explain the definition between right and wrong to Edward. That little kid from ""Honey, I shrunk (whatever)"" is just plain annoying, though. Winonna Ryder was also relatively new to movies and you can't really complain about her performance, just say that it's not the best she has ever done.<br/><br/>Finally, I will mention Anthony Michael Hill who absolutely shocked the hell out of me when I saw this for the first time many years ago. To go from playing the nerd in ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" to this is one weird thing to see. He handles both extremely well and it's a shame that he will forever be branded that brat-packer who was the youngest player on ""Saturday Night Live"".<br/><br/>As for the end of this film, it is kind of disappointing. To think that the angry mob accepts the explanation Ryder gives them is a little like seeing an episode of ""Married With Children"" that has a happy ending. Burton cheated a little there and to wrap the whole thing up with Depp in the garden of his castle is just a little bit tacked on. Otherwise, this is really a good movie. Not great, but what are you gonna do?"

While other people was wondering this scissorhands, Kim, who only see Edward as a person, gave her affection to him. And finally, Edward got expelled by people and came back to his castle. After that, in this town, it began to snowing.<br/><br/>In this movie, the most impressive scene must be the ice dancing scene. It was very beautiful and charming so I just thought that it is based on the original novel. But, there was any novel. There was a movie only which is so good. Even except the theme 'love', Tim Burton uses other facts(or faults) in human society; people's relationship, and human's greed. In other words, this movie the fable for adults. Tim Burton's wonderful direct and Johny Depp's pity acting was the best combination in their conbiner's."

","I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan. He tends to annoy me with his dark edge. However, I have only enjoyed three of his films: Nightmare before Christmas, Batman and Edward Scissorhands. The acting is very well by Johnny and Winona. The innocence betrayed in Johnny is so well betrayed as a young child trying to fit in his area around him but struggles because he is different. The attraction Winona develops is convincing in my opinion and shows the connection of emotion they share. Tim Burton's work is VERY well done. He betrays the American life of the 60s well. The question of acceptance is well done as well. The final scene is one of my favorites. The music is Excellent by Danny Elfman and as well as the story by Tim Burton I believe. 9/10"

","Tim Burton has proved himself as an amazing visual artist over the years with movies such as the first two batman films, The nightmare before Christmas and beetlejuice. But the film he is mostly remembered for is this towering achievement. It is almost like watching a modern day version of Frankenstein. Johny depp plays the role of the boy with garden shears for hands down to a tee. The dark imagery and haunting soundtrack from Danny Elfman make it all the more worhtwile to see. Although this movie might scare some children (I first saw it when I was 4 and it scared me to death) it is actually a beautiful fairy tale and a tragic love story about two people who are made for each other but their differences tear them apart. All in all I strongly recommend this wonderful gem from the master himself Tim Burton. Its a pity that he doesn't make more films like this today."

The girl mouse shall always be the girl mouse! I liked the fact that Edward didn't try one bit to fit in with the world. He stood out though confused against it. Even in the direst of circumstances did her forget his values. It touched me to see the cruelty of the world crush him in its hellish hands, but just like the silver lining present in every cloud there shall always be a soul mate for each and every one... even though you can't be together forever.<br/><br/>Watch it, might seem like a drag in the first half but I'm sure you'll come out smiling although sad at heart. 10/10 for Johnny Depp and his superb acting. 8/10 for Tim Burton and the movie."
"ReelCheese","8","0","0","24 June 2006"," Wonderfully Whimsical
","A wonderfully whimsical modern fairy tale from wonderfully whimsical director Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is perfect as the title character, a scientifically-engineered young man whose inventor (Vincent Price, in his final screen appearance) dies before Edward can receive real hands, leaving him with scissors as digits. Thanks to an overly helpful Avon lady, Edward is soon thrust from his castle into the real world - with all its marvels, cruelties and even romance. The stylish director has fashioned a film as pleasing to the eyes as it is to the imagination, complete with vibrant color, outrageous situations and bizarrely enjoyable characters.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest downside of ""Edward Scissorhands"" is that it tends to be overly sentimental and just a tad dark. While those elements work in heavy doses in other films, they tend to detract from what could have been a true masterpiece. Nevertheless, on the whole this is a solid fantasy that adults and not-so-young children will enjoy."

There's never been a movie that touched me so much.<br/><br/>But trust me it does end with a happy ending. But be worn it might effect you soft side.

The strange newcomer is introduced into civilization through a semi-surreal and oddly simplistic township. Danny Elfman's musical score complements Burton's story that taps into the humanity in all his viewers.

","Edward (Johnny Depp) is a young man, living in a castle of his father (Vincent Price in his last role). You could say, that Edward is very unique individual: he has scissors as hands, you see his father was a scientist who was making a man, but he never finished as he died.<br/><br/>Now this friendly Avon lady Peg (Dianne Wiest) decides to take Edward home, to live with her family. And so Edward fells in love with beautiful Kim (Winona Ryder). <br/><br/>You can see Edward as a modernized version of Pinochhio, even thought he doesn't have a cricket as a guide. He tries to see what is right and wrong , is amazed from the smallest of things, amazes people on his skills as a gardener and a hair dresser. He tries to fit in the world where everyone else is far too different, but at least everyone tries, or at least politely says: ""I know a doctor who might be able to help you."" But how much difference is too much? Where is the boiling point? Do people really like Edward or are they just waiting for him to make a mistake, so they can throw him out?<br/><br/>As a story Edward Scissorhands is very emotional, it's sad and it's happy. Tim Burton mixes greatly this suburban from 50's or 60's with magical and mystical world of Edward's. To coin a phrase: Little girl:How do you know he's still alive grandmother? Grandmother: Well, before he arrived it never snowed.<br/><br/>This is perfect specimen of a Tim Burton film, with a heart warming and emotional story, lazed with great visual contrast between suburbs and Gothic castle, which looms over the town, of the scientist. It's the style which makes this movie to stand out from the vast sea of movies telling stories about how difficult it's to be different."

"Into_The_West","9","0","0","1 April 2005"," In the end we dislike him although we know it's wrong
","Edward Scissorhands was a film that confused me the first time I saw it, and many times afterward. The problem was simply this: if Edward was such a kind and gentle soul, how could he skewer Jim at the end? There are lots of logical reasons. Jim was trying to kill him. Jim was endangering Kim. Or Burton's own explanation, that even someone like Edward has a breaking point. None of these, however, satisfied me.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has a tendency to have protagonists he has an ambiguous relationship with. Beetlejuice is a villain, yet he's the most likable person in the movie. Ed Wood is an absolute hack, yet it's hard not being sucked into his vision that he's brilliant. Jack Skellington of the Nightmare Before Christmas is the hero but we really kind of loathe him. Ichabod Crane of Sleepy Hollow is the hero, but he's a pompous dork.<br/><br/>The thing these characters have in common, however, is that they are creators, people who produce their own realities, sometimes literally, as with Ed Wood, or sometimes magically, as with Beetlejuice, or sometimes just in his own head, like Ichabod Crane.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands, too, is a creator, and of Burton's characters, the closest to being a pure artist. He does hair styling, pet grooming, topiary and ice sculpture. This is relevant to why Edward does everything he does.<br/><br/>The author James Joyce contended that an artist is a person who reacts to a woman neither by lusting after her or loving her, but wanting to capture her essence on paper. This distancing factor is what makes artists perpetual symbols of man's sense of isolation. But the artist's vision is clearly more isolating than that of a average man, because if the average man could create it, it would seem less like art and more like hackwork.<br/><br/>Artists are often portrayed as tragic loners, doomed to ultimately gain satisfaction only through the products of their imaginations. The problem with Edward Scissorhands is that he clearly is _not_ a loner. He desires the company of other people. He initially enjoys the adulation he receives. Even when he knows he is being used, he still allows it to happen because of a love of people, especially Kim. He is so very lovable and Johnny Depp accentuates this. So can he kill? His scissor hands, of course, are what ultimately distances him from the people he wants to be close to. They inadvertently destroy property, or hurt people even when Edward is trying to save someone's life. The scissor hands are also the symbol of the artist: they are what permits him to create. But they also permit him to kill.<br/><br/>In many ways, murder is the thing that ultimately, permanently takes the perpetrator away from society. It is the highest crime, and when no justification, such as self-defense, can be found for it, it is often punished with death or life imprisonment. Having Edward kill Jim erases our vision of Edward, the gentle, lovable soul, even if we say Edward was totally justified in doing it. Edward is capable of more than just hurting people accidentally.<br/><br/>The contradiction of Edward, the lovable and Edward, the homicidal caused horrific conflict in me. The first time I saw the film, I disliked it, precisely for this reason. How could I even feel sorry for Edward if he killed someone? And isn't that the point of the movie, that Edward is a tragic character? Hasn't Burton defeated his own purpose? But a tragic character is a person of great abilities with one flaw that brings him down. Edward is exactly this. His flaw, however, is not his scissor hands; it is, rather, his need for human contact. But Edward is not just a tragic hero, but also a tragic artist. He is a person we must ultimately dislike, even if we don't want to, because that is the only way he can do the thing he _must_ do, avoid human contact, and achieve the distancing from human reactions Joyce talked about.<br/><br/>This is the true genius of the film: the tragedy of the artist. Burton wants us to feel conflicted, to view Edward as something far worse than we ever thought he could be. We cannot truly love the artist, only what he creates. It is one of the great paradoxes of life, and Burton wants it to be under our skins.<br/><br/>Many famous artists, like Gauguin, Wagner, or Hemingway, were detestable people. Yet what they produced is enjoyed and will continue to be enjoyed. And at the film's very end, we don't see Edward, but the ""snow"" he creates by sculpting the ice. Kim's final line, ""sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it,"" tells us in the final analysis, the artist is the insignificant part; the art is what is important. The art imparts joy.<br/><br/>And in the art is redemption: ours and Edward's."

","A visually magnificent, magical fable, the film features some striking sets and great makeup, which are well photographed in different artistic colours and lights. Depp is good as the title character, however the character itself is hardly a good point of the film. As our hero, the film feels rather cold, because there is a distance between the viewer and the protagonist, to whom the viewer is never really brought close. The story, besides for the scissor hands gimmick, is nothing new or original, and it is rather a bit predictable. Yet with such a grand visual style, the film is able to survive primarily on the visual goodies that Burton provides. It is entertaining as something rather unusual and different, but it is not good enough to do better."

This is definitely a film to see. It's a magical experience with original ideas and the notorious imagination from Burton is once again no let down to his fans. Edward is an unforgettable character.

","This is the very first movie in which I saw Johnny Depp - and I was hooked.<br/><br/>A lot of things were very unbelievable, such as how the heck does the man dress himself with those hands? But then, it's a fantasy, or maybe I should say sci-fi story. <br/><br/>The topiary forms were most unbelievable, as those animals, etc. couldn't have been shaped from the trees and bushes that he worked on. The viewer just has to go with the flow and not be too critical of those things and must allow for a great stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>That said, I love Depp's acting and since this movie, I have bought everything of his that I can get my hands on."

","Wow! After always wanting to see this film (I'd seen the ending on TV and it looked really good) I've now seen it twice! I just love it! It's not my favourite film but I rate it very highly. The acting from Winona Ryder, Johnny Depp and Dianne Wiest is excellent and the story.....well, it's just brilliant! The first time I watched it all the way through I was a little surprised because -having only previously seen the ending- I thought it would be a really sad, powerful film and I was shocked to find comedy moments in it! But, after seeing it twice (the second time I bawled my eyes out- especially when Edward stares down at his broken hands and dead 'father' and that tear-jerking music is playing) I can safely say it is one of the most well-acted, well-directed, emotional films I've ever seen.

To take the role of ""Edward"" where he hardly speaks during the whole film and make it so deeply moving - well, what can I say that probably hasn't been already? Tim Burton took prejudice and slapped it finely in the face with this film. Johnny Depp took his character as the ""prejudiced victim"" and there was never a moment when anyone with the sense of a goat wouldn't feel compassion for Edward or just outright love him. Beautiful film - just simply beautiful. Supporting characters were marvelous and recognizable from other great efforts, and Vincent Price - well, that's another effusive declaration.<br/><br/>AMB"

","When I first saw this movie I was like many people and didn't understand the concept. However, by the end of the movie I understood fully what the point of the film was. Tim Burton had made a very deep movie. Maybe I didn't pick up his exact point of the movie that he was trying to get across but I have my own opinion. In a world where everyone is normal and there's very unique, people are quick to judge those who are different. Basically, Edward is treated different because of his ""handicap"" and at times mistreated and used. One character in the movie, was the old man with the prosthetic hip and he says to Edward that you should never let anybody say that you have a handicap. However, this man's opinion changes when he calls Edward a cripple because the rest of the town is made to believe that Edward is evil. Overall, this movie's story or plot doesn't get the credit it deserves."

Here Edwards falls in love with her daughter Kim, but unfortunatly Kim is not too found of him(at first) and she has a real ass of a boyfriend. Edward is also accepted into the community(again, at first) and he wins their praise with his talents in haircutting and gardening. He even tries to open a beauty salon but doesn't have enough money. Well Kim convinces Edward to help steal from her boyfriend's parents(he can pick the lock) so they could have thier own van. Edward is, of course, caught doing the act alone and the community turns against him thinking he was stealing for the beauty salon and rumors begin to fly. Meanwhile Kim discovers that she really does love Edward as the community hates him more and more.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is a classic for many reasons. The music and art direction are flawless(the fact that neither won the Oscar is bad, the fact that neither were even nominated is a downright sin). Johnney Deep gives a mesmorizing performance as the title character and the supporting cast is good as well(Kathy Baker is nothing short of hilarious as the neighboorhood slut).

","Edward Scissorhands is a true classic. It had me bawling by the end. The story is about a man named Edward who is man-made by an old inventor. The inventor dies before he completes Edward so Edward is left with scissors as hands. He lives alone in the inventor`s old castle on top of a hill until such time as a friendly avon lady named Peggy comes along and decides to take him home with her. He falls in love with Peggy`s daughter, is wooed by a neighbourhood resident (but she cries rape after Edward refuses to have sex with her...take note: this is not a dirty film AT ALL! It`s done very tastefully.) and ultimately is run out of the town because of some mistakes he made (most of them without even realizing it). It`s a tale of a true outcast trying to make it in the real world under some very unusual circumstances. Johnny Depp, once again, does a brilliant job. He really doesn`t say much in the movie, and what he does is usually one word comments, but every thought and emotion is shown through actions and facial expression, Johnny`s forte. The movie is a romantic drama, highly underrated, and very exquisite. I love this movie and I think if you give it a chance, you will too."

"allicat232","Null","0","0","5 May 2004"," Modern Beauty and the Beast
","Edward Scissorhands is a tragic fairytale, telling the story of a love that could never be and showing what happens when two very different worlds collide. Written and directed by Tim Burton (Big Fish, Sleepy Hollow), the plot of Edward Scissorhands all starts when Avon lady Peg Boggs, played by Dianne Wiest (Practical Magic, Footloose), desperate for a sale, ventures into a dark, scary castle, where she meets one of the late owner's creations; a man named Edward and played by Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, Secret Window). However, during his creation, the elderly Inventor died and so Edward was never finished and, instead of hands, has knives and scissor blades. Wiest's character, being kind at heart, decided to take him home with her to her house in the cheery world of suburbia. From the moment he arrives, Edward has problems fitting in, but he soon finds that he has a talent that endears him to the community. All seems to be going well, even the fact that Edward develops a crush on Peg's daughter Kim, played by Winona Ryder (Mr. Deeds, Little Women).<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands marks the beginning of a long, successful partnership between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp - the director and actor went on to work on another three films together, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow and the soon-to-be-released Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. These films, with the possible exception of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory share Burton's trademark subtle humour and dark, occasionally scary moments; for example, in Edward Scissorhands, the scene where we first see Edward; emerging from the shadows; dressed completely in black and with what little light there was, glinting off of his blades. He is immediately portrayed as a character to be slightly wary of. As the film goes on, we see that he doesn't mean to be violent; he can't help who he is.<br/><br/>The film is a modern take on the time-old story of Beauty and the Beast - Kim is the popular, beautiful girl; with the brawny, trouble-making boyfriend. Edward is the anti-social, abnormal 'beast' character - feared by the 'normal' people. The only difference between the fairy tale and Edward Scissorhands is the ending.<br/><br/>Overall - the film successfully tells the tale of the collision of two cultures; showing the innocent side of a character who in many ways could be seen as dangerous. It shows a doomed relationship, struggling against everything and, ultimately, leaving us, the audience, with a glimmer of hope.<br/><br/>It has very few bad points, apart from being slightly too light-hearted occasionally - for example, the hair cut scenes are verging on silly, however, I would recommend this film to anyone who likes films that don't necessarily follow mainstream cinema."

Edward lives alone in the inventor's gothic mansion until Avon comes calling, and he is taken in my Dianne Weist's hilarious Avon lady. In surburbia, Edward finds love (Winona Ryder as the ultimate fairytale princess) as well as prejudice - Tim Burton is always making films about outsiders who just don't fit into society.

Edward is a great example that the world is cruel in accepting others that are different from everyone else. One family, or a select group of people, are open to the numerous disabilities of society and would embrace them with open arms, while some would sell them to the freak show in a minute. That was a huge theme that hit me square in the face, and made me cry to even consider someone having scissors as arms. (**SPOILER**)  In the hopes of getting fake arms to replace the scratchy scissors, the man that created and truly loved him dies out of the blue.  Edward is always haunted by the arms still remaining there, which some disabled people could be haunted by whatever they lack. And some cannot handle the pressures of the taunting and the rumors, and explode with rage and lock themselves away. I truly felt the performance of edward, who was dumb about cultures and easily trusting.  I know the whole issue i wrote about is weird, but that's how i perceived the movie to mean.

Depp brings a palpable sweetness to Edward, who is easily distracted by his wonderment at the world around him. Edward's dialogue is sparing, but Depp speaks volumes with his eyes alone.<br/><br/>A fine performance from Johnny Depp can salvage an entire movie (""Benny and Joon""), but his work is not this film's only asset.

Especially for Kim Boggs, beautifully played by Winona Ryder, for whom he would do anything. He loves her, knowing she doesn't have the same feelings toward him. He doesn't try to get her to love him. He is just himself, and hopes that's good enough.<br/><br/>Edward is an outcast, but this is more than just an outcast-trying-to-fit-in love story.

"rmikec","Null","0","0","29 October 2003"," Brilliant and touching
","This film still would place in my top 100 of all time. Burton's musical and visual aesthetic alone has been highly influential, and this is the film that made it salient. The direction, story, score, and aesthetic is typical gaudy, nostalgic, satirical, yet brilliant Burton - but it is also a very touching film that resists oversentimentalization. <br/><br/>Not unlike Shelley's Frankenstein - this is the story of an inwardly benevolent outcast who doesn't fit because of the way he looks. His hands are razor sharp - in a painfully delicious twist his creator dies just short of upgrading him to the real thing. Edward therefore has the potential to mangle anything he touches and bears the scars to prove it... Though there have been other wonderful treatments of good/outcast theme (Frankenstein, E.T., The Elephant Man), Burton's postmodern look at insipid modern American suburbia / teenhood rings truest for me. Somehow Burton has managed to tap an emotional nerve that is still raw in a staggeringly large group of us."
"IpsaThis","10","0","0","22 October 2003"," Best Movie Ever -- see the movie before reading this
","This is the movie where it all comes together--the most creative story, the most moving music, the immaculate direction, and the impeccable cast. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is art, perfected.  There has never been a story told so eloquently as done here by Tim Burton; this movie is the best thing in the world, not to overstate it.<br/><br/>First of all, the whole movie is absolutely beautiful.  It's hard to pick one, but the shot of Peg looking in her car mirror is a wonderful example of the aesthetics Burton uses throughout the film, mixing bright color with a darkness that is crisp, and not gloomy.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score for ""Edward Scissorhands"" is the best I've ever heard. It is touching, funny, and always appropriate.  Tim Burton makes the right move playing Elfman's music almost non-stop during the movie, and there isn't a false note throughout.<br/><br/>Little needs to be said for the cast: phenomenal performances by Depp, Ryder, Wiest, Arkin, and Price pull this movie together.<br/><br/>As for Kim...she knew that she and Edward could not be together as long as he was outcast.  She couldn't just sneak up there every day after school or something.  And as she said, she'd rather he remembered her the way she was. But the silver lining of the movie is, no matter how long Edward stays up there alone, he is happier than he would have been without his days with Kim.<br/><br/>As for the blocks of ice...Edward lives in a house owned by an inventor who created a human being, plus all those cookies and God knows what else.  A big freezer somewhere is not far-fetched.<br/><br/>This movie really is about being different, and the functionalism of society.  It goes over the top on purpose--with the house colors and plain lawns, and the shot with all the husbands backing out of their driveways to go to work all at once--to stress that this is just basic American suburbia. Edward changes the lawns, and in the end, when society's disturbed, the party responsible is rejected.<br/><br/>Of course, there's always the more fun way of looking at it--that it's just a bunch of stuff that happened.  Do that."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","14 September 2003"," Good first collaboration of Burton and Depp
","It's somewhat distressing to find myself in the awkward position of going backwards. I only got to watch the second Burton/Depp corroboration Sleepy Hollow (1999) a few months ago. Then, for the first time, I have just watched this first Burton/Depp corroboration of 1990. I realise that I must have missed out on the freshness and sense of wonder people watching it for the first time 13 years ago.<br/><br/>While the imagination giving rise of E.S. is not quite as soaring as Almadovar's in creating Talk to Her, it is still quite remarkable. But once the main plot of the Csissorhands has been conceived, the rest is actually not that difficult. Everything else we see is terribly familiar. There is the standard suburban American family. There is the poor boy, middle-class girl and rich brat triangle. There is the lot of busybody townspeople driven by herd instinct. <br/><br/>What makes E.S. stand out is the sensitive as well as sensible treatment of Edward, both in not overplaying the freak aspect and not exaggerating the emotional content. Regardless of Edward's vicissitudes, his mind is simple. An emotional outburst can easily be diverting by a little dog passing by, and the immediately ensuing encounter with an approaching police car naturally triggers survival instincts, but not panics. Depp played the role exceedingly well, as if it is really possible for an actor to experience what a mechanically created man actually feels. Winona Ryder, on the other hand, did not make much of an impression, neither in this movie nor in several subsequent ones including Girl Interrupted and Autumn in New York. Ironically, her best performance to-date is in a movie in which she has only a minor supporting role: S1mOne. Maybe that is the sign of her maturing.<br/><br/>The superb art direction adds much to the enjoyment of this movie. Due credit should also be given to the solidly dependable veterans Dianne Wiest and Alan Arkin. All told, while I must say that I like Sleepy Hollow a little better (for reasons stated in my comments on it), I did enjoy watching Edward Csissorhands a lot."

","Years ago I saw a wonderful movie with imaginitive sets, quirky direction, a memorable and magical story, and of course, Johnny Depp. This was the movie that made me a devoted fan of his and cemented my love of Tim Burton's films. Recently, I re-watched this gem and felt that it still holds up after 13 years. Depp is unforgettable in this role of an outsider who is at first joyously welcomed into suburbia, only to be cruelly shunned and driven away by those same ""friendly folks"". It's a testament to his great acting and a well-written screenplay that would make me fall in love with this odd character.Despite heavy make-up that renders him practically unrecognizable and a voice that is equally unrecognizable, I was quite taken with this incredible actor. (It was not until I saw ""Cry-Baby"" that I realized what an attractive guy he is too.)Anyway, ""Edward Scissorhands"" was one of my favorite films of the '90's and I think one of the best and unforgettable of the decade.

","One of the best Tim Burton films. Its the classic fish-out-of-story water, a fairytale with a sad ending, and the masterful way Burton leads us through the unjust persecution of the character is enough to make people cry. Most people i know cry at this film everytime they watch it. The character of Edward is just so beautiful and yet so tragic that its nigh on impossible not to be horrified at the neighbours treatment of him.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, and just perfect for the fantastical element in Tim Burtons films.

His longing for her is made all the more painful at the end when misunderstandings and ignorance inevitably lead to tradegy.....<br/><br/>All the supporting players are excellent, the characters all have traits that we can recognize and identify with - even if they make us uncomfortable (see: Kim's boyfriend).<br/><br/>I really would recommend this film to anyone, it's almost flawless.

"alainenglish","Null","0","0","14 August 2003"," Moving fairytale (major spoilers)
","""Edward Scissorhands"" is easily Tim Burton's best film.  It's bizarre and quirky subject material, and the approach taken to it, may not be for everyone.  Fans of gritty, realistic films or exciting action movies should probably steer clear of this.  But anyone who enjoys a gentle fairytale with a touch of social commentary thrown in would easily take to this.<br/><br/>The tale begins with an old woman telling her granddaughter a bedtime story about a man with scissors for hands.  Moving into flashback, we meet Edward (Johnny Depp) an artificially created man whose inventor (Vincent Price) died before he could complete him, leaving him with protruding metal skewers where his hand should be.  Living in a dilapidated old mansion that overlooks a sunny suburban neighbourhood, Edward is discovered by Peg (Dianne Wiest), a kindly Avon lady, who takes him home to live with her family.<br/><br/>Edward's hands make him an excellent hair-stylist and topiarist, and he quickly becomes the hot topic of gossip among Peg's neighbours.  But things are complicated by Peg's beautiful daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), to whom Edward becomes powerfully attracted...<br/><br/>There is a splendid technical backdrop to this picture.  The use of blacks and greys in Edward's home contrast with the multicoloured pastels of Peg's neighbourhood.  Shot in Florida, the suburban environment is clearly very Seventies influenced, but not specifically so.  The result is a timeless, everyday feel that works very well as a backdrop for the characters. Keeping in with the absurdity,  Edward's mansion possesses Tardis-like qualities, being significantly larger inside than it is on the outside.<br/><br/>The whole story is accentuated by Danny Elfman's magnificent score.  Through careful use of both string and choral sounds,  Elfman captures perfectly the tragic plight of the central character, as well as highlighting the so-called normality of the people he encounters.<br/><br/>On a script and story level, this film has it all.  Edward is an inner extension of director Tim Burton (who co-wrote the story with Caroline Thomson).  Anyone who has ever felt like a freak or an outsider in life, or has something of a tortured artist in him, should be able to identify with Edward.  He acts as a metaphor for such people, and this is why his predicament is so very moving.<br/><br/>The story goes further than this, though.  Through Edward, Burton exposes the little idiosyncracies and hypocrisies that make up suburban middle-class life.  Principal to this is the character of Peg, who despite everything going on around her, still clings (like her neighbours) to the hollow illusion of ""normal"".<br/><br/>The characters are perhaps a little two-dimensional, but are given vivid life through some very colourful performances.  Johnny Depp is excellent as Edward, conveying innocence, pain and love often without any dialogue. Dianne Wiest is equally good as well-intentioned but misguided Peg, and especially enjoys playing the mother to Depp.  She is balanced out by Alan Arkin as her earthy husband.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder, looking immaculate in blonde wig and white dress, is perfect as Edward's love and Ryder convincingly portrays Kim's increasing affection for him.  Anthony Michael Hall is nice and nasty as her greedy thug of a boyfriend.  Vincent Price, in his last movie, is fine as the sweet old Inventor.  All other performances are well-rounded out.<br/><br/>Moving, funny and enjoyable, ""Edward Scissorhands"" is Tim Burton at his bizarre best."
"Angry_Arguer","Null","0","0","9 August 2003"," Suburbian Frankenstein
","Edward Scissorhands is a very different style of film from Tim Burton.  All his imagination is wrapped up into one character and Depp never fails to deliver.  It's amazing that he still winds up in bad roles after almost 20 years since Nightmare on Elm Street.  No doubt he is one of the better character actors in our time.  Winona Ryder is her usual annoying self, this hasn't changed after all these years.<br/><br/>Burton's camera is not as fun this time, he's trying to be more serious in line with his subject.  I guess this was personal for him.  The production design is not his typical goth, but is more satirizing of suburbia.<br/><br/>Overall, better than I expected, but not as smart as I hoped.  If the fantasyland aspect had been a little less funny and more real.  3 out of 5 stars."

","This movie is to Tim Burton what ""Pulp Fiction"" was to Tarantino, and ""Taxi Driver"" to Scorsese.  A definitive directorial vision, put artfully and beautifully on film.  The story, apparently, is a metaphorical reflection of the lonely childhoods of both Burton and screenwriter Caroline Thompson.  The role of Edward put Johnny Depp on the Hollywood map as an artist to be considered for roles of depth and substance.  Burton's direction is flawless, oddly moving, and visually stunning, with the same eerie and head-tilting weirdness that audiences have come to expect from his material.  Long time collaborator Danny Elfman provides a score that ranks among his very best.  The socio-political observations, citations, and commentary that the story and movie provide are both on the ball and thought provoking.  As a character, Edward's tragic innocence, awesome talent, and extraordinary imagination are brought to life with remarkable sensitivity by Depp.  Winona Ryder, Alan Archan, Diane Weist, and Anthony Michael Hall are wonderful in their respective supporting roles. A film that will be remembered.  10/10."

You can't help but feel strongly for his title character, wishing that he could move past the impossible: trying to achieve acceptance from a world that he could not understand. Winona Ryder is Edward's love interest, and really this is her only great acting, aside from Girl, Interrupted.

","In a movie that could only be created by the morbid-but-sentimental mind of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp has one of his first major roles as a needy, gentle-spirited invention-gone-wrong. The movie takes place in a strange Technicolor town of bright houses, square lawns, and a looming mad scientist's castle at the top of the hill. When Diane West, playing an exquisitely sensitive and maternal Avon lady, decides to visit the castle, she finds a boy named Edward living there all alone. Edward is not a normal person, just as you'd expect from Tim Burton: he's a leatherclad, melancholy freak of nature with foot-long scissors in place of fingers. Overcoming her initial fear, Diane West takes pity on the childlike Edward, and invites him into her home. The ensuing story is somewhat typical of all the ""fish-out-of-water"" stories ever told - Edward is at first accepted with open arms by the neighborhood, and takes part in hedge-clipping and haircuts, as well as becoming something of a local celebrity. To make matters more complicated, Edward innocently falls in love with the Avon lady's daughter, a waifish little beauty played with the perfect blend of teenage passion and innocence by Winona Ryder.But a few misunderstandings and dangerous missteps lead the townspeople to reject Edward, leaving you worrying for Edward Scissorhands to the very end of the film. The movie is awash with cartoon-like settings, bizarre characters, and a wistful score by Danny Elfman. Johnny Depp excels as the gentle monster who can never be completely understood by the humans he encounters ... anyone who can make you like them in spite of having enormous blades for hands is a true sweetheart. This is a melancholy, bittersweet bit of Tim Burton cinema magic at is best. Not to be missed."

Only kim knows he's innocent of any crime, and that he's innocent at heart.  There are very few movies that capture love this well.  When kim (at the end) said ""I want him to remember him the way i was"" i think that is one of the best lines i've ever heard in a movie.  because he remembers her as an angel, and that image of him has stayed in his mind for years and years while he is confined in the dark mansion for eternity.

With an originality that is rare for contemporary cinema, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman establish here their cinematic tour de force, and probably one of their most beloved projects - it is clear that this one was a labor of love. Johnny Depp is surprising in the role of Edward, but he is only the leading piece of a magnificent mosaic that combines unforgettable supporting characters, Danny Elfman's haunting score (that will stay in your mind much after the credits roll) and Bo Welch's incredible art direction. One would say this movie would not be the same without the ideas that were put at hand here. And the result is that rare movie that puts in the fantasy worlds real world can invent."

","I'm used to vote, only. I prefer not to comment the movies, it would take too much time. But I have to make an exception for Edward Scissorhands. This movie is absolutely astonishing, touching, tender, beautiful and so on! The plot is simple, but it has every ingredients to make us love the movie. It tells us the story of a man, Edward, created by a scientist. Unfortunately, the scientist wasn't able to finish his work and Edward has to live with scissors in the place of his hands. He's found by Peg, a lovely woman, who takes him to her home. And then we get to watch Edward's adaptation to having people around him, eating, sleeping on beds and others. Of course, not everything is perfect. But you'll have to watch to check out what goes wrong! ;) Tim Burton did his finest work directing with Edward Scissorhands. And what can I say about the cast? Johnny Depp is perfect! I don't even dare to suggest any other actor for the role. Dianne Wiest is quite convincing and we can't help liking her character. Winona Ryder is very good as well, and so is the rest of the cast. Oh, yes! The soundtrack! How could I forget this?! When you are thinking you can't get more involved in the movie... you start listening to those wondrous melodies that really hit your heart. Impossible to describe. I really recommend this movie. It's worth it! Go and check it out!"

","I won't deny that Edward Scissorhands is one of the most beautiful and sad films I have ever seen. I also won't deny that the soundtrack blew me away (score one more for Danny Elfman) and Tim Burton is a fabulous director, but as a big fan of comedies and a not-so-big fan of extreme dramas, I am afraid I found this movie more depressing and emotionally tiring than most other viewers might.<br/><br/>Avon lady Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) approaches a dank, dark castle in her hometown in the hopes of making a sale. Inside she finds a strange young man (Johnny Depp) with scissors for hands. He was apparently in the process of being created when his Dr. Fankestein-like inventor (played by the fabulous Vincent Price) passed away. Peg decides to bring the man, called Edward, back to her home in the hopes of giving him a normal life. Edwards popularity shoots higher than a kite in the Bogg's family neighborhood, but the real problems begin when Edward falls for Peg and Bill Bogg's elder child, teenager Kim Boggs (played by Winona Ryder with long, red hair). Kim's friends and her muscular jock boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall, no longer the class nerd) find the innocent and helpless Edward to be pathetic, but Kim's boyfriend decides to use Edward's scissorhands to break into his own house in the hopes of stealing and selling some of his wealthy parents' possessions. Edward winds up taking all the blame for the break-in when the teenagers are caught, and Kim begins to soften to his kindness. But the Bogg's neigborhood, none of whom know the truth, and Kim's boyfriend, turn against Edward and vow to make sure he goes back to where he came from forever.<br/><br/>The private moments near the end of the film with Kim and Edward are truly sweet and beautiful. However, film is so emotionally draining from all the drama, I haven't been able to watch it since I was a young teenager without bawling all over the place. Although I agree that tears are usually the sign of a good movie, some people love films that make you bawl. I really have never been one of those people. But that still doesn't change the fact that it is a good movie with good acting, and I do recommend it. Just bring plenty of tissue."

There are obvious differences but too many parallels to ignore. Both films are great. It's startling how alike they are though. Both involve a bizarre outsider in an even more bizarre modern world. Some scenes in Edward Scissorhands are almost copied from Mon Oncle. I don't say this as a knock on Scissorhands, I just think it's either an amazing coincidence or Tim Burton definitely looked at Mon Oncle for inspiration. Either that or I'm crazy, which I have considered."

I was 17 then and maybe really didn't appreciate it as much since there were no big explosions.  This time around I saw it for what a truly beautiful and sad movie it is.  Edward is menacing to look at at first, but Depp brings true childlike innocence to the character with his face.  Watching the town turn on him is like watching a child being tormented.  The relationship between him and Kim is touching to watch as it changes, as is how the end shows us how the town changed Edward.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 8/10.

"Xploitedyouth","Null","0","0","22 September 2002"," One of the Most Beautiful Films I've Ever Seen
","Many people complain that Tim Burton is overrated as a director.  To them, I present to you EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.  Not only is this one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, but one of the best and most imaginative.<br/><br/>This is the story of Edward (Johnny Depp).  Edward is the creation of a gentle mad inventor (Vincent Price), but unfortunately for Edward the inventor died before he could attach hands, so Edward is left with a motly collection of scissors and blades for hands.  Of course, this is unnerving to the uber-perky Avon lady (Dianne Weist) who happens upon the young man. Strange as he may look, the kind woman realizes that Edward can't keep living alone like he has been, so she takes him back home to her suburban home to her typical family.  The neighbors are fascinated and are soon patronizing Edward's natural abilities for gardening and haircutting. Edward is enjoying his new friends, but is mostly interested in Weist's teenage daughter Kim (Winonna Ryder).  He has fallen for her, and she begins to fall for him, but problems arise when Kim's thug boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall) decides to rob his dad and use Edward as a patsy. Who would have expected that a movie about a man with scissors for hands would yeild such gorgeous results?  The film's style is visually striking and inlaid with a great sense of ironic humor.  Every house in the suburban neighborhood where the story is set looks exactly the same, every car leaves the driveway at the same time in the morning, presumably for the same place. The mansion on the hill where Edward lives is gloomy and gothic, but features a beautiful garden out in front.  The latter transfers into the former as soon as Edward enters the picture and his unique talents are put to place, and this carboard cutout neighborhood becomes a fairy land. Depp's performance is nothing short of astounding.  His character reflects a child-like innocence and is intensely likeable, but still a bit frightening.<br/><br/>The real triumph here is Dany Elfman's beautiful score, which really captures the essance of the film. I highly, highly recommend this film to everyone.  It's one of the great American films of our time."
"downbutnotout","Null","0","0","27 July 2002"," Subtext is the name of the game...
","I couldn't disagree more with the ""Frankenstein"" analysis of this movie. (Aside - even the story of Frankenstein is not a ""monster"" story. It is a story about man's drive to create due to his inability to give birth.) Edward is a freak. Edward is exotic. Edward is to be stared at. In short - Edward is an artist. But, Edward is not a monster. You don't invite ""monsters"" to sleep in your daughters bed!<br/><br/>I agree that this movie is full of subplot and symbolism. The central theme - as I see it - is ""artists are misunderstood"". But more than this, ""artists are created in a vacuum - away from meddling 'ordinary folk'."" I believe there are two kinds of artists - artists who identify themselves with the ordinary people of this world and artists who live completely inside their imaginary world. It is obvious Tim Burton would count himself as the latter type. All his movies have a definite feel of ""manufactured sets"". You never know if they take place in the past or the future. (I saw the movie tonight on the science fiction channel.)<br/><br/>I agree Tim Burton is a master of his craft - even honour him with the title of ""Artist"". But after watching Edward Scissorhands - one walks away thinking that artists belong in a gothic mansion secluded from the ""mob"". I couldn't disagree more. The best-loved art - is art that makes a connection with the 'ordinary folk' of the world.<br/><br/>Tim Burton does make one small acknowledgement to the 'ordinary folk'. In the movie, Edward has a hard time feeding himself. When he goes to the BBQ in his honour, he is fed by the guests of the party. But at one point, Edward is even in danger of becoming the main course. Have no fear Tim - if anyone is going to eat you up and spit you out, it is Hollywood. But I am sure you know this.<br/><br/>I should mention - I am not an artist. Just an ordinary working-class person.<br/><br/>One final comment - this is not a love or hate type of movie. It is a movie to be watched and analysed. It is food for your eyes and your mind. Open your eyes and keep a critical mind."

I admire Tim Burton amongst others such H.R Giger (of Aliens fame), and novelist Clive Barker. Their abilities to produce things of darkness one minute, but beauty the next, is a moving experience and one that all viewers should enjoy. Burton does this in Edward Scissorhands, a fairy tale for the 90's. It is an ideal Christmas film although not one which pre-teens will enjoy. It combines a variety of emotions; happiness and love on one hand, fear and loss on the other. Acting is first-class, especially from Depp, and the plot is as strong as a vice, full of drama which twists and turns like a spiral. A classic must-see."
"Agent10","9","0","0","2 May 2002"," A character I most closely identify with
","-contains spoilers-<br/><br/>In the movie Edward Scissorhands, the writing style of the film was a perfect match to the emotional and sociological story being told. In retrospect, the working script to the film is rather placid and full of gaps, but the cinematography creates words and speeches that aren't enhanced by human subjects. A person's place in the world is determined by the acceptance of others, i.e. the suburban middle class. <br/><br/>The character Edward Scissorhands represents many subtexts the film didn't wish to make obvious. His place in modern society is eschewed due to his unusual outward appearance. His black clothing and pale, white face clashes with the status quo. Director Tim Burton intentionally altered the landscapes and clothing to imply these messages, making Edward the center of a pastel-loaded world. But it is also this difference which ultimately breathes life to his alienation from society.<br/><br/>Conformity was king, and not a spoken word was ever uttered about such a subject through out the movie. Instead, there are several moments that create this instability. The very moment Mrs. Boggs sees Edward, she instantly judges him as some killer/rapist before feeling pity for the befuddled individual. Throughout the rest of the film, Boggs tries desperately to make Edward look normal like the rest of the neighborhood, ultimately failing in such a diversion. Another example would be Edward's lack of dialogue during the film. <br/><br/>While Johnny Depp physically embodied Edward, the quiet demeanor of the character constructed a stark contrast to everyone else in the world. Edward kept his mouth shut so he could fit in. He accepted everyone's good will with little more than a simple `thank you.' During the entire movie, Edward didn't even speak 100 words. While other characters made assumptions and jokes about Edward as a person, few of them ever looked deep into his soul. As it turns out, Edward's personality was established by what he did as opposed to what he said. <br/><br/>Using his actions as the only frame of reference, Edward possessed many traits which were complex. He truly didn't know the meaning of wrong and right, even though he understood the means of enforcing such boundaries. For example, when he broke into someone's house, he knew it was wrong, but he did it anyway because someone asked him to. He was an impressionable individual, seeking personal satisfaction through friendship and even love. Edward was also terribly shy, which explained his inability to make friends. Instead, he felt doing good deeds for people would create a sense of camaraderie with the community. At first, cutting people's hedges and hair made him the focal point of everyone's life, but after a while, his welcome was worn out.  People were tired of him, and like some board game that is no longer challenging. <br/><br/>In the end, Edward returned to his solitary life, forever existing in his own little world of extroversion. Words didn't force him to return to this world, but the personal opinions and a rigid establishment did."

","You may not be able to touch with scissorhands but you can still feel.<br/><br/>Tim Burton created the character of Edward to portray a gentle outsider who wanted to touch but couldn't due to his disability-if that's what it could be called. Edward, played masterfully by a young Johnny Depp, lives an isolated life away from ""suburbia"", until he is discovered by a kindly Avon lady (Dianne Wiest) and taken into her home.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp lends an innocent performance to the role, his eyes show his emotions more then any other part of his body. The character he plays is instantly likeable despite his strange appearance. I think that this performance paved the way to some of Depp's other roles as general outsiders in an unforgiving world.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder plays the part of kim. Edward immediately falls for her beauty, but, alas, she is attached to Jim (played by Anthony Michael hall, seen in John Hughes movies including the Breakfast club) But kim soon sees the love that Edward holds for her in his eyes.<br/><br/>The film portrays the horror of ""suburbia"" and how people can turn on other's in the blink of an eye. It is a very emotional work, although humour is involved as Edward tries to adjust to suburban life.<br/><br/>The film also shows how the love between two people can survive forever even when pushed apart by the pressures of society.<br/><br/>It is a fairy tale that digs deeper then its appearance. Tim Burton creates Edward's world in typical Burton-esque style, from the mansion that Edward resides in, to his topiary,ice, and hair creations, Burton somehow merges dark images with vibrance.<br/><br/>Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's first film together cements there movie partnership in great style."

","As I recently saw Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"" I was deeply impressed by the beauty and the imagination of the story.

The end is heart-breaking. When Winona Ryder as an old woman says:""And sometimes you can still see me dancing in the snow"", I felt my heart pounding and tears came up my eyes. But the film has also very funny sequences. For example the neighbours, especially the nymphomaniac Joyce. I also must mention the music of Danny Elfman. As an old soundtrack collector I've listened to many film scores, but Elfman's music is the most beautiful of all. Richly flourished, warm and longing. Burton let a lot of room for Elfman's entry. Listen to the music when Edward is the hairdresser for the female neighbours. The music changes from Elegy to Spanish music to wild solo violin to Spanish music to Elegy. Dianne Wiest as motherly woman is as perfect as Vincent Price and Johnny Depp. Don't miss ""Edward Scissorhands"". It is simply wonderful!"

","Coming from Tim Burton, you know that the story won't be something you see everyday. although, it will have elements of classic storys and classic dilemmas, but with that creative Burton twist.<br/><br/>A very very ordinary classic 50's style American town sits at the bottom of a huge dark mountain with a scary castle on top. An Avon door to door sales women, discouraged by the fact that everyone in the town knows her and has already bought their supply of makeup, decides to travel up the mountain to try her luck there. She walks right in to the castle and finds Edward there all alone. She sees that Edward has no hands, but instead huge scissors and knives. She assumes he is helpless, and takes him home. The whole town begins to buzz about the irregular visitor. Edward lives with the sales women, and begins to show unusual artistic talents for things like sculpting bushes and cutting hair. unfortunately, Edwards nieve nature is taken advantage of and the town almost immediately all turns against him. To avoid spoiling the movie, I insist you see this movie to learn the rest of the story.<br/><br/>I really don't think this movie is as much about Scissors or even Edward, but more about the little town, and their reaction to him. Its easy to say this is just a warped Pinnochio but instead of a little puppets who wants to be a boy, its a guy that wants hands. but, I think there is more going on here. Edwards Scissorhand's are clearly a sort of prison, but they also allow him to express himself, and really his only way to communicate. I think I watched this movie once and counted him as only haveing about 30 lines in the whole movie. For a main character, he is practically Helen Keller. I think that it could be more that he doesn't want hands as much as everyone thinks he should so he can be like them. Possibly, I think this movie is more about society. They go to great pains to show the ordinary, american dream suburb where everyones house is the same, everyone has the same dreams and hopes, Everyone goes to work at the same time, SAME SAME SAME SAME SAME. One example is what I like to call ""the car ballet"", where all the cars pull out of the garage at the same time and drive off. Pure symbolism. They are crying out for something new and different but, are also frightened by it. Just like a school of little scared fish, that change directions in quick motions, with no real good reason. One of my favorite examples in the movie is where a man with a prosthetic leg tells Edward to never let anyone tell him he's handicapped, later he calls Edward a cripple.<br/><br/>Is this really about Edward wanting so badly to be like these people, or these people wanting so badly to be like Edward? Or is it simply about the worlds rejection of creativity, and diversity? Truly, these plain, boring, ""ordinary,"" people are just as weird if not more so than Edward. I really think this story is about how the world is full of these people that have no real solo thoughts, and condemn anything different. The crumbling of human society through the effects of purity and perfection. A sad commentary on the current human condition, or lack there of. Love thy common man? only if he is just like you.<br/><br/>Does Edward want to be ""a real boy""? I think he probubly already is more than anyone else in the movie."

","There are two types of people who watch Edward Scissorhands... Those who are like Edward and those who are like the boyfriend who wants to beat up edward for enchanting ""his woman"".<br/><br/>If you are the beautiful, creative, passionate (and alittle pale) type who relates to Edward... good on you! Please don't give up. There is a little artist in most of us, and most people have felt awkward and alienated at some point... this film will speak to you, cut to your heart and stay with you for life.<br/><br/>Then there is the spiteful types who think that just because they dont relate to Edward's pain that the whole film is bad for others. Shame on you! One can't just write off a film with so much depth, and if it seems to you to be nothing else... but an imaculate visual feast in a fantasy like world... Perhaps you should go watch war and teen films about football heroes and cheerleaders, leaving the depth and spirit of this beautiful film to those with empathy and desire to be unique.<br/><br/>If you are the third type of person who loves this film (the girl who ran away from an aching ed out there...) This is a tear jerker and a real eye opener.<br/><br/>From the perspective of Edward himself, this film lets you feel alone, gifted and magical for a few hours. A great film to encourage tolerance of others who are different... and rather against those who just judge on face value.<br/><br/>Loved it, bought it.... you should at least rent it... :)<br/><br/>The musical score is beautiful Danny!

","...is how I would describe this excellent movie hatched from the wonderfully twisted imagination of Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is brilliant as Edward, a lovably naive and believably tragic character built by a mad genius (Vincent Price) but left incomplete with razor sharp scissors for hands. Depp's facial expressions and mannerisms in this film are so excellent. Depp is truly one of America's greatest actors.<br/><br/>Burton constructs a wonderfully surreal and satirical suburbia world. The bulk of the interest of this movie is Edward learning to adjust himself and his uniqueness in environment that is bland and thoroughly not unique.<br/><br/>
Excellent performances all around. However, the ending was kind of cliched and too easy of a way out. This is the only thing preventing me from giving this movie a perfect score. However, this movie's main underlying morals/themes about being colorful in a colorless world strike a chord of understanding within myself. Those of us who have been different from the norm our entire lives will find a immense love for Edward and a deeper understanding of this film. Final Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Noob Aalox"

","I never tire of Edward Scissorhands. Tim Burton has revived the lost art of telling a fairy tale. The once-upon-a-time suburbia is as apt for a modern fairy tale as the petty kingdoms we're familiar with, and the whimsical Inventor plays the benevolent magician role to the hilt.<br/><br/>We have the fairy godmother in Peg Boggs, a peppy Avon Lady who frees Edward from his imprisonment in the lonely tower. Her daughter Kim is the aloof Princess whose love Edward wins. An assortment of imps and ogres populates the world Edward strives to navigate.

","Comedy, Drama, and yes, a pinch of action. This is what you would find in one of 1990's best films.....Edward Scissorhands. While the plot is great, and the little extra details make this movie all the more wonderful. Edward is a misunderstood young man with scissors for hands (my guess is, you figured that out from the TITLE), and was created (no, he's not a robot) by an inventor in a ""spooky"" house on the top of a hill. One day, a cosmetics sales woman goes into the house, finds Edward, and brings him to the neighborhood in hopes of a newer, better life. But All this falls apart when he gets exploited by the media,  feared and hated by the public, and becomes an outcast from a string of events that weren't his fault.<br/><br/> While it is a fulfilling comedy, it is an even better drama. When all of his new found joy is eliminated, and becomes hated by most all (I say MOST all), you tend to share his pain. <br/><br/> So in conclusion, Tim Burton is a great director, as he has proved in Edward Scissorhands! 10/10"

","Truly, Edward Scissorhands is one of Tim Burton's masterpieces.  He mixes mystery, fear, magic, legend, incomprehension and love.  Mainly, the relation between Kim Boggs (Ryder) and Edward Scissorhands (Depp) goes far beyond any imagination could have thought before (no wonder why they dated after the making of the movie).  In a few words, a contemporary fairy tale of how a man-made robot could have become the model of human perfection, until a tragic event crumbles everything down, and how the love of a girl gives him the inspiration to carry on with his life to bring beauty and happiness to the people on the town. Every time I see this movie, it makes me think that life is short and that you must have to get the most out of it...never lose time."

","I love this movie through and through for many reasons.  Like most of the people who have commented on this film, I also think it was casted perfectly and it was pretty cool.  It's characteristic of most Tim Burton films.  Once again, he places the picture with contrasts between dark and light.  But it's always a contradiction.  In this film, the townspeople wear bright, loving colors yet turn out to be black and shrivelled at heart.  On the other hand, Edward comes off as a scary, unknown stranger at the beginning and really is a person with the biggest heart of them all.  Everybody loves the new person at the beginning but that love turns to hatred at the lack of understanding the people have for Edward's condition.  Behind the action and thrills of the ending, Burton tried to get across a lot of issues that plague our world today.  One is prejudice.  People at first are intrigued by the mysterious man with scissors as hands.  But as time goes by and Edward makes a few slips of judgement, the townspeople start to become scared of Edward and even start to despise him and the people who took him in.  It's also a wonderful love story between Ryder's character and Edward.  She's the exact opposite of the townspeople in that she dislikes Edward at the beginning but begins to understand his problems and even falls in love with him.  This may be a metaphor to interracial relationships in America.  It's a rather sad story with moral ethics laced throughout it.  All and all I think every American should see this movie.  It's entertaining and meaningful. ********** stars"

","It took me quite a while to appreciate this film - mostly because I wasn't familiar with Burton's fabulous, overblown proportions and great vision. ""Edward Scissorhands"" was just too weird for me. I am happy to say that it has grown on me - though being far from Burton's later work, such as ""Ed Wood"" or ""Sleepy Hollow"", it is still strikingly original and is a very interesting experience.<br/><br/>The tidy, perfect and very unreal suburb in contrast to the dracula-style castle that has somehow been left standing right in the middle of it is just the sort of dreamy juxtaposition that one could expect from Burton. It is a treat to be surprised by it and it feels very novel. The nosy, in-your-face housewives who center their absurd lives around what's going on in the neighborhood are a vital part of this juxtaposition. It makes you wonder which part of this weird place is for real and which isn't. And Edward himself, a bizarre freak whose life is turned upside down by kind and unkind (and just plain dumb) suburban dwellers - Edward must be one of the most haunting and sad characters I have ever seen, and Depp is absolutely perfect for the part.<br/><br/>In many respects the characters are pretty normal - they have been tweaked somewhat to allow for their extravagant behavior and their calculating meanness, but other than that, they are just people. But put in these awful, cheerily colorful surroundings, they seem even more twisted than they already are. And Edward, apart from his appearance, is more normal than any of them. A film full of wonders. It's inspiring to think that Tim Burton thought this movie up as a kid."

Towards the end of the movie, one of the viewers in the audience stormed out of the cinema, shouting, ""Those b*****ds!

It feels like a twisted fairy tale ... the 20th Century Fox logo behind a curtain of falling snow ... the first view of the castle rising on the mountain top behind the subdivision ... the flashbacks of Edward speaking with his ""father"" ... all of these elements build on each other and make ES one of the most brooding comedies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Depp is wonderful here, and Winona Ryder is perfect (but BLONDE?  ...

It is a harsh critique of suburbia and American culture in general, one that I identitfied with very much in junior high school when this movie came out.<br/><br/>I pulled this movie out and watched it again after four years and was surprised at how much more I got out of it this time through.  But I must admit that after all the analysis and subjective pandering, this movie really touches me on an emotional level.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is perfect as Edward.

","This is my second commentary on this movie.  <br/><br/>I've been thinking.  It's a very touching, sad and funny movie that really rips (pardon the pun) through you.  For two reasons: that the people are insensitive, unfeeling jerks who treat Edward like a freak, and that most of us will probably do the same.  <br/><br/>Like when Edward first came, he was a curiosity, and then a celebrity.  He probably knew that he couldn't fit into the mainstream, but was still the beautiful innocent he was.  Then it became a status symbol to get your hair cut by Edward.  So he was useful.  Then he became an object of desire. <br/><br/>
It's easy to point fingers and say that the people are bad because they won't accept him and don't understand.  But just think: if a guy with huge scissors for hands moved into YOUR neighbourhood, how would YOU treat him? How would everyone else treat him?  <br/><br/>At best he'll be pitited and then (maybe, but veryveryveryvery VERY rarely) gotten used to.  But people will still come and look at him and gape and maybe take a picture of him and everything.  It's like having the Elephant Man at your place and you look in fascinated horror.  <br/><br/>So it reflects us perfectly, little would we like to admit it.<br/><br/>But that's not convincing you to see the movie, is it?

","EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (Tim Burton) **** out of ***** (Contains maybe minor spoilers))<br/><br/>One thing is for sure, this movie introduced me to the world of storytelling and movies in general at a young age.<br/><br/>This is the first movie that I vividly remember seeing for the first time, some 10 years ago now I think. It HAS been 10 years ago since I've seen this movie. We taped it from television, and I watched it, I watched it, I watched it, until suddenly, the tape just disappeared. A very disappointing day in my life if you will :). 'Edwards Scissorhands' buried itself in to my memory as the most fascinating film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>And now, some 10 years later, now that I'm attending film school, I had the chance to order it on DVD. You can imagine how happy and thrilled I was when got it in my hands. All the memories of the movie returned to me in an instant. I felt like a little kid for a second. This movie has been haunting me for all that time, 10 years without seeing it again, it was almost too much to bare.<br/><br/>And what I expected, this movie hasn't dated one tiny bit (maybe for the first long shot of the town and the hill, where you clearly see that the hill is animated). I still consider this as one of both Burton's and Depp's best, without a doubt!<br/><br/>The innocence that Edward radiates throughout the movie is just wonderful, you feel for him. If he feels fear (for example the scene where he is locked in Jim's house), you also can feel it, if he feels mad, you can understand why he feels mad. It's just amazing how Burton created such a fantastic character. It is a Burton says: 'Edward Scissorhands is about wanting to communicate, but not being able to'. I think this is the reason why I can connect to him. Like everybody else, I've been in such situations.<br/><br/>
Visually, this is among the most breathtaking pieces of cinema that I know. Especially the mansion scenes with Edward and The Inventor create a rare feeling. And don't ask me what I think about the ending scenes, it's sad, sad, sad. Very hard to keep your tears to yourself. Beautiful scenery. Just see it for yourself, you will know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman, the genius behind the theme music. I thank him for giving this movie that extra dimension that it needed. The music in 'Edward Scissorhands' keeps hauting you until you get amnesia, I will promise you that. Just brilliant...<br/><br/>The is movie combines comedy, romance, drama, fantasy and so much more. It just all blends together in one fantastic film.<br/><br/>Thank you Tim Burton and Johnny Depp for creating this."

","""Edward Scissorhands"" is a very well told story with the stunning vision of director Tim Burton. The character of Edward (played expertly by Johnny Depp) is very complex and has a very sad story. Burton shows us what it means to not fit in with society. The design of the inventor's mansion is a work of art and the colorful look of the suburban neighborhood (which is much more disturbing than the mansion) is perfect. Depp and Ryder have great chemistry and Vincent Price is great in his role as the inventor. Alan Arkin's performance is my favorite because his character is so subtle and fun.

","When the film first opened 10 years ago, people thought it was a horror movie because it was made by Tim Burton and had a ""monster"" as the title character. True, it is modeled on FRANKENSTEIN, but it is really a wonderful fairy tale about being different and creative in a world that values conformity over everything else.<br/><br/>Vincent Price is a delight as the ""mad scientist"" who doesn't want to rule the world but to make cookies -- and a man who is really a robot with a heart. Like the IRON GIANT, this film appears to be a child's tale on the surface, but it is really profound with insights into human nature.<br/><br/>Depp is totally convincing in his odd Christ-figure role. His eyes and facial expressions show his real talent and range. He manages to be funny, sad, spirited, dejected, and inspiring while hidden under a body suit and thick make-up.<br/><br/>Edward is Tim Burton's alter-ego. If you ever see a picture of Burton, notice the fly-away hair and long fingers. He is showing us the artist in his struggle with a crass, bland world of pastel cookie-cutter houses and drab lives.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's music here is his best. He has time to develop beautiful themes and variations. I think this is one of the most touching soundtracks ever written.<br/><br/>Since the movie concludes at Christmas time and has a mystical, magical ending, it is an ideal film for Christmas since it manages that rare quality of being really moving without being mawkish.<br/><br/>In the new DVD format, the images are sharp and the music is magnificent."

","I will always wonder what was on the other side of the mountain.  I think all of the characters in ""Edward Scissorhands"" must have contemplated it too at some time in their lives.  Of course, none of them can see it, it's obscured by the menacing mountain and its gothic mansion, but the eternal resident of the mansion must know what's on the other side, even though he will never visit.<br/><br/>This is the world of Edward.  I could go on about the film's theme, try to convince people that the film is blessed simply because it says, ""different is good.""  The film is more.  Perhaps it's flawed, but it's a fable, and that makes it okay.  Like all Burton films, this is a film of image, what a film should be.  Those who have seen it will never forget what it looks like to dance in the snow around an ice angel, or how painful it must be to impail the only thing that would make your life complete.  Unlike other Burton films, this one really takes itself seriously.  It has often been billed as a comedy, and if you are looking for one, go someplace else, because this is most definitely a tragedy.  True tragedy in films is hard to find.  Just because a character dies and it is sad does not create a tragedy.  Every frame of this film is painful to watch, even the last few beautiful images.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if my ramblings have influenced anyone, but this is a film of faith.  It is an experience.  It might not change your life or teach you anything or make you understand something you have put away, this is a film to sympathize with.  This is a film that makes you feel human, a quality that will seperate the species."

This film has it all...beautiful scenery, a stiring musical score, staggering cinematography and even some off the wall humor.  This is a film that has something for everyone.

","""Edward Scissorhands"" reminds me of nothing so much as one of those fantastic Caribbean meals that blends flavors, colors, and textures you'd never think of putting together -- but, composed by an artful chef, becomes a food experience to be retold for years.  The characters provide the pungent flavors: Depp's innocent Edward, Ryder's ethereal Kim, Arkin's crusty Bill Boggs, Wiest's sweet Peg Boggs, Hall's brutal Jim, Baker's man-hungry Joyce, and Price's cadaverously paternal Inventor.  Edward's environs give color, from the black and white of his castle, to the eerie green of his gardens, to the pastel-mint kitsch of his neighbors' houses. And the story puts the meal together with softness, chew, and crunch, and the romance between Edward and Kim finishes the meal sweetly.<br/><br/>Of course, when your chef is Tim Burton and your server is Vincent Price (in one of his last performances), the lights are dim, the tablecloth is black, and the candlesticks are cobwebbed.  Though presented as a children's fable (which, like Rocky and Bullwinkle, also satisfies the adults who ""get"" what the children don't), this might not be for kids who still fear the darkness under the bed.  But for anyone older, reserve an evening.  Start with jerk chicken, roll ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and finish with coconut pudding."

This movie teaches us that it's ok to be different, and that we  should accept our differences instead of fighting them. Tim Burton is great a creating stories about underrated people. I never miss a Burton film, especially if Johnny Depp or Winona Ryder are in one of them. Burton always brings out the eccentricity in Depp (for example, see Ed Wood or Sleepy Hollow, both great films, also Beetlejuice with Ryder). Edward Scissorhands is such a beautiful film in every way. The snow fall at the beginning, the developing relationship between Ryder and Depp, and the character development (you really know who you like and who you don't by the time this film is over). One of my favorite scenes is when Depp and Alan Arkin (who is very funny in his scenes) go to the basement and Arkin is pouring scotch and Edward asks what it is and Arkin says ""Lemonade.""

When I finally got around to watching it, I cried my eyes out, and I still cry when I re-watch (I love these off-beat, unconventional tear-jerkers).<br/><br/>The movie isn't an allegory; it's OUR life.  It shows how hopeless we all are, reduced to gossip, to trying to feel superior over everyone else, mostly by picking on them.  Edward's scissors prevent him from being accepted, and a regular butt for jokes.  At one point, poor Edward is trapped with the sex-starved Mrs. Monroe at the beauty parlour.<br/><br/>When you watch it, it's almost impossible not to cry when you see him looking at Kim, the girl he loves but can never have.  His puppy-doggish expression of mixed reverence, adoration and hopelessness just breaks your heart.<br/><br/>This movie has a sort of child-like innocence, since everything's new to him.

This movie came out in 1990 when I was five.  When I was three (1988), I had a terrible dream where a man named Edward Scissorhands attacked me while I was in my basement.  I just wanted to get that frightening experience out into the open.  Now, concerning the movie itself, I have several questions.  Why was Edward given scissors for hands?  I know that if he had normal hands, there would be no movie, but still.  Also, was Edward shot in the end?  If so, why didn't he die?  Other than this, this is a great film.  Burton did a magnificant job with creating such a unique character that is so well developed.

","Edward Scissorhands id one of Tim Burton's greatest films, and all of his are great films. The movie is a very emotional and artistic movie. The movie is in a class by itself. I couldn't put this movie in any basic genre, though most Tim Burton films can't be, either. Edward Scissorhands has a very artistic and fantasy-like story, one we knew couldn't happen in real life, but it also has a lot of touches of the real world. For example, the setting of the movie is completely far fetched, yet as the story progresses, Edward finds out about many real life problems. We all do, and we all find out about the monsters in us all. Edward, the artificial and ""crippled"" man in the story is the only one that does not have that characteristic in him, while the rest of the cast, normal humans, are the real monsters in the film. Johnny Depp gives a stupendous and absolutely exceptional performance as Edward, a creation made by his master, the late Vincent Price. Edward's creator and master dies before he can complete him, so Edward is left with an error-scissors for hands. He lives up in a mansion until a local Avon lady brings him to her neighborhood, where he falls in love with Kim Boggs, played by Winona Ryder. What follows are extremely sad scenes of the neighborhood slowly progressing to thinking Edward is some monster, especially after a terrible decision Edward makes. Anthony Michael Hall plays the villain-type roll as Kim's boyfriend. He is the main reason why Edward is typecast as a monster in the neighborhood. The ending is very emotional, I can't say that it happy emotion either. The movie succeeds in everything it tries to accomplish.

The Elfman score is exquisite, the story is haunting and lovely; the film is simply magnificent.<br/><br/>While some have criticized -Edward Scissorhands- for being too ""heavy-handed"" or too obviously allegorical, I think that the inherent message of the film is one that is universal enough not to be a distraction to the film's beauty. The plot and the characters are too original to evoke feelings of ""been there, done that"", even while it may be true that everyone has felt alienation at one time or another.<br/><br/>The content of this film runs rampant with ""Burton-isms"", the clever absurdities that are Burton's trademark in films. This film does contain a lot of humor and oddity, but unlike films like  -Beetlejuice -, its story revolves around something that is not alien to anyone - love. This is a love story that breaks the heart. The originality lies in the details, and in the conclusion. It's been a long time since someone has written a fairy tale love story that doesn't end up with the beautiful girl living happily in the castle with the handsome prince.

I'm 15 now and a junior in high school and after 6 years of not viewing it I decided that I most likely would not cry again.  I knew that it was showing on television so I decided to watch it.

","I am a huge Tim Burton fan, and love all of his movies and own them, have watched them at least 10 times each, and each one is really special to me (I know how dorky that sounds) but this is the one I am the most emotional about. I can't think of any other movie that has made me cry as often during the course of the movie, or as hard.  When I saw it in the theater, I wasn't just tearing up, I was sobbing by the end. During the scene where Vincent Price (God I miss him) perfectly cast as ""The Inventor"" tells Edward he has a special present for him and hold up a pair of perfect hands, only to slip away at the last moment, I looked around the 3rd time I saw in the theater, and literally everyone in the theater was choked up if not outright crying, including grown men. If I ever want to cry on demand, all I have to do is simply *remember* the last scene of the movie, and the last few lines uttered by the storyteller, and I tear up. Just pulling up the image of Ryder, spinning around in the 'snow' dreamily, can still bring tears to my eyes 9 years later. I think this is the only movie I've seen where I actually had to sit there all through the credits trying to pull it together because I couldn't stop crying. My friend and I were still sniffling walking out of the theater. Other women out there: this is not a movie to watch when you have PMS, not unless you want to totally break down in a sobbing, emotional heap. I was reading the transcript on the internet during my dinner break at work last month and started tearing up right at my desk, and I wasn't even in an emotional mood when I started reading it. There's so many great things about this movie-- Tim Burton is a genius, plain and simple, and the art direction is brilliant. His vision of suburbia is great, with rows and rows of identical, colorful 50's style tract houses and flawless green lawns. The imagery will stick with you long after the movie is over; for instance, the shot of the little girl, getting told a bedtime story (the film's framing device) in a huge, oversized bed, almost buried in all the quilts and pillows, or the inventor's workshop, with an assembly line pumping out gingerbread men. Elfman does do his best work (other than Beetlejuice).  Winona Ryder and Johnny Depp were a couple at the time the movie was made, deeply in love, and it shows. It actually hurts to look at them, and Ryder, even with a horrible blonde wig, is stunningly beautiful and radiant. Just the way they look at each other, the longing in both their eyes, the tenderness when she says, ""Hold me"" and Edward replies sadly, ""I can't"", so Kim (Ryder) lovingly wraps her arms around him instead-- it gets me every time. All the casting is great (Vincent Price, especially -- obviously, Tim Burton got his dream cast for this one). Anyone who has ever felt like an outsider, or lonely, or longed for someone they know they will probably never end up with, will be touched deeply. (Starcrossed lovers always get to me). Yeah, I know. This all sounds very corny, but this movie is really in a class by itself."

She takes pity on him, and brings him down to the surburban world, where he is regarded with wonder by all the neighbours. He sculpts animals and such out of bushes, as he did in the mansion, and also turns out to be a nifty hairdresser. But he also has his eyes set on his family's daughter.

Edward's innocence unknowingly gets him into trouble, as the locals turn on him, and he goes back to the old mansion, after the death of the boyfriend.<br/><br/>When Edward was sculpting a statue out of ice, and the daughter was dancing in the snowflakes eminating from it, I can say that this is one of the few movies that made me cry.

Edward Scissorhands, as played by Johnny Depp, is an innocent and naive fellow who gets thrust into this crazy suburban nightmare. Tim Burton shows us that he believes the people in town are crazier than a strange lonely character at the top of a hill. If you have ever read interviews with Burton, you will see that this is his favorite type of story to work in. Burton seems to love the characters who nobody else would understand. The cast is solid, and I particularly liked seeing Vincent Price and Alan Arkin. The score from Danny Elfman is his best to date and totally captures the feel of this film.

Johnny Depp has said that he identified with Edward completely and was deeply sorry when filming ended as he knew he would never again look in the mirror and see his alter-ego looking back. Talented, gifted, misunderstood - Edward or Johnny?  We may have lost Edward Scissorhands but thank God we still have Johnny Depp!!"

","Edward Scissorhands is one of my all-time favorite movies.  People tend to complain that its light, happy, feel good atmosphere (conveyed beautifully) is destroyed at the end with murder and unpleasantness.  All of this is true,  but its not a flaw.  I think that the drastic atmospheric change in the end is exactly what Tim Burton had in mind.   The general message of the movie (to me at least) is that society can corrupt the most innocent of souls, this message comes across loud and clear.  Edward Scissorhands, however, is also a beautiful love story (fine, they don't end up together in the end...did Romeo and Juliet end up together in the end?).  The end of the movie always makes me cry."

","Tim Burton has updated an old tale of the misunderstood and scary-looking beast (Edward) and his love relationship with an incomparable beauty (Kim or Winona Ryder).  The tale is modernized (sort of) into a suburbia America setting with 60's styles houses, clothing, cars, and people.  The reason this movie is so likable is simply because it interweave's romanticism and darkness with bits of comedy to relieve the tension of the viewer.  This dark fable puts chills down your spine (e.g. when Edward first steps out of the darkness of the attic to meet Peg) while at the same time fills your heart with an equal mixture of happiness and sorrow.  In addition, Burton's  picture was filmed with great elegance.  Who can forget the scene when Edward is carving the ice sculptor and Kim is dancing in the snow he has created?  The ending of the movie is not as melancholy as everyone believes.  It is revelatory about who the real monster is.  This movie can obviously be compared with other tales of individuals who were also outcasts in their society such as Frankenstein and Burton's other masterpiece, Batman.  This work of Burton's is his personal statement to all pariahs who have ever been spurned by the greater populus."

","First of all, it's not hard to figure out that Edward Scissorhands is a movie where the main character is a man with scissors for hands. The next obvious question is why or how would someone have scissors for hands? Even if I suspend disbelief and accept that somehow this could be possible or just ignore that it is never explained and accept that a boy with scissor hands came to exist, then I have to wonder how his existence supports the telling of an interesting story with an important message. The message in the story to not prejudge others based on appearance or differences, but rather based on the things we share in our quest for happiness, and based on how our actions reveal our intentions. My conclusion is that the creation of this character is not only unnecessary to making the point, but dilutes it terribly due to absurdity and poor story telling. If you feel you really must see it to satisfy your curiosity, then be warned and prepare to be disappointed."

"mentalcritic","10","2","5","5 May 2007"," Tim Burton's most personal and relevant film...
","Edward Scissorhands was a transitional film, not just for its director, but also its star. While it was often overlooked and avoided by the mainstream audience when it was first released, people who have more in common with its titular character than they realised at that time have since embraced it with open arms. Watching it seventeen years later, I can understand how it put some members of the audience off, as it is also Tim Burton's most serious, least light-hearted film. In contrast to Batman, Ed Wood, or even Corpse Bride, Edward Scissorhands is played completely straight, with every note of the story intended to be taken seriously. Or so one might think from experiencing the manner in which the story is presented. Although it is tempting to think of Edward Scissorhands as being intended as satire or a joke, everything that the public knows about Burton suggests that he was totally and utterly serious about the message of the film, both those intended and those that the people the film particularly appeals to have discerned.<br/><br/>At its heart, Edward Scissorhands concerns itself with an Avon saleslady named Peg, who finds the titular character within a haunting-looking Gothic mansion after a particular bad day at the grindstone. Unsure what to make of her new acquaintance, she brings him home and embarks on an effort to domesticate him, for lack of a better word. Figuring that all one needs is love, she slowly introduces Edward to the rest of the family, and eventually the neighborhood. At first, everything goes swimmingly, with Edward finding his rather strange condition allows him to do things the stiff-minded townsfolk would not deem possible. But with such sudden acceptance also comes a degree of unhealthy curiosity, not to mention jealousy. As Peg's daughter, played by Winona Ryder in one of her rare fits of relevance, takes more of an interest in the new arrival than she probably should, the normie element starts to deliberate about how to besmirch Edward's character. The manner in which they subsequently behave will strike many who have something in common with the director as oddly familiar.<br/><br/>Much of Edward's background is told through the use of flashbacks that not only detail how Edward lived before he was discovered by the bored housewife, but also why he is in the state he is in. The film, or rather its publicity materials, describe him as being unfinished, but I really hesitate to use that word in this context. Unfinished, incomplete, or variations thereof have a very specific connotation, and the reality is that this connotation is very different from the Edward Scissorhands we see in the film. For certain, he lacks fingers, but he not only comes across as being far more sincere than those around him. He also demonstrates that what he lacks, a fully formed set of hands, is far less important than what the townsfolk he is introduced to in the first act lack, an open mind or an imagination. It is no coincidence that the hairstyles and greenery sculptures that he creates using his bladed fingers take on shapes that never occur in the imaginations of the townsfolk. Or within the imaginations of members of the audience, for that matter.<br/><br/>As I said, the film marks a transition. Director Tim Burton was starting to be taken seriously as a director with a unique creative vision. Batman had just made so much money that one of its stars wound up being paid more than some small countries make in a year. Beetlejuice was prompting grapevine talk of this weird director who portrayed the afterlife as being warmer than the world of the living. And then there was the star of Edward Scissorhands, a former teen idol by the name of Johnny Depp. Although the effect took more time to become more discernible for Depp, this is but one of the films that began to make audiences and the press alike take him more seriously. Even though he was already twenty-one when he made his debut, it is easy to look back on his early appearances and realise he demonstrates more talent than anyone he shares the screen with. After working with Burton for half a dozen films, I am sure Depp must realise just how perfectly they are matched. The only other actor that comes close to benefiting so much from Burton's direction is Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>Indeed, regardless of the colour scheme Burton uses for the different environments of his films, he manages to make one sharply repulsive compared to the other. The mansion in which Edward is found is dark, foreboding, and haunting. Yet it is at the same time so warm and inviting, thanks in no small part to a strong score by Danny Elfman, that one wants to run away with Edward and tell this normalised world they are never coming back. Indeed, after being denied knowledge of what I am for so long, and seeing normies get away with what would be called perjury in a just world during this film, I have to ask those normies one thing. Yours is a world of respect with trust, and mine is not? Tim Burton is therefore not just a director of unique and extraordinary vision. He is the voice for a neglected minority that is being assaulted from all sides by normalists and negationists. Whether he intended this is beside the point, as Edward Scissorhands demonstrates. That he does it so well, and so passionately, makes the end result infinitely more watchable.<br/><br/>It is for these reasons and more that Edward Scissorhands is an unqualified ten out of ten film. Burton does not just offer a piece of himself here, he reaches out and touches so many."
"lee_eisenberg","7","2","5","9 February 2006"," His story will touch you, even though he can't.
","In what was the first of many collaborations between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, Depp plays a sort of Frankenstein's monster with a most unusual set of hands. When suburban career mom Peg (Dianne Wiest) brings him to her neighborhood, his life completely changes - although not necessarily for the better.<br/><br/>""Edward Scissorhands"" is the sort of movie that you can imagine only Tim Burton directing, what with the contrasts between Gothic (the castle) and colorful (the neighborhood). Burton has made many movies set in such environments, but this one was particularly interesting. It's an eye-opening look at how our society sometimes regards outsiders."
"Justme16","3","10","51","23 October 2005"," An unsuccessful attempt to parallel a classic.....
","Edward Scissorhands, desperately trying to imitate the classic movie, Frankenstien, failed completely to capture the emotion and brilliancy displayed by the previous classic. Why someone would want to parallel such a classic like Frankenstein is beyond me. <br/><br/>The acting was poor in some places and the characters were very much clichÃ©d. Although, Johnny Debt did portray Edward pretty decently, for it was such a bad part to have, being that Edward was pretty much confused the entire time. I also thought the themes in this movie are overused. I know already that society is unwilling to change and is shadowed by corruption. I didn't need a poorly created movie, being more shallow/unconvincing than creative, to enlighten me on this subject."

","Edward is a rare kind of movie.  But then, it's been said that Tim Burton is a rare kind of director, and I'm happy to say it's the truth.  From the glaring pastels and stripes of Suburbia to the dark, melancholy grounds of The Master's castle, we get to see a story of contrasts and comparisons, a look at the human in the monster and the monster in all of us.  There's a serious moral here.  And that, in the end, is a problem I have with this movie--it's very heavy-handed and allegorical.  As the movie concludes, the viewer is smacked by hatred and coincidences that turn the world against the 'monster' that is Edward; you watch as even with all the love in the world, things simply don't always work out.  The closing is possibly one of the saddest things I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen a lot.  Johnny Depp pulls in a startling performance as Ed, and there's cameos by the Master Of The Macabre, the late Vincent Price.  Not a bad flick, no, but nothing I long to see repeatedly."

I had not seen this movie since I was a kid (so I watched it) and DAMN. It is a social commentary on how we are as humans (manipulate, cruel, afraid of what we do not understand) while also commenting on the middle class and much more. On top of that it is a story of an outcast that only wants to be accepted, but is different and eventually shunned because of it. It is a tragic love story of a man that does not age and having only had a taste of love and friendship, is forced to live alone, forever. So sad and very relatable for me having always been an outcast. Easily Burton's best film. The feels. I cried like a baby."

"Like_Wu_told_me","10","1","2","13 September 2012"," A sublime fable of love and humanity
","Edward Scissorhands is a film that begins on a seemingly light note and turns into one of the most beautiful, profoundly moving films that I've seen. The production, direction, writing, and acting are all top-notch, and it all comes together perfectly to tell a simple but perfect story that comments on love, humanity, and modern society. The film beautifully distills such elements of isolation, longing, loss, loneliness, and nostalgia of the human experience, as well as the joy, love, compassion, humor, warmth, and kinship that make life so rich. <br/><br/>The story is a simple tale of Edward (Johnny Depp), a man who is less a social outcast than simply a forgotten orphan. He lives alone in a decrepit castle on a hill overlooking a cookie- cutter suburban neighborhood, filled with pastel homes and cars, perfectly manicured lawns, and gossipy housewives. When Peg (Dianne Wiest) pays him a visit and has him move in with her neighborhood, family, and life are affected in both touching and tragic ways. <br/><br/>The entire look of the film contributes to its fable-like feel, and the pastel color palette combines with its simple but vivid characters and plot to create an a unique but universal emotional power. The performances are integral to the film's success. Depp is a wonder as Edward, conveying his loneliness, joy, creative ambition, fear, and confusion with his new world in an incredibly endearing and moving way. Wiest is the other standout in the solid cast. She underscores the utter sincerity at the root of Peg's compassion, understanding, and kindness, and her love and concerns for both Edward and her own family are amplified as a result. <br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is a wonderful, touching film that explores the complexities of life and human relationships in an insightful, unique, and highly affecting way. It's one of a kind, and probably Tim Burton's best. Great film."
"tieman64","Null","1","2","2 July 2012"," The Porcupine's Dilemma
","""For a community made up of so many freakish outsiders, Hollywood's oddly conservative."" - Tim Burton <br/><br/>Tim Burton directs ""Edward Scissorhands"". The film stars the chameleonic Johnny Depp as Edward, an odd man-child who was created in a spooky castle by an elderly inventor, played by horror maestro Vincent Price (in what would become his last film role). Edward's based on Burton's own life as an angst-filled loner growing up in Burbank California. Misperceived, ostracised and constantly brooding, he created Edward as a teenager, the character's scissor hands (he's literally unable to get close to anyone) emblematic of Burton's feelings of isolation, his inability to connect with others, and the misconception others placed upon him. Cute.<br/><br/>Burton worked with Price earlier on ""Vincent"", and clearly adores the actor, or rather, what the actor is associated with; expressionism, classic B movies, early horror films etc. ""Edward Scissorhands"", with its popcorn Gothicism, Expressionism and Surrealism (Lang, Murnau and most of all Czech surrealist Jan Svankmajer, are huge influences on Burton), itself borrows liberally from ""Frankenstein"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Cabinet of Dr Caligari"", ""Elephant Man"", ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"", and is arguably better than the filmed versions of each. It's an ugly tucking tale, but Burton puts his own spin on things and doesn't overreach; his film stays on the level of a simple children's tale, very whimsical, magical and charming. The film's memorable score is by Danny Elfman, though Burton initially approached Robert Smith of the English Gothic Rock band ""The Cure"" to do the soundtrack. Edward, and even Burton in real life, strongly looks like Smith. Not so cute.<br/><br/>""Hold me,"" a character played by actress Winona Ryder whispers. ""I cant,"" Edward cries. The couple spend the film caught in the porcupine's dilemma, someone getting hurt whenever they get close. As is typical of these films (see ""Elephant Man"" et all), the ""townsfolk"" and ""angry locals"" who ""bully"" our ""ugly duckling hero"" are ridiculously caricatural. They're a horde of dumb bad guys who, reminiscent of the final scenes in James Whale's ""Frankenstein"", arbitrarily decide to pick on poor Edward, form a gang and run him out of town. In response Edward, like Quasimodo and The Phantom of the Opera, flees and consigns himself to a tower overlooking regular folk. Ryder's character then spends the rest of her life lost in a lover's lament, missing the scissor man who stole her heart. The film's bookends are magical, Burton's tale offered as an explanation to a sleeping child as to why snow falls from the sky. Snowflakes, we learn, are essentially ""the sadness"" of our hero, Edward, as he carves ice sculptures from the mountaintops of the love he never had. Coppola would cast Winona Ryder in his ""Dracula"" film some years later, recognising the similarities in her role here with the classic damsels of horror-tales past.<br/><br/>While Edward is essentially a cyborg, the film portrays him more as a ""monster"" or ""freak"". Tod Browning's hugely influential ""Freaks"" is its granddaddy (also the ancestor of Lynch's ""Elephant Man""), as Burton goes to great lengths to draw parallels between suburban life and horror movies. All these films attempt to simultaneously ""humanize"" the monster whilst revealing the monstrosity of normative, non-disabled society. Edward may be part Frankenstein, part Freddy Kruger, but the townspeople living around him are themselves torn straight out of a John Waters or David Lynch (""Blue Velvet"") freak-show, all regular people painted in such a light as to seem grotesque and hideous. Even their surroundings are freakish, ""normal"" towns and homes exhibiting a plethora of kitschy artifacts (1950s interior decorating and costuming) and garish colour schemes. Burton also goes to lengths to highlight the clockwork routines of the townsfolk; their stifling conformity and machine-like normative lives. Meanwhile, everyone treats Edward's existence as a disability or a correctable medical condition, recommending various doctors or quick-fix solutions to ""rectify"" his ""incomplete state"". Unsurprisingly, regular folk only grow to value Edward when he ""makes himself a tool"" and ""starts working"" (grooming dogs, trimming hedges, barbecuing, cutting hair). Difference doesn't matter, so long as you conform to homoeconomicus, becoming a functional and productive worker within society.<br/><br/>The film's villains are heavy-handed and its romance rushed, but this is nevertheless one of Burton's better films. It was released in 1990, before Burton became a brand-name, typecast and spokesperson for all that is emo. Today Burton's a bit of a joke; an ageing goth rocker, or freakish blend of Botox and black mascara, marketed as a morbid outsider yet fully ingrained in Hollywood. The whole Goth image doesn't work past 35, Tim.<br/><br/>8.5/10 - Worth two viewings."

A modern fairytale set in what appears to be 1950's American suburbia; everything about it is almost perfect. Everything from the music by Danny Elfman to the effects by Stan Winston is brilliantly done and works so well together.

Edward is soon the talk of the neighbourhood and when it is discovered that he can do brilliant topiary (hedge clipping) and even cut and style hair, he becomes a bit of a celebrity. He soon grows a fondness for Peg's daughter, Kim, who is going out with local rich kid, Jim. He's a bit of a bully and things are about to turn a bit nasty for Edward. I will leave my summary here or the Spoiler Police will send me back to that draughty house on the hill (again).<br/><br/>I love the look and feel of this film; everything seems to fit in the world Burton has created perfectly. With no CGI I think the effects are really great, I'm still trying to figure out how some of it was done! Excellent performances all round and so honourable mentions go to; Johnny Depp as Edward, Winona Ryder as Kim, Dianne Wiest, who I think was really great as Peg, Anthony Michael Hall as Jim, Kathy Baker as Joyce, Alan Arkin as Bill and in one of his last roles, Vincent Price as The Inventor.<br/><br/>There is a lot about this film to like, and much I have mentioned already. On the downside though, I did find the plot a little predictable in that there had to be a bad guy, a damsel in distress and a sacrifice. This is the only thing that lets it down. I really like this film and would love to give it a higher score, but I guess the studio had its say in the end. But it's not all that bad; it still comes very highly recommended from me.<br/><br/>My score: 8.9/10 IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 143,869 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 91/100 (based on 54 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

","Stories get reused all the time. Whether consciously or unconsciously, movies will reference or reshape far older narratives. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the best writers do not so much steal ideas as respectfully blend or rework them, often to rekindle the thoughts and emotions of the previous generation around the preoccupations of the present one. As the filmmakers of the modern era became ever more retrospective, such movies became more common.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is scripted by Caroline Thompson from ideas by director Tim Burton. As has often been commented, it has a fair amount in common with Frankenstein (more the 1931 James Whale/Boris Karloff picture than Mary Shelley's novel - the narrative influences are strictly movieland). But it takes even more from the lesser-known story Being There, brought to film in 1979 with Peter Sellers, about a man (possibly autistic) who has been brought up in one house, seeing the outside world for the first time and being mistaken for a genius. Thompson and Burton channel these influences but give the whole thing the qualities of a modern day fairy tale – a fable about surviving society as a misunderstood outcast. The titular scissorhands – probably the most unique thing about the story – are the literal extensions of a person who cannot get close to anyone without unwittingly doing harm.<br/><br/>Just as the screenplay borrows from here and there, so too does Burton take cues from his cinematic forebears in the look of Edward Scissorhands. There are some clear nods to the weird, Gothic style of German Expressionism, but also contemporaries of his like Roman Polanski, Terry Gilliam and Paul Verhoeven, directors who have specialised in taking the real world (or something like it) and making it look baroque and alien. Burton was always more an artist than a technician. His designs for the picture and the way he frames them with the camera create a small town that is both familiar but eerily strange. There aren't too many connections to reality – no visible place names or brands. The houses, cars and clothing look normal apart from the abundance of tawdry, cartoonish shades. This is not mere stylisation – it is of utmost importance for the whole thing to work. The world Burton presents is just weird enough for us to believe the inhabitants wouldn't bat an eyelid at the huge Gothic mansion looming over of the town or think a man with scissors for hands was anything more than a subject for neighbourhood gossip. The snow-covered 20th Century Fox logo at the beginning of the movie is all part of the plan. We can't be distracted by the gold and fanfare of the usual logo; we must have total immersion.<br/><br/>The disparate influences of Edward Scissorhands extend to the performances. Lead man Johnny Depp studied the work of Charlie Chaplin in preparation for the role, something I guessed at even before I read about it. There is something very Chaplinesque in his shuffling walk and the way he innocently investigates his environment – a wordless expression of personality that is very endearing. But the best bits of Depp's performance happen on his face. He runs a gamut of emotions, filtered through this incredibly stilted exterior, from that nervous smile we see when he rides in Diane Wiest's car to the quiet anger he shows towards Anthony Michael Hall. Other than Depp, there's an excellently deadpan turn from Alan Arkin which provides a lot of the humour. The most honourable mention however must go to Vincent Price, whose appearance is brief yet has an added layer of poignancy with knowledge of the elderly actor's long and distinguished career as a patriarch of Hollywood horror.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is a movie so contemporary in its style, and yet so dependent on the influence of the past. The whole tapestry is new but every strand with which it has been woven has been seen before. And yet it has all done been done with such precision and above all such appropriateness, that even when its derivations become obvious, they only serve to deepen the power and clarify the meaning of the picture. After all, a good movie is the sum of its parts."

","this movie is SO amazing. it sucks you into the life of Edward and who he really is inside. knowing that they don't understand him makes you want to jump in the TV and smack them upside the head. Edward's love for Kim is so passionate and it should be right but it's her forbidden fruit. so yes, watch it. it will make you believe that love like that exist somewhere. Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder Forever. This is my favorite movie. This movie will fill your hearts with pain and sorrow but love and happiness. Anyone will agree and if you don't, you have no soul.

","This film is marvellous. From the characters to the costumes to the set designs, Tim Burton got everything right with this his (in my personnel opinion) best film to date. Edward is portrayed brilliantly by Johnny Depp as he brings vulnerability, wit and charm to the role that really launched his career as one of the most talented character actors working in Hollywood today. I love this film and you will too. It's incredibly touching, whilst filmed with high brow comedy and tortuous drama. One scene in particular, involving Edward and Winona Ryder's character Kim is so heart breaking it's untrue. But rest assured I won't go into the scene - instead I'll let you watch it and come to the same realisation as I did...and that is, that that scene and Edward Scissorhands is one of the most enchanting fairy tales ever made. To verify this and my general enthusiasm for this film, I will leave you with the summary of RottenTomatoes (a prestigious film review website written by world renowned critics) verdict on it:<br/><br/>""The first collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, Edward Scissorhands is a magical modern fairy tale with Gothic overtones and a sweetcentre"".

","This is a spectacular tale of the man who just wanted to be normal. I first saw this recently, but not surprisingly it was a great movie. The story gets summed up pretty quick, gets told through a quick narration.<br/><br/>By far this is one of Johnny Depp's best roll. I can't think of anyone else who can play Edward Scissorhands like Johnny Depp did. Almost as if he was made for the roll. The use of make-up and costume design for Edward was amazing, creating the belief that he was actually a created experiment. It proves that Johnny Depp can play almost any roll, but this is the most significant.<br/><br/>The way each character changes throughout the course of the film is amazing. Like everyone thinks he's some beast, but inside he's a nice person who just wants to fit in. The character changes swing around a lot, along with their feeling toward each other.<br/><br/>One of the great parts about this movie is that it actually made you feel the emotion intended, unlike some other movies where it fails to actually effect your emotions. Edward Scissorhands can make you feel anger, happiness, and sadness towards the same emotions that Edward would go through.I don't think I have ever seen anything accomplish this as good as this movie has.<br/><br/>Overall it is a good movie. I would rather like to see more background story to Edward's life than it showed. But other than that it was quite good. If yet you haven't seen it, see it as soon as you can."

","This film, for me, was literally a life-changing experience.<br/><br/>I experienced Edward Scissorhands for the first time this July when I was in the midst of quite a serious case of depression. I didn't have any previous expectations, although I'd heard good things about it. The trailer I'd watched wasn't spectacular, but I decided to give it a chance.<br/><br/>From the first moment Edward appears on screen, timid and vulnerable looking, the film captured me. I still cannot recall a film character, or really any character at all, that ""got me"" like Edward did. The character of Edward Scissorhands in himself is simultaneously a tragedy and a blessing. He is a character that not everyone can be in accord with, but for those of us who can relate to him, he is a lament for the nature of the misunderstood.<br/><br/>The film itself is, essentially, a fairy tale. It is, above all, a fantasy, and fantasy like you have never experienced it before. It is a film rich in detail and eccentric whim that seems to be practically leaking from Tim Burton's imagination. Because the film is purely imagination, nonetheless.<br/><br/>This is the first film to make me cry. In all honesty, I was bawling at the ending. Not merely because ""the ending was sad"" - because the film itself, and Edward as a character, and all he represents, and all the film represents, was beautiful, honest, cruel, and passionate. This film awakened in me and renewed in me that lonely dwelling spirit of a dreamer inside.<br/><br/>This is the film that sparked my interest in Tim Burton and his work, and I have ever since been engrossed in his fantastical world. He and this film continue to inspire me and my dreams.<br/><br/>You may view this film and not feel as deeply about it as I do, but I can only hope you appreciate this fine masterpiece and miracle."
"Science_Fantasy_Guy","10","1","2","28 January 2010"," The brightest constellation in the Tim Burton universe.
","Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands is a genuine marvel of a movie. By turns visually stunning, romantic, suspenseful, amusing, postmodern and deeply touching, it leaves a stronger impression on me with each viewing, never once showing its 20 years, and more importantly after all these years it remains one of the most unique, satisfying and downright perfect pieces of cinema ever made.<br/><br/>On a spectacular and sprawling yet (mostly) abandoned Gothic castle high on a hill surrounded by mouthwatering gardens and views lives an artificial man named Edward (Johnny Depp), whose old inventor's (Vincent Price) death left him completely alone and with sharp metal shears for hands. But then one day he is rescued from this life of mundane isolation by Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest), a kindly local Avon representative who takes him home to live with her and her family – her everyman husband Bill (Alan Arkin), their typical girl-next-door teenage daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) and cheeky younger son Kevin (Robert Oliveri). He becomes a hit with the locals for his amazing gift for hairdressing and dog-grooming, but that is hardly what he will remember most about this experience. Like in any true fairytale, Edward immediately finds himself smitten over Kim and (though they first meet with disastrous results) Kim slowly finds herself feeling the same way for this artificial but uncommonly gentle and kind man. But when her rough boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) finds out about this and tries to stop it by tricking Edward into committing a crime, a series of events transpire that put Edward in great harm.<br/><br/>Visually, Edward Scissorhands is almost impossible to beat as you'd expect from a director whose first job in the movie business was as an animator at Walt Disney Studios. The sets are jaw-dropping in both their design and construction, with the sets of the spooky Gothic castle and the Boggs' brightly coloured suburban street wonderfully juxtaposing the life of nearly complete isolation that in the beginning Edward only knows to the very friendly, close-knit and normal suburban environment from which he is eventually cut off once again in the end. Stefan Czapsky's cinematography, while (perhaps smartly) restrained for the first two acts, is stunning in the unforgettable ice angel sequence (the best scene Burton has ever filmed) and in the almost equally perfect climax, the editing is fluid and Burton crafts one of his best personal opening credits sequences of all. And the brilliant Danny Elfman's score is nothing short of astonishing, becoming (like the scores of most films that depend heavily on any kind of music) absolutely instrumental in the effect of the finale.<br/><br/>Caroline Thompson's (who helped Burton develop the concept for the movie) screenplay is an underrated gem, and working from it Burton also succeeds in making a fantasy movie that is not just real eye candy, but also an amazingly well-acted fantasy movie. Ryder (although I don't think I'm alone in saying that now whenever I see her on-screen or hear or think of her I'm reminded firstly of her shoplifting incident) succeeds in displaying a far nicer side as opposed to the strong cynicism she showed in the hilarious Heathers and Burton's earlier work Beetlejuice, and she truly makes you believe a girl like Kim could fall for an artificial guy with metal shears for hands, Wiest's sweet-as-pie warmth has never been put to better use as the kind but slightly naïve woman who sees past Edward's exterior and tries to help him fit in, and a very much cast-against-type Anthony Michael Hall (aka the geek from so many John Hughes movie) manages to display a much nastier side as Kim's possessive and mean jerk of a boyfriend. But none of them can hold a candle to Depp, who's never been better before or since as he is here, astonishingly portraying with great dignity, subtlety and barely 100 words of dialogue (and let's not forget he had to endure a very tight leather suit and the afore-mentioned ""metal"" shears for hands – and on that note a shout-out to the late, great make-up artist Stan Winston) an uncommonly gentle and kind but misunderstood and isolated artificial man who is hurt emotionally when he discovers that even the lightest touch with his scissor hands inflicts pain. <br/><br/>There are directors with distinctive styles and then there are geniuses like Tim Burton, whose extraordinarily vast, individual and visual imaginations are complimented by a real interest in telling beautiful stories to provide viewers with a film that will ultimately reach them on a personal level as well as dazzling their senses. He is one of the all-time gods not just of film-making, but of the arts in general, and with this film he is truly at the height of his powers. Many people say that Dances with Wolves and Kevin Costner winning Best Picture and Best Director over Goodfellas and Scorsese at the 1990 Academy Awards is disgusting and while I certainly prefer Goodfellas out of those two, the fact that this powerhouse masterpiece not only didn't sweep but was nominated only for Best Make-Up is even worse to me. Burton still considers this to be his most personal film, and it thoroughly shows. He has and will never top this."

","I could watch this film again and again (and I have). <br/><br/>It's the epitome of Tim Burton- magical and moving, whilst at the same time having a dark, Gothic edge. It's visually beautiful, powerfully contrasting bright toy-town colours with gloomy greys and blacks. Absolutely everything, from the colours of the houses to the clothes the characters wear, has been carefully thought out so that you have the impression of watching not a film, but a moving painting. <br/><br/>The storyline is lovely, and it will make you laugh and cry, often simultaneously. It's a perfect twist on the fairy story genre.<br/><br/>One of my favourite things about this movie is the score- composed by Danny Elfman. It fits the atmosphere of the movie perfectly, with its sweeping violin melodies and ghostly female choir. Tender, yet strange. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is, of course, fantastic and in my opinion this is one of his best roles. He barely has any lines but his characterisation remains very strong, meaning that you pretty much fall in love with Edward from the get-go. <br/><br/>Just watch this film. You won't regret it."

","Edward Scissorhands is a terrifying, grim fairy tale, the story of a deformed boy with scissors stapled onto his arms in the place of hands. It is a well known fact that Vinnie Price went buck nuts before he died, believing that he was a real mad scientist. He began experimenting on neighbourhood runaways, cutting them up and replacing their limbs with household appliances- he would sand off their feet and replace them with a couple of hairdryers, he scooped out their eyeballs and inserted Christmas lights, he ripped off their danglies and tied on glue guns. The list goes on, all I will say is that this is where radiohead got their name from. Tim Button, fresh from his success with his version of Batfink made enough money to make whatever film he wanted. He decided to base his next film on the continuing existence of one of Prince's creations- Edward. It is made all the more horrific by the fact that a love story is tacked on along with some rather sick slap-the-stick comedy.<br/><br/>The film stars Julia Roberts as a suburban saleswoman. In a clear rip off of off Desperate Houses, all the women are sneaky, self interested pointlessly neighbour obsessed with lives so empty and meaningless that the only way to fill the void with something other than outright hatred for themselves is to spy on their equally vacuous mud dwellers. Julia decides one day to go up to the spooky castle at the bottom of her street to try to sell her magic beans there. Inside she finds (amongst an assortment of fetish, S and M torture devices) a lonely young man called Edward. He seems normal other than the fact that he has scissors for his hands and is a complete weirdo. Naturally Jaunty Depp was picked for the role. Judy takes him home to meet her family- husband Richard, son Barry, and daughter Winrunner Rideher. Eddie falls in love for Wineowner but she calls him a hippie and has an affair with local jock Rob Lowe. Jedward goes buck nuts and begins having visions of his daddy, Vinnie Jones who advises him to become an assassin. He does, and the rest of the film is a blood soaked snowstorm of necks being sliced, eyes being gouged (with the camera placed on the tip of the scissor for maximum effect), and limbs removed as Tom Button shows his utter disdain for everything wholesome; it is basically him saying that he wishes everyone would murder everyone else and leave him alone to draw his zany pictures. The worst thing is, when Ed gets paid he can't count or spend the money as he keeps accidentally ripping it up.The scene where he moves from house to house impaling and mauling all the pets is so awful I may well have invented it just so I don't have to remember it. The thing comes to a climax when the FBI come to take Edwood away and he holds Winoprah hostage at the top of his castle. Helicopters swoop around the pair while he has a slow motion fight with their propellers. He finally cracks and cuts off his beloved's head and legs and is subsequently shot to pieces by the Feds. As the sad music rises, Winnie's blood drops onto the floor and we fade to white.<br/><br/>Best Scene: The ending where we fade back in to find that it is the future, and Wimpy is alive and well and a granny. Surgeons were able so sow her head and legs together with a thin strip of her torso, though her midriff is completely gone. She is telling her granddaughter this story (I assume the young girl was naughty and this is her horrific punishment). The child asks 'What happened to Ed, granny?' Winotebook replies 'Ed's dead, baby. Ed's dead' before racing off on her space age mobility cycle."

","Let me start by saying Tim Burton is my all-time favorite director. All of his films deal with the shy outcast who struggles to fit into society, usually with mixed results and ""Edward Scissorhands"" is probably Burton's greatest achievement.<br/><br/>An artificial man (masterfully played by Johnny Depp) is taken from his secluded, castle home to modern day suburbia by a cheery saleslady. From there, the film becomes a fairy tale with Edward falling in love with a young cheerleader played by the gifted Winona Ryder.<br/><br/>Burton brings so much to this film. It's production design is wondrous, the cast is a joy (with an amusing cameo by Vincent Price) and the story is well told. The fact the film also has a non-traditional ending makes it all the more unique.<br/><br/>A modern masterpiece."
"pekinman","10","1","2","22 September 2009"," A Beautiful Fantasy Classic
","I've been on a Tim Burton binge for a couple of weeks and just finished watching 'Edward Scissorhands' after not having seen it for over 15 years (!). I have been depriving myself of a wonderful film and am happy to have rediscovered its magic.<br/><br/>As with all Burton films you have to suspend disbelief and simply enter his world. For instance, it makes no sense that there should be an ancient Gothic castle on a mountain on the outskirts of a Florida suburb, or that a Frankenstein's monster like Edward should be so human, yet, apparently, immortal.<br/><br/>There are more levels to this film than meets the eye and I must watch it over and over, that is clear to me, and delve deeper into the visionary imagination of Tim Burton.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is deeply moving as Edward, his facial expressions and the slightest movements of his scissor hands leave most actors in the dust, even when unencumbered with such foreign objects attached to their bodies. And I loved seeing Dianne Wiest in this film playing Winona Ryder's (Kim's) mother Peg. She is sweet and deeply kind without being saccharin. She is also very funny in the bewildered, innocent manner Wiest is so good at. And Alan Arkin is a great foil as Peg's husband, a long-suffering but non-complaining worker bee, like all the other men in their neighborhood of pastel houses and cars, into which Edward brings his magic, for awhile, by carving topiary in all the yards and cutting the dogs' hair, as well as the housewives'. <br/><br/>Winona Ryder has great chemistry with Depp and their few moments together at the end are heart-rending.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call this a happy movie, because it isn't. There is a murder at the end, for which the viewer can't help but cheer about, that throws the film out of the park if you're looking for a kids' Christmas flick. This is an adult film suitable for more mature children and teens. Especially teens, who Burton always seems to view through a glass darkly.<br/><br/>'Edward Scissorhands' isn't a morality play or a sermon about right and wrong, it's more than those things but Burton doesn't shove it in our faces. He leaves us to come to our own conclusions with what appears to be a straightforward tale of good vs bad; it isn't entirely that either, though good and bad comes into it a lot in the script.<br/><br/>It's a tearjerker to be sure but I never felt manipulated by the film-maker in any way, though clearly he intended the poignance to rise up and overwhelm at the end. The beautiful music of Danny Elfman contributes a great deal, as always with that wonderful composer, to the atmosphere. <br/><br/>'Edward Scissorhands' is now a classic fantasy of American film-making and should be seen by all movie lovers. It's right up there with 'It's a Wonderful Life' but without the 40's schmalz.<br/><br/>One of Tim Burton's best."
"evelind7","10","1","2","29 June 2009"," Hauntingly beautiful film
","This movie is what I would call hauntingly beautiful-for its musical score, for its sad but wonderful story and for the dramatic ending that is ""Edward Scissorhands"".<br/><br/>I first saw this film back in the time it came out, around 1990-1991, and although I was young I found this movie to be so beautifully done. The town it takes place in is picturesque but the cast of characters are as varied as night and day and many are not willing to accept young Edward into their town. Many look at him as a ""freak"" and are willing to let him into their lives if only for an occasional haircut or lawn trim. Yet these same townspeople are easy to turn against Edward and take sides against him in moments of trouble.<br/><br/>I think Johnny Depp was perfect in this film and he made Edward Scissorhands what it is. He showed the viewers the complexity of his character, and showed us a lonely man who was so abruptly brought down from his house-a house he had always lived in- and made to live and interact with a society he had never even encountered before.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a great film. It is a fantasy-drama that still brings to me the same feelings of wonder when I first saw this film over almost twenty years ago. I highly recommend it."

"gentendo","10","1","2","19 November 2008"," Absurdity vs Normality
","Edward Scissorhands is a deeply peculiar and philosophical story that questions the peculiarity of life. It is a story that challenges people's ideas as to what is considered strange versus what is considered normal, and how by calling something strange or normal is really just a prejudice that identifies itself with the other side. In other words, what one person calls normal is what another may call strange. People typically use the word ""strange"" to alienate themselves from that which they don't understand, or are afraid of. The truth of the matter is that everything and everyone is strange; which is to say, everyone and everything is not completely understood, each of us being quintessentially unique. We have to familiarize ourselves with the strange and welcome it with open arms in order to understand ourselves, others and life in general better. The story of Edward Scissorhands is no different.<br/><br/>Edward is a part machine part man whose creator dies before his completion, leaving him with scissors for hands. He lives life as a social outcast within the vacant walls of a lonely, deserted castle, and is one day invited to live a ""normal"" lifestyle amongst a neighborhood of gossipy Suburban folk. He timidly accepts the offer, descends from his gloomy abode and enters a world that is not entirely familiar to him. He gawks inquisitively out car windows, jolts when telephones ring, pokes the mirror to examine the reflection he sees, struggles to eat food like everyone else, and overall lives in this new world like a foreign yet wondrous traveler. As the Avon lady who gave him this invitation concludes, ""It'll take some time to getting used to Edward before you start feeling at home."" Profound are these words. They seem to strike at the very core of the pilgrim within us all; traveling like foreigners on an unfamiliar planet as we try and familiarize ourselves and search for the cure to our divine homesickness.<br/><br/>That which we typically familiarize ourselves with to a great degree we call ""home"", or comfort. Conveniently for us we have quickly grown accustom to our home since birth. Earth is our home, and it is a place that has become familiar to us through repetition and time. For an individual like Edward, howeverone whom many of us would view as alien because of his differenceshe, to the contrary views our home as alien, and if you really stop to think about it, he's right.<br/><br/>The film's objective correlative seems to argue that it's OK to view life as absurd. Life is absurd. Life's absurdity will hopefully motivate us to learn more about what we are a part of, and to make that which was once considered absurd seem more reasonable. This only happens by descending, like Edward, from our homes of comfort and discovering the beauty that lies within the unknown. I believe we all bask in our own private wonderlands that at times make sense, and other times make nonsense. We're all still so naïve about who we are, where we came from, why we're here and where we're going, that to call something strange, I think, would be an indirect compliment to the God who created us all. It just means that we haven't explored enough. With time and repetition, however, things will become more familiar until we reach the status of feeling like we've finally arrivedfinally made it home.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is truly a wonderful story that reminds all of us not to lose our child-like ingenuities, but to embrace fear with loving hands and a confident smile."

","Edward Scissorhands is a wonderful masterpiece. I saw this film long before I saw any other Johnny Depp films. As usual, Tim Burton did a great job with the gifted cast. This film stars Johnny Depp as a invented person with scissors for hands. He was invented by an old inventor. As soon as Edward is about to receive his hands, the inventor dies. Soon after, a woman played by Dianne Wiest takes him to her house where he learns about everything from banks to the woman's daughter. Everything works out perfectly until Edward hurts the son. He eventually was kicked out of the town with everyone assuming that he's dead. As I said above, the acting was gifted and magical. Everyone did a good job. This is also Vincent Price's last film. The scenery was great and I liked the plant shapes the Edward was cutting. My only bad thought is that the score was a bit bland. I recommend this film to everyone over the age of 12 and I rate this film a 9/10."

","Edward Scissorhands tells the story of an artificial man who was never completed, and has pairs of scissors for hands. He is brought down to the real world where he falls in love with the daughter of the woman who took him in. Gradually, the neighbourhood begins to lose trust in Edward, and he is forced to run away forever.<br/><br/>Tim Burton could direct a movie of Johnny Depp reading a phone book and I'd watch it, just for the artistic value. Tim Burton's warped perception and the style of his art are perfect for this type of movie, and it makes for great movie-making. Tim Burton uses pastel colours and elaborate costumes to portray what suburban life was like in the late 50's or early 60's. It's always bright and shining in the neighbourhood. In direct contrast is the dark and creepy castle with storm clouds hovering over it 24/7, that serves as the home to Edward.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives a strong emotional performance as the kind, but naive Edward. Every role in this movie is expertly filled. Alan Arkin is especially funny as the oblivious husband of the woman who took Edward in. Vincent Price is great in his final role before his death as the man who put Edward together.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is an unconventional love story, but it's still one with raw emotion. It's the perfect movie to watch around Christmas, because it has a very Christmassy feel to it, at least towards the end. The thing I love best about the movie is that the WHOLE film, the character, the love story, everything, is given to us as an explanation as to why it snows. SPOILER: Snowflakes are shavings from ice sculptures that Edward is carving.<br/><br/>This is probably one of the most well written, well acted films in cinema history. One of the greatest.<br/><br/>10/10"

Johnny Depp is great, the same in all his films; Winona Ryder is so cute; Vincent Price is great... <br/><br/>The movie tells us the story of a man called Edward who is not human, just an incomplete creation by an inventor who died before he could finish him. The man is alone for a long time, but one day, a friendly woman founds him and take him to her house. There,Edward falls in love with her daughter, Kim, but she doesn't love him. But soon Kim realizes that he's got a sweet and good heart. <br/><br/>The protagonists in the film are Johnny Depp as Edward, Winona Ryder as Kim, Vincent Price as the inventor, Dianne Wiest as Pegg, Kathy Bates as Joyce and Alan Arkin as Bill. I think this film is the best by Burton,a man who must keep doing those cute and charming films like this and ""Big Fish"", ""Beetlejuice"", ""The Nightmare before the Christmas"", ""Corpse Bride"", etc. Do yourself a favour. Rent this film and enjoy it. You will love it."
"AngusYoungBinge","10","1","2","6 April 2006"," A beautiful, heartfelt masterpiece
","Tim Burton has a wonderful imagination, and from this imagination sprang the idea for ""Edward Scissorhands"", a movie that is so heartfelt it might just reduce you to tears. <br/><br/>The story is about Edward, the creation of an old inventor who passed away before he could finish him, leaving Edward with scissors for hands. Edward remained in the mansion until he is found by Mrs. Boggs, a local woman who works for Avon and is attempting to find customers for her products. Feeling pity for Edward, she takes him back to her house in Suburbia where he becomes loved by the people and hated at the same time. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp does a wonderful job as Edward, playing this out casted character with much talent. Wionna Ryder plays Kim, the daughter of Mrs. Boggs whom Edward has an infatuation with. Also notable are Vincent Price, wonderful as the old inventor, and Anthony Michael Hall, Kim's jealous boyfriend. What makes the movie memorable, however, is the amazing score from none other than Danny Elfman. The music is so heartfelt and fits the mood of the movie so well that it is hard not to feel tears in your eyes while watching this amazing movie.<br/><br/>Give it a try."

","When I first watched this movie, which was about the time it came out on VHS, I was mesmerized by the film's beautiful and slightly haunting music. I also was captivated by the movie's cinematography. One thing this great movie also did was introduce me to Johnny Depp. His portrayal of Edward, the young man who has been left incomplete by his maker, is perfect. Johnny really brought out Edward's innocence and confusion of a world he doesn't really belong to.<br/><br/>I thought the story was memorable. It is a bit comedic at times, but overall it is a wonderful fantasy that can teach others that everyone is different, but our differences should not frighten others. Rather the film tells people to accept others and share with them our hopes and dreams. I felt that Edward was a great caring person, even though he had never really been shown love or compassion. <br/><br/>I recommend for everyone to rent or buy Edward Scissorhands. It is a film that lacks nothing."
"tonymurphylee","Null","1","2","17 February 2006"," One of the greatest films ever made
","Tim Burton's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. It is simply such a treat to watch a film about a man with such childlike ability and innocence. And yet he has talent and a good heart. He creates art and is happy to know that what he thought was just a hobby to do when he's bored can be so attention grabbing. This fantasy film is a simple one told mostly in images. An Avon lady(Diane Weist) is having a typical rotten day when she sees a creepy looking castle way off in the distance. She takes her chances and drives all the way up to the castle. She finds a pale looking man(Johnny Depp) in the attic and sees that he is missing his hands and in place of where his hands should be, there are different shards and colors of scissors. This sight scares her at first, but eventually she feels deeply sorry for him and takes him home with her. The neighbors see him in her car and so begins the gossip. ""A man with scissors for hands?!"" ""What a weird looking man!"" ""Who in the world is that?"" ""What is he doing here?"" The man is talked about by everyone. He befriends the Avon lady's laid back husband(Alan Arkin) and her young son(Robert Oliveri).Later in the film, The Avon Lady's beautiful daughter, Kim(Wynona Rider), shows up and meets Edward too. And eventually he becomes popular with the neighbors when he shows that his scissor hands can create absolute beauty. Unfortunitly, he is taken advantage of, and that is when darkness begins to shroud the town's usual colorful spirit. Edward has disadvantages with his scissor hands and yet nobody except for Kim sees him as a man who is complicated and scared of this new world he has entered. Edward is somewhat clumsy, he is very unsettling looking with his cuts and scars all over his face, and he is quiet. Everyone ignores these characteristics except for Kim. The neighbors, when he shows something different in his usual activities, freak out! The people run from him, he is molested in the back of a hair salon by a strange woman, he is attacked by Kim's boyfriend, and he ends up being expelled from this so called normal world. The musical score by Danny Elfman is absolutely spell bounding. Quite possibly the prettiest soundtrack in motion picture history. It completely fits with the classic feel of the neighborhood and the mystery of Edward. This is my favorite Tim Burton film and I believe that everyone should see it for its beauty, its love, its look, and Edward. The film is hypnotizing. Vincent Price, the nice inventor, gives his best( and last) performance to date, and the flashbacks involving him are an absolute joy to watch. They are touching, beautiful, revealing, horrifying, and spell bounding. He may have been even more childlike than Edward in fact. In one flashback, he is shown reading to Edward and he suddenly exclaims ""This is boring!"" so he switches to some funny poetry and teaches Edward to smile. This film must be seen."

","I'd heard about this movie before and I wasn't really sure what to expect. I wasn't really into Tim Burton. But after seeing this movie, I have such respect for him. It's hauntingly beautiful. From the score, to the characters, to the weird place they live in, everything is meticulously and beautifully done.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is unrecognizable as Edward Scissorhands. You can't help feel sorry for Edward. He's so soft spoken and polite. He's thrown into this world he doesn't know and tries to cope with everything. Winona Ryder is excellent as Kim. She really captures the character wonderfully. You watch their relationship evolve. I know I've said beautiful a lot in this review, but I'll say it again. It's BEAUTIFUL. You really feel for Kim and Edward and absolutely detest the neighbors who try to take advantage of him.<br/><br/>Oh, man, I cried. I cried so much. This movie affected me way after I had stopped watching it. It's a movie that you keep thinking about and it lingers on your mind. Edward Scissorhands is one of the best, thought provoking, beautiful and haunting movies I have ever seen. It's original, different, sad but sometimes funny. I recommend this movie to anyone!"

","I have been waiting to see Edward Scissor Hands for months. Partly because of the magical and sad story line, partly because of Johnny Depp. I think he played this role with real ease, how many actors do I know who can play roles like Edward without being too plain and boring? Not Many.<br/><br/>The story of Edward Scissor Hands is one of those children's films that even action fans or Horror lovers might enjoy a little. It's such a sweet little tale, full of magic and fantasy, with a little bit of love thrown in.<br/><br/>This is a movie I will definitely want to see again because even if it's quite an old film, it still manages to warm our hearts.<br/><br/>I applaud Johnny Depp for his fine acting.

","One of the most touching films I've seen. Tim Burton did his best work in this Frankenstien-esquire expression of human cruelty, and ultimately love. To bear silent witness to pain, Edward's in this case, is a horrible mistreatment. Edward Scissorhands is a modern Frankestien, misunderstood, and unjustly feared. His only crime was a wish for acceptance, and that simple, simple thing was denied him, as it has been denied to so many others. Through Edward, Tim Burton shows just how cruel and judgmental people can be; but also how a little love, which costs nothing, can make the biggest difference. but forgive me, I get sentimental. Edward Scissorhands is a truly wonderfully movie, and through it, Tim Burton shows that at the end of the day, we can all make a difference."

","This is my favorite movie. Never mind that Winona Ryder uses age makeup that wouldn't fool an extra on a Planet of the Apes sequel. Never mind that this movie began the career of the Frankenstein creature that had once been a skinny teen named Anthony Michael Hall. Never mind that Burton chose style over logic in a lot of scenes. Edward Scissorhands is a movie for weirdos about weirdos. If the Goth crowd hadn't clung to Nightmare Before Christmas as their unofficial banner of nonconformity, this movie would have filled the hole. It's odd and funny and very, very poetic. The suburbs are portrayed as deeply strange, and counterbalance the deeply strange characters with pastels. If you're a rebel, or a hedge-trimming enthusiast, or a kid trapped in the suburbs, or a human being at all, you will be touched by this movie."

","Edward Scissorhands is in my opinion a classic and besides Batman it's Tim Burtons greatest achievement. Johnny Depp is fantastic as Edward the the poor creation of a brilliant inventor (Vincent Price) who unfortunately dies before he is able to finish his greatest creation, thus leaving Edward with a pair of huge scissor-like hands instead of what we would call normal hands. Years then pass and one day Edward is discovered by the local Avon lady who decides to take him home to live with the family, obviously the whole neighbourhood wants to know about Edward straight away but it seems he only wants to know one person... I must say the scene where Winona Ryder is dancing in the falling snow always brings a tear to my eye, because its such a beautiful scene and it is really made perfect by Danny Elfman who manages to capture the mood with his wonderfully composed music.

"pocca","7","1","2","1 May 2005"," One of Burton's best
","Very entertaining modern fairy tale about a beautiful but not quite human young man--he looks like a glam rock star as drawn by Edward Gory--cursed with scissors (giant shears, rather) for hands, who wants to fit with ordinary people but ultimately can't. The suburban setting is almost as strange as Edward himself: Burton takes its familiar kitsch and exaggerates just enough so the banal becomes surreal, and charming. The most entertaining sequences are those with Edward interacting with the neighbourhood housewives who make a sort of pet of him when he shows just how skillful his hands can be by trimming first their topiary,then their hair into exotic shapes (is there some kind of erotic subtext going on here about the unfulfilled longings of desperate housewives? Edward is definitely sexier than any of their husbands, and one of the women, a Peg Bundy lookalike, does blatantly attempt to seduce him). But inevitably Edward accidentally harms someone with these same scissorhands, the neighbourhood quickly turns against him, and Edward ends up back in hiding at the old Hollywood style haunted castle whence he came.<br/><br/>The only element of the movie that doesn't really work is Winona Ryder who plays Edward's dream girl and is supposed to be magic. Ryder has been magic in other movies such as Beetlejuice and Great Balls of Fire, but she looks miscast here in a cheerleader's uniform and brassy blonde wig. (She is somewhat amusing in the opening scene where she's aged about by fifty years and reading a fairytale to her granddaughter).<br/><br/>All in all, worth adding to a permanent collection of DVDs."
"tghoneyc","8","1","2","11 February 2005"," E.T. meets Frankenstein (1931)
","Tim Burton is one of the true auteurs of our time. He manages to put his label on virtually any project he takes on. And this is arguably his masterpiece. Excepting the ""Batman"" movies, the only other Tim Burton-directed movie that seemed to truly bring out his dark imagination is ""Sleepy Hollow."" My personal favorite is ""Beetlejuice,"" but that is more for sentimental reasons than anything else.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is the title character, a Frankenstein monster who has been left in the large, abandoned mansion of an inventor. The mansion sits at the edge of a small suburban neighborhood where the housewives' only function is to spread gossip. Edward is discovered by Peg Boggs, ""the Avon lady,"" after her unsuccessful bi-yearly visit to the homes of all the women in the neighborhood. Edward is brought home to the Boggs residence, and before they get home everyone already knows there's a tall pale man riding with Peg.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is already full of kooks. Kathy Bates eats up her role as Joyce, the neighborhood slut, there's the overweight woman with curlers in her hair whose hobby is to stare out the window and spread gossip about what she sees. And Esmerelda, the neighborhood outcast, who raises hell, quite literally, when she sees Edward.<br/><br/>Bill Boggs is a friendly man who is not above drawing the line somewhere. He just wants Edward to fit in. The Boggs' son, Kevin, is wowed by Edward, and even ventures to take him to show-and-tell. When their daughter, Kim arrives home, it is initially the entrance of someone who couldn't possibly be from the same family, but then we're reminded she's a teenager who has all sorts of inexplicable issues with her family already. For Edward it's love at first sight, or something like that, because being alone for so long, she's the first truly beautiful thing he's seen since he came down. Unfortunately, she's already attached to Jim, the spoiled bully who initially finds Edward amusing and pathetic, until Kim begins to like him, too, and stops seeing Jim. It's nice that as hateful as Jim is, we can see where it came from. He's the son of filthy rich parents. He never had to worry growing up. But his father won't buy him a car like he wants, he wants him to build character and earn the money himself. They have a top-of-the-line security system. And they are completely absent for the entire duration of the movie. We don't know these people, we just know what Jim tells us, and Jim doesn't think too highly of them, and as a senior in high school, he doesn't understand why they are the way they are.<br/><br/>The cast is first-rate and inspired. Viewed in flashbacks, Vincent Price, as Edward's inventor ""father,"" is a misguided man so fascinated by his own creations. It's no surprise Burton cast him, since he seems to have a great admiration for classic horror, and as one of his later roles, it serves the actor well. As Price plays him, he's not an evil person. He's just too old to finish what he started. Alan Arkin and Diane Wiest are perfectly cast. Their sensibilities as actors complement their characters, as middle-class every-men and women. Kathy Baker makes the most of her slutty character, Joyce. Anthony Michael Hall, for those who know John Hughes' films, might be the most surprising. Looking back at his dorky beginnings, who would have expected Hall to ever be so menacing? And then of course there's Johnny Depp. This is, I think, the movie that made him known, although he didn't rise to star status until 2003 with the character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp doesn't say much, but it's in his face and body movements that touches people. He is a tragic figure. He comes into the neighborhood like E.T., a freak with a heart of gold, but he's forced out by a mob of people who aren't so much eager to kill him, like Frankenstein, as they are eager to see what becomes of him. The women of the town are the kinds of people who buy tabloids at the supermarket, and so, as long as they don't know, they want to find out.<br/><br/>Tim Burton seems to have made this movie as a critique of suburban life. This isn't ""Desperate Housewives"" by any means, but a cruel and yet sincere observation of the human psyche, and what happens when everyone finds out."

It's obvious that this person would never exist in real life, but as the movie progresses, it doesn't even feel weird to see him.<br/><br/>It's about a ""man"" who was created by an eccentric old man. Before he was able to give him real hands, the old man died, leaving his creature behind with hands that are made out of scissors and knifes. He lives in an old castle, completely on his own, because no-one in the village on the foot of the mountain where his castle stands would accept him. But than one woman finds him, takes him to her home and gives him respect. In return he performs all kinds of small household tasks for her and her family. Of course this doesn't stay unnoticed by the neighbors and soon they all want to make use of his wonderful hands and talents, without giving him anything in return...<br/><br/>This movie may look a bit weird at first, but you have to read in between the lines to find the real meaning of it. In fact this movie is about the social acceptance of people who are different, because of some handicap or something else. It shows that these people can be valuable as well, that they also have normal human feelings, but that many people are afraid of them or want to use them in their own advantage. I give this movie 7.5/10."

A pallid, wild-haired innocent with a heart of gold and fingers of steel, Scissorhands becomes the neighborhood's personal freak show. He fascinates with his dexterous ability (as hairdresser, ice-sculptor etc.) and arouses strange desires in female loins. But he is never accepted into their pringle swathed hearts.

Johnny Depp was great his child-like voice and the way he walked moving his scissors as he did. The first half of the film its like a children's film, everyone has different coloured houses and their cars match their houses but the second half it gets darker with all the people turning on Edward and then were they chase him away for doing nothing wrong, the opposite in fact saving the boy from being run over but the people think hes trying to hurt him and then Edward killing Kim's ex boyfriend, Jim. Vincent Price is the inventor who doesn't finish Edward before he dies in one of his last roles before his death from lung cancer. The director, Tim Burton who is well known for his odd main character that the audience loves anyway, Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, both played by Johnny Depp, in fact Burton used Depp again in Sleepy Hollow. All of which are great movies but never made it big at the box office, the only Depp film that has is Pirates of the Caribbean but none of his films are bad he is in Platoon, Nightmare of Elm Street, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleppy Hollow, From Hell, Ninth Gate etc all which have cult following."

The unique aspects of contrast between the bright town and its residents and the dark castle like place where Edward is created is wonderful.

I believe it near impossible not to feel for Edward when he states lines such as ""I'm not finished.""

The sort of film that will not be forgotten easily, however old its still a timeless fantasy story with irresitable characters.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives a perfect portrayel of Edward, his emotion is spot on as his lines are barely there. Winona Ryder gives a beautiful performance as the suspicious and freaked out Kym who slowly falls in love with Edward.<br/><br/>The film is depressing yet oh-so-appealing and impossible to turn off. The ending will reduce you to tears and the music is hopelessly romantic and sad.<br/><br/>One of the few films that is etched in my mind. 9.5/10"
"pariskitty0808","Null","1","2","19 June 2004"," short thoughts, and some cute scenes!
","Okay, first here is my collection of short thoughts of this movie.<br/><br/>I thought it was so unique how they gave Edward scissors instead of human hands. I also thought it was lovely how Edward was so quiet, but he didn't need to talk to share his thoughts. He was a quiet guy, but had many facial expressions and SOMETIMES he said a sentence or two. But that was rare.<br/><br/>Cute scenes time!<br/><br/>Cute scene # 1: When Kim says ""I Love You"" to Edward and they hug! It was sooo cute! (Kim was the teenage girl's name, right? I dunno.) Cute scene # 2: When that lady was trying to make out with him in that store place, he got freaked out and ran away. The lady chased after him and she was like, 'EDWARD?!?! Come back this instant!' That was classic. Cute scene # 3: When Kim came home and started to get undressed in her bedroom, she saw that Edward is laying there and starts screaming! But then it's cute because later in the movie Edward develops a crush on her. Cute scene # 4: When Edward gives haircuts!! I want a haircut from Edward!<br/><br/>So that's my review, any questions?"
"s0304464","Null","1","2","7 May 2004"," Hard as rock, sharp as scissors, soft as paper - 'Edward Scissorhands'
","Being director Tim Burton's picture 'edward Scissorhands' combines a sense of dreamy storytelling with great special effects.  The film tells the story of edward, a young, mysterious man with a different appearance but a kind human heart.<br/><br/>Edward lives alone in the town's notorious 'house on top of the hill' until the day an Avon lady calls and takes him home to live with her in their town...unfortunately not realising the potential consequences.<br/><br/>As always the director (Sleepy Hollow, Beetlejuice, Batman) works visual magic and with a top screenplay by Caroline Thompson the film captivates with a slight twist on good and evil.  With spectacular sets, Tim Burton, uses a fantastic, surreal mixture of dark, haunting sets and bright planned 60's streets.  These sets are stunningly visual and vibrant colours play off each other and contrast to edward's dark yet beautiful home)<br/><br/>Starring a then trapped TV drama heart-throb, Johnny Depp (edward) gives a performance of a lifetime without really having to speak.  His heart-warming performance enables you to sympathise with this character and his habits, such as extravagant topiary and makes you also sympathise with how difficult people are to get on with in life.  Johnny Depp is among a fine cast including Winona Ryder, Diane Wiest and Vincent Price as the inventor.<br/><br/>The other characters, mainly the family and the neighbours start to annoy you with their precise lives but soon it becomes apparent that this is the danger for the harmless edward.  As in a lot of Tim Burton films the characters are obviously greatly worked into and can sometimes seem a derivate on stereotypes or to the extreme.  Whatever your view, this works in 'edward Scissorhands' and adds to the tragedy that affects anyone who isn't 'normal'.<br/><br/>Some people may find the start a little slow but that does not hinder the fascination throughout the film and I find this also shows the quick descent into sad chaos as the characters begin to realise the consequences of trying to change things. `Sometimes you just can't change things.' The film doesn't really have a set time period because with love it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The story is original and gently funny, with a slight touch of danger. This film, to me, also represents the narrow mindedness of our societies and touches upon the notion of racism and discrimination and the sad consequences of the extremes of this.  It is shown through the family's neighbour's reception to edward.  Above all though the film is about true love and works under the children's question 'where does snow come from?' - The film answers the question, you will have to see it to find out.<br/><br/>For me 'edward Scissorhands' is the best visual journey ever told.  With make-up from Stan Winston and music by Danny Elfman, the whole film takes you into a spectacular surreal world.  'edward Scissorhands' is an incredible love story, visually a treat and one that will remain in your heart forever.<br/><br/>Star rating - five out of five"

","I loved this film when I was 11; now I'm 22, I've just bought the DVD and fallen in love with it all over again. In some ways, Edward Scissorhands is an update of the Frankenstein story: an artificial being, created by a mad old scientist, and his attempts to fit into the human world. But there's more to it than that. The actors all give fantastic performances, for example, Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Alan Arkin, and of course, Vincent Price. Tim Burton's amazing aesthetic vision is fully realised here in the contrast between the colourful, sanitised, plastic town, and the monochrome, industrial world of Edward and his creator. It's one of the few films that genuinely manages to be funny and sad in turn, without getting TOO sentimental. Finally, Danny Elfman's haunting music completes the sense of wonder that this film produces. Very highly recommended."
"LebowskiT1000","7","1","2","14 December 2002"," Truly bizarre film, but good.
","The writers of this film, Tim Burton and Caroline Thompson, have quite a strange imagination.  But, I guess strange imaginations usually yield the best films.  This film is not a masterpiece in my opinion, but it was very fun to watch and had a lot of good stuff in it.  The story is nothing but bizarre from start to finish.  There are a few things in the film that aren't really explained to you, so I guess you just have to fill in the gaps with your own explanations.  For instance, I was unsure if Edward was a human put together from other human parts (like Frankenstein) or if he was a machine/android.  There were other aspects, like this, that weren't really explained, but that didn't hinder my enjoying of the film.<br/><br/>The cast was very good.  I could not believe that Edward was played by Johnny Depp.  They did a fantastic job with his make-up, his wardrobe, and of course the scissorhands.  Johnny was fantastic as Edward.  Winona Ryder was great as well, she looks very different as a blonde, but I'm not complaining, she looked great!  Dianne Wiest was also great in the film. Anthony Michael Hall was quite a surprise to see in the film, and plays quite a different role than his well known 1980's films (""The Breakfast Club"", ""Sixteen Candles"", ""Weird Science"").  He really pulled off the role rather well.  Alan Arkin was a perfect choice for Kim's (Winona Ryder) father.  I have always liked his acting, and he didn't let me down in this film.  Another notable cast-member is The Inventor, played by Vincent Price. I don't know much about him other than I know he is well known for his roles in horror films.  He was a perfect choice for the role of the inventor in this film, and did a great job.  The rest of the cast was very good as well.<br/><br/>The music in this film, composed by Danny Elfman (as you can expect from a Tim Burton film) was excellent.  Elfman's work is quite funny to me because you can tell immediately that it is his work.  His music is so distinctive. I couldn't help but think of the first ""Batman"" film when I heard the score in this film.  I really liked the score quite a bit and if you like Elfman's other work, then you'll more than likely like his score in this film as well.<br/><br/>Like I said above, I wouldn't call this film a masterpiece, but it was definitely worth my time to watch it.  The film really is quite interesting, fun to watch, and quite touching at times.  This film has a lot to say about human nature and accepting outsiders and what not.  I'm not usually one for ""deeper meanings"", but at least that's what I got from the film.  I'm not really sure that I would recommend this film to everyone, but if you like Tim Burton's other work or are just a fan of Johnny Depp or Winona Ryder, then go ahead and give it a chance.  I hope that you enjoy the film, thanks for reading.<br/><br/>-Chris"
"Cheetah-6","10","1","2","17 August 2002"," This is As Close As It Gets To Perfection!
","This is the most original take on the Frankenstein theme that I know of and for me is Tim Burton's Masterpiece. This is one of those rare films where everything comes together and works on all levels.  Everyone of the characters from Edward, the Avon lady and her family down to the neighborhood busybodies and eccentrics are played to perfection and the essence of suburban America is captured in a comical, surreal , yet accurate way. Edward's outward appearance is a masterpiece in itself. The way his dark, bizarre, freakish, yet innocent look contrasts with the pristine, pastel conformity of the homogenized world he finds himself in. Alan Arkin is at the top of his form with that low eyed, deadpan style of his as the well meaning but oblivious head of the household. This film has that very effective trademark visual and sound quality of Burton's and it really works on an emotional level as well which is what usually is lacking in his other efforts. We really begin to care for Edward the oddity with a heart of gold who's inner beauty is at odds with his outward appearance. His gentle trusting heart and  innocence that make him so appealing ends up being what gets him in trouble with the world at large and then of course his uniqueness becomes their source of resentment and rejection of him.  This speaks to that phenomenon in life where the masses are at first fascinated by someone new and different with an interesting talent and then equally relishing their downfall and demise if they should somehow trip up along the way. The media in particular loves to exploit these two phases of well known figures lives but why wouldn't they when it sells so big? The real beauty here is how Edward reaches the teenage daughter Kim and teachers her about true friendship and caring. In the end, when he has been banished from the world he still carries on in his separate reality creating a secret life of beauty and adhering to his gentle ways. He seems to evoke a higher level of understanding. Hence his home is located high above the neighborhood below where he watches over their existence. This modern Fairy Tale became an instant classic and is among the best from any era. Underneath the folly of the this story, allot is being said about human nature and the motivations behind peoples actions. It's what makes it a great story, it can be enjoyed as just a quirky, amusing tale or something much deeper."

","Edward Scissorhands was a beautiful masterpiece.  Never has one felt so connected to Johnny Depp.  His character was very charismatic, and the film was very warm and gave me a sense of security and well-being.<br/><br/>But that's enough about Johnny. The true star of this film was Conchata Ferrell by far. Her role as Helen was brilliantly portrayed and ever so realistic. Of course my theory is that Teen Angel is really the high point of her career.  I believe that an actress like Conchata is definitely more suited to roles like Pam on Teen Angel, but before that, this was truly a magnificent early role for her.<br/><br/>By the end of this film, I felt more in touch with myself and my feelings for others.  I learnt to understand that cruelty to people is terrible and that when one is shunned by society as I myself am, it helps to see films like this and realise that these movie producers care about more than profits.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands was, after American Beauty, the best film I have ever seen in my life.  Good work Tim and keep making more films like this one!<br/><br/>A 10 out of 10 for this one!!"

The birds eye view at the beginning was very noticeably a mini model set, the make-up was noticeably make up instead of ""real"" looking, the dialog was on the nose (but not over the top, making it now work. It worked in ""The Truman Show"", but here, it failed), and the entire story- line, although timeless, didn't bring out the TRUE mood and spirit of snow. Unlike what Cameron does with classic tales and what Burton usually does nowadays to tales, I felt NO new eye to this tale at all. I felt that on the contrary it was turned on its head when brought forward. <br/><br/>Can someone please share with me something I'm missing, and don't bring up the ""It was meant to be fake"" card, because if ""The Truman Show"" can be purposely fake AND brilliant in doing so, I'm sure Burton could have too. <br/><br/>Hope I'm not angering anyone.

","I am extatic about this movie. I remember watching it the first time and feeling sick by the end of it, realizing that our society is really a farcical world. Johnny Depp, although VERY young, portrays the emotion of a character so well, I sometimes forget it is Johnny Depp playing the part. The busy bodies of the neighbourhood talk so much but say so little, while Edward hardly speaks, yet says so much more. I could go on for ever. Tim Burton and Danny Elfman really make this movie their own. The music is incredible, and perfect for the mood and tone, and Tim Burton, my favorite director of all time, pulls out all the stops once again and wows the audience with his imagination, his cleverness and his ability to make you see reality. This movie is a total must-see and a perfect 10!"

"zkonedog","6","1","3","11 March 2017"," Strange...But With Heart
","The best thing that ""Edward Scissorhands"" has going for it is that it was directed by Tim Burton, perhaps the only man who could make this story move us. Unfortunately, Burton is also this film's biggest downfall by intermixing his cinematic and stereotype gobbledegook into the overall plot.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film sees a boy named Edward (Johnny Depp), who has scissors instead of normal hands, brought down from his lonely, deserted castle to live in suburbia. After all the appropriate hijinks such a situation perpetuates, Edward falls in love with his new family's daughter Kim (played by Winona Ryder), which only further complicates matters.<br/><br/>The reason this isn't an ""instant classic"" despite the never-before-seen concept and compelling visuals? For almost three quarters of the movie, director Burton (as is his style) mishmashes all sorts of stereotypical human themes and doesn't make sense of any of them. It is all just a jumble & mess. It's kind of like ""Being John Malkovich"", in a sense, where the concepts and visuals are the movie, not the actual plot itself.<br/><br/>How can I enjoy this movie, then? Because, in the end, it truly is about love and having a big heart. For me, when everything else falls aside and the focus is squarely on Edward & Kim is where this film will move you. Ryder is able to perfectly capture the essence of youthful beauty, while Edward is a character for whom sympathy is a must. Their moments on screen together (combined with a wonderful score from Danny Elfman) are spectacular and worth the viewing time alone.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a decent film that will always be remember for its unique concept and title character. Don't try to understand all its message, but instead focus on the human elements: love, family, & hope. If you can do that, you will care about what happens in the end."
"TheFunkyBass","7","1","3","13 May 2015"," Just another overrated Burton movie.
","First of all, let me remember that this is the person who directed Planet of the Apes.<br/><br/>This is the first collaborations between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton and the start of a long friendship. The intro was very cinematic, but the rest of the movie sadly wasn't.<br/><br/>The movie really didn't have a story, it just went on to show how Ed works around a new environment. It has a good but overused moral: Everyone has a special gift, every ""disability"" becomes an advantage and bla bla bla... we've seen that many times.<br/><br/>I hated the fact that everyone in town was a douchebag except for the family that adopted Ed. The town made the family look like saints. It was really unrealistic. Like where did he get the giant ice blocks? But the stupidest part of the movie was that the cop in his car couldn't catch Edward running.<br/><br/>It started out good, but it ended in clichÃ©s."
"The-Sarkologist","10","1","3","29 October 2011"," A modern Gothic fairy tale of the American Suburbia
","I just love this movie. The critics didn't but I think they really missed the point. When your society is being subtly attacked the way the Tim Burton does it in Edward Scissorhands then you do not want to see it. Visually the movie is absolutely fantastic. The set designs are superb and really draw you into the movie itself. Even though they are so dazzling, it does to subtract from the tragedy of the story. As I have said before, Tim Burton is a masterful storyteller, and not only that, he is able to interweave social criticism into his films as well.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is set in a timeless world where nothing ever changes. In this world lives a woman Kim (Winona Wyder) who is telling a story to her grand daughter about why it snows. The story takes us back to when she was young and her mother brought home a strange man who lived in a house on top of a hill. She does not enter the movie until a little way in when she comes home from a weekend camping trip late at night unknowing that there is a new guest in the house. Her first impressions are of horror because the guest, Edward Scissorhands (Johnny Depp) has scissors instead of hands.<br/><br/>Edward is not a real human but rather the creation of an inventor (Vincent Price). One day he thought of giving life to a cutting machine and thus he turned it into Edward. Unfortunately he died before he could give him hands, so Edward was born, and cannot die, and was left all alone. Unfortunately I cannot describe the intensity of emotions that the movie draws out (even though the brain dead American critics do not understand it) so I will try and explain some of this ideas.<br/><br/>This movie is a love story, but it isn't a typical crappy love story where everything turns out well in the end. It is a tragic love story where those who are in love just cannot express it nor can they get together. Kim is trapped in an unforgiving society that either treats the unusual as a toy, or a deadly enemy. When Edward first comes everybody is using him, but when he is set up by Jim (Anthony Michael-Hall) people begin to change their mind about him. Edward doesn't change, nor has he any evil about him, but rather it is the people around him that make him evil. All Edward does is try to help people and to look after people, yet the prejudices of the society drive him away as a freak.<br/><br/>There is a religious freak in the film, and she hates Edward from the beginning. Edward is different and thus he must be from Satan. She curses him constantly and warns people against him. At first she is rejected because they don't care for her raving, but when they decide to turn against Edward, they use her as ammunition to destroy him.<br/><br/>Yet not all of the people in the society hate Edward. The policeman seeks not to kill him and even says that he is concerned about Edward. The police, which are usually seen as the brutal arm of a disliked government, stands to protect Edward from a mindless mob of people. Edward is quiet, meek, and very loving, yet only a few desire to see this side of him.<br/><br/>Kim is a very important character in the movie. She begins by hating Edward because he is different, but she slowly becomes to understand him, especially how Jim pushes her to love him. Soon she goes from being a blind schoolgirl to a young lady who sees the fantasy of life. The scene where she is dancing in the snow simply removes all semblance of reality, until Jim rudely steps in and destroys it. We are left to assume that Kim never took anybody after Edward left, and this assumption adds to the sadness of the story."
"gigan-92","9","1","3","25 May 2009"," One of Tim Burton's Best
","By far one of the best films by Tim Burton, besides my personal favorite the original ""Batman"". Where does one begin? Obviously, Johnny Depp! His performance is one of passion and clever simplicity. Portraying Edward as a modern incarnation of Frankenstein in a way, viewers can actually connect and come to love him. We worry about him just as much as we would any ordinary character. In fact, even more so.<br/><br/>Another remarkable aspect of the film is the very unique world Burton sets up. A mix of the suburban 50s and a sense of dark, Gothic almost, style imagery. It actually fits the film quite well, one reason why it's so easy to love. Plus the score by Danny Elfman is one of his best, perfectly matching any emotion the director wants to depict. Elfman never lets us down, that's for sure. All in all a very well made film put simply. Although Kim's boyfriend's dialogue is at times questionable, it didn't ruin my experience."

","Edward Scissorhands (1990) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the title character, a nice man who suffers from having scissors for hands. An Avon lady (Diane Wiest) finds him in an abandoned castle and brings him home where he fits in at first but as time goes on he finds it harder to blend in with the normal people. There are a few problems with the screenplay and there are a few logical problems but this is a fantasy so I try to put them out of my head and just sit back and enjoy this rather bizarre film. I think Burton gets across his message about human nature without beating the viewer over the head and in the end this is certainly one of the more memorable films of the decade. Depp is terrific in his role and really brings a lot of truth and sadness to his character. Winona Ryder (whatever happened to her?) is great as well in her role and I've always believed she was one of the best actresses out there in this time frame. The supporting cast of Wiest, Kathy Baker and Anthony Michael Hall also turn in fine work. I love the way Burton used Vincent Price in this film as it turned out to be a very loving tribute to the horror legend. The film is visually striking and the music score by Danny Elfman is terrific. The ending of the film is very touching as well."

Unfortunately, the inventor died before he had the chance to complete Edward, so he has scissors instead of hands. Many years after the dead of the inventor, Peg Boggs (a sweet local lady who lives in the area of Edward's castle) takes him home with her.At first, everybody is intrigued by Edward and they all want to join in on his popularity. From the moment he was wrongfully accused of burglary, the all reject him. Besides the Boggs'family, and more importantly the daughter Kim, they all turn their back to him. <br/><br/>Many things in this films could be considered as pure genius. For example the moral that true love comes from within. Edward is considered as a hideous creature by Kim at first. But she realizes that he's the only man that loves her the most. Edward Scissorhands also comments the life in small communities a lot. Gossiping woman meet on the corner, the people look into each others houses...This films really shows the hypocrisy of these people. The locations and decors are outstanding, to say the least. Edwards house and garden are perfect shots of beauty and macabre at the same time. Great work. And finally there are the acting performances. Johnny Depp does his best work under Tim Burton. The 3 film they made ( until now) are just perfect. Also, it's just impossible not to love Dianne Wiest in this film, she's the perfect cast in the role of the loving mother. So is the father played by Alan Arkin. And then there's Winona...Let me tell you, you haven't seen beauty until you see her dancing in the snow."

","Interpretation, Spoilers:<br/><br/>On the surface, this movie is a quaint suburban fairy tale; in actuality, it is laden with symbolic racist propaganda. <br/><br/>The fact that Edward is the only member of the scissorhands immediately gives him minority status. He lives in the run-down part of town which is basically taboo to visit - unless you're a desperate avon lady or a blood thirsty lynch mob. Saying the house is haunted is a euphemistic way of saying the ghetto is dangerous and not to be frequented. Likewise, the polarity between the unpleasant darkness of Edward and his abode with the unseemly brightness of both the town and town folk is further illustrated by Edward's dark attire - completely black from head to toe. Edward's skin is not black because that would be too honest for Mr. Burton. Instead, Ed's inferiority is hinted at in that his skin is seen as unpresentable and in need of drastic cosmetic refurbishment. Also, Ed is shown to be mentally unstable and manipulatable and even assumed to be a master criminal. In the end, Kim tells Ed that she loves him, but conveniently refuses to visit him for the remainder of her life although he lives just down the street: it is not acceptable for her to associate with the subspecies scissorhands. A modern lynch mod drives Edward out of town and back into his isolated, decrepit pit. Symbolically, they have ""shown him his place."" Understanding this, Ed remains alone for the rest of his days; but, we are visually assured, he is happy with his sculptures. Conclusion: not only is segregation desired, those oppressed by it also desire it. And, racial mixing is never to be tolerated.   <br/><br/>However, and hopefully, this film could be interpretated as an anti-racism satire. Prejudice of Edward was overcome twice in the film. Those who met him were able to see past his unique body (his handicap!) and one other person stood up for him: unsurprisingly, the police officer - the only truly black character in the film. Thus, there is hope of transcending racial stereotyping, but the end-of-the-film renunciation by both Kim and Edward seem to tell against this more politically correct interpretation.<br/><br/>
Either way, this movie is watchable if simply to help demonstrate our still backwards racial morality."

","Edward Scissorhands is one of those I'll never see what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>Frankly, you can't hide a tired plot with a bizarre style. Burton has an eye for imagery here but is not so successful in creating a satisfying story. The film manages to introduce a fairly interesting character, Edward (Johnny Depp), a young man invented by a crazy scientist who dies before he can give Ed real hands. The set up is wasted on a very by-the-numbers plot and opportunity was greatly missed in creating something truly profound. Instead, the film relies on a ridiculous but at the same time, blindingly obvious love story involving the teenage girl Kim (Winona Ryder) and her a-hole boyfriend who shuns him. Edward manages to find kind of a living for himself when he his brought into this strange suburban neighbourhood, giving the residents bushes, hair and dogs a trim with his scissor hands. However, one must wonder why he never accepts the number of offers of medical help, and its never explained. The ostracising continues until the very contrived ending in which someone dies, a complete and utter cop-out but amazingly, nobody seems to mind too much. Its also way out of tone with the rest of the film. Then Elfman's score oohs and ahhs to remind us that what we're watching is mysterious and haunting when in fact, it's just weird. It all amounts to general annoyance, despite it being visually stunning.<br/><br/>This is one I can really only recommend to Tim Burton fans, which is rather redundant considering that they've probably seen it already."

","Edward Scissorhands, directed by Tim Burton (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Planet of the Apes), is a movie with one very strong message. Throughout the movie it is shown that in most places there is not much room for acceptance. Tim Burton wrote in a passage after making this movie that the strongest impulse for the film was to show that from day one people categorise you. I believe that Tim Burton demonstrated this message very well in the movie. However, as much as I agree with the message in the movie, overall I didn't like the actual movie at all. For me in some places it was too dark and for a family movie the strong themes and messages in it could be confusing for children. I believe that maybe it could have been advertised to an older audience, rather than families. I also found this movie to be boring at some points, but that is only my opinion. Nevertheless you cannot deny that the acting in this movie is not to be commended for. Johnny Depp who plays Edward in the movie did a fine job at portraying his character, as did Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall and all of the other actors and actresses in this movie. Overall I would give this movie three stars, but only because of the creative way the message was expressed and the quality of the actors."

","Despite some people's comments, i feel that this film is one of the best ever made. It is a beautiful story, a modern fairytale, and definitely Burton's greatest work, if not Johnny Depp's. The cinematography is beautiful, the score is so haunting and Depp's performance as Edward absolutely melts my heart. I love how Burton can make even Suburbia seem sinister! He is a fabulous director and this just shows how good he can be. The story of the outsider looking in has been done a thousand times, it's true, but this film stands out as the best of these. I feel it also makes a statement about the close-mindedness of secular communities, unable to deal with a simple complication or development. It stuns me every time i watch it, and makes me fall back in love with the whole film. The fantasy genre has always been my favourite, and this film, is one of the best.Surely no-one with a heart can fail to be touched by the sheer chastity and innocence of such an incredible film.

"bankofmarquis","8","0","1","23 April 2020"," Has more heart than later Burton/Depp collaborations
","There have been many actor/director long term collaborations through the years - John Ford/John Wayne, Martin Scorcese/Robert DeNiro and Alfred Hitchock/Jimmy Stewart all come to mind. Another interesting collaboration is the unique one between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The films these 2 have made have shown an ""outsider"" being introduced into an environment - usually in a quirky and gothic dark manner. So it was interesting to go back to the film that started it all - 1990's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, this film works because of the lack of weight of previous Burton/Depp collaborations.<br/><br/>Let me explain...<br/><br/>If you were to hear today that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were to collaborate on a film, what expectations would you have? Quirky, dark and gothic comes to mind. With EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, none of these expectations were in place. You can see the purity in the beginning of this collaboration with these 2 artists finding there footing together in a film that is...yes...quirky, dark and gothic.<br/><br/>It is also, unexpectedly, light, airy, funny and poignant - traits that I think get lost in later Burton/Depp collaborations....collaborations where the focus seemed to be on the design and look and less on the emotion.<br/><br/>Set in a timeless, stylized world that is part '50's, part '60's, part 80's and part ""everything else"", EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is Burton's loose retelling of the Frankenstein story, where an isolated inventor (in this case Vincent Price) creates life (Depp)...with scissors for hands (you'll have to see the film to see why). When a local resident (and door to door cosmetic saleslady) discovers Edward living alone, she invites him into her house - and into the lives of the the neighborhood that exists below.<br/><br/>Depp owns this character - and owns it well. He brings an innocence and integrity to this character that rides a fine line well. His character is naive - but not simpleminded. He is longing to please - and to be loved - but has his own mind. In Depp's performance, you see an actor coming into his own.<br/><br/>He is joined - wonderfully - by Diane Wiest as the lady that invites him into her home. Winona Ryder (who turned down Godfather 3 to appear in this film) as Wiest's daughter (and object of Edward's affections) and the great Alan Arkin as the patriarch of the family who is a fun stereo-type of the Suburban dad.<br/><br/>All of this is packaged - uniquely - by Burton with an ""8 crayon"" color palate that exaggerates the various styles of the time. It is an expert job of combining styles into a unique vision that works very, very well.<br/><br/>I also have to give Burton credit for casting the iconic horror movie veteran Vincent Price (in his last film role) as the inventor of Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>I was taken under the spell of this film - and not just because of the interesting visuals - it has a heart and soul (because of Depp's work) that, I think both Depp and Burton lose in some of their later collaborations.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film in awhile - check it out - I think you'll like it.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

It goes without saying that this is an iconic film not just in the genres of romance or fantasy but of filmmaking in general. Much like Beetlejuice beforehand, nothing has managed to capture the magic and the feeling of isolation more than this. Edward is a beautiful character; you feel such sympathy towards him and is one of the most relatable protagonists in film history. Tim has mentioned before that Edward represents how he felt as a teenager; wanting to fit in but being unfairly categorised. The desire to touch but inability to do so in fear or destroying something. It's a really powerful metaphor and through his perfect direction and Depp's incredible performance this symbolism completely hits home. The make up and costume department absolutely excel in creating the look of the characters, particularly Ed with his scarred visage resembling years of troubled attempts at self-care. West is fantastic as Peg; such a lovely human being and a career-defining role. Winona Ryder plays Kim; the girl who captures Edward's heart and his fascination with her is gorgeously told with delicate camera close ups. As well as being romantic and sweet, it's also tinged with genuine threat from outside influences making for the more sinister edge of the film and is also really funny with great supporting roles from Alan Arkin adding to it; Ed's first time drinking is a classic comedy moment. I could go on but you already know how great it is surely! A film for anytime of the year, especially the winter months and a brilliant, star-making performance for Depp"
"anastasiia_shystovska","10","0","1","31 March 2020"," Edward Scissorhands: Movie review
","'Edward Scissorhands' (1990) is a beautiful romantic, fantasy movie. The director, Tim Burton, paid close attention to the atmosphere of the movie, which makes it even more fascinating. Before this movie, his works included Beetlejuice (1988) and Batman (1989). The production of 'Edward Scissorhands' began with a budget of $20 million. The stars are Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, who perfectly suited their roles. Caroline Thompson worked on the script. She later went on to work as a screenwriter on ""The Addams Family"" (1991) and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (1993).<br/><br/>Edward was created by an inventor who before his death, had given him nearly everything a human body has, apart from hands. Instead of hands, Edward has scissors. He lived in the inventor's gothic house till Peg Boggs finds him once and brings him to her house and family. Since then, the lives of Edward, Peg's family and the whole city started to change.<br/><br/>'Edward Scissorhands' was a critically acclaimed movie, which may be as popular with the young audience as it is with older moviegoers. I guess everyone could find something special in this movie. Also, I'd like to mention the soundtrack, which was written by Danny Elfmann. It brilliantly underlines the beauty of this movie. This movie is not only a sensitive romantic story, but also a big question about how people sometimes hold prejudices that could easily harm someone else around them.<br/><br/>Written by Anastasiia Shystovska"

Edward trims the manor for others, cuts incredible hairstyles for others, he does n't collect money, and he never does anything for it, he just likes it, he just wants to do it, using his scissors, It seems like this should be his born mission.
Lively parties, waiting in line, he thought he just made everyone happy, everyone was satisfied, and everyone accepted himself.

","Tim Burton here cleverly gives us a modern fairytale with a twist combining the dark with the light in this conflation of the classic Frankenstein and Pinocchio tales taking some barbed shots at mid-60's American suburbia along the way.<br/><br/>Framed within the timeless ""Once Upon A Time"" and ""They lived (un)happily ever after"" narrative is a beautifully realised story of the strange boy who came to stay, in this case Johnny Depp's title character, who up until now appears to have lived unnoticed by everyone with his scientist creator Vincent Price in their unobtrusive (!) castle abode just out of town. For some reason having given his creation sets of scissors (as opposed to say a hook or stump) for hands until the real things are ready, Price unfortunately for both expires just as he's about to replace them for Edward.<br/><br/>And so it is, that after a quiet day touting for doorstep business, persevering Avon lady Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) espies the castle and decides to try her luck there, where she encounters Edward and with her gormless husband Alan Arkin, promptly adopts the young Goth with blades for digits. It's not long however before Edward's growing local celebrity, especially once he displays his wonderful topiary skills, brings him all sorts of unwelcome attention, particularly from Kathy Baker's sex-starved neighbour (surely a prototype for Peg in the classic 90's sit-com ""Married With Children"") and the jealous lunkhead, beefcake boyfriend of the Boggs' pretty cheerleader-type daughter played by Wynona Ryder.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly Burton duly brings the rain with a less than happy ending for the three youngsters in the love triangle but not before he's poked some fun at small-town Americana with its under-the-surface jealousies, bible-bashing proclivities, underlying prejudice and sexual repressiveness all exposed to view, with a nice satire of daytime TV thrown in too.<br/><br/>The film is a visual delight with Burton mixing heavy gloom Gothic with day-glo sunshine. Depp is excellent in another of the notable misfit roles he regularly seemed to play at this early stage of his career, Ryder is fine as the love interest, Wiest, Arkin and particularly Baker as the tolerated town trollop are very good in their grown-up parts and I particularly appreciated the aged Price's cameo as the for-once not so evil inventor.<br/><br/>Sort of like the kind of film Frank Capra might have directed after waking up with a nightmare after watching ""The Wizard Of Oz"" the night before, Burton has created an enduring holiday classic and an early highlight in his long career."

","Admittedly, I dislike Tim Burton. Sometimes, I really hate Tim Burton. I don't mean the director---I mean, the actual person. Tim Burton is just so, ""Ooh! Look At Me! I'm Different Than Everyone! No One Understands Me! I Was Bullied As A Kid!"". I feel like some of his ""torment"" was self inflicted in a way. There's nothing special about Tim Burton's origin story. What makes Tim Burton special is the amount of pity he gave himself and the inflated ego it gave him. What's this assessment have to do with the movie, Edward Scissorhands? Well, it doesn't take a genius to know who the title character is based on...<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is a dark and gothic fairy tale that makes little sense; has very unlikable or uninteresting characters and will only be liked by Tim Burton and every Emo kid that gets off to cutting to the image of Tim Burton. We start off with a grandma telling some kid about Edward Scissorhands. Edward lives in a dark, creepy castle, on a dark, creepy hill above a little, happy, light filled town. No one seems to notice this until a woman decides to sell makeup one day. Vincent Price plays his father (inventor) who dies before finishing him. That is to say, he gave him scissors for hands instead of regular hands. This is funny to me, since, in the movie, the inventor actually has a plan for this, and human like hands are on it, as like the 8th step. Okay, what the hell?! ""First, I shall put scissors for the hands! Then I will go get latex mold! Then I will make a pair of hands from said mold! Then I shall call my best friend Tim! Then I will watch Beetlejuice! Then I shall sharpen the boy's scissors! Then I will remove the scissors! Finally, I shall install the hands!"". WHY THE HELL WERE THE SCISSORS EVEN NEEDED?!! So then Edward goes to live with the makeup lady and her family. No one questions or is freaked out about this guy dressed in bondage with scissor hands. Well, they are and they aren't. They're not really concerned for the right reasons, I should say. They kinda just wanna know if the makeup lady is doing him. Edward can cut things like grass, shrubs and hair and that makes him valuable! No one has ever thought to do these things before! If it wasn't for Edward, people might have never cut their own grass or hair! Also, the daughter, who's known him for 5 minutes is now in love with him...for...reasons?! I mean, they haven't had any connected in any way; they haven't had a deep conversation; they know nothing of eachother but they're in love, I guess. Tim Burton does not know how life works. So now the boyfriend is mad and wants to kill Edward for getting his girlfriend all hot and bothered. The town people want Edward out of town now because they heard an unconfirmed rumor. Grass and hair be damned! So Edward runs home to his spooky castle, impales the evil jock boyfriend (admittedly, he did suck but he was also so unlikable and boring and miscast that you don't care) and never returns. Twist: Grandma was the daughter all along in horrible old person makeup!<br/><br/>Tim Burton seems to think everyone who is not Tim Burton is the same. We're all bullies. We're all jocks. We're all mean. If you aren't pale, lonely or like the color black, you must be a bad, stupid or lesser person. If you don't live on a spooky mountain, in a spookier castle, well, guess what? You suck! You don't understand the pain of having pain! I like some of Tim Burton's work, like Big Fish and even the Batman films (though flawed). I like his movies where he leaves his ego and 10 year old self at home. Edward Scissorhands is a love story to himself, and for himself. Unless you're a hardcore fan of Tim Burton's work, you won't enjoy this film..."

","The story line is predictable but extremely well executed in the niche of Tim Burton. The acting by Johnny Depp is outstanding. There was an uneasy feel about the whole film as you could tell it was leading towards a much darker path. There was not so subtle foreshadowing with the unlocking of the door. And the idea of the snowing was a little far fetched but so was the idea of scissors for hands.
The makeup (such as on Winona at the beginning) is quite dated compared to the make up today and background art (such as the clouds in the beginning) have obviously been drawn on compared to CGI today (28 years as of this review) But these are the days when the special effects (such as the scissors for hands) were plentiful but now are much more of a limited art form. It is lovely to see. And the haircuts are so frozen in time in which now it has become a landmark in film making history just for these points.
Overall, a great film which makes a change to the same pumped sequels by many bigger companies nowadays. And is just different enough to the genre to be unique. And I believe it has lasted the harshness of time that not many other films have done."

","This was one I had a lot of love for as a kid and it always stayed with me. Upon revisiting it I was delighted to see that a lot of the magic still is there. It really is the movie that gets the essence of Burton and his themes of an isolated dreamer. The movie still looks phenomenal and it isn't just the perfect set design. It should be studied as a example of using color and contrast to jarringly create a weird world. I remembered a lot of the scenes in the haunted mansion and laboratory but I forgot how delightful it was when the weird goth Edward was brought into the overwhelming loud suburbia with the houses and shopping centers of bright shades of pink.<br/><br/>It is Burton creating an allegory for himself and his lack of subtlety has always sort of been a challenge for him in developing a narrative and characters to match the artistic vision. When viewed as a sort of autobiographical fairy tale it sort of comes off as self-indulgent at it's worst moments. There are too many moments of Edward being misunderstood as a monster. The bible thumping neighbor is way too much.<br/><br/>But you sort of have to forgive it because like I said that loudness has always been Burton's storytelling achillies. As a visual fairy tale 'Edward Scissorhands' is a masterpiece. The music and look of the film alone would have done that without any dialogue."

","I hadn't purposely made the decision to neglect the works of Tim Burton, yet I found myself in 2017, despite being a huge cinema fan, without ever seeing a Tim Burton feature before in my life. It was time to rectify this oversight and settle in for Edward Scissorhands. The 1990 film starring Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder exploring the life of an abandoned invention turned man left alone when his inventor passes away before he is finished. Burton had a lot to say in Edward Scissorhands, very obviously, criticizing suburban culture and the social constructs of what constitutes as ""normal"". His message is clear and nearly overtakes the narrative coming off as an after-school special. Nevertheless, it was time to finally ""meet"" Tim Burton.<br/><br/>On the edge of the most picturesque suburban town, there is a castle that no one visits, and the neighbors know nothing about. Inside the castle, there lived an inventor (Vincent Price) responsible for elaborate designs taking over the entire castle. His most prized invention is that of Edward (Johnny Depp). He built a man, called Edward, a person made from parts, complete except for that of his hands. His hands were left as scissors before the inventor passed away. Since his inventor's passing, he lived alone in the castle secluded from the world and left to fend for himself. Trying to see Avon products, a kind neighbor named Peg (Dianne Wiest) happened upon the castle, finding Edward. At first, Peg is frightened by Edward and his scissor hands, but she eventually understands that he is a gentle soul yearning for some human interaction. Peg decides that she can't bear to leave Edward behind, so she invites him into her family's home. Initially, her family and neighbors are taken aback at the sight of the pale, scarred, man with scissors for hands. Eventually, though, Peg's friends and family come around, and once they get to know Edward, they realize he is sweet and unique and has talents appreciated by all. After such acceptance, however, things start to go wrong and the easiest person to blame is the different outsider.<br/><br/>Tim Burton obviously hates suburbia, the entirety of Edward Scissorhands is his diatribe of all the problems of suburbia. He was so overt with his message that suburbia traps people, keeping them confined and limited. Burton also clearly illustrates how much being different is looked down upon, to an almost nauseating intensity. The camera angles Burton chose to use, while they were effective in creating the claustrophobic atmosphere he was going for, were uncomfortable to watch. The ratio created with the camera work he chose seemed too manipulative to appreciate. Johnny Depp was overkill with his expressions, taking one out of the film by being so distracting. The standout was the score/sound design, in an otherwise after-school special-like film far too overt with its message and seeming to make color/camera angle decisions for the director's own pleasure rather than for the audience."

","Edward (Johnny Depp) lives a lonely existence and is isolated in a house set away from the rest of the community. Edward is an outcast because he has had to live his life with scissors for hands after his inventor died before he can finish his creator. Edward is taken in and cared for by a kind woman and falls for her pretty daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). However, things prove tough for Edward as he has to try and deal with disapproving neighbours and Kim's rather aggressive boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall).<br/><br/>Burton's primary objective here was to tell the story of a man who may be a bit scary and weird on the outside, but ultimately show that underneath his rather scary exterior is a man who is kind and gentle. Yes it's a little clichéd and mushy perhaps, but I think it's something that writers can get away with if a film has a certain charm and warmth to it and that's where a film like Edward Scissorhands really succeeds.<br/><br/>Another interesting facet with this film is that it acts as a satire/social commentary on suburban life; I must admit that I found it amusing to watch these shallow and dull 'suburban housewives' all chatting on the phone about Edward's arrival and to here them gossiping about their neighbours and so on. It's a spot on critique about modern suburban life that was both clever and funny.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is awash with beautiful colours and wonderful cinematography; not only does this film have oodles of charm and heart, but it's also quite pretty to look at as well (and it's not just the cinematography that's pretty - Winona Ryder scrubs up quite well too).<br/><br/>As far as performances go then this is Depp's film hands down; he captures both the innocence and naivety of Edward in such a way that it's almost impossible not to care about him as a character. Anthony Michael Hall was surprisingly effective in his role as a thug (I've only seen him play the geek before and must admit that I think he's better playing a geek than a thug, but he was still good here).<br/><br/>If I'm being critical then there are one or two weaknesses with this picture; firstly I felt that this film could have benefited from a little more character development (the suburban housewives were quite funny at first, but I do believe that they out stayed their welcome and towards the end they were becoming more annoying than funny). I felt that Burton could have perhaps developed Edward's character a bit more as I couldn't help but feel that he only scratched the surface with his original and impressive creation.<br/><br/>To be honest though when a film has this much charm, this much warmth and this much likability it's hard to really put it down. It's pretty to look at, it has a nice story and it contains some fine acting performances. It's a very difficult film not to like so just sit back and enjoy!!"

Many women would like to have a male homosexual as a friend.

","If you had to name the most famous director-actor collaborations working in Hollywood today, I would bet Johnny Depp and Tim Burton are among the first you would name. Edward Scissorhands was the first film they collaborated on and is probably considered by most to be their best. For me I think the film is a bit overrated. It wants us to believe that this is a man we should all feel sorry for, which we do, but it also tries to convince us that his wrongdoings aren't his fault. While I believe this 'man' deserves to be treated like a human, but I don't think mixing him with other humans and not thinking chaos would eventually happen was the right move.<br/><br/>Depp is great as the title role. In fact it's hard to believe anybody else really playing this role. For once he actually gave a tremendous amount of subtly to this strange role and he also gave it a lot of heart. But the problem is that I don't think the supporting characters were developed enough. Not only that, but I don't think any of them actually seem like people who would live in a real world. Perhaps that's the point. Winona Ryder's character has a far too sudden change of mind half way through the film, and her boyfriend is the most clichéd ex boyfriend ever. But I did enjoy watching Depp play this character. And I think his 'mother' had some really great scenes with him as well.<br/><br/>So the problem isn't so much the actual story but rather the execution. There are few Burton movies that I thoroughly enjoy so perhaps my problem is more so with him than the rest of the crew. His films tend to be split down the middle with audiences so I think this may be one that I have to sit on and re-watch for further appreciation.<br/><br/>+Depp's subtly emotional performance <br/><br/>+Dianne West <br/><br/>-clichéd characters<br/><br/>-Style over substance <br/><br/>6.0/10"

","I realise this movie is considered almost a classic by others, but after finally watching it I can honestly saw I'm terribly disappointed with the whole thing. First off, the acting is terrible, which is quite surprising considering there are so many famous faces in the cast list. <br/><br/>Another thing that was bad with this movie is the whole storyline in general! Why did the inventor give Edward scissors for hands if he was later planning on giving him REAL hands? Why exactly did Kim's boyfriend hate Edward so much? Edward wasn't stealing Kim away in the beginning, so it wasn't like he was a threat. Jim had absolutely no reason to hate Edward and act as psychotic as he did in the end. <br/><br/>The character Esmeralda serves NO purpose in this movie. You see her 3 times, vaguely hinting that Edward is evil, yet her accusations add absolutely nothing to the story. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, none of the characters show any personal development. As the watcher, I never saw what made Kim fall in love with Edward. Sure, breaking up with Jim was logical, but what was it about Edward that drew her in? She never even spoke to him.<br/><br/>One last thing that I found quite funny though was how apparently, in the logic of this film, snow comes from ice, and ice blocks just tend to magically appear in this place where no snow ever comes down, and where the temperature is seemingly not below freezing."

","Wonderfully creative story. I think the real inherent beauty in ""Edward Scissorhands"" comes from its ability to mesh the Frankenstein like elements of Edwards creation with the harsh realities of 20th century American suburbia; Edward's almost angelic innocence just can't survive in an environment where one small mistake is enough to ruin a reputation. Though his""mysteriousness"" is adored by the neighborhood at first, as soon as he is labeled as a threat the superficial attitudes toward him by the locals dissipates almost immediately (cleverly satirizing neighborhood relationships). It would be impossible to have a happy ending in this story while at the same time maintain its integrity as a semi-plausible modern fairy tale(all except his initial creation of course). Regardless, Edward tugs at our heartstrings for the character traits that define him: kindness, gentleness, innocence, loyalty, and his incredible imagination. He is thrust into a hostile world (disguised as a ""normal"" American neighborhood fully equipped with picket fences, synchronized 9-5 white collar jobs, and lots and lots of dogs), he is rejected by it, and his character comes out unscathed. He is truly a hero and possesses a certain charisma that is truly unique. Amazing character, compelling story, and great performances by all."

","Holiday movie watching is not a tradition to be taken lightly. Non-binding clothing must be donned, a hot drink must be within arm's reach, and a cozy blanket must be tucked up against one's chin to foil any possibility of draught. In a perfect world, a fire would sizzle and pop in the fireplace, and inclement weather would rage against the window panes.<br/><br/>And Johnny Depp would be on my couch. Or at least in my DVD player. ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990) is a heartwarming, quirky romantic comedy with a twist of fantasy. It's the story of an awkward, innocent misfit, and it's just the right choice for a wintery evening in.<br/><br/>My personal love affair with Johnny Depp began in 1990 when he played Edward Scissorhands. But I'm going to try to be objective in this review, really I am.<br/><br/>It begins as a kind of fairy tale, a grandmother tucking a child into bed while explaining the mysterious origins of snow. I would like to say the film is suitable for the whole family, but there is one seductress scene where the neighborhood hussy (Marge, delightfully played by Kathy Baker) tries to Mrs. Robinsonize young Edward in the back room of her beauty parlor, the innuendo of which would bump the film into the PG-13 category. (Hooray!) <br/><br/>Edward (Johnny Depp) is an awkward misfit boy, who has been created with scissory blades where his hands should be. He speaks only 169 words in the entire movie and looks at the world with wide wonder. He desperately wants to do the right thing; moving around gingerly so he doesn't stab or slash anything. By the time Edward punctures the water bed with an accidental poke, and then tries to fix the spouting water by covering it up with stuffed animals, he has won our hearts.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is regarded by many critics to be the crazy-haired director Tim Burton's finest film. No argument here. Burton calls it his favorite creation as well. It was his first project with the then 27-year-old Depp, the first of seven collaborations between the two.<br/><br/>The Burton/Depp relationship itself bears some discussion.<br/><br/>Why is there this unholy alliance between the disheveled, uncombed lunatic Tim Burton and the man-god Johnny Depp? What fuels this obsession of Johnny's to keep making Tim's movies? Johnny once said in an interview that he would do anything Tim Burton asked him to do. ANYTHING! (capitals mine) Yes, Johnny, we KNOW you love Tim but you don't have to say ""yes"" every time the man drinks too much tequila and has a weird movie idea.<br/><br/>I have a theory about why Tim and Johnny are joined at the artistic hip: People with gaps in their front teeth are magnetically drawn to other people with gaps in their front teeth. Hear me out, there's empirical data.<br/><br/>In orthodontic terms, this gap is called diastema, and I think the National Science Foundation needs to throw some serious research money at the diastema-to-love correlation. Tim Burton has it. Johnny has it. Johnny's life partner Vanessa Paradis has it - the exact same gap in her front teeth that Johnny has. Coincidence? My theory is that there is a glittery, invisible beam of attraction that emanates from the heart, comes up through the esophagus and is emitted out the gappy tunnel between the teeth. It then passes through the other person's gappy tunnel, and locks on to their heart, resulting in love. Or a movie deal.<br/><br/>But Burton and Depp aren't the only ones involved here.<br/><br/>If it is possible for me to love anyone in this film as much as I love Johnny Depp, it is Dianne Wiest. She superbly plays Peg, the Avon lady and the mom everyone wants to have. Her reaction upon first meeting the frightening looking Edward? ""What happened to your hands? Where are your parents? I think you need to just come home with me."" She adopts Edward and brings him home to live with her family. I want her to adopt me.<br/><br/>This was Vincent Price's final film. Price plays a small but poignant role as Edward's creator/father, living in the eerie, Gothic castle, and kindly tutoring Edward in all subjects including proper decorum when tea is served. Ironically, Price's death scene was to be the last scene he ever filmed before his own death, a fitting farewell to the Crown Prince of all things mysterious.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder plays Edward's love interest, Kim. Edward is instantly transfixed by her photograph, but the relationship never materializes. SPOILER ALERT: At the end of the film, Edward hears the words he has longed to hear from Kim: ""Hold me."" He tries, but cannot, because he is afraid of hurting her. But she maneuvers in past his blades and snuggles against his chest in what is possibly the sweetest embrace in all of cinematic history.<br/><br/>In real life, Johnny and Winona had a hotly fueled affair that was to end in a bad breakup and a tattoo revision. I think it's obvious why things didn't work out: Winona has good teeth.<br/><br/>** Special thanks to longtime friend Carlos Alcala, the ""Chick Flick Guy,"" for prodding me to finally write this and for including this on his wonderful romantic comedy Blog!"

","Edward Scissorhands was about a man made by a scientist. The scientist dies before he is able to give Edward (Johnny Depp) real hands instead of scissor hands. He is later picked up by Pegg (Diane Wiest) and brought into town to live with her and her family. Edward has a tough time adjusting to normal life, but ends up charming almost everyone. His love for Pegg's daughter, Kim (Wynona Ryder) does him in. Her jealous boyfriend, Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), makes Edward out to be a monster and finally banishes Edward back to his mansion to live in isolation.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie was about isolation. Once Edward's inventor died he did not understand it or know what to do because he was just brought into the world. So, there he was all alone in the dark and dreary mansion isolated from society until Pegg discovers him and brings him into her world. Edward is misunderstood by Pegg's neighbors and they further isolate him by keeping their distance at first and gossiping with one another when he first arrives in the neighborhood. Once everybody discovers he has a talent for sculpting and haircutting, he becomes popular in that little community. Edward gets pushed into the spotlight once everyone gets over their fear and become interested in his cutting abilities. This act again isolates him because he becomes ""special"". Edward just wants to fit in and be like everyone else instead of a showpiece. Once Jim starts to see that Edward has feelings for Kim, he becomes very jealous. He makes Edward out to be a thief. This also isolates Edward from his community because they all start to fear him again. They do not agree with what he is doing so they turn their backs on him. Edward then isolates himself for good by going back to the mansion at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Another film, Frankenstein, reminds me of Edward Scissorhands. Frankenstein was also a scientist's invention that came to life. Frankenstein was also misunderstood and people were frightened of him because he was different. People chose to isolate themselves from Frankenstein out of fear of the unknown. Frankenstein, like Edward did not choose to live and be targeted by people for being different and not fitting into the cookie-cutter version of society.<br/><br/>One technique in Edward Scissorhands that was used was the lighting. When Pegg goes into the mansion it is made to look dark and ominous by just having sunlight shine through the windows. It gave a look of abandonment since it was the middle of the day and it was pitch-black in the mansion. Another technique was the display of motifs. One motif was Edward's mansion. The mansion symbolized Edward and his isolation from society. The mansion was big, black and creepy looking and isolated from the other bright and cheery houses on the block. The people in the neighborhood were also a motif. They were meant to portray society and how they treat people that do not look or act like them. People like Edward feel isolated because society does not want to accept that not everybody is like them."
"Eternality","7","0","1","26 February 2011"," The comparatively more powerful finale redeems the experience of sitting through a build-up that is less than inspired.
","Arguably Tim Burton's most well-known, and possibly most beloved film in his entire filmography, Edward Scissorhands is a heartwarming, and at times dark story about a life-size man-doll with scissors for hands. His name is Edward and is played by a young Johnny Depp in his first role for Burton. Depp would later form a productive partnership with the eccentric director in the next two decades making pictures such as Ed Wood (1994), Sleepy Hollow (1999), and Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007).<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is a conventional story told in flashback that is bookended by two scenes involving a grandmother telling a bedtime story to her granddaughter, who asked about the origin of snow. The story is about Edward who, in the distant past, lived in a castle on the mountaintop. His creator died before fixing human arms on him, thus the scissors for hands. He was lonely. Until one day, a woman from the community down below came by to sell cosmetics. She brought him to her home and made Edward part of her family. Predictably, Edward became infatuated with the woman's daughter, Kim (played by Winona Ryder), who slowly fell in love with him.<br/><br/>Despite Burton telling the story like a fairy tale, Edward Scissorhands does not end up like one. It is a bittersweet film that tries to seek for the viewer's sympathy. With a visual style that is unmistakably Burton's, the film unfortunately does not have a script good enough to match the visual flair. The dialogue is dull and falls in the territory of clichés. Very often, Edward is made the subject of ridicule in his new town, and even though it is done for humor purposes, too much reliance on these so-called gags to propel what little original plot it has unsurprisingly backfires.<br/><br/>That being said, in a film with a draggy second act, it has a moment that would probably be etched in the minds of viewers – the ice dance sequence. Although shortlived, that sequence involving a beautiful display of ""man""-made snowfall is surprisingly touching and I would even extend my praise by calling it arguably the most magical moment in all of Burton's films. Danny Elfman's dreamy, choral score also heightens the sequence dramatically. The musical themes repeat in the last act, and by then, they truly flow with the narrative. The comparatively more powerful finale redeems the experience of sitting through a build-up that is less than inspired. Not a must-watch unless you are a fan of Burton and Depp.<br/><br/>GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."

","You think writer/director Tim Burton and Every(which way)Man Johnny Depp were soul mates over the years and seven movies. Here, in Edward Scissorhands, their first collaboration together, it's as if they were beyond soul matesthey are like one.<br/><br/>Even when you get past the absolutely original and wonderful character ""Edward Scissorhands,"" Burton and Depp created one of the most touching, funny, original, colorful and adventurous bedtime stories this side of The Princess Bride. But within that, there is a regret they added adult scenes – meaning a tad bit of gore and humans in peril, but also language. Other than those, this would be one-hundred-percent for all ages for all the ages. (Yeah, I'm calling it timeless, even 21 years later, it holds up today.)<br/><br/>Oddly enough, in the ""Dr. Suess"" type/50's Technicolor neighborhood created here, sits a mysterious castle that no one seems to ever visit or act curious about. Even when it's not a mile away from the other residents, but practically on top of them. Nevertheless, Peg (Wiest) does her darnedest to sell her Avon products and when all else fails, she enters the château and finds the loner – Edward, a man with scissors for hands.<br/><br/>Kindness overcomes her and she takes him back to her home sparking the obvious curiosity of the neighborhood hens – a type of person I seriously cannot stand (more later.) Edward's mystified, curious, nervous and grateful for the attention from his newly adopted family made up of the norm: Mom, Dad, Son, Daughter, only the daughter's away.<br/><br/>Her absence doesn't escape Edward who's definitely smitten with her from the photos. And besides, he's got the entire town of hens to woo him as he's the newest ""gossip"" piece for them.<br/><br/>It's not a stretch to see where their attention is heading, and yep, it goes southfast. Too bad for Edward – he didn't ask for this and he's obviously innocent throughout the ordeals. Meanwhile, daughter, Kim (Ryder) returns and is both suspicious and curious at the same time. Also too bad for Edward – she's got the Biff Tanner-Type Boyfriend, Jim (Hall) and he's not the sharing kind.<br/><br/>Even mentioning the word: Frankenstein is just too obvious for both this movie and for any Burton fan. To be honest, this glorious, fun and moving picture takes Frankie to a whole new and creative level.<br/><br/>Almost everything in this movie works: beautiful and perfect score by also long time collaborator Danny Elfman, gorgeous colors/cinematography and wonderful acting by the leads, but also the supporting cast – SEE: the always masterful Vincent Price, in his last live action role. In addition, the script is wonderful, the moods are pitch-perfect (the first snow dance and the ""Hold Me"" – ""I can't"" scenes get me every time) and the atmosphere is just flawless. Even when the ""starting point"" idea behind the movie isn't the most original, the execution from then on was one of the most original concepts before its 1990 release year and to date.<br/><br/>I state all these praises even when the movie wasn't 100% perfect. Burton sure loves to use those washed up old 1980s actors, such as Paul Rubens, but in this case Anthony Michael Hall. Here, he does what he needed too, but I felt he did it with a little too much push. In addition, though it was crucial to the plot, the movie contained two of my biggest pet peeves: Hens & the Media. I CANNOT stand women (or some men) who have nothing better to do but gossip, talk & create drama and attempt to drag others down to their pitiful level. Unfortunately, I deal with them in my life on a daily basis – enough I need to consistently separate myself physically from their claws. Also, the media who's only purpose is to feed both fear and additional drama into these no-life desperate housewives, while destroying anything or anyone in their path – in this case, Edward.<br/><br/>Now, that all said – with the necessity of the evil Hens & the Media and the low point of Hall's performance, the movie still receives my highest honor of 5/5 stars. I could go on much further on how enjoyable this little tale, this brilliant bedtime story can last generationsbut just take my word for it: if you have yet to see it, go and buy it now. Don't rent, don't Netflix. Just buy. Even before you watch it; you will not be disappointed."
"poolandrews","7","0","2","26 December 2010"," A touching fantasy fairytale from Tim Burton.
","Edward Scissorhands starts as Avon representative Peggy Boggs (Dianne Wiest) drives up to the spooky old castle that sits on-top of a hill overlooking her average suburban town, hoping to sell some cosmetics Peggy discovers a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp) who has large shears for hands. Alone & unfamiliar with normal life Peggy insists that Edward come back home & live with her & her family. Having no contact with the outside world before Edward finds things hard & unusual at first, his scissorhands don't help him either. Edwards meets Peggy's teenage daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) & falls in lover with her but at first finds him a bit of a freak & Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) takes a real dislike to Edward. Using Edward to break into his parents house Jim leaves Edward to take the blame when the police turn up, the whole neighbourhood turns against Edward who seeks comfort in his castle but people just won't leave him alone...<br/><br/>Produced & directed by Tim Burton this dark modern fairytale is so Burton in style & substance & remains one of his best films, it's a tender & heartfelt piece of fantasy filmmaking that might just make you smile & cry in equal measure. Edward Scissorhands feels like a deeply personal film from Burton & has all his usual trademarks, the main hero is an eccentric outcast of society & Edward Scissorhands feels like Burton's take on the Frankenstein story as he tries to show Edward as a tragic figure, a victim of circumstance & the script (which was apparently written at first as a musical) manages to impart great sympathy on Edward & his plight. Edward as a character has a unique, naive, lonely man with a child like innocence. Edward is a great creation, if you can accept his scissorhands & the fantasy behind him his journey through the film is heartwarming & touchingly told with some amazingly written moments even though he only says 169 words during the entire duration. From his introduction to normal society to his falling in love & the eventual turning against him as he naivety & innocence is used for sinister purposes. A charming fairytale with strong fantasy aspects that is heartwarming & got me quite emotional on a few occasions. There's a certain deadpan satirical humour to it as well that plays brilliantly against the fantasy fairytale story. At an hour & forty minutes the time flew by for me & watching Edward come full circle in the film is a joy to witness.<br/><br/>Like most Burton films there's a dark Gothic style to Edward Scissorhands along with it's colourful suburban town setting & again the contrast works perfectly. There are many great moments in Edward Scissorhands, the moment when Edward sits on the curb unhappy & then cuts that dogs fringe is cute, the nice image of Winona Ryder dancing in flakes of snow as Edward craves a huge ice sculpture or the funny dinnertime scenes where Edward is used to carve the roast! The production values are top notch & Edward Scissorhands looks great throughout, from the brightly painted suburban houses to the dark Gothic castle a lot of time was obviously spent on the look of this.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 you can see where the money went, apparently filmed in Florida. Tom Cruise, Jim Carrey & Robert Downey Jr. were all considered for the role of Edward Scissorhands but Johnny Depp is great in the part anyway. Vincent Price makes his last screen appearance in a nice little cameo role.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands is a touching fairytale that I enjoyed a lot, you really have to accept the character's & the events but if you can than this is a great film."

","I think this is definitely Tim Burton's most amazing film-every aspect seems to fit and all the acting is excellent. The best part, I think, is the simplicity. The film communicates about being different and how people are not accepted, a basic moral but done well, Tim Burton-style.<br/><br/>The film showcases the director's unique abilities with his own interesting characters and little details-and the score by Danny Elfman is really memorable. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp will forever be remembered for not just Jack Sparrow, but for Edward Scissorhands, the role that brought him into film. His character is a sort of Of Mice and Men idea, hurting the things that he loves. Winona Ryder and all the other supporting actors play their roles to perfection, notably Vincent Price in his last film role.<br/><br/>Although the suburban design is a bit outrageous (the blandness idea is really forced onto you), it really shows a place we find boring may be an amazing place to others.<br/><br/>The film is an astonishing combination of music and visual effects and I think it may well be Tim Burton's greatest film."
"JessyCritical","10","0","1","12 November 2010"," Perfect
","Edward Scissorhands, as its slogan states, tells the story of an uncommonly gentle man. As the film progresses it is clear to see that he is the only gentleman in a neighbourhood filled with narrow-minded and ignorant residents. This (and many other reasons!) is why it is easy to fall in love with Edward, who is perfectly portrayed by Johnny Depp. The story is a simple one: boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, but it's not meant to be. However, Tim Burton put a twist on this typical, Hollywood rom-com structure when he created this dark fairytale. Edward is discovered by the cheery, Avon representative Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) who thinks it would be a great idea for him to go home with her. Little does she know, that this is the worst thing she could have done. Tim Burton emphasises the monotony of life in the Suburbs when showing every resident rushing to Peg's house to have a look at the new visitor. Edward immediately falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) when gazing at her photograph. She, however, has a jock boyfriend: Jim. He rapidly forms a hatred for Edward and mocks him throughout the film. Life in this neighbourhood eventually takes its toll on Edward, and without giving anything away, he doesn't get the fairytale ending he deserves. The ease at which we fall for this story, is perhaps, the best thing about it. Tim Burton invites us into his Gothic fantasy world and we enjoy every moment we are there. The music, that accompanies the many bitter-sweet moments between Kim and Edward, is beautiful; it is easy to see why Danny Elfman believes the music he composed for Edward Scissorhands to be his greatest. It is also understandable why Tim Burton favours this out of all of his films; if he had only made Edward Scissorhands, he would still be thought of as a great Director. The wonderful performances by all members of the cast, which include Vincent Price as the inventor, add to the brilliance of this film. Each character is different from the next, yet equally believable. This just adds to how heart-breaking this film is; we know, that this is how people would act towards someone this different. We sympathise with Edward because all he wants to do is fit in. The amount of themes Edward Scissorhands covers is endless: love, hatred, jealousy, kindness and it, also, raises many questions about society. Something else that needs to be touched on is the amazing contrasts between Edward's dark, eerie, lifeless world and his new life; filled with bright colours, flocks of people and noise. This makes Edward stand out even more from the crowd, his pale face covered in scars and his all-black clothes. To sum up, Edward Scissorhands is a must for Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans alike, they are both at their best here. It is definitely a modern- day classic that will stay with you long after you've seen it, and want to be watched over and over again."
"callanvass","9","0","2","1 August 2010"," Still stands up wonderfully today, as a magical tale.
","Edward Scissorhands is a movie they just don't make anymore. Frankly I find Tim Burton's movies to be often too dark and plodding, but this isn't one of them. The romance between Depp and Winnona Ryder is one of the most enchanting and beautiful love stories I've ever seen, while some of the cinematography was tremendous. I really like how they try to make Edward a part of society at 1st, and try to make him feel like a human being, it was really heart-warming and fun to watch. After all these years, this remains one of Johnny Depp's best performances, and most certainly one of his mot definitive roles. Tim Burton's directing style suits him perfectly here. It's effectively dark and brooding, while having the neighborhood in the day-time smartly looking peaceful and classy. The characters are well-developed for the most part, but the main reasons this work so well is Johnny Depp and the unique romance surrounding it, I especially loved the old mansion Edward stayed at.<br/><br/>Performances. Johnny Depp isn't even at his peak here talent wise, and he still musters up an incredible performance. He looks unique, acts unique and his character was unique. It was a tough role to play off, but Depp did it wonderfully and made Edward very sympathetic. Winona Ryder is pretty good for the most part. She's hypnotizing on the eyes, and her chemistry with Depp was excellent. Dianne Wiest is great in her role, as the caring yet ninny-nanny person. Anthony Michael Hall served his purpose well, and played a perfectly unsympathetic prick. Kathy Baker did great in her role, she stole quite a few scenes. Alan Arkin is a riot as the dry, yet hilarious Father. Vincent Price looks old and ill, but was pure class when on-screen.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Edward Scissorhands is a beautiful work of art, that still holds up great today. There aren't many like this movie, and I'm glad about that. A must see.<br/><br/>9/10"
"mrjordan","10","0","1","9 July 2010"," A film to keep in your library
","A fairy tale that is moving and beautiful. Definitely a multiple time screener.<br/><br/>This and Nightmare before Xmas is Burton's best work. You really become involved with the characters, their alienation and ""different-ness"".<br/><br/>Even the heroine who appears to be the popular girl, has a side of her that just doesn't fit in with others.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, the score is emotional and the acting fantastic. Vincent price is delicious as well as the whole cast.<br/><br/>It's a blend of comedy and tragedy and pulls you through a wide range of emotions through the film.

"francisco-bacigalupo","9","0","1","25 June 2010"," Edward Scissorhands: a unique master piece
","First of all, I have to say that although I am not such a big fan of Tim Burton's work I enjoy watching his movies. Edward Scissorhands is not the exception and I must say that this film is quite a master piece and I consider it to be his finest creation. <br/><br/>The movie tells the story of an artificial man named Edward (the legendary Johnny Depp), an unfinished creation, who has scissors for hands. Edward is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter Kim, who's magnificently interpreted by Winona Ryder. Burton shows the audience an imaginary world that is so odd that it entices them in a very peculiar way. People in this place might seem weird or eccentric but they are just a clear reflection of our society. <br/><br/>Through a very original and moving love tale, Tim explains us that scissorhands can be harmful but not as harmful as human hands. I totally recommend this solid well told story which is a unique critic of all the bad and ugly aspects of society, such as gossip, lies, violence, selfishness, prejudice, religion, etc.<br/><br/>9 out of ten."
"neil-476","7","0","1","4 June 2010"," Demented but touching
","I have very mixed feelings about Tim Burton. Having seen nearly all his films, I am starting to come to the conclusion that, very often, there is a great deal less to them than meets the eye. Admittedly there is usually a lot to meet the eye, but I suspect that this may lure the easily influenced (and I count myself among them) into mistaking eye candy for substance.<br/><br/>Edward Scissorhands, like most of Burton's films, has an extremely distinctive look to it, and one must give credit to the production design, from the dark Gothic tone of Edward's origin and big house on the hill, to the stylised bright pastels of the estate below, Edward's own unique visual aspect, the film never looks anything less than striking.<br/><br/>The story is a demented little fable. It doesn't stand up to critical scrutiny, but it wasn't really intended to. It illustrates a broad (and obvious) moral but is otherwise simply there to provide a vehicle for a number of cinematic ""moments"". Some of these are simply fun - the discovery of Edward's tonsorial talents, puncturing the water bed etc. - but a couple of them are real Moments, destined to feature on my personal list of cinema's Top 50 Greatest Moments. One of these is Vincent Price's brilliant performance in his final film, full of gentle power and compassion. And the other is, of course, the final reveal in Winona Ryder's closing bookend, where Danny Elfman's best ever musical cue hikes the emotional stakes up to unbearability level.<br/><br/>Not the classic it might appear to be at first sight, but with more than enough plus points to make it well worth catching."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","1","2 May 2010"," An overrated but charming and eventually very moving fairy tale set in modern-day suburbia
","There have been many film collaborations between filmmaker Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp, but it all started with ""Edward Scissorhands"", a successful dark fantasy movie. I was a preschooler when this was released, and I remember hearing about the film and seeing a bit of it within the next few years after that. However, I never actually sat down to watch the 1990 blockbuster until 2006. At the time, I wasn't sure what I thought of the first hour or so, but found it very powerful later on! After a little over four years, I've seen the hit modern-day fairy tale again, from start to finish. I still certainly wasn't as impressed as so many other viewers definitely have been over the years, but still think it's a good first Burton/Depp collaboration.<br/><br/>Edward is an artificial human being who lives in a mansion up the hill from a suburban neighbourhood. This mansion was the home of his inventor, who died just before he got to finish his invention, leaving Edward incomplete, with scissors for hands! One day, a local Avon representative named Peg Boggs is not having any luck with her sales, and decides to go to the mansion to try and make a sale, not knowing who lives there. Up on the hill, she finds nobody in sight until she reaches the top floor, where she meets Edward, and it seems he has never been off the mansion property! Peg takes him back home with her, and he stays with the Avon representative, her husband Bill, young son Kevin, and teenage daughter Kim at their house. The artificial being is admired by most of the neighbours, but Kim's boyfriend, a thug named Jim, does not think too highly of him, and he could lead Edward into a load of trouble! <br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, we see a grandmother about to tell her granddaughter the story of Edward Scissorhands. This elderly woman is not played very well by a young actress in makeup, trying to speak in an elderly voice. After the story begins, the part where Peg Boggs discovers the mansion and searches for someone inside is a little tedious, but the mansion is a fascinating location, and the scene showing her meeting Edward for the first time can certainly grab viewers. Edward, played wonderfully by Johnny Depp, stands out as a likable character, but some of the other characters are not portrayed so well, especially Esmeralda, the Christian fanatic who thinks Edward is from hell. I honestly don't get this character! Is she meant to be funny?! If so, she's not. She's just weird, absurd, and annoying! Good thing she only has four scenes! There are also some fairly sappy moments in this film. However, most of the movie is well done. It's usually intriguing showing the protagonist's relationship with the people in the neighbourhood, and there are some other good performances, such as Winona Ryder as Kim, Vincent Price as Edward's inventor in flashback sequences, and Anthony Michael Hall as the despicable Jim. Later on, the film gets very dark, intense, and often heartbreaking, and I've never seen a character harder not to hate than the one Hall plays here! The tension and emotion at this point are unforgettable! <br/><br/>This first Burton/Depp collaboration is probably thought by many to be their best. It does seem to be more popular than most of the others, but I have to disagree. Unlike some people, I've found some severe flaws here, but overall, I still think it's a very good film which deserved its success, even if it's not as great as its reputation suggests. I would say the film is most effective after the first hour or so, which was what I thought the first time as well, but I think the movie as a whole was better for me the second time. It's probably a good thing I didn't see much of ""Edward Scissorhands"" as a kid. What I saw at the time didn't hurt, with Edward accidentally puncturing a waterbed and struggling to try and eat with his scissor hands, but it might have gotten to be a bit too much for me near the end, especially with the Jim character. Well, it was rated PG-13. I certainly wouldn't recommend this for kids, except maybe older ones, but for many adolescents and adults, I'm sure it's a worthwhile fantasy drama, with a bit of humour."
"zeroFargoth","10","0","1","6 April 2010"," A Modern Horror Classic
","In recent memory, there have been films and books borrowing heavily from older, classic, and revered horror novels. Many fail in their attempt. This movie is one of the few that borrow from these older tales, and end up creating something just a good and unique in its own right. This movie can't exactly be called dark, as it contains very bright colors and a cheery atmosphere. This movie is beyond that, the perfect neighborhood where the story takes place is so cloyingly 60's it becomes ironic. A bland palette of cut and paste houses and perfect yards adds to the atmosphere of the overall film. This is one of several aesthetic choices like the sharp contrast between this neighborhood and the massive castle ominously situated above it,makes this movie a piece of visual art to go with this story. The story is similar to classics like Dracula or Frankenstein in some way, but develops a distinct stamp of its own throughout the film. The mob of villagers is replaced with nosy gossipy women and the evil vampire is gone, with simply a tortured, unfortunate, and innocent soul in its place. There is humor in this film, but the farther you go in the less it happens. This darkness builds up until the climax, which explodes in a burst of irony and utter desperation. Only one spark grows in the midst of this bleakness. The villagers er, neighbors at first embrace Edward but lies and ignorance cause them to immediately label him a monster. The spark I mentioned is the one who began by fearing and almost despising him, I'm of course talking about the closest to a love interest this movie has. If you haven't watched yet I can't perfectly explain this relationship, I can only stress its importance to this film. The film cuts off well, leaving no hope for a sequel, as is proper, and leaving you with an odd feeling of sadness, joy, and utter.. well I can't properly describe this last emotion. No matter how hard I try I can't properly describe this movie, to understand you must see it. It contains a magic of its own distinct from any other movie. The last bit of review I have left is one acting. The stand out performance is definitely Johnny Depp as Edward Scissorhands, he barely talks throughout the movie but the body language perfectly shapes and emotes the character of Edward Scissorhands. This is his finest role in a slew of many. The rest of the acting is well done as well, with some hilarious bits from the nosy neighborhood women. This movie is the perfect modern horror classic, which only makes sense if you've watched the film. If you've never seen the movie before I utterly recommend it, if you've seen it before watch it again. You may see something more in the film. If you dislike the movie I respect your opinion, but utterly disagree."

","I've decided instead of writing a review of Alice in Wonderland, which I've just seen to write something about a far more interesting and less cloying film of Tim Burton - the fantastic Edward Scissorhands. The movie for me is something a fairytale should be, it's a visually amazing story (not taking into account the movie's modest budget) with a character, that I don't think anyone besides Tim Burton could ever create. While the visual style of Burton in my mind always rivals with Gilliams, but the characters he comes up with are just different, at same the time fantastical and very relatable. Depp and Burton work together for the first time - and it's a match made in heaven (at least in this film) Depp gives subtlety and depth to Edward'd character. The script is not amazing (it goes for obvious situations and often easy laughs) - but it's definitely not bad. Tim Burton doesn't really bother writing for other characters, I suppose all his effort went into the main character, who I guess Burton himself relates to the most. They're one-dimensional, practically walking stereotypes. Though the movie is not perfect (and what movie really is?) it's a pleasure to watch, a melancholic fairy tale of a person who doesn't fit in."
"Aaron1375","Null","0","1","6 September 2009"," Worth a look just to see Vincent Price's last role.
","I do believe it was his last role, and not surprisingly he is absolutely great as the inventor who sees a human in a cookie cutting machine and gives it a heart, a body and life and sadly dies before he is able to give his creation hands. The impact really had me going and was very emotional especially considering how shortly after this Price himself would take his last breath. The rest of the movie is good too, I would have ranked it higher, but the ending so brought me down that it left me feeling down in the dumps where it could have instead uplifted. Poor Edward went through so much, then was able to carve out some happiness with people and then had it taken away again. The ending is just enough to break your heart. Then again, what can one expect from Tim Burton? The movie has a very Gothic look to it that would also be seen in ""Batman Returns"" though I would argue he got a bit to dark and Gothic in that one. This one though becomes more of a comedy when Edward is found and introduced into society. Then near all the funny stuff, Edward falls in love and tragedy ensues making making this movie a depressing one. Still, it is a good movie and worth a look. Like I said, the movie is worth watching for Vicent Price's brief scenes alone."

","Movies are made to have a lasting expression on the audience for many days.Edward Scissorhands is one of them.This movie is showcased so beautifully by Tim Burton that you seem to think how could Johnny Depp (Edward)take up such a role and play it to perfection.The man has frequently been criticized for his expressionless acting and does not have the capability to carry a film on his own shoulders.But Depp's performance in the film has silenced his critics forever and made them stand to witness arguably the best performance of his career. <br/><br/>Depp doesn't have many lines to boast of in the movie.But he portrays brilliant expressions convincingly in each and every scene.Editing and photography is top notch.Dialogues are superb and give a lift to each scene.Music by Danny Elfman is haunting,magical and outstanding.The melody of his songs is in accordance with the theme of the movie.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder(Kim)was Depp's girlfriend during the shooting of the movie.She too plays her part perfectly and gives able support to Depp.The chemistry between them is the highlight of the film.They look so beautiful on screen no wonder they were a couple in real life. <br/><br/>But the credit has to go to Tim Burton,who has handled his most personal project with dedication and sincerity.He has shown how Edward adapts to a new world outside his mansion and how he experiences various emotions in life.The movie is an honor to watch and the climax of the movie will move you for days to come.Excellent 9/10"
"MarvinCandle","9","0","1","15 April 2009"," A comical/sad masterpiece
","After seeing a tiny part of Edward Scissorhands on TV a long time ago and hearing that it was only ""strange"" I didn't think much of it. After seeing it completely and understanding it better, I have to say it's one of my favorites. It's very funny and also incredibly sad from the haunting music in the beginning to the very last well acted scene.<br/><br/>It's a mature and dark story told in a fairy-tale like way. It takes a simple idea really (a young, secluded, shy man with scissors for hands thrown into regulatory society) and depicts as many emotions, jokes and scenarios from hilarious to bitterly sad as possible. What would a man with scissor hands be good at? The movie is unique and strange and that's part of what makes it great; its a look at reality from an odd angle. The fact is; there are people like Edward out there (I'm not talking about the scissorhands obviously) and there are, sadly, neighborhoods like that out there. There are too many good morals to the story to put down here.<br/><br/>The entire cast is perfect for their roles. The directing is brilliant as well as the music. One of Time Burton's best (if not best). This movie solidifies for me what a great actor Johnny Depp is. Winona Ryder & the small part of Vincent Price is just another reason this is one of my favorites. A true masterpiece, an instant classic that is perhaps very under-appreciated or misunderstood. A must see for a true movie fan."

","Describing Edward Scissorhands... Where shall I begin? It's only fair to start with the impact it had on me  all those years ago when I first saw it.<br/><br/>It's one of the few films that managed to touch me in a very unique and emotional way. I had only seen the promo and trailer on television, when I became mesmerized by the astonishing world and characters Burton created for this film. I knew then I had to see it. And I knew then that I would love it. Because this is no ordinary fairy tale  no, this is real magic.<br/><br/>Not only are the parts sublimely castthe music is amazing and so appropriate, the set is delightful and interesting to watch, Edward's innocence and frailty is an instant sympathy factor and the budding love between him and Kim is one of rare kinds  one that I was captivated by, and am still.<br/><br/>The film knows slow, funny, romantic and exciting scenes. All of which show us more of Edward and the life with his new 'family' outside of the professor's castle. I began falling more in love with the story and the characters, especially Edward, while watching it. My favourite scenes include the obvious 'snow dancing' scene, the funny show and tell scene and the precious 'hold me  I can't' scene. But, honestly, it's hard to pick a particular scene from a film that is so dear to my heart. <br/><br/>How can I put it? It's a story that invites you into a different world. If only for a little while. Still one where good and evil exist, but where a bittersweet happy ending holds victory. Yes, the ending. Also a scene that completely ran away with my heart. I remember fighting my tears during the final scene  especially when I saw it the first time. Of course I knew it was going to end that way, how else could it? And the fact that It did only made a bigger impression on me and made me treasure the film more. It was an honest ending. An ""I love you"" I will never forget. And one of which I hope there will be more in Hollywood in the years to come. <br/><br/>It is impressive what Johnny did in this role. There's no other word for it. Or maybe 'wow'. From that moment on he became my favourite actor. And he still is. And no matter what projects he works on in the future, I doubt that is going to change. <br/><br/>So, yes, when it comes down to it; I'm giving this film a 10 out of 10. Simply because I think it's that good. One of my all-time favourites - a contemporary fairy tale"

","This movie is truly remarkable. It's a movie that in some way, reaches everyone that watches it.<br/><br/>I could think of every glorifying word I know to describe this movie. But, in all truth, this movie is indescribable. This is Tim Burton at his best. In this movie you see the imagination of a child come to life in a beautiful tale. I think, that in a way, everyone secretly wants to know someone like Edward. Because, quite frankly, the one thing that really separates Edward from ""normal"" people is his actions and personality. Edward is gentle, he is kind to everyone he meets, he is polite and caring. Edward is something that is a fantasy just for those traits, never mind the fact that he has scissors for hands.<br/><br/>I think thats what gives this movie the magic it has. The fact that, by the end of this movie you realize this fact. You watch the people in the town drive him away, and your sad. And, your not just sad because Edward is alone. Your not just sad that Edward doesn't have a family any more. Your sad at how the towns people acted. Your sad how it all came crashing down. And, finally, your sad at almost how real that situation is, and your disappointed because, in a way, you can see people you know, in your own town, doing the same thing..."
"sddavis63","7","0","1","27 May 2008"," Fluffy Fantasy That Descends Into Darkness
","""Edward Scissorhands"" is another example of Tim Burton's rather quirky style of mixing humour with horror (in a Goth sort of way) and ending up with a pretty good movie when it's all put together. When I thought about this movie, one of the things that came through was how heavily influenced by the story of Frankenstein it is. Edward (very effectively played by Johnny Depp) isn't a real person, he's a creation of an unnamed scientist (played in basically a cameo role by Vincent Price.) Like Frankenstein's monster, he's basically isolated. Like the monster, when he's removed from his isolation, he ends up wreaking unintentional havoc. Maybe the most obvious comparison is when the people of the town storm the castle he lives in, much like the villagers stormed Frankenstein's castle. (Much of the action in the town actually reminded me of ""Desperate Housewives,"" with everything happening on the same street and a bunch of women being in the know about it all.)<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is a fun, whimsical sort of fantasy as Edward tries to adjust to life outside his castle. He becomes the hit of the town (especially with the women.) Some of this is wonderfully funny. Gradually, though, the movie turns progressively darker and even violent as Edward runs into more and more trouble. The gradual shift in tone was very effectively accomplished by Burton, and pulled off well by the cast (especially Depp.) It did, however, represent a bit of a problem for me. The opening of the movie tells us that this story is a bedtime story told by Kim (played by Winona Ryder) to her granddaughter about an event long ago, to explain where snow comes from. I wouldn't think of the darker half of this movie as a good bedtime story for a young girl! That caused me a bit of trouble, as did the fact that no one ever explained why Edward had scissors for hands. I understand that The Inventor (as he was called in the credits) died before he could give him hands, but why would he have fashioned these clunky looking scissor-type hands for him in the first place? Unanswered questions aside, I throughly enjoyed watching this (although I thought the fluffy fantasy was more enjoyable than the descent into darkness) and thought that the entire cast really pulled off a collection of good performances. Overall - 7/10"

","I saw this movie back in 1994 or so. I was only 6, but have to say I cried at this movie. It's simply a masterpiece. You don't have to be an adult to understand the message delivered by it.

It is hear touching, and like one of us said, it will melt the coldest hearts, and it will bring tears to your eyes :) that is a good thing as modern movies don't do that (well dropped some tears @ LOTR, but this is different) very often.

","Tim Burton has a knack for, and perhaps a habit of(but as long as the movies are great, what's the harm?) making Gothic films, centered around a misunderstood outcast who is or will be distrusted by townspeople. He really understands the characters, and he helps us to understand them, too. This is an utterly beautiful film. I'm not sure it's possible to watch this and not be affected emotionally. The characters are exceptionally well-written, and portrayed. The acting is basically all good. Depp is astounding. As with The Penguin of Batman Returns, I wasn't really watching the actor, I was watching the character. The writing is great, throughout. The pacing is just about flawless. The humor is magnificent, and seldom harsh or unnecessary. Some things in this are perhaps at least a little above what children should watch. Some language, and suggestive dialog and actions. The unclear time period is well done... this could take place today, or decades ago. The use of color is expertly done. The film is amazing. I recommend this to anyone who can look beyond the surface. 8/10"
"Pythe","9","0","1","9 October 2007"," Message to the movie's detractors...
","The first thing you have to understand about Edward Scissorhands is that it's meant as a modern day fairy tale, with a strong base in absurdism. Things happen here that would not or could not happen in real life. People do not react realistically. THIS IS INTENTIONAL. If you are the sort of person who takes everything literally (and it seems everyone I've encountered who doesn't like this movie is ""that"" kind of person), don't watch this. You will only wonder why Edward's inventor gave him scissors for hands in the first place rather than actual hands, or why everybody takes his sudden appearance in stride, or why a Gothic castle shrouded in gloom is randomly situated on the edge of suburbia.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to insult you. I'm just trying to tell you that, if you see this movie with somebody who loves it, all you're going to do is complain, and fans will get irritated because you don't ""get it"", and then everybody involved will get in a big argument over whether or not this is a good film. So please, just take it on faith that you really need to stay away from this one if you can't accept the bizarre reality presented in the film."

","I had seen this movie years ago, and recently found the DVD at my public library. Watching it again was almost like a fresh experience. Depp was very young, Ryder was a teenager, and they were perfect. The DVD extras has a few ""sound bites"" from several actors and the writer and I was particularly struck by how poorly the young Depp expressed himself. But that is history.<br/><br/>An old inventor (Vincent Price) living on the mountain at the end of the cul-de-sac in this flat Florida suburb has made this boy, Edward (Johnny Depp), but didn't have a chance to finish him when he dropped dead. Edward still had scissors for hands, and many nicks on his face from inadvertent cuts.<br/><br/>Peg (Diane Wiest) is an Avon sales lady and is having a particularly unproductive day, when she decides to drive up to the old house on the hill, go in, and try to find someone to sell Avon to. She encounters Edward and does what any mom would do, she took the orphan home, gave him some clothes, and sat him at the dinner table with the family.<br/><br/>Edward is, of course, very different. While the old inventor explained lots of things to him, Edward had never experienced social settings, he had no idea what real people did in real everyday life. Kim (teenager Winona Ryder, before her felony days) is Peg's daughter and she sort of takes a sympathetic liking to Edward, in the end defending him against her mean boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall). Kathy Baker plays Joyce, the over sexed neighbor who tries to seduce Edward, and Alan Arkin, sounding a lot like Christopher Walken, is the dad, Bill, who takes everything in stride.<br/><br/>The movie is mostly entertainment, seeing how this unusual character Edward copes with his new surroundings. But it is also a story about acceptance of someone who is different. Edward never quite fits in, even though he fascinates people with his skill, sculpting hedges or cutting hair. The movie has a somewhat dark ending, but the only one possible in this impossible situation.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. Jim is relentless, and ends up following Edward back to the old house on the hill, along with Kim. He is mistreating her too and, angry, Edward stabs him and Jim falls to the ground below, bleeding and eventually dead. Kim tells the gathering crown that Edward died in the building collapse, but in fact he was safe. Kim narrates the story as a very old woman and when the little girl asks if Edward still lives she says she is sure of it, because before him it never snowed, but now it snows every winter. And we see Edward using his scissor hands to carve yet another ice sculpture, and the fury of his actions send up a snow storm of sorts."

","This is a truly heart-breaking film, which will leave even the toughest person with tears in their eyes. The compositions by Danny Elfman which accompany the main feature, are truly amazing.<br/><br/>Although this film doesn't have the special effects that we are so accustomed to enjoying in recent movies, this film benefits from not being overloaded with complicated plots, intricate characters or hours of fight sequences.<br/><br/>Basically, this is the touching story of Edward, an abandoned and incomplete experiment. Left with scissors for hands and unable to touch anything without destroying it, Edward is brought out of his secluded world into the busy hubbub of daily life. Forced to live amongst humans for the first time Edward must learn to survive in a prejudiced society, which offers no allowance for his needs. However there are a select few, who see Edward for what he is inside, rather than for the blades he carries.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film highly enough. This film is for anyone and everyone. With charming characters and a thrilling plot, Edward Scissorhands is one of my all time favourite films. I have heard several critics comment that this film ""drags on""... I couldn't disagree more, but there is a noticeable acceleration of pace in the last 20 minutes of the film. However, don't just take my word for it - watch it and find out for yourselves."

We see the sympathy that she shows for him. and humorous complications. when the doctor gives the answer the long way to say whether or not Edward will be fine in the town. And when he is shown around the house and the intimate actions he doesn't understand. Simply a classical but funny way of showing that since Edward has been in isolation for so long that he doesn't understand the ways of ''normal'' people.<br/><br/>Yet he seems to have a good chance of an art career turning, whizzy messes into masterpieces and works of art. changing hedges into topiary and husky dogs into elegant poodle-like creatures. then he meets a partner he falls for but isn't sure if they shall get together because he is not ''normal''."

","I officially fell in love with Johnny Depp and gained a brand new respect for him as an actor after seeing 1990's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, the darkest of black comedies, in which Depp plays the creation of a mad scientist (Vincent Price, in his final film role)who, after the death of his creator, is disturbed to learn that his creator did not finish his hands and left his hands as large scissor-like objects who is befriended by a kindly Avon Lady (Dianne Wiest)who takes him home to live with her family. Director Tim Burton takes the ""fish out of water"" concept to an all-new level, creating an alternately dark and vibrant cinematic canvas that encompasses some of the most interesting color schemes that I've seen in a film in ages. A razor sharp screen- play is given yeomen service by Wiest, Winona Ryder as her daughter who Edward develops a crush on, Alan Arkin as Wiest's husband, Anthony Michale Hall as Ryder's boyfriend, and Kathy Baker as an amorous neighbor; however, it is Depp who dominates the proceedings with a devastating, tragic, sweet, brave, and touching performance. There is nary a false note in his performance as Depp plays the stranger in a strange land to perfection. This film was the genesis of the Depp-Burton collaboration that would continue into other films, but it all started here...this magical fantasy journey into the darkest parts of suburbia will thrill, amuse, and entertain."

Edward wants to love and fit in, but he simply cannot because of his abnormality. However bittersweet the ending was, it certainly reminds the audience that love is not something you find often, but it is something you should do anything for. This film is a classic for all fans of Tim Burton, fans of romance, or fans of movies in general. It will have you laughing, crying, and shaking your head while seeing all the similarities you and Edward have: clumsiness, elegance, beauty, abnormality -- all the things that make up life."

Since this movie, all others with a Gothic ""creature"" going into suburbia will seem like it was underdone to this movie. Another great aspect that I enjoyed in the film was the work of Danny Elfman, Burton's sidekick for producing movies. Had Elfman not been included in the film, I feel it would not have come on as strong as it did. Elman, with Burton was definitely a great choice, especially when a great movie relies on a great soundtrack. Others will tell you how great J. Depp and W.

But the most interesting one in my opinion is the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp partnership, which has produced five weird, unusual, fascinating movies so far. It all began in 1990 with this beautiful opus...<br/><br/>Burton mixes Frankenstein and Beauty and the Beast in this peculiar Gothic love story between artificial guy Edward (Depp) and his host's daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder). This far, nothing wrong. Well, unless you consider the fact that Eddie's got giant scissors for hands, since his creator (Vincent Price, in his last role) passed away before finishing him. Therefore he has to live with his ""digits"", which actually come in handy as he starts charming the local ladies with his hairdressing/grass-cutting abilities. Unfortunately, trouble is on its way, as the boy can't tell the difference between good and evil, right and wrong...<br/><br/>It's pretty clear whose side Burton's on: the ""freak"" is much more ""human"" than other people and Johnny Depp makes that possible thanks to one of his best performances ever (on my list, Edward ranks #3, straight after Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow). Winona Ryder is excellent as well, her Kim being the only one who totally understands our troubled protagonist.<br/><br/>Batman may have made the director a celebrity, but it's this movie that showed the world exactly how talented and non-conventional he could be."

He was just showing the world his talents and was pulled this way and that. Is it everyday that women swoon over sculptors and hairdressers? What an occupation to have. I think the world needs another touch from this artist with steal blade fingers. To bad 'Ed' made little profit from his skills except cookies. How did Kim fall for Edward so fast? I guess if all the local kids were like her boyfriend Jim then who wouldn't. The cookie machine was dopey but I guess Edward breaks the mold. Hopefully he was happy trimming bushes and carving ice the rest of his eternity. Where did he get the ice anyway? What a nice Avon lady. She was very dedicated in this dead-end neighborhood. Her family really reaches out and when you show compassion to an outsider people label you as one of them. May there be more of those who love their neighbors as themselves."

This movie is the subject of deep inner meaning. Depp plays very well as the traumatized creation of a dead inventor. Edwards' intentions are always good but sometimes do not always appear so.

It is simply Tim Burton at his best with the use of Gothic and mystical sets, dark humour and wonderful performances. The real show stealer here for me though has to be the score of Danny Elfman which is truly something to behold. I have always been a huge fan of his and Burton has used him in every film I can think of. Here he is at his peak. The score here perfectly captures the tone of the film brilliantly and is at is best during the scene where Winona Ryder dances in the snow while Johhny Depp is cutting an ice block towards the end. It should have won an Oscar and is one of the best, if not the best scores i've ever heard.<br/><br/>Perormances of the entire cast led by Depp and Ryder are top notch and the cinematography beautifully captures the 1950's town and dark mansion perfectly. I have to say this is my favourite Tim Burton film purely because it shows what a wonderful vision he has and the fantasy and tragedy of his story really works well. I believe this is heavily underrated but looks to be finally receiving the acclaim it deserves here on IMDb. Long may it continue.<br/><br/>Beautiful 10/10"
"Lizzie_Loves_Films","10","0","4","17 November 2005"," An amazing piece of work with a beautiful outcome
","Tim Burton is definitely one of my favourite directors, his films never seem to fail in my mind, as he is such an amazing director. He always chooses the darker and more Gothic approach in film making. His film Edward Scissor Hands is incredible. With excellent acting from Johnny Depp, he looks so sweet and innocent, and yet he is mistaken by the Surburbia society to be evil. When a lady decided to take him in, and fix his scars, she doesn't quite realise what she's got herself into. The young man Edward is not any 'normal' person, he was created by an inventor who happens to be Vincent Price. Edward has scissors for hands and causes more damage than immediately thought. Also starring in the film is Winona Ryder, who is rather annoying as she seems to be loved by Edward, she is not the best actress in this film, but i think Johnny Depp is excellent and he makes up for her bad acting. Directed superbly with amazing music that will make your heart beat faster and slower at the same time.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for film fans every where, this is an excellent film and should not be forgotten."

","Tim Burton has one of the most creative, quirky, original, fantastic, and brilliant minds in film today. He has a rare gift of bringing pictures to the screen that are not market driven and are motivated purely by his unique art and extraordinary ideas. Unlike a lot of other great film-makers Tim Burton has always been consistent with his brilliance and his unparalleled, imaginative genius. With films like ""Edward Scissor Hands"", ""Big Fish"", ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"", and ""Corpes Bride"", Tim Burton has always created a curious, and refreshing,movie-going experience. Tim Burton's films are nothing less than magical."
"salchichafingers","10","0","2","1 November 2005"," a masterpiece
","This movie is a masterpiece of the human condition! It taps in to the most basic human ideal of wanting to be accepted and loved by others no matter how different you are. I love this movie because the main character played by Johnny Depp has many layers. He can look scary, but yet, be child like with his sensitivity. Tim Burton has done a genius job in directing this film. The look of the film is from another world. Its an explosion of color. The people, plants and animals have almost Technicolor look to them.Its middle America meets Alice in Wonderland. The lighting in the film is also ingenious; many scenes in Edwards world are dark and have a limited pallet of color. Scense in the town have a more festive array of color and natural lighting. This film has a fairy tale look, that can apeall to the young and the old. I strongly recommend this movie and hope you all enjoy it as much as I do."

","this movie i sorta just bought with 2 other Johnny Depp movies because it was a 3 for 1 deal....i had heard about it but never actually watched it and now 4 weeks after i bought it i finally decided to watch it and I'm really glad i did, the movie was amazing and very unique. One of the things i like best about TIm Burton is his creative mind he's original and very unique some people may say a lot of his movies are odd, but i think they are amazing. He's an amazing director and well everything. This movie was amazing because i think there was a lot of meaning to it and there was also a lot of parallelism. THe music was amazing and the movie i thought was so sad but very sweet."
"bob-da-frogg","9","0","2","22 October 2005"," Soooo Good.... Except....
","I absolutely love johnny depp & burton when they get together, they've done it so many times its like a father-son relationship. OK, the movie starts out with the lonely inventor and his cookie machine. He discovers how lonely he is and decides to make a robot companion. He teaches that companion manners and poetry, and he becomes more and more human like till he almost is except his various sharp objects for hands. Before he can get them, the inventor dies right there, leaving edward alone. The local avon lady finds him and takes him home. Its funny but sad to see poor edward trying to eat a single pea with those scissors of his. Kim comes home and freaks-out when she finds edward in her room, but she adjusts and falls in love even asking for a hug from what she first thought was a beast- *heres the spoiler* but in the end during the fight she doesn't really take much action, shes like oh well, totally destroying the movie, she could have at least supported edward in his final fight, sure they still could of died, but she is such a dumb blonde. soo good, except kim. Nine Stars"
"Gaeloch","9","0","2","17 September 2005"," Edward lives in complete solitude, his face and limbs scarred by the scissors he bears in place of hands, until one day he is introduced at last to the 'modern world'. . .
","This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Johnny Depp is in top form in his trademark role as an outcast and he captures the character, indeed the very essence of Edward, perfectly. It is also one of Tim Burton's best films. He either makes brilliant films or terrible ones. This is definitely one of the former. The two strongest impressions from this film are of it being something uniquely wonderful and heartbreakingly sad. Although it can be seen as a comment upon society, it is, first and foremost, a story, so merely suspend your disbelief (not that you'll need to try hard to do so,) and lose yourself in the magic of the film. <br/><br/>I love this film. . .but I expect you have already guessed that! One final thing; it contains some of the most beautiful examples of mise-en-scene that I've ever watched and is well worth seeing for that alone."
"performing_x_dream","10","0","2","30 August 2005"," A Beautifully Arranged and Emotional Film
","One of my all time favorite movies, Tim Burton directs another one of his outstanding pieces. There's a marvelous cast playing imaginative characters, especially Johnny Depp, who in the movie plays Edward, and says only a few lines, but was still best for the part and really gets you close to him while watching the movie. <br/><br/>Along with Danny Elfman's beautiful score, the plot is well written with touching scenes that that are really meaningful. And there are of course a few funny scenes that can really crack you up. And most of them are quite simple too. <br/><br/>This movie truly shows how powerful movies can be. I swear, this is one of the most emotional films I have ever experienced watching, and it got me crying for quite a while in the end of the film.<br/><br/>I sincerely do recommend this film to anyone who has a big heart, is a fan of Tim Burton, enjoy's a good cry, or would like to see what love can truly be. This isn't one of those romantic chick flicks such as ""The Notebook"" or the ""Titanic"" that makes you cry. This is an incredible film that is much more beyond that, and that will remain in you mind for a long long time."
"go_leafs_go_13","10","0","2","21 August 2005"," a touching film. Burton's best.
","I don't think I can find words to describe this movie. I was touched beyond words by this gentle, innocent character. Johnny Depp portrays Edward perfectly. Edward Scissorhands is a must-see movie. The story of this uncommonly gentle man is comical and heartwarming. I don't think I've seen a better movie. Undoubtedly, Tim Burton's best film to date. The score fits the film perfectly. Two thumbs up for Danny Elfman. Each time I watch this film, it brings tears to my eyes. Edward Scissorhands truly is a masterpiece. If you have not seen this film yet, I highly, highly recommend it. A film for all ages. Truly magnificent. Tim Burton is to be congratulated on such a remarkable film. Really. Depp's acting is perfect. He managed to make me smile, laugh, feel pity and cry during the course of this film."
"jboothmillard","10","0","2","13 July 2005"," Edward Scissorhands
","Of all the films in the career of director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street), this is the one that everyone talks about, and highly acclaimed. This film is essentially a young man's struggle with being different and without a certain part of body, his hands. Basically mother and wife Peg (Dianne West) explores a mysterious house on the top of a hill (to promote beauty products or something) and she finds a man called Edward (Golden Globe nominated Johnny Depp), his surname Scissorhands tells you whats wrong with his hands. However, when he lives with this woman he uses his scissors to help some people, e.g. hair cuts, hedge trimming. Kim (Winona Ryder) becomes attracted to him as well. It's only when some people fear Edward that he goes a bit mad, and accidentally kills someone, so not exactly the happiest of endings. Also starring Anthony Michael Hall as Jim, Kathy Baker as Joyce, Honey I Shrunk the Kids' Robert Oliveri as Kevin, Vincent Price as The Inventor (one of his last roles before death) and Alan Arkin as Bill. Depp is great, Ryder is cute and Burton is fantastic director. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup, it won the BAFTA for Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up Artist and Best Special Visual Effects. Winona Ryder was number 87, Johnny Depp number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Depp was also number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Outstanding!"
"Nitemareb4xmas000","8","0","2","5 July 2005"," Definitely an Art-house movie
","The movie is very darkened, and cripsy like Twas the Nightmare Before Christmas because the meaning throughout the movie was something that no other movie would've had. This movie had also moved from the 80's into the 90's in a good transition. Tim Burton makes brilliant films, even his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is probably going to be a box-office hits, and probably better than the original. The characters are not stereotypical. They're the creepy neighbors that are too jolly until Johnny Depp's character totally misplaces the scene. I call that genius because it's symbolic for someone trying to fit in, even they do have scissors for hands. Probably wondering what an art-house movie is....well, it's a film that shows some sort of quality, that it could tell a story without making it into a film, also it could be symbolic in superflourous ways. The movie in the beginning has a good feel to it because the narrator is an old lady, making it cozy, and pleasing to hear. This is an art-house movie because this movie is very symbolic, and has a feedback that can be strong enough to be a story itself. If you've watched his other movies, then this movie has total relations."
"Lady_Sin","Null","0","3","27 December 2004"," Edward Scissorhands is the story of a man who have scissors instead of hands.
","This weird and enchanting fairytale has marked a lot my childhood. I think that my passion for cinema came from this movie.Edward Scissorhands is simply a masterpiece. The images are beautiful and leads us to a magic world where only Tim Burton can bring us. There is an unexplainable feeling about this movie. Like this unforgettable scene where Kim (Winona Ryder) dance under the snow. That's why I supposed it touched me this way. Through Jonnhy Depp lives Edward, this incredible and mysterious character. Because of that, the movie is even more interesting. A movie to watch over and over again, just for the magic!"
"sdj88","Null","0","3","24 December 2004"," Weird, but so incredibly good!
","I think that pretty much sums it up. The movie is without a doubt one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen, since it's about a guy with scissors for hands, but at the same time it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's an extraordinary, timeless movie and it surprised me in so many ways.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is simply brilliant as Edward. His clumsiness, his facial expressions, the way he moves...everything was just brilliant. No one could have done it better, I'm sure of that.<br/><br/>I think Edward Scissorhands will always be one of my favorite movies...at least in my top 5. It's a strange, but wonderful movie!"
"rockstar2545","10","0","3","17 June 2004"," GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!
","It was a great movie.I seen a lot of movies and that has to be top five.What makes a good movie is the actors/actresses facial expressions on the set, and that is what makes the movie seem real and gives off feelings and johnny depp did that, which made the movie even better.I love the movie because its not every day you see a movie of a lonely man with sissorhands. its unique and thats another reason its better than other movies.a lot of movies are the same but this one is different. the set was awesome and the cast was awesome everything about it was great.the actors/actresses were awesome because of their talent. they made this a great movie and i cant get enough of it."
