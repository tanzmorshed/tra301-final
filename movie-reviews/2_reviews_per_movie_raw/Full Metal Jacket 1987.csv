","SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to ""weed out all non-hackers"". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes ""Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes ""Gomer Pyle"" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom, seconds of terror"" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the ""duality of Man"" according to Jung. 10/10"
"brujay-1","8","173","213","22 December 2006"," The movies finally got Parris Island right
","Though I've read only a couple of dozen of the nearly 500 comments on this film, I didn't see any from ex-Marines who'd had the Parris Island experience. I went through PI in 1957. The time period in the picture would have been about 1967, since the in-country sequence includes the '68 Tet Offensive. Little had changed in those 10 years except the switch from M1s to M16s. <br/><br/>For the most part Kubrick got Parris Island right on the money. And why shouldn't he have, since his screen DI, Lee Ermey was in fact a real DI before he started acting (he played another DI in ""The Boys of Company C,"" an earlier and lesser Vietnam flick)? He had a built- in technical adviser. The screams and insults and profanity and physical punishment were all part of the DIs armamentarium. When you're facing up to 75 young strangers you need to immediately establish absolute authority and hang on to it for 13 weeks. Furthermore, you want to break the breakable as soon as you can. My platoon had its Private Pyles and though none ended up as he does in ""Full Metal Jacket,"" I remember that they simply disappeared from our ranks, never to be heard from again. Nothing Ermey as Sgt. Hartman does is exaggerated.<br/><br/>Kubrick, however, does exaggerate. Speaking of Pyle's ending, it's almost impossible for me to imagine that a recruit could manage to sneak a clip of live rounds away from the rifle range. Every shooter at the range has his own rifle coach, and every single round is very carefully accounted for. Kubrick started the killing one scene too early.<br/><br/>I've read that DIs nowadays are forbidden to use the time-honored f-word, and are not allowed to lay hands on recruits. I don't know if that's good or bad for training (I had my face slapped hard my first day of boot camp and that was just for openers), but then all of us old-timers like to brag about how tough it useta be!<br/><br/>A final note: It's interesting to compare ""Full Metal Jacket"" to another attempt at a portrayal of Parris Island, Jack Webb's ""The DI,"" made around '55 or '56. Webb tries for authenticity, but as I was to learn a year or so later, his PI was a boy scout camp."
"tr91","6","132","165","9 September 2013"," A film of two halves
","'Full Metal Jacket' was a film that I had been meaning to watch for a while after all the good stuff I had heard about it.<br/><br/>It really is a film of two halves, unfortunately I didn't like the 2nd half.<br/><br/>The 1st half at boot camp was excellent, we saw a lot of character development and emotion as well as a lot of humour and really serious issues. R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio were just brilliant.<br/><br/>The 2nd half I didn't enjoy as much, it looked great and there was a lot of action but it was just a bit boring and felt really dragged out, whereas the 1st part just had everything that you wanted.<br/><br/>Glad I got round to seeing it but wouldn't watch it again, slightly disappointed after a really good start to the film.<br/><br/>6/10."
"alanbenfieldjr","9","48","57","28 June 2017"," Full Metal Jacket 30 years later
","Strange, as I sat to watch Full Metal Jacket for the first time in years, what I remembered most was Lee Emery's Sgt Hartman's rantings and Vincent D'Onofrio. In fact, it was Vincent D'Onofrio's Pvt Lawrence, known as ""Gomer Pyle"" that made this Stanley Kubrick film, truly memorable. I'm noticing this more and more as I get older and revisit old films. The performances, certain performances, even in supporting roles allow a film to keep growing with the passing of time. Full Metal Jacket a shattering film or I should say, two shattering films. The first part, the training, the intro is a masterpiece practically impossible to match up, so, the second part doesn't match it. But, still. A film-experience. Vincent D'Onofrio's performance even more powerful now, 30 years later. Enormous! The British skies over Vietnam is another reminder than an artist's eye knows no boundaries."
"Aidan McGuinness","Null","213","275","5 November 2002"," Kubrick - yay! One of the best war-based movies ever
","I like Kubrick's stuff. Generally any movie he directed was several notches, in quality terms, above any other director (particularly those working nowdays). Does `Full Metal Jacket' continue to show the mastermind behind `2001', `The Shining' and `Dr. Strangelove'? Yup, it does.<br/><br/>As plots go. there isn't much here. I don't particularly care because the script makes up for it. `Full Metal Jacket' is very much a movie of two halves - the first half dealing with a group of conscripts in training at military camp and the hardships they endure under their `hard-as-nails' instructor. The second half is about their exploits in Vietnam itself. Fights? In 'Nam? Haven't we seen all that before? Yes, but rarely with such an experienced hand at work. And it's the camp scenes that are so wonderful.<br/><br/>Gustav Hasford et. Al. have produced an excellent script, particularly for the opening hour. There's barely a moment's pause before you're thrown into the screaming face of Sergeant Hartman. He's hurling abuse at his new recruits with lines so forceful and sharp they'll have you gasping in shock while simultaneously laughing in incredulity. It's the way the script runs in without a pause for breath that helps so wonderfully - and the fact that it's so powerful. It's never just about one-liners from a sergeant, it's also telling a story about how humans work under these conditions. The first half is about how they suffer under their own at home (and very well told it is too), the second half about the human condition under the duress of war. It's an interesting comparison, and a tale well told. The battle may lack some sort of overall context or resolution, but then I feel that's in keeping with the movie - it's about the individual, and not the war, and such elements cannot be easily quantified.<br/><br/>All the characters have a grounded `real world' feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil/beyond-hope look he gives later on (anyone who has seen the movie will know the one I mean), remains as the most frightening look I've ever seen depicted onscreen. All in all the cast accredit themselves well here.<br/><br/>And so to the direction. It's Kubrick. It's good. Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. There's some lovely use of filters (that haunting blue). There's a brilliant subtle score, that's eerie when used, but never intrusive. There's a very good command of pace - the viewer is never left idle or bored, and the story (particularly in the tremendous first half) flows along smoothly. Great touches abound throughout - check out the many examples, such as the opening scene of Hartman marching right up to the recruits (and to the camera), spitting and screaming vindictive comments, almost as if at the viewer. Some may criticise the almost disconnected feeling you have in the battle scenes towards the end, but I found their stillness, their quietness, and raw power, far more effective than the flash-bang wizardry employed in tripe such as `We Were Heroes'. I can blather on about Kubrick for ages. so I'll stop now.<br/><br/>Is `Full Metal Jacket' perfect? Not quite because of the `two halves' syndrome. Although they do contrast and complement one another, the first half is very much the stronger half. The second feels weaker against it. In and of itself the second half would normally be regarded well, but it doesn't have the visceral power that the first does. I love both bits, but I do love one bit more. This makes the movie suffer just a little. There's so much to like here though that I can't criticise too much - and so much to cherish (especially in the lines delved out). Once more the main man succeeds. Definetely worth seeing. 9/10."
"thomas8331","Null","267","351","13 October 2004"," The best war film I have seen
","NO SPOILERS! This is a review, not a synopsis. <br/><br/>First of all I love Kubrick's work, so I came into this with a bias. However I have seen a lot of action and war films, and this one, to an individual who never went to war, seems the most true-to-life, taken as a whole. This IS how you have to look at this film, incidentally; trying to break it down into two or three parts and say which was better is missing the point of the film, I think. <br/><br/>In the same way that ""Trainspotting"" was an anti-drug film that did not gloss over anything, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is (for me) an anti-war film that stares straight at the ugliness of war and the potential for violence within almost all people, especially those trained, conditioned, even twisted, into military roles, without preaching even a single time. Less allegory and more applicability! Wonderful! <br/><br/>The camera work was superb. I felt like I was walking through the movie with the Marines, from the barracks to the battlefield scenes.<br/><br/>I have seen others criticize this film for the voice over, but I felt that it was used sparingly, and was helpful, not overdone. The narrator doesn't say anything that seems out-of-place.<br/><br/>Others have commented on the music, the acting, and so on, so I won't add my repetitive comments, except that the drill sergeant is perfect!<br/><br/>The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom, seconds of terror"" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL.<br/><br/>10 out of 10, perfect."

","Goddamn you Stanley Kubrick. For me Clockwork Orange set the standard a long time ago for cinematic perfection; FMJ just raises the bar. Sitting around with bored in-laws I quietly slipped this into the DVD player, 20 minutes later conversation has ceased and everybody is absorbed. Predictable Kubrick really, stunningly lit, musical soundtrack that is oh-so-right, and the cinematography -Jesusmotherofmary. Ten years before anybody had thought of picking up a movie camera and running with it, Kubrick had perfected the technique. War is hell? -it sure looks a vision of hell. Stunning in every way."

","""With flowers and my love both never to come back ... It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black"". So sings the man whose throbbing song marks the film's end, merciless lyrics to describe thematically a story that is as wrenching as it is mesmerizing.<br/><br/>There are no villains in this film, only heroic victims. The villains are all off-screen, comfy behind mahogany desks, or dressed for success and giving shrill speeches about how maintaining peace requires war. Strange logic.<br/><br/>First it's boot camp, a dreary prospect at best, for an ordinary group of young American men. Here, a sadistic drill Sargent, in colorful language, barks out orders and insults straight from Hades. It's do or die, almost literally, for our greenhorns. It's an ordeal of blackness from which some may never recover. Still, the grunts learn a valuable lesson; namely, that life is mostly physical, not mental. It's a lesson some ivory tower college professors never learn.<br/><br/>But then it's on to an even blacker black ... Vietnam. Combat scenes are rendered believable by effective visuals and terrific sound effects: pounding percussion, amplified sounds of equipment and footsteps across explosive debris, and an always present, ever-so-subtle ... echo. Potent and torturous, these scenes convey a Zen-like immediacy, an impending sense of doom. And then at film's end, those lyrics ...<br/><br/>Composed of two, barely overlapping, parts, the script's structure is a bit unorthodox. But the film works, owing to an intensity that never lets up. R. Lee Ermey is of course terrific as the harsh drillmaster. Casting of the young lions is okay, though a tad weak in one or two cases. Insertion of pop songs of the era works well, to amplify the cultural disconnect between a war-torn Vietnam and an indifferent America.<br/><br/>Like reading a history book, watching an occasional war movie is good for the soul. It puts one's problems in perspective. For that reason, this particular war movie is better than most. It's riveting, intense. And the sense of impending blackness hovers ever present over the story's heroic victims, like the sword of Damocles."
"Peach-2","10","289","396","10 December 1998"," Kubrick is genius.
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket seems like an uncompleted film, but to me that's poetic justice to one of America's uncompleted wars. The film is harsh and doesn't turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like you are there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and that the second half falls apart. I believe Kubrick sets up the first half to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter the lives of these soldiers during war. It is easy to identify with being picked on because we all have in some way. Not all of us, on the other hand, have fought in war. Kubrick is the master."

","The first third of Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam War is as powerful and shocking as any film ever made about the military <br/><br/>In the film's opening shots, we see close-ups of new Marine recruits getting their heads shaved at a military training post The next shot follows Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) as he strides through a barracks and completes the first stage of the young men's intimidating indoctrination into the Marine Corps The scene also establishes the measured pace that Kubrick maintains throughout <br/><br/>Booming, gloriously profane, and imaginative, Sgt. Hartman is a force of nature that will mold these boys into killing machines At that point, most war films would turn to the young men, sketch out their pasts and then show their transformation into a cohesive unit These kids are names and archetypes who will react differently to Hartman's approach<br/><br/>Kubrick makes Ermey such a mesmerizing force that one key early element is easy to overlook From the first moment we see him in the barber's chair, before we even know his name, it is abundantly clear that Leonard is mad He has that familiar vacant, smiling, dull-eyed expression of evil that Kubrick also uses to define Little Alex in ""A Clockwork Orange"" and Jack Torrance in ""The Shining."" The other characters do not see it, and so the inevitable confrontation between Hartman and Leonard is all the more horrifying<br/><br/>The middle section of the film establishes Joker's role as a war reporter, working behind the lines during the Tet Offensive of 1968, and his desire for some ""trigger time"" with his old pals from basic That's where Kubrick shapes his view of the Vietnam war <br/><br/>In the third part, a new sociopath named Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) is introduced, and the focus shifts to a patrol searching through the bombed out city of Hue to root out a sniper That is where the filmmakers comment most pointedly on the war itself They see it as a dead-end that serve no purpose That's certainly a valid artistic interpretation of history Many other films have made the same points, often more eloquently But Kubrick isn't interested in eloquence, either<br/><br/>The three sections are unmistakably separated from each other The first stands on its own though key elements are stated again at the end<br/><br/>For the viewer expecting a ""traditional"" war film, the result is disconcerting, frustrating, and somehow unfinished Most Kubrick fans will admit that ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" are more enjoyable, but even if their man is not in top form, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is challenging, and repeated viewings reveal more details and connections"
"auberus","8","60","82","22 August 2003"," `The dead know only one thing: it's better to be alive'
","Mr. Stanley Kubrick was not a prolific director. After 71 years walking this Earth he left us with only 16 movies among which some of the most powerful cinematic experience to date. `Full Metal Jacket' is part of Mr. Kubrick's list of masterpiece and was released 12 years before his last movie `Eyes Wide Shut' as War always precedes Denial.<br/><br/>Having a total control on his Picture from the writing to the editing, what you see on the screen is what he wanted you to seeand what we see is close to a perfect demonstration: One can learn to kill. Through this learning one looses his individuality. By loosing his individuality one can loose is Innocence and reach Madness and of course during all those steps something can go wrong To make this demonstration as obvious on paper as on screen you have to be methodic (as methodic as Stanley Kubrick) and you have to have the right actors and the right acting. Matthew Modine (Pvt Joker), Vincent D'Onofrio (Pvt Gomer Pyle) and R.Lee Ermey (Gunnery Sgt. Hartman) are a good example of how pristine the casting was. In order to draw a clear conclusion Stanley Kubrick used the chapter technique and delivers a 2 chapters demonstration.<br/><br/>
Chapter One  The building of a Corp.  The Training. Here Mr. Kubrick shows us how a Marine Corp. is built, how one can learn to kill and how through this learning one looses his individuality. This building has to go through 2 major processes: Humiliation and Team building. The humiliation process consists in the destruction of your ego, because your ego is what makes you unique. If an organization breaks your ego then you are most likely to be just like everybody else. Private Gomer Pyle is the perfect example of how someone goes through this humiliating process: he is the most humiliated Private and we all remember this wonderful quote from the Gunnery Sergeant Hartman Drill Instructor (R.Lee Ermey):'Are you quitting on me?! Well, are you?! Then quit, you slimy *beep* walrus-looking piece of *beep*! etc' The second process in the building of a Corp., is in fact the team building process: It is an equally important process because at the end of this process each team member only exists through the team, alone each of them is `equally worthless' as our favorite Sergeant Instructor would say. Obviously something will go wrong because there is no such thing as invincibility (it's a chimer at best, a lie). The suicide scene is therefore the transition between the notion of individuality and the notion of Corp., between chapter one and chapter two. Admirably played by our 3 protagonist (Private Joker and Pyle and the Sergeant Drill Instructor) it emphasis the only true statement of the movie: `we live in a world of *beep*' and `the dead know only one thing: it's better to be alive'. <br/><br/>Chapter Two  Disintegration of a Corp.  The War. This second piece of the demonstration (one can loose his innocence) is fueled with two dynamics: the desire of the killing and the reality of war. The desire of the killing is impersonating by Pvt `Joker', he is a combat correspondent who doesn't really understand the meaning of this War. At the same time he is `born to kill' and think that the combat will bring meaning to this absurdity. This contradiction is very well sum up in the following memorable quote from Pvt Joker: `I wanted to meet stimulating and interesting people of an ancient culture and kill them. I wanted to be the first kid on my block to get a confirmed kill.' As soon as Pvt Joker links up with Pvt Cowboy, Mr. Kubrick makes us dive in `the reality of war' and the disintegration of the Corp. begins: The lieutenant goes first with him the authority, one by one the Marines falls under the fire of a sniper. The climax of this chapter is the fugitive vision of the sniper. The platoon has reached the border of Madness, where `a day without blood is like a day without sunshine'. Did Pvt Joker found the meaning he was looking for? Can we control the dogs of war once we've unleashed them? Once again there is no lesson only one statement as the thoughts of Pvt Joker `drift back to erect nipple wet dreams about Mary Jane Rottencrotch and the Great Homecoming *beep* Fantasy.' He is `so happy that he is alive, in one piece and short. He lives in a world of *beep* yes. But he is alive and not afraid'.<br/><br/> Innocence is lost foreverleft on the ground by the corpses and their `Full Metal Jackets'."
"shannonphoenix","10","124","179","11 March 2006"," A Movie that you will always wonder about
","""Full Metal Jacket"" is one of the legends of any service person in basic training. As a young recruit in the Army, we talked about it, and we talked about it further and it is one of those movies that you always find something new to say about. The beginning, the young men come to be trained as ""killers."" And it is at this point where you may realize later that not everyone is meant to be in the military, example, Leonard (Pyle.) He is a nice kid with probably a good sense of humor, probably liked among for his sense of humor and would have done better in college, but instead is in the Marine Corp where he does not fit in well. Then you have Hartman (excellent portrayal by Gunny Ermy) who has the heartless job of making killers out of these young men. It is here that you question if he is truly mean spirited or is doing what he knows he has to do by being as hard as he can so that these young men will survive the horrors of war. This is a point that I think is sometimes missed. Joker, a rather smart young man, attempts to take Leonard under his wing and the two become friends until Leonard messes up and is given a ""blanket party"" by the rest of the platoon. Hartman is the reason for this, but behind this hides another reason; he has to make them tough and solid so that they will work as a team and have each other's backs in combat. He knows this to be true, but no one else does. This sends Leonard into a psychotic break and for a while, Hartman begins to show interest in Leonard due to his progress. Joker, noticing the change in Leonard, does not bring this to anyone's attention and thus begins his journey through his own private war because he believes from his inaction, he may have been the cause for the aftermath of the confrontation of Leonard and Hartman and the eventual fate of Leonard.<br/><br/>After that, the movie shifts and they are in Vietnam and only then does Joker begin to see why Hartman was so mean as he sees his friends become more like Leonard and may be destined to share his fate. When the young sniper is shot is when a part of humanity returns to Joker and we are left to guess at what follows.<br/><br/>The performances by Ermy, Modine and D'Onofrio were remarkable, especially D'Onofrio. I often wonder what went on behind the scenes, especially with a seasoned Marine war vet such as R. Lee Ermy on the set. I often wonder how much he contributed to the movie as an actual adviser.<br/><br/>By the way, I am a Gulf War I Army Veteran and I am female, so it could be that I may be looking at this differently. Females usually were not in combat situations, but some were. I do wish the movie would have shown that a little, but as far as making you think, I think the movie did what it was suppose to do."

"Agent10","10","118","173","28 April 2002"," Kubrick's version of Vietnam
","Stanley Kubrick always managed to bring something new to his palate whenever he made a film. He brought dark comedy to the screen with Dr. Stranglove, an epic story with Spartacus, and a film more important for its efforts than box office potential in the film Paths of Glory. This is what makes Full Metal Jacket so entertaining.<br/><br/>Humor, horror and political commentary are the themes which shape Full Metal Jacket. From the overbearing drill sergeant to the war loving soldiers. It all seems to make sense within this film, never overstepping its bounds or being to subtle. Kubrick may have alienated some his hardcore fans with such a mainstream-type story, but then again, he helped mainstream movies take a bold step. What doesn't the current cinema owe Kubrick?"
"WriterDave","9","30","42","3 January 2006"," In a World of S**T, they are not Afraid....
","Kubrick's films are generally more accessible and mainstream than he is often given credit for. As gritty and unflinching as his take on the Vietnam War is, this is for my money his most mainstream work. Kubrick gives us a ""grunts-eye-view"" of military training and combat in a war that was particularly unpopular and well documented. This was the first war to be fully televised on TV, and Kubrick pokes fun at the soldier's awareness of this, and of the dubious nature of the propaganda put out by the military's own front-line reporting. Here we get a world-wind tour speckled with dark humor (but never too much politics, a similar stance that benefited the recent ""Jarhead,"" which owes a world of debt to this film), excellent use of pop music (who thought Kubrick could go all Scorcese on us), and brutal sequences of hard-edged violence.<br/><br/>My one complaint is that Matthew Modine is extremely underwhelming in the lead role, but the rest of the ensemble is top notch. Lee Ermey is perfect as the sadistic but oddly sympathetic drill instructor who turns maggots into killing machines in boot camp, and Arliss Howard is especially good as the underwritten ""Cowboy."" Kubrick, always the master of his art, leaves us with some lasting images, most notably D'Onofrio's stare-down before blowing his brains out, which is mirrored later on by a young female Vietnamese sniper begging to be put out of her misery after being fatally wounded. Kubrick also closes the film with something he doesn't often do, a wink to the audience, as our grunts, now combat weary and barely alive, march to the theme of the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" showing that indoctrination started long before they were dehumanized in boot camp and rebuilt as ""The Core."" Semper Fi, indeed."
"tedg","Null","23","32","27 August 2001"," The Battle Photographer
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Since Vietnam, there have been a few competent films by Americans about Americans on the ground in battle. I think which one you like best (or appreciate the most) probably says a lot about you and how you look through the filmmaker's camera.<br/><br/>Ready? `Red Line,' `Metal Jacket.' `Catch-22,' `Apocalypse,' `3 Kings,' `Platoon,' `Private Ryan.' Seven types of people. How would you rank them? Who are you? How do you see?<br/><br/>I listed them according to my own ranking, which is heavily weighted on the degree to which the filmmaker mastered the art of filmmaking to do something to my soul that no one else could through any other art experience. Private Ryan was just a noisey Norman Rockwell. Platoon's war was somebody's fault, and we watch colorful and depictions as accusations. But Red Line weaved a mystical hypnotic internal narrative that put me in the mind (and incidentally the body) of a character swept by violent events. So very expert at understanding how to make us see war around us permanently on leaving the theater.<br/><br/>But I rank this film high as well. Less visceral, at least at first. But there is so much style in the manner of the storytelling that it alone has more power than the story itself.<br/><br/>The story is clever, however, concerned with framing the narrative. `Joker,' (an apt name if there ever was one) starts with a voiceover. We immediately know it is his story, but we don't know which character matches the voice for sure until the toilet murder scene. So we spend about half of the film, not in the story proper, but in a metastory which defines the narrator. And bingo, at the end, he is turned into a reporter.<br/><br/>Then flash to a whore's butt and the story begins with a stolen camera! Immediately thereafter we have a whole different stance from Kubric's camera. Before, it was sterile, `outside' the action like most other films. Now it turns into a camera that is part of the group. It's internal to the gathering and travels with the men as a member of the party. And the camera is now less apparently controlled by the reporter than by the sweep of fate.<br/><br/>We go through a middle section which sets up the `war story' proper, and this is framed once again by dickering with a whore. Then we are carried along with Rafterman's cameras. (And incidentally, Kubric's daughter with a camera at the burial pit.)<br/><br/>And now to battle, and the style takes on a new Dantesque hue at the third layer of Hell. Just one example: that trio of sounds leading up to final encounter with the sniper are three metallic grating/screeching sounds that transmute to nearly identical violin sounds leading up to Joker's decision to shoot. Another: the sets in this third are transforming. I invite you to compare them to Spielburg's for a literal eyeopener. `Enemy at the Gates' had a similar battle-sniper-set style, clearly derivative of Kubric, but more stagey. Here we have carefully composed primitive shapes and fractal textures that suggest more than mere war: the destruction of civilization but the preservation of a more basic order. Another: the action is interrupted by journalistic interviews where the characters look you right in the eye to underscore that you are there -- you are the narrator; you have to decide whether to shoot or not.<br/><br/>Kubric is a very personal filmmaker, and his personality is tied up in abstractions unique to the film narrative. I take war personally, so prefer this film above most of the others, except for Malick which is more personally abstract and therefore even more present."
"guy-bellinger","9","178","301","30 November 2004"," Still modern today, all too modern.
","One of the greatest war movies ever, a statement very few will dispute. I will therefore not illustrate this point : thousands have done it before me, often brilliantly.I'd rather lay the stress on Kubrick's modernity in ""Full Metal Jacket"". Indeed the USA being once again at war, it is interesting to compare the way they wage war these days with the way they did back in the sixties. And the comparison is edifying. Just apply the following statements to Iraq and you will realize NOTHING HAS CHANGED : - the marines are trained to become killing machines without being taught minimum knowledge about the people they come to defend. - the boys know nothing about the Vietnamese and reason according to American standards : for instance ""Cow-Boy"" complains half-jokingly half-seriously that there are no horses in Vietnam. Another example is the soldiers singing the Mickey Mouse Club hymn after fighting, which strikes as particularly out of place. - they try in vain to impose democracy through gruesome violence and destruction. Such similarities abound and testify to the film's absolute - and unfortunate - modernity. I wish Kubrick was still with us. I also wish George Bush and his advisers had seen this masterpiece and - most of all - understood its message. They would have avoided another bloody war doomed to fail."
"DeathFish","9","15","20","10 August 2006"," Amazing Kubrick does it again
","This is another Kubrick masterpiece that has pleased people all over the world. This time it is a different kind of a war based movie, and I have to say that it is one of the best if not the best war movie of all time. Many people write that the second half of the movie is bad, or even horrible. I agree that the first part of the movie is the best part, because it shows a completely new side of the lives of marines. No other movie has ever showed that base camp training episode as well as Kubrick does it. It is very psychological and painful to watch these men braking down and then rise as cold-blooded killers. No one shows that as well as ""Gomer Pyle"". As many others I think that the drill Sergeant gives this movie an extra spark with his comical lines and hard personality, he actually makes you laugh, and even so you really get to hate him. The second half is the actual battle in Vietnam. This is where the movie is more similar to other war movies, but yet it is unique. Kubrick is all over the place throughout the entire movie, the camera and sound effects along with the music keeps reminding us that this really is a Kubrick film. The second half is without doubt also amazing, because of the uncensored madness it makes you sick with sorrow and hate. The sniper scene is of course one of the strongest and most terrifying scenes of the second half. Also the interviewing part is a very good idea I think, Kubrick finds yet another way of showing the different mind states of these men. That makes the characters even more real and makes you even more sympathetic for them and their destinies. In every way a breathtaking movie from start to finish. Kubick uses all the methods of making a good war movie, and then some. Besides that the movie is filled with intelligent and poetic lines, beautiful details and symbols, and some of my all time favorite movie quotes. This movie leaves a stain and it will always be high on my personal list of movies. Watch it, enjoy it, watch it again and love it. 10/10"

Modine, D'Onofrio, Baldwin, and Howard give worthy performances, while Ermey gives an Oscar worthy (not even nominated) performance and steals the show.

"ReelCheese","8","9","11","18 July 2006"," Fascinating Despite Come-Down
","The first half of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is so intensely entertaining that director Stanley Kubrick can be forgiven for the slight come-down that follows. The opening scenes draw us into the strict world of ""maggots"" training to join the ranks of real men, otherwise known as Marines. We see the characters humiliated, yelled at like children, beaten and, in one tragic case, broken down. It's an unpleasant yet fascinating place to visit from the comfort and safety of our living room couches. Yet once the action shifts to the Vietnam War, when you would expect even better, something is lost. The characters seem less real and the atmosphere less intriguing. Overall, however, there aren't many faults to find with this effort, but be forewarned that it's certainly not for younger viewers."
"supah79","7","85","142","18 October 2005"," Like all Kubrick films it requires multiple viewings
","I always thought of Kubrick as the poet amongst the proza's in Hollywood. Kubrick always tries to tell a bigger picture than he's putting on the screen. But it requires the viewer to see beyond the images. I had to see this film a second time to fully grasp what Kubrick was trying to show me.<br/><br/>The film is divided in two parts: basic training at Parris Island and combat in Vietnam. Both are equally difficult to watch. Kubrick shows us young boys being stripped from every possible individuality, only to be sent into a war that will only damage them and the war-torn country even more.<br/><br/>The film has an eery kind of absurdness to it. The tone of the film balances between hard core anti-war and black comedy. Maybe thats because most of the soldiers in Vietnam (or any war) have the same kind of humor: harsh, but funny in a wrong kind of way. Kubrick lets R. Lee Ermey have his way the young recruits and gives him all the best ""wrong lines"". The rapid fire of slurs and insults is unbelievable for a normal person. Which all the recruits are in the beginning. Ermey glorifies the fact that Oswald killed Kennedy from 250 feet at a moving target. Oswald learned his skills IN THE MARINES. Yes, be proud.<br/><br/>Kubrick's Vietnam lies in ruins. The American involvement seems to have only negative results. It's native people are being slaugthered by either the VC or the Americans. Youngs girls prostitute themself to GI's. Once a beautiful country with a rich culture and historic buildings, it's not much to look at with tanks and marines roaming the streets. The scenes in the final act where the platoon is being cut to pieces by a sniper are very powerful. Those scenes make a bigger statement. They define the conflict: With all it's firepower, tactics and technology, the platoon lost three soldiers to one girl with an AK. An unwinnable war. <br/><br/>Though and sometimes difficult to watch, this film is not anti-war for pacifists, but anti-war for humanists. Think beyond ""oh, war is hell"" and you will be satisfied with what Kubrick is telling us."
"gut-6","Null","19","27","5 July 2004"," Fantastic - ignore the criticisms
","This superb film was a big improvement on Kubrick's previous film, The Shining. It is a far more confronting spectacle than the poetic, stylised violence of A Clockwork Orange, despite the latter's notoriety. The brutality of FMJ is unceasing. <br/><br/>While the war scenes may seem pointless and directionless, this film more than any other war film I have seen captures the small-scale and scrappy nature of urban warfare. There is no grand narrative from the point of view of the individual unit or the individual soldier - just lots of snipers and corpses and skirmishes over ruined buildings. These individual skirmishes have no obvious strategic value and no obvious relationship to one another or to the world war against communist imperialism. They may be fighting for freedom, but the soldiers are motivated by other things - camaraderie, macho posturing and the urge to kill instilled in them at boot camp.<br/><br/>I cannot understand those who criticise this Kubrick film above others for consisting of multiple episodes with very different feel and setting. It appears such people have never seen Kubrick's other films, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or A Clockwork Orange or Barry Lyndon or Paths of Glory or Lolita. Indeed, 2001: A Space Odyssey is even more disjointed than FMJ, not even having common characters between the segments. The films are no less brilliant for it. This is a consequence of the way that Kubrick worked, as revealed in ""Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures"" and Fred Raphael's admittedly unreliable ""Eyes Wide Open"". In Kubrick's view a movie was ready to be made when he had 7 or 8 episodes to string together. Often you can see the joins. Kubrick's legendary perfectionism arose from the fact that he didn't know what he wanted, only what he didn't want. Hence the voluminous research, the continuous script rewrites, the endless prop redesigns, the dozens of takes (all for petty and arbitrary reasons if he gave reasons at all) until by chance someone came up with a great idea. Only then would he move on. All this is why the greatness of Kubrick's films lies in the sum of the brilliant parts rather than the whole.<br/><br/>FMJ fits right in to Kubrick's oeuvre. There is the ongoing theme of dehumanisation, the cynical world view, the hilarious black humour, the cold, distant and unsympathetic characters, the key use of pre-existing music, and the central role of war and conflict. Yet again, and very much like Werner Herzog he makes the surreal seem utterly believable, and reality seem surreal.<br/><br/>For those who say there are better anti-war films, Kubrick said himself he was making a war film, not an anti-war film. He was trying to show the full picture, and leaving it to the audience to judge. The dehumanisation and brutality of boot camp, the moral ambiguity of the war and the vanity, crassness & questionable mental stability of some of the American soldiers is shown unsparingly, but so is the uncompromising barbarity of the communist enemy. You understand why the soldiers need the dehumanising training they are given. Animal Mother may indeed be an Animal Mother, but when it comes to the crunch he is clear-headed, effective and fiercely loyal to his comrades, and even musters a grudging sympathy for the dying sniper in acceding to Joker's humane despatching of her.<br/><br/>All in all, an unforgettable film, totally different in feel to any other war movie I have seen. There is no glorification, no demonisation, and no redemption, but also no simplistic pacifist platitudes and despite everything, great beauty in the hellish ruins."

","I give this a 9 because I saw this with my father, a Vietnam vet, who served in the Army. He was totally taken aback by this film as the sniper scenes really depicted his experience in Vietnam. To him, this film remains the most accurate portrayal of the city fighting and total fear such circumstances brought out in the soldiers. Also, the Matthew Modine character is very close to my father. He, too, served the press corps for the Army and like Modine, was embedded with several troops in combat situations. Stanley Kubrick was known a superb technician and perfectionist and this film is a great example of his brilliance. Additionally, the Marine bootcamp scenes are harrowing as well."

","This is the journey undertaken by Private ""Joker"" J.T. Davis, from brutal training camp to Vietnam itself.<br/><br/>As most people know by now, Full Metal Jacket is divided very much into two different halves, halves that to me show the best and worst of the talented director, Stanley Kubrick. For the first part we are subjected to the training regime inflicted on wet behind the ears boys, boys soon to become Marines out in the harshness of the Vietnam War. This is real dehumanising stuff, frighteningly essayed by the brilliance of drill instructor R Lee Ermey's performance. We know, see and feel that the boys are primed to be killing machines, unemotional killing machines at that, with Kubrick astutely weaving the brutality of camp into the moral quandary that was the war itself. One particular recruit, Private Gomer {a heartfelt and unnervingly great Vincent D'Onofrio} is the film, and Gustav Hasford's {writer of the novel and co screenwriter here} point of reference in this incredible first half. It's with this strand that ""Jacket"" burns itself into the soul of the viewer, to hopefully set us up for what will be Private ""Joker's"" {Matthew Modine} preparation for the Vietnmam conflict.<br/><br/>Then it's that second half........<br/><br/>Where do we go from here? We already know that ""Joker"" and his mentally brutalised colleagues have been stripped of their basic humanity. Soldiers primed to kill, it's harsh, but true. But Kubrick has already chilled our blood and bludgeoned us repeatedly courtesy of the ""Boot Camp"" set up. Modine's {who isn't strong enough to carry the picture} ""Joker"" is now the films axis, a clever, most definitely articulate character, who is thrust into the murky and muddled battle of the Tet Offensive, yeah and so? All it amounts to is a prolonged series of rationale and philosophical musings on the false war. Kubrick even shifting to safe mode with a clumsy narration segment spouted by ""Joker"".<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is a truly fine film, but it's not the brilliant one it really should have been. If one can take the time to venture deeper with the second half, then it doesn't deliver on the already made point promise of the first part. Technically it's flawless, incredibly designed, with Douglas Milsome's cinematography stunningly effective. But I'll maintain to my dying day that Full Metal Jacket finished up as being bloody and pretty instead of being a poignant and horrifying masterpiece. 7/10"

","A gritty, intense, no-holds-barred war film that grabs attention from the very beginning and holds it all the way through.  The only detriment to this film is the fact that the first half (Boot Camp) is so much more powerful than the second half (Vietnam). <br/><br/>The film is basically about how war sucks the life out of humans and turns them into 'killing machines'.  The greatest performances in this film are of course R. Lee Ermey, the savage drill instructor, and Vincent D'Onofrio, his slow-witted whipping boy.  The viewer alternately laughs and cringes at the relentless abuse and degradation inflicted by the former on the latter.  And at the famous line, ""What is your major malfunction?"", the tension reaches an almost unbearable limit and the viewer ceases to move or breathe.<br/><br/>This movie, like many of Kubrick's, is too graphic for many people, but I highly recommend it to those who can withstand its assault on both senses and consciences."

","The first part of the movie entertained me. The instructor seemed quiet authentic, ""Paulas"" progression was a bit simplistic but interesting and the atmosphere of the boot camp kinda ""caught"" me. Then in Vietnam i began to wonder why I'm watching this and what it has to do with the first half of the movie. If it was Kubricks idea of showing you that you can only experience war, and not train it, he failed. He just began to bore the hell out of me. No matter how hard i tried i couldn't care about any character, all of them were unbelievable boring and plain. It didn't show me that Vietnam was hell either. Well not more or less hell than i could imagine any other war is. The End was lame and i began staring at the ""elapsed time"" counter several times. And why the hell is all this concrete burning????<br/><br/>Now i have the feeling that, since FMJ was made in 1989, Kubrick was simply just too late with his Vietnam movie. And thanks to Platoon, Apocalypse now, Deer Hunter etc. everything there was to say has been said already.

","A preliminary note: anyone who liked this movie well enough to read comments should know that a considerable amount of detail in both it and _Apocalypse Now_ had origins in a 1968 Japanese novel called Into a Black Sun, by a Japanese war correspondent working in Vietnam at the time. It took about 20 years to be translated into English, but it's in American paperback now. I recommend it.<br/><br/>I just saw this movie for the first time since it was deployed in movie theaters in '87. As then, I was knocked out by what a great film it is. I can't help but contrast it with such movies as Apocalypse Now and Barbarians At The Gate, both movies that I admire, but let's face it, they are florid and melodramatic. Full Metal Jacket is anything but. It is so cold and hard in tone that it freezes your bones. At the same time, both the cinematography and sound track are so good, so effective, that the watcher can't look away from the movie.<br/><br/>This is classic Kubrick, in my opinion: the correct correlation of visual and audio information, with a plot that is so horrifying that one lies awake for awhile."
"rch427","3","25","40","30 November 2013"," Immensely overrated
","""FMJ""'s reputation, combined with Kubrick's name, elevate the film far above its actual merits. Here are my specific criticisms: <br/><br/>1. The plot is simplistic and formulaic. #1: Basic training. #2: Suddenly in Vietnam and lulled into a false sense of security. #3: A heavy firefight for the denouement. And. That's. It. It feels as if Kubrick started with three sheets of paper, labeled the top of each with those three phases, and kept them hermetically separated. There's no sense of flow, of growth, of anything organic. So when separated buddies from basic training are reunited later in the film, their ""hail fellow, well met!"" shtick feels hollow and forced.<br/><br/>2. Partly because of #1, many of the plot devices are utterly predictable. Private Pyle telegraphs his breakdown to us at least 10 minutes before it occurs. The hubris and languor of the cast, safe in their city quarters in Vietnam, take every opportunity to tell us how nothing bad could happen, because -- after all -- it's Tet, a national holiday. C'mon, Kubrick -- it's 20 years after the Tet Offensive. You can't expect us to NOT know what's coming, when you set it up like that. That day of doom, in which tens of thousands of Viet Cong and NVA troops launched surprise attacks that killed thousands of US soldiers, is rendered utterly devoid of suspense. Prefiguring sucks the air out of a film.<br/><br/>3. Many of the scenes are as clumsy as anything one could ever see from a college Filmmaking 101 class. Case in point: After ""Touchdown"" and ""Handjob's"" bodies are brought back and the squad stands in a circle around them, the camera pans from one squad member's face to another for about 5 seconds each, while each says something utterly canned sounding: ""You're going home now."" ""Semper Fi."" ""We're mean marines, sir."" ""Go easy, bros."" ""Better you than me."" ""Well, at least they died for a good cause."" Who provided this dialogue (or more accurately, serial monologue) -- Joe's All-Purpose Elegies? <br/><br/>4. Most of the settings look contrived and ""cinematic"" rather than natural. In particular, the city scene in Vietnam with the prostitute and the scene where ""Joker"" and ""Rafterman"" are hurrying along a road, trying to find the location of the mass grave -- both are stuffed to the gills with ""period stuff going on"", but one definitely gets the sense that it's all part of an effort to give the effect, rather than being authentic. Other scenes, such as the firefight at the end, look like they were staged for live theater, with strategically-placed fires (what the hell was burning for hours in those concrete buildings?!), atmospheric smoke, fill lighting, etc.<br/><br/>5. Many of the side characters are nothing more than caricatures. A prime example is ""doorgunner"", who is straight from central casting as ""Gun-crazed Child-killer"". What? Not convinced by watching him shoot fleeing peasants with his machine gun? Well, then he'll *tell* you that he's a gun-crazed child-killer as well. Just so there's no doubt. Thank you, Captain Obvious.<br/><br/>6. Some of the plot turns and the way they're acted are laugh-out-loud ridiculous. For example, when ""Touchdown"" is hit by a mortar round, ""Doc Jay"" immediately starts giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and CPR. It's extremely unlikely that concussion from the mortar simply stopped Touchdown's heart, so neither treatment would do much good (and why doesn't Touchdown's chest move even a fraction of an inch when Doc Jay is pushing on it?) Another example is when ""Rafterman"" finally shoots the sniper with about a dozen rounds and she lies bleeding on the floor with the squad gathered around her. Not only is she still alive, she's saying something. What, you ask? She's _praying_, in Vietnamese. And not just praying, but mouthing the words and enunciating as clearly as possible, as if she has an audience to perform for. Finally, after the slowest death scene in history, she switches to English, saying ""Shoot me!"" about fifty times. And all the while, we're forced to put up with seeing ""Joker's"" tortured expression as he has to wrestle with what to do. Ain't war just HECK?! <br/><br/>7. The heavy-handed use of period songs isn't effective, it's annoying. Playing ""Surfing Bird"" at top volume doesn't add anything to the viewer's experience. Nor does ""Wooly Bully"" or ""These Boots Were Made for Walking"". This kind of gimmick is best left to middlebrow action flicks, not serious war films.<br/><br/>8. Finally, a note to filmmakers: the use of voice-over from a character is very seldom effective and almost never necessary. When in doubt, leave it out.<br/><br/>No American born before 1960 is ignorant of the fact that the war in Vietnam was a huge mistake, a tragicomedy of errors and a national disgrace, and that there were acts of bravery, naiveté and inhumanity in approximately equal amounts. We've all heard of Mai-Lai. We've all seen (the vastly better) ""Apocalypse Now"", made 8 years before FMJ, as well as ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Platoon"", both of which also predated FMJ. And every American born too late to have witnessed the War firsthand, knows almost as much, since America has publicly excoriated itself for the past 4 decades over its involvement. The result is that FMJ breaks no new trails in terms of information or emotional content. We've been down those well-traveled roads already. <br/><br/>In general, FMJ feels graceless, inauthentic, clumsy, ham-fisted and about as uncreative of a film as can be imagined. It's difficult to believe that it came from the same director as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""Dr. Strangelove"". How much of this is specifically Kubrick's fault is open to debate but as the film's auteur, the ultimate blame can only be his."

","This film is really scary and easily one of the best films ever made. There are many reasons to say that. Private Pyle is definitely one of the most disturbing character ever written in the history of cinema. Other characters as disturbing as him are Antonio Ricci of 'Bicycle thief', Devdas Mukerjee etc. Beginning is mindblowing. All the characters are defined in the first scene itself. Joker and Pyle stand out as wrong people in the wrong place. Later Joker gets a promotion for his straightforwardness in the first scene. Its interesting because may be thats how officers are identified amongst 'pukes'. Pyle comes across as regular jovial 'fatbody'. What marines make of him is I think the whole concept of the film. Very weird piece of writing. <br/><br/>Most of the things have already been discussed so I'll be really short. I'm surprised no one has said anything about the background music. This movie has brilliant background music. All the Pyle's scene are brilliant. 'Last night on the island' will remain one of the best scenes ever shot in the history of cinema. I must admit that I got really scared when I watched it for the first time. Vincent D'Onofrio shocked me in every scene. Very gifted man. I watched the whole film and then I watched the first half twice and some scenes again and again. R. Lee Ermey and Matthew Modine are good too but this is definitely Vincent D'Onofrio's film. ""This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine"". Mind blowing. By the way the order of Joker, cowboy and Pyle keeps changing as Hartman walks in the first scene.

","I was a Marine at Parris Island in 1977 and I can certainly tell this film is very accurate in every respect right down to the blanket party scene. The base that they used in England looks very much like Parris Island, right down to the Grinder and the barracks in the background. The part where they are running on the road with Joker carrying Pyle looks like the road to Elliots Beach. The Cadence is true to life as well as Senior Drill Instructor Hartmans dialect, all of the comments I can say 100% that I have heard on The Island and had them used on me. For a person who was there it had me fooled, although the O-Course and the rifle range are completely different in layout and looks. The inside of the barracks and the head are identical to the real thing. For anyone viewing this film trust me it doesn't get any closer to being Parris Island and I would say that the ""Gunny"" saw to that. As far as the in country segment it looks pretty much like the real photos I saw in USMC training films."
"billreynolds","8","11","16","22 February 2006"," an unusual take on war
","I first saw ""Full Metal Jacket"" in the summer of 1987, when I was 17 and the name Stanley Kubrick meant little to me. The Parris Island sequence absolutely stunned me, but I felt the Vietnam portion of the movie was a real let-down. I compared it unfavorably with ""Platoon,"" which I had seen perhaps 5-6 months earlier.<br/><br/>In the years since, I have returned to FMJ a number of times and had varying impressions of it. Certainly the boot camp sequence retains its tremendous power; Lee Ermey's portrayal of Drill Instructor Hartman has to be one of the most memorable supporting roles in movie history. Still, I feel the characters in this section are undeveloped. The implication is clear that Pvt. Pyle goes insane after (and presumably because of) the blanket party -- but would that event, traumatic as it was, be enough to turn a seemingly simple, lovable soul into a homicidal maniac? Pyle's transformation is way too neat, too clear -- one minute he's a simpleton who can't do anything right, the next he's the perfect Marine and a deranged killer. If this result could occur so easily, Hartman never would have survived the many years he had obviously spent as a D.I.<br/><br/>I think there is a fundamental structural flaw in building the movie up to a powerful dramatic climax 45 minutes in, then completely abandoning it and starting all over as if the climax had never occurred. Neither Private Pyle nor Sgt. Hartman is ever mentioned again after the movie leaves Parris Island, and Pvt. Joker -- our ostensible protagonist -- shows not the slightest hint of having been affected by the traumatic events he witnessed in boot camp. I was very surprised to learn recently, from Matthew Modine's newly published ""Full Metal Jacket Diary,"" that Kubrick shot the Vietnam portion of the movie (or most of it, anyway) first, and the Parris Island portion second. I think it would have been much wiser to do it the other way around; then the experience of the Parris Island scenes might have informed the performances of Modine and Arliss Howard, the two actors who bridge both sequences. I'm sure Kubrick intended there to be a jarring contrast between the horror at the end of the Parris Island sequence and the careless insouciance of Joker in Vietnam, but still there should have been some hint that what came before had resonated.<br/><br/>Reading Modine's FMJ Diary was a shock because of the intelligence and insight with which it was written -- qualities that do not come through in his performance in this movie. Modine seems to find the wrong note in almost every scene. This is probably the fault of Kubrick, who seemed to seek the off-key and strange from his actors. Is it really plausible that Joker would mouth some John Wayne impression within the first few seconds of Hartman's Parris Island abuse? (The Wayne impressions get very tiresome.) I think Joker is supposed to seem intelligent and wry but he just comes across as a pain in the neck. Why is he so insubordinate to his commanding officer at Stars and Stripes? Why is he so eager to get ""in the s***""? His character just doesn't ring true. This is disappointing because several other actors -- Ermey and D'Onofrio, and Adam Baldwin as ""Animal Mother"" -- give outstanding performances.<br/><br/>The final battle with the sniper is brilliantly staged. Kubrick's daughter (under a stage name) provided a haunting electronic score. Visually the film is impressive, with Kubrick using many long, evocative tracking shots (such as of Hartman pacing up and down in front of his recruits as he screams at them). One particularly remarkable tracking shot -- evidently done by Steadicam -- follows an attacking Marine platoon entering the city of Hue for nearly a full minute. On the other hand, Kubrick uses a dolly in or out only once or twice in the whole movie (even in 1987, when the zoom had become very outdated, he used zoom shots more than dollying in or out). He seems to have loved tracking along with the action, retaining always the same distance and perspective on it, but unlike Spielberg or Hitchcock, he did not have the taste for using the dolly in to focus or dramatize the audience's perspective. (One notable exception is a very slow dolly in on a circular entrance to some kind of ruined temple when Joker and Rafterman first meet the Lusthog squad.) Certainly this is a fascinating, thought-provoking movie. The lack of an engaging central character, however, as well as the return to square one after the high drama at Parris Island, blunts its emotional effect."

","The comments by many vets on this site, saying that this film to some degree reflects the nature of war, should be the highest praise for this film. I scanned the reviews looking for the comments of vets and found, in the first 14 pages, 6 vets stating that key elements of this film mirrored to some degree their experiences in Vietnam. I found this movie amazing. I agree with many of the more widely-held conclusions about this film. R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sgt. Hartman is incredible, as is Vincent D'Onofrio as the tragic Pvt. Pyle. There certainly are two sections to this film, but the inspiration for both parts come from the same book and so, if both parts of the movie can be inspired by the same real lives, then it seems we should accept that both parts reflect different aspects of the military experience. I think that is fair. Capturing the emotional and psychological brutality of bootcamp, along with the horrors and the banality of war seem to be reasonable things to include in the same film.<br/><br/>If anyone thinks that this film glamorizes war-from the death of Pvt. Pyle to the predicted destruction of the unit charged with taking out the sniper, as well as the sniper at the end of the film-they must be a psychopath."
"StayPuft003","8","3","3","10 June 2006"," Two Parts
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a film of two parts. The first part deals with the basic training of the Marine Corps being built to become killers. R. Lee Ermey gives one of the best performances i've seen as the intense drill instructor. For most of the first part, his speeches and training tactics are very funny, but soon you realize that he does not care about these men's lives and only wishes for them to be killing machines. We realize this when he asks the trainees about some famous snipers, like Lee Harvey Oswald, who was trained to shoot in the Marines and how he respects that man for getting in so many shots in such a short amount of time and hitting his moving target twice. He truly honors Oswald. He dehumanizes them, especially a fat private by the name of Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). Pyle makes a few mistakes, and soon we see that the Sergeant is out to get him and seems to want the rest of the trainees to dislike him. And this Sergeant knows how to hold a grudge. There are a few spectacular scenes, and the first ten minutes are the best opening minutes to a movie I have ever seen. I was into every second of the basic training scenes, from the opening montage to the disturbing but brilliant last scene, the final confrontation between a few main characters.<br/><br/>The second part to this movie, however, is much different. It is about life during the war. The main character of the movie, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) goes to fight with his old friend ""Cowboy"" and his men in the city of Hue. I did not like this part of the film nearly as much as the first for many reasons. First of all, there was a feeling to the first part that just doesn't seem like it was there in the second part. I really felt for the characters during the training, but when they were fighting I felt less attached to them. Most of this part of the film is the men hiding behind walls and getting shot. While it is interesting, I felt that I had had enough after a little while. There is one very good part to me, when the men are being interviewed by a documentary crew. You get to see how different people saw the war, and it seemed to remind me of the dehumanization process the war brings as well as some comedy from some things the men said when answering the questions. The opening scene to the second part is also kind of amusing. Besides that, I don't have much to say about the fighting in Vietnam. Because, after all, there just isn't that much to it besides guns and blood.<br/><br/>Basic Training: 10/10 Vietnam War: 6/10 Final Grade: 8/10"
"barnabyrudge","7","10","15","14 March 2006"," Foul-mouthed, gruelling snapshot of Vietnam.... intentionally unpretty and bleak (which is, ironically, both its strength and its weakness).
","Stanley Kubrick made surprisingly few movies considering that he was credited as a genius film-maker. For example, he allowed seven years to elapse between The Shining and this Vietnam War film. Well-made as it is, Full Metal Jacket is not without certain flaws and is by no means top-drawer Kubrick. However, it is punctuated with incredible moments in spite of its shortcomings, including a gruelling opening-act which details marine training at Parris Island and ends with a hair-raising showdown between a grunt and a gunnery sergeant. Also, the film's bloody climax, with its inconclusive clash between the American forces and an enemy sniper, is simultaneously tense, frightening, ironic and meaningless.<br/><br/>The story (taken from Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers) opens with a bunch of green marine recruits undergoing military training at Parris Island. The drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) is a ruthless, motor-mouthed loony who relentlessly humiliates and desensitises his boys, so that when he has finally stripped them of their humanity he can rebuild them as single-minded killing machines. Among the bunch is happy-go-lucky Private Joker (Matthew Modine), and the vaguely ridiculous (and ridiculed) Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). As the recruits near the end of their gruelling training regime, Pyle finally cracks under the strain and kills the gunnery sergeant, before turning his gun on himself. The action jumps forward to find Joker on a tour of duty in Vietnam. He is by this point a military journalist who has seen some pretty unpleasant sights during his time in 'Nam (and is divided by his experiences - notice his Born To Kill helmet and his Peace buttoned jacket). The platoon he is part of becomes involved in a street battle in the ruins of Hue City near the film's climax, where they find themselves pinned down and picked off by a female Vietcong sniper. Finally, after much panic and bloodshed, darkness falls and the marines retreat into the night singing the Mickey Mouse March.<br/><br/>Where Kubrick really hits his target is in his depiction of the emotional change within Modine's character, and in his cold and cynical (and authentic) view of the dehumanisation that results from being subjected to warfare. Women and children become acceptable targets for the gun-toting soldiers; fear of death gives way to callous indifference; violence becomes normal; horrific deaths and injuries become commonplace to the point of disinterest. No-one in the film can remember the cause they're fighting for or, if they can, they never refer to it. It's just one side versus the other, locked in a costly, savage stalemate, as they enter into violent engagements simply because it's expected of them. The lack of real location work is a problem - Kubrick wouldn't film outside England, so the final gun exchange in Hue City was actually shot in a disused London factory yard, complete with imported palm trees. Also, the film is so detached from compassion (intentionally, I know) that it becomes hard to relate to anyone in the film. While we're supposed to be shocked by the utter indifference with which people are killed or injured during warfare, the total refusal to present a glimmer of feeling or sympathy makes the film's second half as icily distant as it is bloodthirsty. Full Metal Jacket is certainly powerful and potent, but its sheer authenticity makes it a pretty hard watch."
"SquirePM","1","61","121","3 September 2000"," Kubrick knows nothing about war.
","Speaking as an actual infantry veteran of Vietnam, I'd like to make two short comments about this film.<br/><br/>The first half is excellent.  It is an authentic, though condensed, portrayal of basic training.  Obviously the presence of a real retired drill sergeant (Ermey) had a lot to do with that.<br/><br/>But then Kubrick's faulty imagination takes over.  Starting with the climactic latrine scene and carrying throughout the rest of the movie, this film is total hogwash.  I was aghast at the skewed, completely erroneous, just plain wrong depiction of this platoon's actions in the war in Vietnam. Kubrick either had no advisors, or ignored them, when it came to the second half of this movie.  I have never seen such a load of tripe.<br/><br/>See FMJ for the first half, and just rewind it and put it back in the box when you get to Vietnam."
"extravaluejotter","9","6","8","3 June 2006"," Born to Kill?
","During the first part of this movie, set in a USMC training camp for the ""phony tough and crazy brave"", Gunnery Sergeant Hartman cites Lee Harvey Oswald as an exemplary US Marine marksman. The scene perfectly illustrates the total reversal of moral standards in modern warfare.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick has done anti-war before. ""Paths of Glory"" was hardly a recruiting poster for the French army and ""Full Metal Jacket"" doesn't do much for the US Marine corps either. Based on ex-marine Gustav Hasford's book ""The Short-timers"" (which I recommend as a gripping read), ""FMJ"" concentrates on how ordinary American men were moulded into killers then sent to fight in a war that they never understood.<br/><br/>Ignore the bad reviews for this film and ignore the good reviews as well. Watch it and make up your own mind. Love it or hate it, you'll definitely remember it for its depiction of human beings forced to take part in acts of pointless savagery. Many Vietnam war veterans still have to deal with the disparity between the conventional war that they were trained to fight, and the dirty guerrilla war that they actually fought in places like Hue City. No other film about Vietnam shows that disparity more clearly than ""Full Metal Jacket""."
"zetes","10","44","86","9 July 2001"," This film's divergent halves confuse too many people
","People just refuse to use their brains. They love the first half of Full Metal Jacket, and then basically give up on the second half. It is depressing.

In fact, despite what so many people think, Full Metal Jacket is a perfectly structured opus - one of the most original pieces of art ever created. I am not going to get into it, but I will just say that it is YOUR JOB AS A VIEWER to figure out the connection between the two halves. 10/10."
"CineCritic2517","1","60","126","2 October 2007"," huh?
","Very odd, this seems like a very average movie to me, if not slightly less. It is brilliantly shot but, together with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, that's about the only redeeming aspect I found in the movie which consists of two separate parts. <br/><br/>The first part covers the basic marine-training which, watching it in 2007, comes off like something I've see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and it's not particularly gripping. After 30 minutes I got the idea and wished they could just get on with it. The drill sergeant is about the only believable character while everyone else seem to be just cardboard cut-outs. The general acting is staggeringly haggard and the screenplay is devoid of anything interesting and consists of little more than the Sergeant shouting. The boys make it through their training and end up in Vietnam. Oh, and the fat weirdo shoots the sergeant (what a surprise..), probably in the mistaken belief that it was actually the scriptwriter. <br/><br/>So, one hour passed and nothing worthy of note happened. Nothing...<br/><br/>Then we have the Vietnam-part.<br/><br/>It opens with a bunk-scene where reporters of Stars and Stripes are bored and are making small talk to pass the time. At first I thought they were re-enacting some movie scenes from old films, it sounded pretty bad. But no, they were actually muttering their script lines. Then the camp is besieged. Some 20 Vietcong enter the camp through the main gate. Too bad for them they are being dropped like flies because they simply walk into several manned gun posts with no means of cover. Is that normal behaviour? Were the Vietnamese all suicidal? If so, how come the US didn't win this war during the first two months of engagement? The rest of the movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the whole plot is altogether pointless. None of the characters inspire much sympathy and the story is frankly rather uneventful. It shows little more other than some war-reporters hooking up with a platoon with some guys getting shot because they are disobedient morons and who also seem to think that somehow a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from bullets.<br/><br/>What was the message of this movie..that people died in Vietnam? That people are animals in war situations? That if you want to dispose of really dumb people, you send them to a war zone? Or that somehow in Vietnam concrete can actually burn? <br/><br/>I'm sorry, but if this movie deserves an 8.3, then Apocalypse Now deserves a 38.3<br/><br/>5/10"
"wes-connors","7","4","5","4 October 2009"," That Giant Sucking Sound
","The unifying theme of Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' is that Vietnam put American in the toilet; each of the film's three parts, or ""Acts"", has characters in what is repeatedly described as ""a world of s--t."" The men are successful trained to kill - but, they do not know when to kill, who to kill, or why anyone should die. Narrator protagonist Matthew Modine (as James ""Joker"" Davis) not only wears a ""Peace"" button on his uniform, but also has written ""Born To Kill"" on his helmet (to illustrate the duality of man). The reason for the war is explained, ""We are here to help the Vietnamese because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out."" <br/><br/>Probably, the film's strongest ""story"" is told in the first ""Act""; it features drill sergeant R. Lee Ermey (as Hartman) belittling overweight Vincent D'Onofrio (as Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence). This story literally ends in the latrine, where a successfully trained killer demonstrates his ability. Some of the material in the rest of the film becomes very weak, in comparison; especially disappointing are some mid-movie scenes ""staged"" for the camera of ""Stars and Stripes"" photographer ""Rafterman"" (Kevyn Major Howard) - the characters all say silly things for the camera. Still, some near-poetic moments of humor and brutality remain to be seen.<br/><br/>******* Full Metal Jacket (6/17/87) Stanley Kubrick ~ Matthew Modine, R.

"alexkolokotronis","2","29","60","31 January 2009"," Been There, Done That, Seen Better
","Full Metal Jacket is considered by many to be a great movie. I am not one of those many. In fact I believe quite the opposite. I think this film is not only terrible but repulsive in countless ways. It attempts to show the horrors of war but does nothing but trivialize them. Also what exactly is the message of this movie? That war is bad? Well if thats what the message it certainly isn't something new. Of course then this movie has to make up in what lacks in an original message with some sort of creativity and stylistic features. In this way the film fails horribly.<br/><br/>The acting of many of the relatively unknown actors is at best average. No actor stands out except for that of Vincent D'Onorfio who makes his exit less than half way through the film. The directing and writing of the film is absolutely horrible with the first half of the film used as a build up to a flat second half. Its almost as if the film is actually two separate ones: an average one and a disgraceful one. In the basic training sequences which takes up most of the first half of the film comes off as more hilarious then a brutal depiction of man being forcibly turned into machine. In the 2nd half of the film many of the sets made it too obvious that it was exactly that; a set. They were unconvincing with a lack of a realistic touch and screen shots out of a TV movie.<br/><br/>As the movie wore on the lack of attention to detail became quite apparent leaving much to be desired. The ""tough"" characters came off as cheesy as everything seemed to just collapse within itself. The dialog in the movie felt useless and inconsistent with what was happening with in the film. By the end I didn't even care what was taking place. There were no character motivations and scenes became very predictable. Compared to the many classics made about Vietnam this one doesn't even come close."

"dierregi","4","6","9","8 October 2012"," Vietnam does not look like the UK
","It should be widely known that Kubrick movies are not to be enjoyed, but endured. As a ""cinephile"" my choice was to endure them only once, just to know what one of the most overrated directors in the history of cinema was up to. I duly watched FMJ at the time of its original release and did not enjoy it. Back then it felt like a late arrival, saying nothing new after Apocalypse Now and Platoon. Devoid of the emotional impact of those two other movies, dry, slow-paced and boring.<br/><br/>Last night, I stumbled upon it on TV and out of curiosity I decided to give it another try, should my previous impression been marred by youthful ignorance. Alas not... In fact, years of movie-watching just enhanced my dislike for what looks more than ever like an half-baked, over simplistic war movie.<br/><br/>As everybody knows, FMJ is basically two movies stuck together, with little relation to each other. The first half takes place during a brutal boot camp, with lots of shouting and humiliation from a sadist drill sergeant, leading to ""tragic events"" of some sort. The second half takes place in Great Britain, standing for Vietnam and failing miserably at the task.<br/><br/>In no way the cold, gray UK could be mistaken for a sub-tropical country. In FMJ the actors keep their long sleeves down, no sticky heat, profuse sweating or ventilators flapping. <br/><br/>Besides being infamous for its fake, chilling location, the second part is almost ludicrous in every other aspect. From the dialogs, which sound like a parody of macho war movies, but are in no way funny, to character non-development, to sexist use of local prostitutes - not once, but twice.<br/><br/>We are shown twice what is basically the same scene (and the only female presence in the movie): a young Viet prostitute soliciting Joker and friends. Same scene some 15 minutes later, only this time the prostitute is pimped out by a local guy.<br/><br/>I could ask many questions about this movie For instance if Kubrick was supposed to be over-meticulous and detail crazy how did he missed the fact that the UK does not look like Vietnam? How did he missed the fact that he had the same scene twice? etc...<br/><br/>In the poster's photo we have a helmet with ""Born to kill"" scribbled next to a peace sign, signifying the duplicity of human nature. This convey the full message you should get at the end of the movie, so you can spare yourself some time just taking a good look at the poster. If you want to add an additional layer of ""meaning"", perhaps you can infer that mankind (in the shape of main character Joker) is ""naturally"" good but can be trained to become ""bad"". Hardly a brand-new, mind-blowing concept."
"mram16","10","6","9","11 March 2006"," Ain't war hell?
","This is one of the best war (or anti-war) films that I have seen. It is a tale told in two parts. In the first part we follow green recruits as they go through basic training on Parris Island. It is the first part of the story that introduces us to two truly unforgettable characters: Drill Instructor Hartman is a terrifying figure who uses both verbal and physical abuse to mold his men into Marines. Hartman is superbly played by real-life ex-Marine R. Lee Ermey, and not a single word of his seems fake or contrived. The second unforgettable character is Pvt. Leonard Lawrence, better known as Pyle. From the first time you see him on screen you get the feeling that something isn't right. The overweight recruit takes the worst of Hartman's abuse, is humiliated, betrayed by a friend and finally completely broken down until he becomes the picture of quiet madness. The first part of the story ends with a shocking act of violence that shows what can happen when you ask ordinary men to become killing machines.<br/><br/>The second part of the story finds Joker (the character who narrates the film) in Vietnam, now a Sergeant and a writer for Stars and Stripes. His job is not as much about reporting the truth as it is about boosting morale. Joker is a walking contradiction, a Marine who wears a peace button, yet has ""BORN TO KILL"" written on his helmet. In this part of the story we meet another memorable character, Animal Mother, an unbalanced individual who while standing over the bodies of two fallen comrades says without emotion, ""Better you than me"". The last shots of Marines marching through fiery ruins while singing the Mickey Mouse Club theme song could best be described as haunting. If war is hell, then these are the damned.<br/><br/>A great script, great cinematography, a solid cast and a good soundtrack all brought together by a great director. This film stands above all other Vietnam War movies, rivaled only by Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Full Metal Jacket is a film that everyone should see at least once, although it retains it's power even after repeated viewings. A truly great film."

","FULL METAL JACKET has one of the most bizarre structures in film history. The first half of FMJ is rightly regarded as being one of the great segments of cinema . Kubrick/Herr/Hasford`s razor sharp script takes us on a blackly comical tour of the horrors of basic training with Sergeant Hartman , private Joker and Leonard Lawrence being the central characters , but then the film cuts to the battlefields of `Nam with only a couple of characters like Joker and Cowboy linking the two segments . Also disappearing is much of the first half`s wit with only the irony of American firepower bringing down tower blocks in retaliation to a sniper being the only real clever and knowing aspect to the script . It`s confusing too because with the exception of Joker and co. the rest of the film doesn`t really tie in with the basic training segment , perhaps the film would have worked a lot better if the entire film was taken up with the basic training ? And I can`t help noticing that much of the terrain doesn`t really resemble the jungles of South East Asia , as everyone knows FMJ was filmed in and around London and it often shows. Still it`s a film worth watching if only for the basic training scenes which are certainly more convincing than those seen in HEARTBREAK RIDGE . A couple of questions though ...<br/><br/>If there`s any former USMC men out there could you write in and tell us how realistic the training scenes are ?<br/><br/>I used to be in the army myself ( Royal Engineers ) but we never EVER called instructors "" Sir "" .

While the second half focuses on the soldiers after they have been deployed in VIetnam and now the war has a dehumanizing effect on the soldiers.<br/><br/>The performances are great, from Vincent D'Onofrio's pvt.

I think that just goes to show the brilliance of Kubrick, to him it isn't about giving audiences a question and an answer but to present us with a rhetorical question that we can sit with and discuss amongst each other. I really enjoy the ambiguity of each key scene yet it is presented in such a way that as an audience you wouldn't just take for what it is, there is a sense that everything means more than face value and thus, is the beauty of Full Metal Jacket."

","I had no context doing into this film, and boy was I surprised. Pleasantly so, I will admit, but surprised and shocked nonetheless. This grim and gory film about a young Marine Journalist and his training, combines dry humor a complete disregard for any sort of decency in regards to graphic violence or language. Joker suffers through personal and large scale atrocities of war, and witnesses madness and clinical sanity alike. The inhumanity on the part of the American troops is showcased both in the treatment of the Marine trainees and of the Vietnam enemy, which Joker responds to with humor, in an effort to remain sane and in control. Stanley Kubrick uses an immersive camera style, where often the shot follows continuous action, so that the audience feels almost present in the scene, and as if one was following along behind the characters. The shots are most often wide angle, and meant to show the uniformity of the troops, and how they are crushed to be interchangeable in training."

I didn't know they stacked sh!# that high""<br/><br/>""Give your heart to Jesus but your asses belong to the Marine Corp""<br/><br/>But the quote that would be his demise was the infamous ""What is your major malfunction numbnuts?"" <br/><br/>The rest of the film is following Private joker as he photographs the war. I see it as anti-war film with Kubrick showing how the military turns people into killers and then just the brutality and horrors of war. He does all of this this with a kind of twisted sense of humor."

The situations feel very plausible and you soon begin to develop empathy for the young men. The soundtrack sometimes didn't underline the actions perfectly, but that is just my personal opinion, I know that some find it very suiting. It is not the kind of movie that leaves you destroyed but it quite skillfully portrays how senseless people are willing to kill each other.<br/><br/>All in all this is not the best of its genre for me but it is a beautifully produced question, that lets its audience search for an answer.

Kubrick seems intent on utilising music at ever opportunity, though I would cast doubt on how effective this decision was. The cast as a whole deliver moderately impressive performances. Kubrick certainly intended to showcase how war dehumanizes the individual, and this allows for the highlight of the film: the magnificent scene in which ""Private Pyle"" commits suicide. The film claims to provide dark humour, however If there was such any I failed to observe it. However, I simply couldn't understand the psyche of protagonist ""Joker"", as he is such a contradictory figure throughout the film. Is this another effort by Kubrick to demonstrate the dehumanizing effect of war, or a metaphor for the duality of man?"

"shadow_blade-89459","9","2","2","15 March 2018"," Best Vietnam War Movie to date
","""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) is a war drama that accurately displays the hardship of the military, in this case the Marine Corps, during the Vietnam War. The film is through the perspective of Private Joker, played by Matthew Modine, as he navigates basic training and the war. The film is very versatile in that there is obvious drama, but there are moments of comic relief mostly to those who were in the military. I feel the point of this film was to shed light on the actualities of the military during training and war time, which have been improved since Vietnam. According to some veterans I have spoken with in my years, the nail was hit smack on the head.<br/><br/>The director, Stanley Kubrick, paced this film perfectly. Even though the pacing was unable to keep my teenage son intrigued, knowing what happens in basic training and having done my time in a war, the pacing couldn't have been better. When the story is being told from the service members point of view, the pacing all revolves around how that member absorbs their surroundings. The payoff is unfortunate, but it is the truth of war. The loss of characters you get attached to during the film is a direct depiction of any war where friends and family are lost, but the end is just as heart warming as it is sad. This is a great film that I would recommend to anyone, especially those interested in the military."
"PWNYCNY","8","2","2","12 March 2018"," Military as a sham.
","This is an excellent movie, for a while. R. Lee Ermey gives a riveting performance as the arch typical drill instructor, Sgt. Hartman. Ermey's performance should have earned him an Academy Award. In fact, it can be argued that Ermey's presence makes this movie special. Out side of that, the movie falters. Sgt. Hartman states clearly at the start that his order is weed out those who cannot hack his beloved Marine Corps. That means finding the bad apples. Yet, despite all his threats and abuse and blustering, nobody gets weeded out. The story line contains huge holes. First, regarding Gomer Pyle. Pyle fails at everything, yet Hartman does not flunk him out. Instead, he employs terror to try to get Pyle, a hapless screw up, to comply. Nothing helps, yet Pyle makes it. Boot camp has taught him only one thing: how to kill Hartman. Second, the story abruptly switches to Vietnam. The troops are cynical, demoralized and dysfunctional. They lack unit cohesion and esprit de corps. However, the story fails to explain the cause of their malaise. Joker, another bad apple from boot camp, is still in the Marines. Third, the character Animal Mother. His presence in the story is seems to make no sense, except that he is yet another bad apple that the Marines never weeded out. He's just more overtly anti-social. This entire movie depicts the military as a sham. Tell that to those who actually serve."
"TheMovieDiorama","9","2","2","9 March 2018"," Full Metal Jacket is not just about war, but rather the psychology behind it.
","A smart move from the legend that was Stanley Kubrick. We've all seen many war films, a genre that is well explored from a variety of different conflicts. Full Metal Jacket however chooses to go behind the scenes and focus on the training process that changes well intentioned men into trained lethal killers. You could easily split this in half and have two separate films, the first half being more psychologically charged whereas the latter showcasing the brutality of warfare. A ridiculously serious drill sergeant practically bullying a trainee marine so harshly that it slowly turns him into an unstable psychopath. That right there, was some really good psychology and made the film so much more interesting. Sure the Vietnam War scenes were depicted with a substantial amount of fire, blood and guns but it was the first half that really captivated me. Vincent D'Onofrio was the stand out for me, both convincing and expressive through his face. Matthew Modine was good, probably his best performance. Lee Ermey deserves recognition just for somehow managing to not lose his voice from all the shouting. Characterisation was present, perhaps not fully fleshed out as I would like but was just enough for me to care about them. Yet again though, it's the technical marvel that wins...Stanley Kubrick. His directing style is so damn flawless. The nice clean long takes, actors looking directly into the camera, slow motion deaths (particularly in the sniper shootout)...he is just phenomenal. Script was sharp as well. A great section of dialogue where our lead character wears a peace badge and a helmet that says ""born to kill"" for which he describes represents the duality of man. That really stuck with me. So whilst it might feel like two separate films (due to that ridiculously quick transition), it's hard not to appreciate everything that's shown to us. Another hit from Mr. Kubrick."
"avik-basu1889","8","2","2","7 November 2017"," The inhumanity of War !!!
","One of the many characteristic aspects of Kubrick's cinema is the deliberate lack of humanity and intimacy. He made it a point to keep the viewer at a distance from the characters and the circumstances. 'Full Metal Jacket' is divided into two specific parts. The first part involving the basic training in the boot camp, benefits immensely from Kubrick's emotionally distant filmmaking. This first part is a brilliantly directed, shot and acted satire on the dehumanisation of young boys in the army. We see the innocent and honorable masculinity of these boys who want to do themselves, their families and their country proud, get replaced by toxic masculinity which involves killing your identity and your humanity, equating the lust for sex with the lust for violence, keeping all your emotions suppressed and in the end becoming ultra-aggressive, remorseless, animalistic killers. R. Lee Ermey pretty much single-handedly carries this first part of the film through sheer verbal aggression. The character of Sergeant Hartman played by Ermey is pretty much the devil just like the character of Terence Fletcher played by J. K. Simmons in 'Whiplash'. Just like great satire, there are numerous sequences and moments in this part where the audience will feel like laughing and then within a few seconds feel disturbed and disgusted for laughing at something terrible and reprehensible.<br/><br/>While Kubrick's emotionally distant filmmaking is beneficial to the first part of the film, it actually to some extent becomes a weakness in the second part. In the second part, we move to Vietnam where we see the soldiers having to execute everything that they learnt in boot camp, at the real battlefield. Now there certainly are moments in this second half that I love like the sequence of the talking head interviews of the soldiers which further underline how pointless this war was and how clueless even the soldiers were about their missions and the general purpose of their temporary existence in Vietnam. I also especially loved the extended situational set- piece that the film ends with as it provides a devastating and perhaps a sorrowful conclusion to the arc of the character of Sergeant Joker played by Matthew Modine who for the major part of the film remains the voice of reason, logic and humanity. However apart from these aforementioned scenes, this second half of 'Full Metal Jacket' lacks a sense of cohesion. It feels like a random collection of vignettes, some of which aren't very interesting. The reason why some of the vignettes seem uninteresting is Kubrick's refusal to allow us into the mental state of the characters that are introduced in the second half or give us any insight into their psyches apart from some surface level behavioral tendencies. There are many scenes where we see the soldiers talk to each other and spend time together, but those scenes rang hollow to me and felt somewhat forced and artificial. This inability to completely appreciate the second half of the film on my part could be completely subjective. Since I loved the first half so much, maybe the change in setting and tone that takes place was always going to make it tough for the second half to measure up when compared to the first.<br/><br/>Technically 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't as showy and attention grabbing as some of Kubrick's other films, however it still retains a lot of his characteristic visual touches like the use of one-point perspective and the use of steadicam,etc. The urban, ground level combat scenes are very well staged and directed. The production design has to be admired a lot for those scenes too. From an acting standpoint, I have already mentioned R. Lee Ermey for his brilliant performance. I think Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio deserve special mentions too for coming up with contrasting, yet equally compelling performances respectively.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'll say 'Full Metal Jacket' doesn't quite achieve greatness due to the flawed second half of the film. But it's still an exceptionally good movie that comes close to greatness due to the incredibly brilliant first half which I think is as good and as powerful as anything Kubrick has ever done in a visceral scene. It's a film that can be directly connected to 'Paths of Glory' and 'Dr. Strangelove' in terms of Kubrick's criticism of institutional authority, dogmatic patriotism and toxic masculinity. It's most certainly worth recommending."
"Aaron1375","8","2","2","21 June 2010"," Almost a tale of two movies. One training, the other Vietnam.
","I have to say I am not the biggest Kubrick fan. Not really against him or anything, but I have actually seen very few films by him. In fact, other than this one, the only other film of his I have seen is ""The Shining"" so of these two my experiences have been mostly positive. This film starts out great in my opinion with a well organized basic training section. You get to meet new recruits as they get their head shaved, then you get to see what a Marine has to go through to be a Marine and suffice to say there is no way I could do what they do. Not only do you have a crazed Sergent constantly yelling at you and demoralizing you, I just could not handle the sleeping quarters and all that comes with basic training as I have social anxiety problems so I most likely would try to get away or off myself. I would not do what the one guy does here though. The second half of the film is a bit weaker and not as strong plot wise as the first part. This may have been done on purpose as to depict the Vietnam war as disorganized and chaotic and if that is the case it is done well. Just not enough plot structure for my tastes in this section of the film, still good, it just can not quite rise to the level of the first portion of the film. The acting is even though throughout the movie so that helps in the rather uneven Vietnam section of the movie."
"MartinHafer","9","2","2","1 July 2009"," Very well made--tough to watch.
","Warning--This movie is NOT for young kids or those who do not wish to see violence and adult content, as it's rather brutal and the language is pretty rough. Now I am not complaining about this, but this is clearly an adult film intended for adults. It's hard to really do this sort of film without making it this intense--just be forewarned. In addition, this is a very tense and unpleasant sort of film--be aware of this before watching.<br/><br/>This film has a ton of reviews, so my summarizing the film or going into any sort of in-depth analysis is probably a giant waste of time. And, Bob the Moo has done such a good job of reviewing it, I say you just go read his! In brief, here's what I liked or at least respected in the film: It had a very gritty realism and managed to pull the viewer into it very, very well. The first portion (in boot camp) and the second portion (in Vietnam) were very different but both were very tense and compelling. While it wasn't pretty, it was well done.<br/><br/>And, in brief, here's what I didn't like: The constant and clichéd use of rock and pop music. A few decades ago, this would have been innovative. Now, FULL METAL JACKET sounds an awful lot like GOOD MORNING Vietnam and APOCALYPSE NOW and other films. The constant blaring soundtrack was, I suppose, meant to be surreal and illustrate how ludicrous the war was. However, I just thought hearing ""Surfin' Bird"" was annoying and a cheap use of music. Apart from that, there isn't anything to say negative about the film.<br/><br/>Is this the greatest anti-war film? No. Its message (like the war) was rather mixed at times and lacked the same impact of films like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT or WESTFRONT 1918, but it sure did come close."

","A very disturbing film about the Vietnam War, much darker than any of Kubrick's other films. The Music stands out as a major contributer to the film's mentality. Kubrick likes to use music of the time his films takes place, and it made perfect sense for Full Metal. The film really gets into the minds of the soldiers. What Apocalypse Now was for the Air Cav, this movie is for the Marines in Vietnam. The film's major point is the Duality of Men, and the beauty of Kubrick's shots helps instill a feeling of Victory even though all you see in the film is defeat. This is the most beautifully shot war film I've ever seen, even better than Terry Malick's Thin Red Line. Shots are crisp, perfect, colorful and each scene has its own embrace and feeling, paired wonderfully with the music. All in all, a beautiful war film that delves deep into the psyche of a solider in the Vietnam era. The perfect blend of Tragedy and Energy. the perfection of Stanley Kubrick."
"citizenchris","9","2","2","3 April 2004"," an analysis
","Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece of the dregs of warfare ""Full Metal Jacket"" is often thought of as two films. This is easy to understand when one considers the films rather unconventional structure. You see most commercials films (as apposed to say ""art house"" fare) are divided into three acts. In the first act the dramatic conflict is introduced, in act two the challenge of the conflict is met by the protagonist, and finally in act three the conflict is resolved. Not so in FMJ, for you see this film is two act that don't quit ""jell"" in such a nice and neat way. Act one depicts life in marine boot camp. This being the act that the film is most widely know for. The second act is where things stray from the norm. You see act two only contains two characters from act one. One being the narrator/ protagonist  the other a rather small secondary character. The acts don't flow together in the previously mentioned three act manor. In act one we see ""Pile"" mis-treated while ""Joker"" tries to help him conform to the marine ways. ""Pile"" goes on to commit a murder suicide by killing his drill instructor and subsequently himself. Then on to act two we see Joker is now ""in-country"" as a correspondent. The only real tie to the first act is when he runs across a buddy from boot camp.  Each act is treated like its only miniature movie. Act one being the most popular and two like a weird sequel. FMJ not only lacks a third act  but also cohesive dramatic conflict. In act one the conflict might be seen as boot camp life and the protagonist could be ""Pile"". But ""Pile"" is obviously not in act two. One might find traditional conflict in act two but they would be mistaken for there is none. So what is the point of all of this you might ask.. Well you see what most screenwriters and Hollywood filmmakers forget is that there is no cohesive dramatic conflict in life. In life as in FMJ S&^% happens and all we can do is react and observe. And that's exactly what Kubrick wants. He wants to show us something and upon seeing this he wants a reaction. So what is he showing us? In act one he is clearly showing us the dehumanizing nature of creating a ""good marine"". And no this is not just a fictional depiction. Its a lot closer to reality than you might realize. You see the actor portraying the drill segment Lee Ermey served in the Marine Corps for 30 months as a ....you guessed it drill instructor. Much of his now famous dialogue were his own words.  All you have to do is talk to a marine about FMJ and they will tell you that's how  it was. The question is how do you a an audience member react to this display. In act two we are given a more ""traditional"" war film. Though unlike most Vietnam films FMJ second act takes place in decaying urban sectors as apposed to the thick jungles of ""Platoon"" or ""Apocalypse Now"".  It doesn't try to get you into anyone's head. Show you how this experience is changing the character. Kubrick is more interested in the audience. In the ""Vietnam the movie""  sequence soldiers are asked what they think about he war. There is none of your John Wayne hallmark patriotic propaganda.<br/><br/>""Do you think we waits gooks for freedom? This is a slaughter."" -Animal Mother ""I wanted to see Vietnam, the jewel of south East Asia. I wanted to meet interesting and stimulating  people of a ancient culture and kill them"" -Joker FMJ is based on Gustav Hasford's novel ""The Short Timers"".  The book was a first for the for the marine and military war correspondent who served in the Vietnam war. Early versions of the novel were developed while Hasford was still serving in the war. Many of the novels central characters were named after pals he served with. Kubrick and Hasford had extensive phone conversations (Kubrick's often preferred manor of collaboration) over the script to what would eventually become Full Metal Jacket. A title Kubrick chose due to ""The Short Timers"" lack of mass popularity. Kubricks other collaborator was Michael Herr. Who has previously worked with Francis For Copola on the previously mentioned ""Apocalypse Now"" ."

","The consensus seems to be that this film is two separate dramas, and that is an accurate assessment.  Kubrick, as always, shows the audience events and then allows them their own conclusions (sort of like real life, huh?)<br/><br/>I served in the Army and like most veterans, the boot camp sequence (the first film) is funny, scary, informative and exhausting, just like basic training.  When the story shifts to Vietnam, it loses a little of its appeal and originality, but it is effective in showing the utter uselessness of war, especially the disjointed, aimless jaunt that existed in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>I'm not so sure this is the best war film ever made, or even the best film about Vietnam.  The film is thought provoking, though, and very well acted. Why isn't Matthew Modine more highly regarded?  His performance here is very good, and with his roles in Birdy and And The Band Played On, he seems to be one of the best actors in the 25 to 40 range.<br/><br/>I do like this film, and I think it is another example of Stanley Kubrick's brilliance, but I can't say that it's great.<br/><br/>But, to his credit, a Kubrick film is just like a military experience.

"bob the moo","Null","10","18","26 October 2002"," A good (but heavy handed) anti-war movie that has an enjoyable vein of black humour
","A bunch of young men join a marine training camp to prepare for war in Vietnam.  However before they can face the enemy they must make it past the rigours of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  Once past the training they face a war where many may not return alive.  They learn that the dehumanising effects of war run through every stage and are complete.<br/><br/>This is Kubrick's most accessible film and I suspect that contributes to it's high rating on the imdb.  There can be no other reason why it would rank so high on it's own merits.  This is not to say it's a bad film but it is certainly not one of the best anti-war films ever made.  The plot is a game of two halves  first the training camp and second the actual conflict. The point that both halves hammer home relentlessly is that war dehumanises those involved.<br/><br/>The first half is enjoyable pure and simply because of Emery's Gunnery Sergeant.  His is a witty character despite the inherent cruelty in his actions.  However eventually his screen time is ended and the film continues to make the same point over again but in a different setting.  The problem is that it hammers it's point home so heavily that it doesn't allow us to work things out for ourselves.  Even things like Platoon and the like allow us to work it out ourselves!  The film's strength is it's wonderful streak of black comedy that runs right the way through  it is the reason for watching and makes it feel a little different from other hardcore war movies of this ilk.<br/><br/>Kubrick is always going to be watchable but this is not one of his best. His cold direction is usually excellent but here it is alienating and clinical when we should really be getting to like the soldiers involved. The film is still good but I felt that the flaws are too much here.  Emery is undoubtedly the main reason for watching this film.  He gives a great performance that is a mix of improvisation and script that works well and guaranteed him work in the same role for many years.  Modine is suitably wide eyed as our guide through his experiences but he is like most of the other marines  just blank characters for Kubrick to work around.  Only D'Onofrio (Pyle) came out of this as a real person.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good anti-war film but not a great one.  There is no doubting the power of the message and Emery easily carries the film till the war itself.  It is still a very good film but I suspect that the fact that this is Kubrick's easiest film to get into explains why it is rated so highly."

It is set in Parris Island, S.C., were the main Corp was locate to whip these civilians into shape. Gunnery Sgt. Hartman(Ermey) is one heck of a bad-a$$ Drill Sgt. who takes no crap from anyone. He didn't discriminate anyone, he treated everyone like an equal. However, he tortured Pvt. Pyle(Vincent D'Onofrio) so bad, he went over the edge after the training. He marched with his pants down, sucked on his thumb like a little boy, and had to endure a very brutal beating from the other Privates. Socking a drill Sergeant will call for a discharge or time in confinement, shooting him will result in court martial, and a dishonorable discharge. Of course, Pyle discharged himself with the same gun. The other went on and the brutal battle is ensured. The Marines don't play around, and they really show the sign of brotherhood of the Corp. The chants the Gunny made was a classic. ""This is my rifle, this is my gun..."" is the one song I think should be shared to only the military. It's always lock and load.

","Unlike many other (Vietnam)war movies, the movie focuses in my opinion on the madness of man instead of the madness of war.<br/><br/>The first half shows how the soldiers are being dehumanized during their military training by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a legendary and already classic role by R.

Both of the halves are good and in a way can be seen as a movie alone but for some reason the two halves don't really flow into each other, which is my only real complaint I have about this fantastic and most certainly unique movie.

I'm one of the few who actually like the second half more as the first but that is just only personal and different for everyone.<br/><br/>It's strange that the Vietnam battlefield looks more like a WWII European battlefield but I'm sure Kubrick had his reasons for it.

Unfortunately for me, that was ten years before the Copyright Act of 1976 that gave the copyright of anything written to the author the moment he put it in writing. Otherwise, Kubrik would be paying me, but I would not ask for much. It WAS the feeling. I disliked the Marine Corp. Their attitude in general, the tough guys, heroes, belied their actual performance in Vietnam. US Army units in I Corps and II Corps spent much of their time rescuing Marines pinned down by Charlie. They knew little of the concept, ""recon in FORCE"". The sniper scene depicts the true effects of 7.62 or 7.65 ammo on a body. The finale, with Joker finally pulling the trigger on the girl made him ""part of..."". The Mickey Mouse song was another standard ""in country"". Believe me, ""it never goes away""."

","This is an awesome movie, I just saw it for the first time a few minutes ago, I rate it 9/10. The intensity and action just doesn't stop except for a few minutes as when Cowboy is struggling with Animal for a cease-fire ... The feature is visually stunning, nice scenery, a few ""gooks"" up-close and lots of weapons and war-torn buildings. There's a wide range of emotions except for romance, hurray for realism ! You can see tree facets of the war going from training and it's hardship to comfy position finished by smelling blood. It's odd that they chose Joker, a war correspondant (journalist), for a main character ; I guess they wanted to show the hardening of a pretty normal guy instead of just jumping in the action with a testosterone/adrenaline junkie lusting for a kill seen in countless movies, it's more human that way."

Worth watching for Ermey, who should have received an Academy Award!"
"refresh_daemon","8","3","4","15 March 2007"," A very Kubrickian take on institution of war
","Ah, Stanley Kubrick. The man has directed two of my favorite films, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb and Paths of Glory. So I took it upon myself to watch another one of his that I haven't seen yet. Full Metal Jacket is both a funny and disturbing look at the effect of the military on those that serve in it, at least, as far as I can tell.<br/><br/>One thing that I always particularly liked about Kubrick films is they have a wonderful grasp of black humor. Kubrick's direction is always so cold and controlled so that we're always just observing moments. When the funny hits, he doesn't ""do"" anything to indicate the funny, but rather coolly and dryly observes the absurdity of the moment therein. You can see this frequently in the training sequences where we observe the soldiers repeating the absolutely ridiculous rhetoric of their drill sergeant as though it were nothing. Another way that Kubrick likes to throw in humor in this piece is his often clashing use of old pop songs, which are placed up front in the mix so that they're loud and clear. The songs are clearly non-diegetic since there is often no place for the music to be coming from and the mix indicates it and yet somehow, even though the songs often don't fit lyrically, creating an effect that somewhat distances us from the image, somehow they also all fit together with the image such that you can't actually imagine the film without the music.<br/><br/>The sound mix on the film is also fantastic. It's not fully immersive: there's some element of the mixing that, like the music and the coldly observant camera, that leaves us a little detached from the film, creating a little reflexive space. It works so well with the rest of the elements of the film. It's strange because you'd think the distance created by Kubrick's overall direction would cause you to feel detached from the film, but it actually doesn't... we just watch everything a little differently. The one time that the film's music becomes diegetic is when the soldiers march on after a horrible incident--singing the Mickey Mouse show theme song. Again, a wild contrast of innocence in a place of horror.<br/><br/>I praise the direction, but I can't do the same for the story. It's a bit of a wandering mess. First of all, the structure of the film is basically two separate stories joined together by shared characters. The first half of the film deals with the recruits and their training under a straight-faced angry and somewhat unhinged drill sergeant. We watch as the new recruits are stripped of their individuality and become real Marines. There's a real drama in the relationship of the drill sergeant, ""Joker"" and ""Gomer Pyle"", but the story doesn't really seem to go anywhere. When all was said and done with the first half, I just stopped and had to wonder, ""So?"" The second half deals with the Marines in Vietnam. Here we see the military interact with the local populace, including some disturbing moments where the Marines treat the Vietnamese as sub-human. But because of Kubrick's direction, we actually don't side with them but just watch them and find ourselves in horror. You can see this a little in the Marines' interactions with the prostitutes as well. The fact that everybody finds it okay to bargain over how much a sex act costs and the relative ease of soldiers all sharing the same prostitute draws up a little recoil, at least in me. We also see slices of the hell of war, as people die unexpectedly. Again, many of the deaths are shown without dramatic effect, until near the end. As authority figures die, it's done without any of the expected slow-motion glory-deaths, but rather matter-of-factly. It gets really eerie near the end though, when a Vietcong sniper lies dying and the Marines are observing her. Suddenly, Kubrick steps into the picture and makes us think about the Marines and their enemies by lingering in the moment of her suffering, after she had killed a number of Marines.<br/><br/>But for all the moments that the film puts together so well, it still leaves you with a bit of ""so what?"" Kubrick observes a lot in this film, but it's hard to find his voice. This might be true of many of Kubrick's films, but it makes me wonder what I'm supposed to take from what I see. Full Metal Jacket, then, to me, is more about the story of the dehumanizing nature of both the military and the war. Joker, our protagonist, stands as our human character, who struggles to stay human in such awful conditions. At the same time, in the end, was there a lesson to be learned? Or are we all just supposed to sigh and continue on like we can't help ourselves? Or maybe that's what we were supposed to think all along? Either way, I found Full Metal Jacket to be quite impressive, even with all of its flaws. There's a lot in it. Good stuff. 8/10."

","A gentleman (from France, I won't hold this against him), wrote a comment about the ironies and callousness of the characters of FMJ. I would like to politely disagree with him on several points. As a former marine myself, I went through boot camp at Parris Island, SC, where we were taught to be killers. I was fortunate to never have to do so. In 1998, I was deployed to Japan as an electronics technician with an aviation unit, and prior to deployment, my squadron received several hundred hours on Japanese history, culture and tradition, in addition to the requisite safety, security and terrorism briefs that occur when deploying to a foreign nation. The process was the same when I deployed to Saudi Arabia in 2000. As for the Mickey Mouse at the end, they were not being callous (as a group, individuals are another story), but the battle depicted in the movie was Hue (pronounced WHEY) City, and one of the bloodiest of the war, and were all trying to remember a happier, simpler time in their lives. I have been through the training that Joker, Cowboy, Sno-Ball and Gomer Pyle went through, and I would like to think that I became a better man because of it."

","When I first saw this film at the time it came out, I thought it was very good. But now that liberal H-wood has steeped me in its BS for all the years I had subscribed, I now see that the BS theme associated with ""Gomer Pyle"" is that growing into an instrument of war is insanity causing to some. That the ""hero"", ""Joker"", drops his gun when shot at, then mercy kills the sniper that someone else protected him from. And that war is a waste for liberal reasons, not realistic ones. I very much doubt that any actual war movie has ever been made, and certainly not this as one.

It made a star of Lee Ermey, whose Drill Sergeant was terrifyingly real, primarily because that is what he was in reality.<br/><br/>Like all of Kubrick's work, this film contains iconic imagery that sears into your mind's eye and becomes very hard to erase; the final scenes, and the film's closing, with its perfect marriage of image, sound, and music, haunt you and leave you reflecting on the last 2 two hours."

","This is an excellent film that shows that film maker Stanley Kubrick has lost none of his skill despite a 7 year break between projects.<br/><br/>The film is plotted in two distinct parts, the first half, which is the stronger part is concerned with the impact of brutal training on the wannabe soldiers, with the second part focusing on the story told from the central character, Private Joker, played by an effective Matthew Modine in a deliberate low key and understated manner. In fact most of the performances are subdued, with the exception of Adam Baldwin as a cynical and brutal Animal Mother and particularly Lee Ermey, who steals the show as the ruthless drill sergeant. He is totally captivating in the role, even if his character spends most of his time by humiliating the recruits - though the film posits that there are potentially tragic consequences with this approach as well as the production of a group of lethal killers.<br/><br/>The second part of the film is still effective though, even it isn't quite as captivating as the first half. Vietnam is very well realised, particularly since it was shot in London's Docklands, which was derelict at the time! This is a tribute to Kubrick's skill as a director, particularly with his use of steadicam to develop a cold, objective realism peppered with black humour. Huge credit must also go Anton Furst's outstanding work as production designer and Vivian Kubricks score, though minimalist, is interesting and gives a refreshing and different feel to this non-typical war film. Martin Hunter's editing is also first rate.<br/><br/>In summary and efficient, and highly effective observation of the dehumanisation of warfare on the soldier made with trademark Kubrick precision"
"lee_eisenberg","9","4","6","11 March 2006"," Be prepared.
","After a several year absence, Stanley Kubrick returned to the screen with the hard-hitting ""Full Metal Jacket"", about an American platoon going to Vietnam. The movie wastes no time in getting down and dirty. Sgt. Hartman's (R. Lee Ermey) monologues haranguing the cadets are likely to knock the breath out of anyone. But that's only a preparation for what they experience once they reach Vietnam.<br/><br/>If you've seen Kubrick's other movies, then you probably know that he pulls no punches. And believe you me, he doesn't here. We usually talk about the first and second parts of the movie, but one might say that even the second half has two halves: when they first arrive in Saigon (a safe, Americanized place), and when they actually go into battle (get ready for things to get ugly).<br/><br/>All in all, maybe this isn't Kubrick's best movie, but definitely worth seeing.

"Drywall","10","4","6","31 March 2005"," A true anti-war film
","I have heard of the idea that every war movie is in fact an anti-war movie, because they all show the horror and brutality of the situation.<br/><br/>I do not agree.<br/><br/>Some war films, while showing violence and blood, have stories describing how war gives people the potential to be heroes; movies like 'Saving Private Ryan', 'A Bridge Too Far' and even 'The Great Escape' fall into this trap; they seem to say that, even though war is terrible, some good can come from it.<br/><br/>A true anti-war film has no heroes. The statement is very clear: war turns men into vicious animals, with no drives except to eat, copulate, and kill. Films in this category include 'King Rat', 'The Dirty Dozen', 'Platoon', and of course Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket'.<br/><br/>With 'Jacket', Kubrick provides what is perhaps the most comprehensive and complete overview of how human beings are de-evolved through the military process. He begins in boot camp, where they are treated as scum, beaten and abused, and (in some cases) driven completely mad. By the time they reach the field, they are ""killing machines...angels of death"", and the horror of battle only makes it worse.<br/><br/>They suppress fear, pity, love...and and all emotions that distinguish humans from animals. Sex is purely physical gratification, and killing is a rush. There is no loyalty or patriotism; the desire to retrieve a wounded comrade is more akin to how a pack of wolves protects one of its own. They act on instinct rather than reason, and they do not hesitate to destroy everything they see.<br/><br/>That is the plot of Full Metal Jacket. The movie itself is a scathing example of how horrible war truly is. Perhaps there is the potential for heroism...but few, if any, rise to it."
"Frequency270","9","4","6","25 April 2004"," Damion reviews Full Metal Jacket
","""Full Metal Jacket"" follows a single Marine-nicknamed Joker(Mathew Modine)-through boot camp and a portion of his time in Vietnam. It is loosely based on the story 'Short Timers' by Gustav Hasford. It is directed by Stanley Kubrick, known for long, eccentric movies that weave surreal and super real characteristics blended together, creating nightmarish, hollow and disconcerting movies.<br/><br/>The boot camp portion of this film is what most people remember. The drill instructor is played by R. Lee Emery, and it is one of the most terrifying, moving, funny and convincing performances in movie history. Virtually a non-stop rant from his first appearances to his last he electrifies the performances around him and puts the viewer in boot camp with the rest of the recruits. Vincent D'Onofrio does well as Private Pyle, overacting in only one scene-though it is a critical scene. Matthew Modine's performance is almost tertiary to Emery and D'Onofrio's performance. We do get see him develop a little, the positive characteristics that will make him strong in Vietnam.<br/><br/>The second portion blends sixties rock n' roll and Vietnamese urban warfare to tremendous effect. The war effort is crumbling and Reporter Sgt Joker is sent to the front to support infantry and get stories for the ""Stars and Stripes"". There, Joker confronts the full effects of war on himself, friends and strangers. One is hard pressed to remember at points that it is just a movie, so comfortable and real are the actors in their surroundings. The Door Gunner ('ain't war hell?'), Animal Mother, 8-ball and Cowboy are consumed by their roles. <br/><br/>It is definitely not a movie for those easily offended by language. As an anti-war movie, it seems to have exactly the opposite effect. Nonetheless, it is a powerful performance, with the entire cast making it greater than the sum of its parts. It is the finest Kubrick movie that I've seen(out of eight). I recommend it for anyone over the age of sixteen who enjoys action or war movies. I rate this movie at nine stars out of ten. It truly deserves to be an American classic."
"DaveDiggler","7","10","20","6 June 2008"," A Been-There-Done-That War Film
","Kubrick may be best known for his visuals, style, and creativity. ""Full Metal Jacket"" isn't all that great to look at it, and doesn't have any great stylistic flare worth noting, and is the same old recycled and clichéd settings and scenes that we've seen over and over. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a kind of disjointed film told through a boot camp setting in the first half and a war setting in second half. The basic training elements of the film have been done numerous times, but nothing like this. This is ""Full Metal Jacket'"" strongest element as we see some great film-making of things we've seen done numerous times before, but here; Kubrick brings us one of the most memorable characters in film history with Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). Ermey is fantastic and plays the part as if he's been through it all and seen it all before (That's because he has). The basic training is brutal and if you think the Marine Corps is brutal; ""Full Metal Jacket"" raises the bar and heightens reality to unprecedented levels. The first half of the film is done to near masterful levels. There were only two real issues: The inconsistent acting from Vincent D'Onofrio who plays Gomer Pyle and the never ending shellacking that Hartman rains down on his young men. D'Onofrio is great in one scene and absolutely over-the-top in the next-- over-the-top in a campy sense. Private Pyle is a ""fat-body,"" and a screw up. He manages to screw everything up to the point were he hides a jelly donut in his footlocker. We see scene after scene of Pyle screwing up as D'Onofrio goes so far over-the-top that at times he puts this look on his face as if he's trying to imitate a person with Down Syndrome- it gets that bad. In most scenes his face works to eerie perfection. Hartman, then tells his men that they need to motive Pyle because he has failed, thus the corps failed him because they have not helped him motivate Pyle. So they beat him one night as he sleeps with bars of soap wrapped in towels and everything changes. Pyle starts talking to his gun. He becomes an excellent shot and a marksman and starts looking more and more like a soldier ready for combat except we get the not-so- subtle feeling that Pyle is going to go AWOL, and, of course, he does. None of the characters seem to know, but we sure do. This will bring us to the best scene in the entire film, which takes place half way through the film. Pyle becomes the second best character, only to Hartman, but once we leave the basic training scenes we're thrown into a war we've seen before and a war we've seen captured on film much better. ""Full Metal Jacket"" offers a lot of laughs in the first half of the film and actually goes for too many laughs with Hartman in the opening scene as Kubrick and company just go for the next joke about their sexual orientation. It's funny and Hartman has some great one-liners, but for a drill instructor it gets to the point where he becomes the comedian instead of the drill instructor. After so much it got the point where I was thinking, ""When is he going to get back to his speech and stop calling these guys fags and queers 15,000 different ways?"" <br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" shows how dehumanizing war can be as we see ""born to kill"" written on the helmet of Joker (Mathew Modine) with a peace sign on his chest that represent the ""duality of man"" (as we're told). Basically this is questioning the idea that war will solve the world's issues- killing people will create peace. The problem with the film is that we get all of what Kubrick tries to sell us about the effects of war in the first half of the film, when, interesting enough, doesn't even take place during a war. Maybe that's why it made it so strong, but the final half is the same exact theme and message, but now we're actually in the war and it doesn't have as big an impact. The action sequences and the fight sequences are clichéd and stupid and look amateurish with the slow motion shots of blood spattering everywhere, and echoing cries of pain are heard from afar. This is supposed to strike a cord in you, that's why Kubrick elongates the pain. In ""Saving Private Ryan,"" a film done over ten years later, in a very similar situation, Spielberg doesn't use any camera tricks or slow motion shots to make us feel a certain way. He just shows it as it would happen: Realistically. This creates a much stronger reaction than having a guy slowly fall and flop around as we're being told how to feel. It comes off as an unnatural and unrealistic force feeding because Kubrick is almost afraid his audience won't care for these guys, so he tries to make us care. ""Full Metal Jacket,"" ultimately doesn't have much direction or anything new to say on the subject. It's a film about the soldiers, but the soldiers are all clichés. They're all the same exact people who are represented as nothing but barbaric animals. I don't know if his intention was to glorify veterans and troops, but this film is insulting to the men and woman who protect and serve."
"mentalcritic","1","35","89","10 December 2000"," You people have got to be kidding...
","Sorry, guys, but this is numero uno for the single worst war flick ever made. Based on Gustav Hasford's classic semi-autobiographical novel The Short Timers, Kubrick's film version fails to get half the detail on screen. In spite of the fact that the novel is about 180 pages in length and mostly consists of expletives. The entire third act of the novel is missing, as are the death of Rafter Man (probably one of the most gruesome parts of the novel) and Joker's promotion to Sergeant.<br/><br/>The fact that this abortion of a film has been voted into the top 250, and is being described as ""the best"" by so many IMDB users pretty much invalidates the entire concept of the IMDB. If you want a great film about war, go and see The Bridge On The River Kwai or Three Kings instead. This film is a sad joke that insults everyone who has read its source material. The greatest trick Kubrick ever pulled was convincing anyone that he had directed a masterpiece here.<br/><br/>On a positive note, however, Lee Ermey puts in a great performance with the material he had to work with. Even though the best sequence of the book that involved his character was, not surprisingly, left out of this film, he grabs hold of the role and rides it like there's no tomorrow. Such a pity that the rest of the cast have no idea what to do with their lines, and the director couldn't make a decent film out of his source material if he even tried. This is easily the single most overrated blot on the history of Hollywood to date, although The Matrix gives it a good run for its money."
"jyanagi","2","15","34","18 August 2002"," Promising at first, but sure to disappoint
","This movie has always been a real disappointment for me.  While its portrayal of the Marine training sequence is powerful and memorable, Kubrick continues to do a less-than inspiring portrayal of combat in Vietnam. Approaching the diaspora from a different angle than Stone, Kubrick hits upon some of the classic themes left (appropriately) untouched by Platoon. Yet, in some cases the ubiquitous slow-motion violence is needlessly gratuitous and the round-the-body one liner reflections and face-the-camera montage interviews are cheesy, if not reminiscent of other great 'camera-focused' escapades like Kevin Pollak's ""Opposite Sex"" and the recent ""that 70s show"".  <br/><br/>     Pop music is played too often as if FMJ begins to lean towards a self-indulgent glorification of the 60s, even in inappropriate and distracting places.  Who can forget Joker and his colleagues (the few bright spots of the film: character development), but the movie fails to depict the subject matter in a realistic or subdued matter when needed. <br/><br/>
     It seems as if to Kubrick, Vietnam is not a war where Americans were forever traumatized, but rather just another stage for pop culture to spotlight the trite 'duality of man' in an 'animal setting'.  I hated the movie.  This movie does little justice to the memory of those who were in Vietnam.  The movie immediately strays and wavers, becoming an uncomfortable hybrid between 'popular nostalgic war formula' and 'psychological thriller' and proceeds to do both very poorly."

It's an anti-war film, a war film, a film about Military training, a film about Military combat, and a film about soldiers all packed into one little bundle. It's overstuffed, too full to carry all of its own weight, and it's got nowhere to dump the excess cargo but on its viewers.<br/><br/>One of the film's characters, ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine), wears a peace necklace around his throat and a helmet with the words ""Born To Kill"" scribbled in the center throughout the film. ""Whose side are you on?"" someone asks him. He's not sure, and either is the film--which is one of its considerable flaws.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw is its cold manner.

But, as I noted in a paragraph above, the worst thing about ""Full Metal Jacket"" is the humanity of the story. It has virtually none whatsoever.<br/><br/>This isn't particularly surprising, since Kubrick has often been famous for his cold style of filmmaking (""2001,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut""). Don't misunderstand what I'm saying--Kubrick may very well by an amazing director. But a war film is different from one about art and deep meanings--you have to introduce characters, get the audience to like them, have them suffer personal trials and tribulations, and have some emotional moments in the film. Kubrick fails at this on the same level that Stone succeeded, even though they're both trying to get across the same messages. (It doesn't help that ""Full Metal Jacket"" was released a year after ""Platoon,"" which makes it look like a pale imitator in comparison.)<br/><br/>All of the characters in ""Full Metal Jacket"" seem very written, which basically just means they're words and motions on paper, acted out by individuals in Army suits. Of course, from a literal viewpoint, this is correct--but it's hard to doubt the realistic nature of a film when we are fully convinced that what we are witnessing is true. These characters in ""Full Metal Jacket"" seem hardly likable, and they are very rarely put through any type of emotional anguish, which is the key to all great war films--even ""Forrest Gump"" had some.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first half of the movie, which is basically the training period. We see a group of soldiers being prepared for conflict outside their barracks by a nasty Drill Sergeant (R. Lee Ermy). One of the kids in the group, Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), is a bit of a dummy--and the drill sergeant takes out all his anger and fury upon the kid. After weeks of training, Lawrence finally snaps in half and shoots the drill sergeant, then himself, leaving Joker as the sole witness.<br/><br/>This is where the first half of the film essentially ends and the second half begins, which is all boring combat. This is where I started to grow weary of the film's heavy-handed anti-war protest and ineffective characters. There was at least some type of subtle setup for the Lawrence character, but all the other characters are just wandering clichés.<br/><br/>This may sound like an ignorant thing to say, but it's not. I enjoyed ""Full Metal Jacket"" to a certain extent. I just can't find it anywhere within me to call this a great film, nor a perfect one. It has many flaws, most of which result from poorly introduced characters and unattached emotions. There are also flaws from a technical viewpoint, such as the voice-over narrative by Modine. It's like screenwriting guru Brian McKee advises students--don't use voice-over unless it's essential to the story. Any idiot can express characters' emotions with their own words.<br/><br/>Voice-over was essential in ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platoon,"" but not here. It only occurs three or four times throughout the film and only halts the progression of the story. It's sloppy, pointless, and Modine's voice provides almost nothing to the story. Some people may disagree with me, but why have a character (in this case Modine) tell us where he's heading to instead of just putting subtitles in grainy Courier font? By introducing the audience to this voice-over, Kubrick does nothing but take the easy route towards scene explanations. Especially considering this voice-over is only used a handful of times for a few seconds each time.<br/><br/>Regardless of technical flaws or figurative flaws, ""Full Metal Jacket"" fails where most war films succeed. Whether you agree with the message or not, Stone knew how to deliver the anti-war message within ""Platoon"" with deadly accuracy and subtlety. There's no subtlety here--Kubrick makes his echoing statement clear from the beginning on. And whether you personally like him or not, Stone also convincingly portray Vietnam. Even DePalma did a fine job of this in ""Casualties of War."" ""Full Metal Jacket"" isn't quite as convincing. Everything's heavy-handed. Everything feels fake. Everything feels contrived. It gets boring very quickly, and feels like an imitator of all the other Vietnam films. And the fact that it was released a year after ""Platoon"" seems to suggest that Kubrick may have indeed been borrowing a few ideas from Stone.<br/><br/>There's a reason the die-hard Kubrick fans consider this one of his lesser works, and there's a reason you don't hear it mentioned very much when war films are discussed. In conclusion, it's just a copycat of many various films, with a dozen or so different ideas that never mix together very successfully.<br/><br/>This is a good war film, but I can't say it's anything more than that.<br/><br/>4/5."
"puttputtk","10","5","9","12 September 2010"," Kubrick's best, and one of film's best
","Full Metal Jacket (1987)<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket seems like 2 great short films rolled into one. The first half is a film about boot camp the second follows a correspondent into urban combat in Vietnam. <br/><br/>The first half is incredible; the boot camp is tense and realistic. But it's a good thing that it doesn't last the whole film. I don't think that it could have been as extreme, they would have had to stretch it out and it would have lost its fast paced action. R Lee Ermey pretty much steals the show in the first half. His performance is impressive and one of the most memorable performances in any war film. Many other characters had good performances as well, mostly Vincent D'Onofrio. His performance starts out seemingly poor. The further his character (Gomer Pyle) gets pushed and the more he starts to look crazy the better performance he gives. Seems like hes better at playing a crazy person than a mentally slow person. <br/><br/>****first part spoiler****<br/><br/>We finish part one with one of the most tense scenes in all of film, with all three main characters giving their best performances. Knowing Kubrick's perfectionism this scene must have been just as tense to shoot as the final outcome. Pyle snaps, kills Hartman, kills himself and no matter how many times I see it, my jaw still drops. The look on D'Onofrio's face is incredible, such pain and insanity. It helps make the scene as memorable as it is, one of the greatest facial performances (is that a term?) ever.<br/><br/>****end spoilers****<br/><br/>Just as it seems like the film is over the second half jumps in. moving from tension at his highest straight into Vietnam and a hooker walking to the beat of ""These Boots are Made for Walking"" A very strange transition that actually works out great. <br/><br/>The second half is still a great movie but not as much as the first half. It's a lot like your average war movie in a lot of ways but still very distinct. We see much different kinds of characters than the average Vietnam movie. Usually it's a bunch of hard asses and one guy who doesn't like what they are doing, while we do see both of those types, we see many others as well. Due to the styles of fighting it's actually more like a World War 2 film rather than Vietnam because its urban warfare rather than in the jungle. <br/><br/>I don't have as much to say about the second half. It's fantastic but nothing that stands out from other great war movies. Great soundtrack, directing, writing, acting, fighting, all of that, just not as memorable as the first half.<br/><br/>****spoilers****<br/><br/>My favorite thing about the second half is that, though they complete little missions, nothing really gets accomplished. It could have ended with the killing of the sniper but that would have made it seem like that was the mission and that finished it. By adding the last scene of the soldiers walking singing the Mickey Mouse song it showed that the war wasn't over and nothing really has changed for them, or the war. I'm guessing this is probably how a lot of people felt during the war, and even after it. <br/><br/>Kubrick didn't mean for this to be an anti war film, but by showing the war the way it was, it can't really be seen as anything but that, in my opinion. <br/><br/>****end spoilers****<br/><br/>Any fan of Kubrick's work should definitely watch this film. Anyone that's a fan of war films or really fans of movies in general should not miss this one either. One of cinema's best. <br/><br/>10/10"
"funkyfry","9","5","9","9 March 2009"," Kubrick's ode to war and man
","War was the only subject really that Stanley Kubrick seemed to come back to over and over again. This film combines some of the satirical humor that made ""Dr. Strangelove"" such a classic with the brutally objective eye that he trained on war in ""Paths of Glory."" It's a story of the making of a killer, from boot-camp to the wrecked urban landscape of Vietnam. Matthew Modine plays the primary character, ""Joker"", and you'll also see Vincent D'Onofrio giving a wonderful performance as ""Gomer Pile"" and R. Lee Ermey perfectly cast as the hard-ass drill instructor.<br/><br/>But it's not really a movie about individual people, it's a movie about the loss of identity and individuality in the context of indoctrination and life-or-death struggles. As in Kubrick's ""2001"", the characters are only a mechanism for the themes of the film. It is a deliberately anti-melodramatic film that seeks to create its own formula. Like ""Barry Lyndon"", its period recreations are incredibly faithful. The idea is more to transport you as the viewer into the environment, and not to allow us the easy separation between self and experience that a strong protagonist would have afforded us.<br/><br/>The only real problem with the film is that there's no suitable ending, and what we do get by way of a conclusion is only a logical extension of the themes and doesn't really feel like it arises naturally from the material in any other way. I wish maybe something else could have been done to wrap it up, but I'm not sure what.<br/><br/>Where other war films give us either heroism or villainy, this film is quite obviously about the ""duality of man"", a phrase that even finds its way into the script. It views the phenomenon of war as just that, a natural product of the collective human imagination that follows its own rhythm and rules. And if there was no war, then what place would there be in the world for all these warriors we create? Sgt. Hartmann (Ermey) practically praises Lee Harvey Oswald for his sniping prowess, and another officer later ponders, ""when we rotate back to the States, we're gonna miss not having anyone worth shooting."""
"tsf-1962","10","5","9","20 November 2006"," war is hell
","War is hell, but boot camp is worse. At least that's the impression I got from watching ""Full Metal Jacket,"" Stanley Kubrick's second anti-war classic in thirty years (the first was 1957's ""Paths of Glory."") Since it's based on fact, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is not as mind-bending as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""The Shining,"" but it has all of Kubrick's visual trademarks: harsh, bright lighting; cold, impersonal settings; and lots of whites, reds, and golds. Like the other movies, it deals with ordinary Americans seeking to survive in a hostile environment: first, boot camp, run by a psycho drill instructor (R. Lee Ermey), then urban warfare in Hue City, where they must contend with both the Viet Cong and their own superiors. The boot camp sequence is the best part of the movie: Ermey's sergeant character is clearly out of control, but he's not really a bad guy: he's just doing his job, trying to teach the recruits the skills they will need if they're going to survive in Vietnam. To see Vincent D'Onofrio as the slug-like ""Gomer Pyle,"" then see him in his present role as Detective Robert Goran in ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"" is to see just how much this amazing actor has grown. Matthew Modine's Joker is the voice of reason and the story's anchor. The combat scenes are horrifying, but the movie ends on an oddly upbeat note, the troops singing the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" theme song as they pull out of Hue. Add a killer soundtrack of 60s rock and roll and a hilarious cameo by Papillon Soo Soo as a consumptive Vietnamese hooker, and you've got a winner. Maybe not as good as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but still a great war film."

","Full Metal Jacket was one of Kubrick's better films, and to be honest I was pretty torn on what to give this film. Although many will go against my decision, I decided to give Full Metal Jacket an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. The film had outstanding visuals and audio design, but Kubrick's odd way of storytelling bogs down the movie and ultimately hurts the film's pacing, character development, and much more. The acting in the film was great, and the tone literally put you back into the Vietnam War in 1968 (when the second and third act take place). This was an extremely hard film to watch, but I felt it was an absolute great representation of what war really is. So in conclusion, although Full Metal Jacket had some great moments, it was ultimately three short films tied together by one thing.. Kubrick.

"Joe_Walker","Null","4","7","28 May 2004"," A Delightful Movie, but not the Best take on Vietnam.
","Full Metal Jacket is a very well made look at Vietnam, from basic training to fighting combat. In the movie, we are lead by Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine) as he is trained by Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) at a Marine training camp, while recruit Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) finds himself worthless and doesn't think that he can take it from Hartman's pressure. After graduating, Joker goes to Vietnam at a reporter, and meets up with old buddy from boot camp (Arliss Howard). They are pinned down by a sniper and try to find a way out, as Joker realizes the real horrors of war. Full Metal Jacket is terrific but not a perfect war film. It was excellent until Joker went to Vietnam, and then it went a tad downhill but it was still great. Kubrick does a great job of directing once again while Modine is good in the lead role. Ermey is instantly classic in the role of Hartman, shouting great one-liners and the real man who's in the mood for ""no more Mr. Nice Guy"". A very good war film with only a couple of flaws. <br/><br/>9/10 stars."
"nawlinsurfer-1","5","7","16","30 September 2005"," Adequate, yet flawed war movie
","Though the boot camp scenes were riveting and quite accurate for the Marine Corps in the 60's (from what I've heard from first-hand accounts), the shooting of the drill instructor (played with superb realism by former Marine D.I. Lee Ermey) was a total buzz-kill and far-reaching. For me, this misguided climax threw a poorly conceived curve-ball, slowing the film down dramatically and losing its well-earned momentum. Private Pyle could have simply killed himself and this would have been adequate. Disturbingly, the audience is tortuously subjected to Joker's tiring and annoying dialog for most of the film (do we really care about him?) while the plot seemingly meanders in an unclear direction; that is, until the action involving the sniper begins. Viewers are then suddenly catapulted into the fray (possibly a move by director Kubrick to mimic the shock and violence of Vietnam upon the audience) and the story begins to garner a clearer sense of purpose and focus. The madness and confusion during the combat scenes bring strong realistic performances, but ultimately, the film fades to an end and loses insight along the way. There is no strong sense of closure or solid setup for a conclusion regarding the characters (as we saw in ""Platoon""). Though the combat scenes are well done, most of the characters are not fully developed enough for the audience to identify with or even really care about. The potential was definitely there and the cinematography was excellent, but the script had some problems that could have been rewritten for an easier, more realistic flow. Some key adjustments could have served the film well overall."
"zardoz-13","7","3","5","12 June 2009"," Not Up To Kubrick's Usual Brilliance
","""Dr. Strangelove"" director Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" qualifies a cynical, blistering, and profane expose of the U.S. Marine Corps, its dehumanizing mentality, and the amoral experience of the Vietnam War. Sadly, despite the talent involved, ""Full Metal Jacket"" doesn't eviscerate the Vietnam War with either the same intensity or insight as either Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" or Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter."" The cast consists of unknown newcomers, including Mathew Modine, Adam Baldwin, Vincent D'Onofrio, Dorian Harwood, Arliss Howard, John Terry, and Ed O'Ross. D'Onofrio delivers the best performance as a crazy recruit, while former Drill Sergeant R.L. Emery steals the show. His dialogue and use of rampant profanity will stick in your mind long after this film fades. Kubrick makes good use of the Nancy Sinatra tune ""These Boots Were Made for Walking.""<br/><br/>Taking Gustav Hasford's minor novel ""The Short Timers,"" Kubrick penned the screenplay with Hasford and Michael Herr. The first 45 minutes takes place on Parris Island in a Marine Boot Camp where a Looney tunes drill sergeant subjects his raw recruits to the worst that he can dish and turns into killers. Indeed, the first scene shows the principal actors for the Boot Camp scene getting their heads shaved clean in a barber shop. The second half occurs in Vietnam before the Tet Offensive. <br/><br/>Amazingly, Kubrick—because he hated to leave England—lensed the entire film on location in England. Unfortunately, the riveting first half at Parris Island overshadows the second half in Vietnam, and the film concludes rather lamely with a drawn-out sequence involving a female sniper who pins down our heroes in an urban setting. Incidentally, as surprising as it is when she is revealed as the sniper, it is interesting to note that Private Joker (Mathew Modine) foreshadows this revelation as the outset of the Vietnam sequence when he observes that NVA officers are sometimes women. Several memorable scenes occur in the Vietnam sequence, particularly when Private Joker questions the helicopter gunship gunner how he can kill women and children. His response that he leads them more is ghoulish. Private Joker's run in with a high ranking officer about his helmet plastered with stickers is funny, too. The soundtrack boasts several Top 40 hits from the era that fit in with the storyline, especially Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots Are Made For Walking.""<br/><br/>What a letdown for Kubrick."
"opuffen","10","3","5","11 May 2005"," The ""Saving Private Ryan"" of Vietnam
","Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" does for the Vietnam war what ""Saving Private Ryan"" did for WWII- create a strikingly (and sometimes disturbingly) realistic portrait of the horrors of war. However, FMJ's depiction of the de-humanizing affects of boot camp and later the psychological effects of war on soldiers (similar to Apocalypse Now) set it apart from many other war films, such as Private Ryan. Matthew Modine and Adam Baldwin give excellent performances of de-sensitized GIs, but the true standout of the cast is R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor at Paris Island boot camp. Despite the fact that the film was shot entirely in Britain, Kubrick does a very convincing job of recreating Vietnam there, and all aspects of the film are very realistic and authentic. Also unlike other war films, FMJ doesn't focus on the action and violence (which is still very realistic) and instead relies on complex characters to drive the story. Modine's Pvt. Joker is especially interesting, dying to get into action one minute, but once the bullets start whizzing, scared out of his wits.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: an excellent war film, and should be considered one of the best of all time. ***1/2 out of ****"
"wlroes","Null","3","5","11 October 2004"," two halves make a whole
","This movie is split into two halves. The first gives an excellent depiction of what is done in boot camp. The elimination of the individual. At least a big part of the individual. And it starts with the very first image. The hair cut. Anything that identified you as who you were before you got there is gone. A lot of people have commented on the weaknesses of the 2nd halve of the film. I don't know, maybe it could have been done better. But I think it does a great job of depicting what happens to men who have gone through such training. Men being used as decoys to see if the way is safe for a tank. What normal person would do such a thing. Someone who had been through the Paris Island experience. All the things that happen to them, risking everything as point man for your platoon, risking yourself and others to retrieve one member of your platoon, killing a wounded sniper like you would put a dog to sleep. All this is the result of the training. And to end the film when it did, has the effect of having you wonder - what became of these men- oh, they are your workmates, neighbors, high school teachers, etc.. with such experiences in their memories. and then you think, how are we all, marines or otherwise, conditioned to perceive ourselves and our world. In this respect, the movie has similarities to clockwork orange. perhaps that is why Kubrick chose to do this film."

","Well, the drill sergeant in this film certainly was memorable. No one will argue that. How good this film is overall, however, is up to debate. My feeling is that it's overrated because Stanley Kubrick - a favorite of critics - directed the movie and helped write the screenplay.<br/><br/>It's notable, mainly for the ultra-profane and ultra-color descriptions that Lee Ermey uses as ""Gny. Sgt. Hartman,"" the Parris Island Marine drill-gunnery sergeant. Hearing several of his tirades is something you won't forget!<br/><br/>At times, the film is too hard-edged, too political, too preachy and just not a smooth enough story. You know it could be much better. <br/><br/>Yes, if my ears can stand the assault, Ermey can be fun to hear, and young, fat Vincent D'Onofrio as ""Pvt. Pyle,"" the victim of the sergeant's rage, terminates his boss in a memorable scene, the main character of the film is ""Pvt. Joker,"" played by Matthew Modine, and I didn't like the guy. Maybe that's another reason I don't rate this film as highly as others. I couldn't root for the guy the scriptwriters made as the ""good guy.""<br/><br/>The clincher came when Pvt. Joker told the sergeant he didn't believe in the Virgin Mary, which got him points with the sarge. Being a non-Believer meant the ""kid is all right."" That, of course, is ultra-secular Kubrick getting his atheist propaganda in, something he did in several of his films.<br/><br/>After watching several years of the TV program, Law and Order: Criminal Intent, it would be interesting (and strange) go back now and see D'Onofrio again. I probably wouldn't recognize him. After watching him as the dignified Sherlock-Holmes type ""Detective Robert Goren,"" I don't know if I want to see him back in this role, however!"

","Kubrick is a director whose movies age very badly.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is no exception. <br/><br/>I can see what he was trying to do, i think, with that awful drill instructor screaming out of the screen for far too long, and the gradual transformation of the 'gentle giant'. It was simply over done. Too much sonic assault makes for a physically uncomfortable movie. The drill instructor also didn't seem to be able to pull off his lines, either. It felt wooden, directed more to the audience rather than his trainees. Pyle's descent into overplayed madness was pointless, too. Was it simply to highlight the earlier point that marines make the best psycho murders, or did we need someone to shoot the shouty man after he'd harassed us for so long? At any rate, the actor playing Pyle couldn't quite carry it off - he was clearly acting and had no menace in him beyond his physical size. Given the superlative praise other reviewers have given this scene, it was very disappointing.<br/><br/>The part set in Vietnam was not quite as bad. It relies on us having seen other Vietnam war films to work, though, specifically apocalypse now and platoon, far far better, more involving and more engaging movies. Perhaps we are supposed to make those links then feel clever for reading extra depth into a movie that says very little.<br/><br/>the final scene, as the soldiers sing a song about mickey mouse seems like the point of the movie. An extended, over-laboured, comment on the mickey mouse nature of the Vietnam war, with the personal, human cost hammered into us at excessive volume before hand.<br/><br/>In summary, a reasonably tedious movie, a nearly blank canvas for the viewer to project their own interpretation and feel clever. In typical Kubrick style, over-loud, relying on sonic assault to batter down the viewer's mind so that they are left unable to critically assess the disappointingly thin content."

","Stanley Kubricks, Full Metal Jacket is widely considered to be one of the definitive war films, yet when I heard about it all I ever heard about was about the first act which is a new platoon of soldiers being trained by a cruel drill instructor so I was really wondering if the film was only focused on the training of the troops. It doesn't and that we're this film truly lost it for me. But I do think this film has plenty of positives, as I said the half of this movie is truly amazing it's intense and has an amazing performance for R Lee Emery I thought he was so convincing as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman he was hilarious and imposing and is by far the greatest thing about this movie. An extremely young Vincent D'Nofrio is in this movie and he was also amazing in this film, he was such a sympathetic character and even when he starts improving you still feel for him because you know just how much this training process has taken from him. I'm pretty sure it goes without saying that Stanley Kubrick directed this film to perfection, he always he something visually interesting happening on screen and their was never a dull moment for that first half. My praise pretty much stops there I think the last half of this film was dull, boring and tensionless. A big part of that was due to the completely boring protagonist, he never leaves any impression on the viewer and has absolutely no character development or arc. Honestly other than D'Nofrio nobody has any kind of character development and it really shows in the action sequences were there is absolutely no tension whatsoever because every character is interchangeable. The first half of this movie was incredibly intense because we saw the effects it had in the characters, the last half doesn't take the time to do this they just go on as if nothing's happened. The Vietnam arc of this film is simply just boring because it's pretty much just the same shots repeated for the last hour, Private Joker standing around talking to someone while other soldiers fight in the background. <br/><br/>I wanted to love this movie, I really did but I couldn't, it's got far to many flaws when it comes to its characters and how it handles the arc in Vietnam.

I'm pretty sure none of you has ever been in a training camp or in a war (neither I have). So how do you know? Well, I know it wasn't authentic. Consider the scene with the trainee in the camp having hard time climbing over the hurdle. Well, a funny scene, wasn't it? Just like an one from Police Academy. (BTW, I prefer Police Academy to Full Meta Jacket, when I want to see a comedy.) All the jokes (or at least half of them) make this film sentimental and the ""serious"" war scenes pathetic. Oh, yes, the war scenes... I really liked the authenticity of burning concrete. Have you ever seen burning concrete with flames in equal distances from each other? If not, watch the film, this is your opportunity! But the scene which really got me was when the marines went to save their dying/dead friend, undergoing a certain death and violating the orders. Well, if this is how American soldiers behave, then there's no wonder they didn't win the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>Some of you say the strength of this film is in describing the violence. Well, I felt completely untouched. I'm not an American spectator, crying when the marines lose their brother in the war. If you want to see violence that makes you want to vomit and have bad dreams, you should see ""Salo"" from Pasolini - film without a single drop of blood (as far as I remember).<br/><br/>Alright, all in all I think this movie is far away from authenticity, it has been shot for the American (male) audience and I don't like it.

My opinion that day would be reinforced by the opinion I had years back. Full Metal Jacket, though, is a film that I am always certain will have changes of opinion over time. Out of all the films that I have reviewed so far, this is the one that I feel like I could review again in a year and come to very different conclusions.<br/><br/>I've seen this film four times, and I'm still coming to terms with it. I've moved beyond the idea that the first forty-five minutes are a mini-movie and wholly superior to the final seventy minutes. I still think that the first section of the film on Parris Island is superior to the second long section that ends the film, but there's definitely a deeper relationship between the Private Joker character. There are themes and motifs at play in the first half that continue into the second. I just can't quite get past a few things that hamper the whole experience for me.<br/><br/>The events on Parris Island are both hilarious and horrifying, often at the same time. A group of marine recruits goes through basic training, and we latch onto two of the largely interchangeable maggots as main character, Private Joker and Private Pyle. These are, of course, not their real names, but the nicknames stick. They are robbed of who they were before walking onto the island. There's that dehumanization idea that keeps popping up in Kubrick's filmography. The process of training strips even the interior individuality so that they all become alike in behavior, marching perfectly in time, performing the same actions, and reacting the same way to their drill instructor.<br/><br/>Our two main characters have different paths to this sameness. Joker is smart and thoughtful which allows him to navigate the minefield of the instructor's verbal jabs in ways that do him credit, eventually getting him the position of squad leader. Pyle, on the other hand, is stupid (not pejoratively, mind you, Pyle is obviously supposed to have an IQ of less than 90) and has incredible difficulty adapting to life in the corps. He has trouble telling his left from his right. He can't master the obstacle course. He hides jelly donuts in his footlocker. It is only after Joker is forced to take Pyle under his wing that Pyle begins to shape up, turning the corner in his training, and eventually going way too far in the other direction. He becomes the ultimate psychotic killing machine, putting a round into the drill instructor's chest after graduation before shooting himself in the head.<br/><br/>Just from a cinematic experience point of view, this first forty-five minutes is a tour de force. It's nearly impressionistic and heavily reliant on editing to create the general sense of unease that pulls us in as we watch the humanity stripped so completely from Pyle to the point that he does only kill.<br/><br/>The second section ends up feeling both more straight forward cinematically and more confused narratively, which can create a certain letdown from a movie going point of view. However, as I wrote earlier, there are stronger connections between the two sections that my first viewings of the film originally revealed to me.<br/><br/>Animal Mother, for instance, seems like another version of Pyle. He seems pretty dim the first time we meet him, but he's also obviously a great killing machine. Knowing that the movie ends with Joker leading the survivors of the film in a rendition of the theme song to ""The Mickey Mouse Club House"", I began considering what that could mean more than an hour before it came up, and the idea of infantilization creeped into my brain. I began to watch as a group of children lost every parental figure they had (starting with the drill instructor) until they were faced with a great life or death situation without any guidance from a higher authority. There are also signs of the breakdown of all civilization in the face of war, an idea so big I'm not sure it fits terribly well in only seventy-minutes of screentime.<br/><br/>And that's where I end up. I feel like this second half is simply tackling too much. Breakdown, though, is a great lens to view it through. Joker starts this section negotiating with a hooker for her time, playfully joking with her. That attitude extends through his meetings with his CO as a reporter for Stars and Stripes. His life is easy hidden away in Saigon. He can talk big about his time in the  and no one can really challenge him. It's when the Tet Offensive begins that his veneer of bravery breaks down and he starts shooting maniacally at a small invading force. He then gets sent out into the field to document some of the counter action.<br/><br/>It's about here that I feel the movie just begins to break down itself narratively. From the time Joker is reunited with his mate from Parris Island (Private Cowboy) to the time that their squad leader dies in the final city, the movie kind of just swirls around without a real direction. There's marching and everyone talks big about nothing in particular. It's more of a dick measuring contest than anything else, and it culminates in another scene about a hooker as the men negotiate with her pimp and then jockey for who gets her first. As a contrast to the first hooker scene, Joker has little to say or do here. He's no longer standing out, and he's been pushed more to the background. Much like in Parris Island, he's more of one of several than an individual again.<br/><br/>From purely a filmmaking perspective, the final thirty minutes, as the squad gets pinned down by a hidden sniper in a building, might be as good as the movie's first forty-five minutes. This stuff is really well filmed with clear action, a great outdoor set, smoke, and fire. It's tense as the squad watches several of their comrades take repeated sniper fire, mortally wounding them but not killing them, and the rest find a way around the sniper's position. It's a great sustained sequence that ends with the reveal that the sniper is a young girl, a wonderful point of irony to cap off the movie that's pretty steeped in it.<br/><br/>Some more technical notes real quick. It's screamingly obvious that this movie wasn't filmed in Vietnam. It was filmed in England, and there's no place in England that looks like a Vietnamese paddy field, so there are numerous shots of the countryside that looks like flat bits of England with palm trees. The giant set that ends the film is both a blessing and a curse. When the frame's edges are filled with parts of the set, I find it completely convincing. When the edges of the frame extend out beyond the set, it once again feels like an outdoor set in the middle of England. I was also assured by my high school history teacher (who was a marine who had done three tours of duty in Vietnam) that while the yelling of the drill instructor was spot on, drill instructors would never ever strike a recruit.<br/><br/>So, that's kind of where I am overall with the film. I know that the first half informs the second half, but I still haven't quite figured out how. I think I can grasp the overall thematic thrust of the film, but I haven't really developed it in my own head. I believe that there's more to this movie than my first four viewings have left with me, and I'm more than willing to give the film another try in the future. But for now, I have to embrace the incongruity between the two major sections, the flaccidity of a large part of the second section, and an opaqueness that I can't quite get through, and relegate Full Metal Jacket to the second tier of Kubrick's filmography. Maybe when I revisit this again in a year or so, I'll read this and build on my original thoughts instead of just repeating them. We shall see."

","Full Metal Jacket is not only, to me, Kubrick's best film, but it is by far the best war movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The movie is about Private ""Joker"" Davis (played by Matthew Modine) who is going through basic training and is suffering through insults from his foul mouthed drill sarge, Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and helps a guy named Private ""Pyle"" Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) get through basic training. Pyle takes a pretty bad detour, and Joker is graduating to the Marine Corps and is sent to Vietnam, where he joins the Battle of Hué.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket was a very realistic and well established war film. It had a very clear story, the acting was top notch, the war elements were amazing, and it ran in a fast pace.<br/><br/>R. Lee Ermey, in my opinion, was the best part of the film. Not only does he get to be humorous, but he does a great job at playing a legit drill sergeant. Vincent D'Onofrio was pretty good at playing Private Pyle, as he turned psycho later on, and Modine was great as the lead character.<br/><br/>The war elements were also phenomenal. With all the gun action, explosions, and violence, they really did a solid job giving this film some good war spirit.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I love Full Metal Jacket and it has aged very well for over 30 years."
"philosopherjack","Null","2","3","25 March 2018"," An astounding exercise in strangifying
","I suppose your assessment of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket depends largely on how you see the relationship between its two halves: the first set in a South Carolina training camp where a group of newly-recruited Marines are belittled and terrorized by their drill sergeant; the second following a couple of the characters to Vietnam, to be belittled and terrorized by the war itself. The first time I saw the film, the transition seemed jarring, but over time I've come to see it as validating the sergeant's tactics as much as damning them. Of course his relentlessness makes them tougher, but Kubrick pushes the abuse into the realm of twisted poetry and mythmaking, into an exercise in fictionalizing oneself (no one ever gets called by their real name) and then wearing that fiction like a full metal jacket. If Matthew Modine's character ""Joker"" copes best, it's perhaps because of his head start on such a project with his dumb John Wayne impersonations and smart mouth. In Vietnam, working for the Stars and Stripes newspaper and chafing at its mediocre reporting values, he craves greater engagement, then gets a dose of it, and in his final voice over is retreating back to the imagined, to the world of the sergeant's invented ""Mary Jane Rottencrotch,"" and thereby finding a measure of peace, even of satisfaction. Given time, he might retreat even further, maybe into a photograph as at the end of The Shining; the interiors in the first half of Full Metal Jacket often feels like it might have been shot in some of the back corridors of the Overlook Hotel, and the second half might just be taking place inside a more cunning and noisy metaphysical maze. Whether it's an ""anti-war"" film seems somehow like the wrong question; any attempts even to engage with it - as in Joker's simultaneous wearing of a peace symbol and a ""Born to Kill"" slogan on his helmet, explained as some kind of comment on the ""duality of man"" - seem draining and futile. As such, the film, even if it's not one of Kubrick's very best, is an astounding exercise in strangifying."
"aciessi","9","2","3","8 November 2017"," Paint It Black
","Believe it or not, this was considered a flop and a disappointment for Stanley Kubrick back in 1987. Many of his fans were expecting a war epic along the lines of Apocalypse Now. But the thing is, Kubrick already made his war epic, in Paths of Glory. Secondly, it's clear by watching the film that Kubrick's intention was not to talk about the politics of the war, or even stage big budgeted action sequences. His goal was to encapsulate the overall feeling many had about the Vietnam War on and off the battlefield. A pointless exercise of human slaughter. Vietnam, for many, was the definition of man's inhumanity to man. That is what Full Metal Jacket is truly about. The unforgettable first 45 minutes of the picture has us see the ways in which these soldiers are desensitized. The loud-mouthed, profane Sgt. Hartman humiliates the new recruits to their core and as a result, mentally destroys the most vulnerable of the recruits in Leonard ""Private Pyle"" Lawrence. Once we enter Vietnam, Kubrick shows us the casualties of war, and man's inability to show humility towards each other. In the end, Vietnam is a killing field and some of those fighting it ultimately enjoyed the killing. Full Metal Jacket doesn't resolve like a novel, nor do any of the characters receive any kind of redemption. You can say that it's in the tradition of all of Kubrick's films."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","3","4 November 2017"," Pyle. Pyle! PYLE!
","""Full Metal Jacket"" is an American live action film from 1987, so this one has its 30th anniversary this year. It runs for minimally under 2 hours and it is of course one of the most known works by legendary director Stanley Kubrick and the fact that this one is in the IMDb Top250 certainly works in his favor here. It is also the film that brought him his final Oscar nomination as he was part of the team that adapted the novel this is based on. Anyway, there is a pretty clean structure in here. The first 50 minutes or so are about the training for the armed forces and we see a handful of recruits, most of them relatively young still, and how they want to become American soldiers. Problem is they have a really tough gunnery sergeant in charge of them. The latter is played by R. Lee Ermey and this film brought him the biggest success of his career, a Golden Globe nomination and that's quite something, even if he came short at the Oscars. I guess he won't be too mad about it. The second half then is in fact scenes from the battlefield. And as I am not too much of a film of (anti-)war movies in general, these did not do as much for me as the psychological thriller (you probably can call it that) in the hour before that. This does not necessarily have a lot to do with it being bad or anything, on the contrary there are some good scenes there like the one with the prostitute, but with my personal preference because I find stuff like Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan equally underwhelming. I liked this one here probably even more because of the insight into group dynamics and relationships between the characters, even if this area also was one of my biggest problems. Sure it isn't an actors movie and that's fine, but most of the characters and actors seem so interchangeable here sadly.<br/><br/>The one exception to that is Vincent D'Onofrio. I may be biased here too because I like him a lot as well, but I don't think many could have pulled it off as good as he did here and the fact that he is of course missing completely from the second half of the film is not helping at all. Anyway I am glad he starred in here because it was the breakthrough for a long and prolific career on the small and big screen and hopefully a lot more will be coming too. Perhaps the R. Lee Ermey fans will agree that the film got worse in the second half as there must be a reason behind his awards recognition, not only at the Globes. I am sure his actual military background definitely helped him with his success story. As for D'Onofrio, his last scene was definitely the highlight of the film and boy did he look scary there. Okay, about the film what else can you say. I personally think it hardly had any moments when it was really weak, but the greatness early on vanishes eventually, so yeah unless you love military films, I suggest you turn it off perhaps at the big breaking point I mentioned already. It's not IMDb top250 worthy in my opinion, but as a whole it is still a fairly decent watch. I give it a thumbs-up."
"The_Hateful_Citizen","9","2","3","28 June 2017"," The great art !
","Wow. This movie is fantastic. Stanley Kubrick decided to separate his film in two parts, one part where we see the training of the soldiers and another where these same soldiers are in Vietnam for the war. From the beginning, the Sergeant Hartman announced the color, he managed to make laughter by humiliating and insulting his soldiers, he comes out incredible catchwords and remains funny, even at his death. However, he embodies the harshness of American training, not hesitating to punish all his men for the error of only one of them, but he don't forget to spare the one who had made the mistake, In order to this guy be hate by his mates. The second part of the film shows the horror of the Vietnam war through Joker, a war reporter whose job it is to hide the truth about the war from the Americans The same paradoxical man with a ""Born to Kill"" helmet but also a ""Peace and Love"" pine, showing the absurdity of this war. In the end, at the end of each of the two parts, goes wrong, showing the failure of the US Army. With this film, Stanley Kubrick demonstrates the absurdity of this Vietnam War where the United States destroyed men in a war lost on all fronts. For me, this movie is really not far to get a 10. The great art!"
"aph-ricaud","7","2","3","14 February 2015"," Kubrick's patchwork of war
","Divided in two parts, this movie first looks like a patchwork of two completely different films. The first part shows young men entering a combat training camp. They do not look like the stereotype of soldiers: some are skinny, others are fat, and they do not master guns as if they were born with. The role of the Sergeant is simple: turn them into killing machines, whatever method it requires: humiliation or violence. (But one appreciates him, or maybe appreciates to hate him.) Their only wife? : Their rifles. Their only enemy? Communism. But despite this tough training, they are still humans, and friendships grow on the battlefield. But one of them, weaker than the others, is totally brainwashed by the doctrine he is taught, beyond the expectations of the Sergeant. Then, one understands that killing machines are dangerous for everyone, including those who created them. The second part occurs in Vietnam, following a former soldier -of the first part's training camp- who has become a war journalist. Though it takes place on battlefield, it seemed to me that the second part was way more relaxed than the first, where tension was omnipresent. Here, brotherhood ""hides"" slaughters behind jokes, though those slaughters are shown in an explicit way. The second part expresses the duality of these men, who are ready to give their lives, but less for patriotic reasons, than to save and protect their companions, because they kept their humanity. And that is what, in my opinion, links the two parts: once at war, they apply what they learnt in the training camp: killing, dealing with horror, but keeping in mind they are common humans."

","Events of dehumanization as learned scene by scene as coldly dictated by director Stanley Kubrick. Our Marines are always rallying around something white trying to hold onto their own values, themselves and, overall, their sanity. Much like ""The Deer Hunter"", this anti-war film is broken down into two parts, one prior to war, and then into the beast itself. While one movie shone an extra light on those stateside, Full Metal Jacket stayed with our boys and to what was left of themselves; their boyhood instincts (to defend each other) and their Mickey Mouse marches which drove the point home. This cold film doesn't bring you into each character as others might, but war is not about one person, is it? It is full of dogma (first to go, last to know), direction (our marines got lost) and dehumanization (see the first hour alone to hear the non-stop rant of Gunnery Seargent Hartman (Lee Ermey). Brutal and darkly funny, this is what I held onto as our narrator, Joker (Mathew Modine) is simply trying to fend off the brainwash, while it bounced off of Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) whose story tells us all Kubrick needed to say. That is why the second half of the film in Viet Nam seemed only to serve the audience a follow up and adventure as to what happened to some of our original boot camp marines. I still found the film both detached and personal, as if I was trying to fend off the disgracing of my viewers' soul. I like this film due to that internal struggle of whether or not to view war as acceptable."

","The star of this movie is the drill instructor (D.I.) for the boot camp attended by the group of men that signed up for the United States Marine Corps. He is always verbally and occasionally physically savage to the men as he pulls apart their feelings and turns them into automatons that are at one with their rifles. It is interesting that Lee Erney, the man that played the D.I., was in fact a drill instructor during the Vietnam War and much of his dialog was ad lib. When the men are in boot camp, there are times when you empathize with them.
The war action is just as gritty, the last section of the movie is set in the Vietnamese city of Hue during the Tet Offensive when it was overrun by the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong. The set is so real that once I was done watching the movie, I went to a search engine to find out where the scenes were shot. I have watched actual footage of the battle for Hue and the reality is uncanny.
The story follows a group of young men that join the Marines and proceed through boot camp before being sent to Vietnam to fill various roles. After some time in country, a few of them are reunited in the battle for Hue. Despite their now brutal personalities, they show tenderness towards each other as only fellow soldiers in battle can.

","I had heard great things about this movie but didn't remember specific details until I saw it. I only saw it because WGN America is in my basic basic cable package which I have just to be able to watch what I should receive free with an antenna. And I happened to see a couple of interesting movies as I was looking carefully through the listings at Christmas.<br/><br/>I know the G-rated version of Boot Camp from ""Gomer Pyle, USMC"", which the drill sergeant here was familiar with. This was nothing like that. At first I assumed this man was unspeakably brutal, but one imdb reviewer said yes, he was in Boot Camp during the era when this was set, and this was realistic. I'm sorry to hear that. This treatment of human beings was nothing less than disturbing and upsetting. And entertaining because it was so well done. In fact, we could even laugh at times.<br/><br/>LAUGH? YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY? Sir, no sir!<br/><br/>""South Park"" once tried to set a record for uses of the S-word in an episode. I believe this movie beats that record for the word itself and countless compound words that include it and then some. There were only a couple of words WGN America wouldn't allow.<br/><br/>How could anyone treat people this way? Is this really going to produce confident fighters? For one man in particular, we saw the predictable result of treatment beyond what any human should endure. Yes, he will be a killing machine. But he is not the proud honorable warrior that the Marines are known for. More like a serial killer with a frightening expression on his face, a man we should be afraid to send to Vietnam.<br/><br/>How did Lee Ermey not win an Oscar? Or at least get a nomination? And Vincent D'Onofrio should have at least been nominated as well. Called ""Gomer Pyle"" because he is such an incompetent idiot, he is patiently trained by Joker, in a way that is more likely to get results. I remember the same thing happening to the original Gomer in his show's pilot, only that was done by his D.I. who was given the impression Gomer was a general's son sent to test him. In truth, this Gomer Pyle probably should have washed out, as the original Gomer's D.I. believed would happen in his case. But then we wouldn't have found that quite as entertaining. Or disturbing.<br/><br/>And talk about disturbing. I began to realize what I thought I had heard. I don't know if I ever did, but that's what happened.<br/><br/>And then the whole tone of the movie changes. We get to laugh a few more times before things get really serious. Things aren't too bad where combat is not taking place, but it's still not family-friendly by a long shot. And regardless of which side they are on, Vietnamese people are treated like dirt by the white and black soldiers (I'm not sure they are all Marines, and I think ""soldiers"" may be an acceptable term for those in the service on land). After all, any of them could be the enemy.<br/><br/>Finally, there is real combat. Wait, this is war? It's not the traditional image of war. It's more like war has been in the past couple of decades. In fact, it's like an episode of Lucas Till's ""MacGyver"" but far more violent, and there's no science genius who can solve any problem and make anything out of whatever parts he can find.<br/><br/>Someone is filming a documentary, which makes things interesting. We hear the opinions of those who are serving.<br/><br/>Oscar worthy? Not really, not here. But like Boot Camp, it is quite disturbing. The enemy is prepared to kill or be killed. Some of those on our side have quite an unsettling attitude. When we finally meet the enemy, there are moral decisions to be made.

They were so strong, organized and funny that one could only feel sympathy for them. By the end of the first part one was expecting this hard training to result in forming some mighty heroes.<br/><br/>However soon enough one sees the result of the dehumanization in the boot camp.

","I am alive. And I am not afraid."" These last words from the movie, sum up the very reality and terror of war. From our homes, sat on comfy cushions softer than air, chewing on cheap popcorn, it's easy to romanticise about war, it's glory and the bravery of those involved. But, when we choose to see beyond this fool's illusion, war is a different game altogether. In short, it is the great atrocity that mankind can inflict and suffer, one that brings out the worst in every man.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" taps into this terrorising essense of war and creates a traumatic masterpiece that is built so bare and strong, that it shall drive fear and concern in the heart of all those loungers who choose to look on it. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is one of the most true war films ever because it chooses to capture almost the entire spectrum of impact that war creates on the lives of those involved, especially, the preparatory part before the war. The first half of the movie, that deals with the preparation for the marine corps, is a keen insight into the gruelling regime that aspirants are forced to go through. Regimes that often take a great toll on their body, and more importantly their minds. Traumatic experiences that can turn your mind insane and lead you to shoot your head and yourself to death in a bathroom, with a rifle, at midnight. With brilliantly crafted dialogue that is rich in mockery, vulger speech and rough communication, coupled with the endless sequence of drudgery shot one after another, the first part of the movie provides a true feel of the hardcore, loveless circumstances in the corps.<br/><br/>However, as far as discussing cinematography is concerned, the most remarkable achievement for the movie lies in the neat and systematic shooting of war scenes. Inspite of the general chaos that entails such environments, the shots have been taken so, that the strategies are relayed to the audience very comprehensively and allows them to understand the chaotic proceedings in detail. This, along with the extended nature of scenes that focus on and capture the warcraft, gets the audience engrossed in the battlefield and provides major intellectual satisfaction. And this, along with genuine moments of warmth and brotherhood scantily interspersed in between the cold and brutal circumstances, provides the rewarding feeling that every audience needs to walk away satisfied from a radically provoking film of this nature.<br/><br/>1. Sharp, vulgar and provocative dialogue with brilliant deliverance.
2. Brilliant cinematography that helps present the chaotic battlefield action in a strategic, organised and comprehensible form.
3. Extended scenes focused on warcraft and gruelling routines, to complement the gruesome conditions and amplify the impact the movie has on the audience.<br/><br/>The film intends to say the exact opposite of what it's characters suggest. With smiling faces, flippant attitudes, vulgar speech and often lewd interests, the soldiers seems rather okay if not enjoying the thrill of it all. But it is not what they say, but what we see around them, the manifestation of their actions, that is the true directive to be followed. The flight because they have to. The soldiers, they do not fight for freedom, as one openly confesses. It's nothing but slaughter, ordered by superiors. Bloods of the innocent, spilt for conflicting ideals of great, but unwise men."

","In 1987, Kubrick delivered one of his best known film's to America. Full Metal Jacket shot former Marine R. Lee Ermey to critical acclaim as the tough and darkly hilarious Drill Instructor Hartman. Although the film was meant to be a genuine critique on the duality of man and the warfighter's transformation from an ambivalent civilian to a cog in the killing machine, its purpose was lost on most. Instead, viewers latched onto Ermey's magnificent performance and the first act's powerful closing, feeling that the latter half of the film lacked substance.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket follows Pvt Joker (Matthew Modine) an intelligent Marine Recruit who trains under DI Hartman during the Vietnam War. In boot camp, he bears witness to Hartman's hazing and abuse. Through his indoctrination, he becomes a killer. Yet, he maintains a small bit of humanity. Joker moves on from boot camp and finds himself in Hue City as a combat correspondent. Through the haze of battle, he must overcome the final shreds of his retained humanity in order to survive the violence and bloodshed.<br/><br/>Kubrick elicits frightening performances from his actors. The most memorable of which have become iconic: DI Hartman, Pvt Joker, Pvt Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin). Paired with dramatic lighting from moonlight and ruinous flames, nearly every scene engenders a sense of dread over what might happen next. But character and setting are just a part of the equation. The script powerfully employs violence to display the potential for the human spirit to decay. The violence starts among the recruits and, in the end, the fresh Marines do not see the difference between civilian and combatant. Everyone not wearing green must die.<br/><br/>Although Full Metal Jacket's lasting impression is the boot camp scenes in the first act, multiple viewings reveal the deeper meaning act two carries. It will always be remembered for its ominous tone, striking visuals, engaging characters, dynamic soundtrack, and of course... Drill Instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman."
"josephinemallorys","10","1","1","13 February 2019"," The madness of war
","Unlike many other (Vietnam)war movies, the movie focuses in my opinion on the madness of man instead of the madness of war.<br/><br/>The first half shows how the soldiers are being dehumanized during their military training by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a legendary and already classic role by R. Lee Ermey. The second half shows the madness of man in a war situation. Both of the halves are good and in a way can be seen as a movie alone but for some reason the two halves don't really flow into each other, which is my only real complaint I have about this fantastic and most certainly unique movie. Then the eternal question of which half is the better one? I'm one of the few who actually like the second half more as the first but that is just only personal and different for everyone.<br/><br/>It's strange that the Vietnam battlefield looks more like a WWII European battlefield but I'm sure Kubrick had his reasons for it. Kubrick also manages to put many other weird and unique situations in the movie, which makes this movie truly an unusual viewing experience that shall leave quite an impression on you. Only a brilliant man such as Stanley Kubrick can come up with these kind of scene's.<br/><br/>Despite the oddness level of the movie, the movie still manages to also impress the more casual viewer. The battle sequences are made with lot's of profession and with some beautiful cinematography and great use of music.<br/><br/>The characters are good and typical Kubrick like. Many of the actors give the performance of their lives.<br/><br/>Not the best Vietnam movie but certainly the most unique one. You'll love it long time."

","Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam war epic Full Metel Jacket is a outstanding movie even visionary. I provably consider it to be the second greatest war film. No only be it's so powerful and disturbing, but also because it explores things that many war films usually don't. What it takes to be a soldier to fight in war and what does it do to the human brain? The question is ""not good"". It shows the dehumanizing of war in a way nothing could top it. It kinda fellas like two movies. ""The bootcamp and the actual war"" as James Rolfe said. <br/><br/>The Story is basically through the eyes of a soldier nicknamed Private Joker while in bootcamp he witnesses his drill instructor Gunner Sergeant Hartman (R Le Erney) scream and abuse an overweight soldier nickedbamed Private Pyle. It starts off comediac and funny when Hartman pushes him to the limits and yells at him with his unbelievably hilarious rapid fires, but it soon gets dark and very horrific when Hartman turns his fellow soldier against for stealing a donut. They all have to do extra work because he can't do it. So one night they beat him up in his sleep in a gut-wrenching and powerful moment. This drives Private Pyle insane and he kills Hartman in revenge, and then kills himself.
The second part is when Joker finally joins the war in Vietnam where we see what America has done to the country. And the soldiers Joker comes across are sick psychopaths, especially Animal Mother, because the training they had to go through before becoming soldiers.<br/><br/>It's a brilliant movie, and R Le Erney gives a phenomenal performance that should have won him an Oscar. <br/><br/>So, another brilliant film by Stanley Kubrick."

","First of all I love Kubrick's work, so I came into this with a bias. However I have seen a lot of action and war films, and this one, to an individual who never went to war, seems the most true-to-life, taken as a whole. This IS how you have to look at this film, incidentally; trying to break it down into two or three parts and say which was better is missing the point of the film, I think. <br/><br/>In the same way that ""Trainspotting"" was an anti-drug film that did not gloss over anything, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is (for me) an anti-war film that stares straight at the ugliness of war and the potential for violence within almost all people, especially those trained, conditioned, even twisted, into military roles, without preaching even a single time. Less allegory and more applicability! Wonderful! <br/><br/>The camera work was superb. I felt like I was walking through the movie with the Marines, from the barracks to the battlefield scenes.<br/><br/>I have seen others criticize this film for the voice over, but I felt that it was used sparingly, and was helpful, not overdone. The narrator doesn't say anything that seems out-of-place.<br/><br/>Others have commented on the music, the acting, and so on, so I won't add my repetitive comments, except that the drill sergeant is perfect!<br/><br/>The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom, seconds of terror"" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL.<br/><br/>10 out of 10, perfect."
"yuenw003","10","1","1","19 July 2017"," Stanley Kubrick's genius comes through
","It is said that 90% of directing is casting. That is just part of Kubrick's genius. Another part of his genius is for capturing the right setting and ambiance. This movie has two part: first half is the boot camp drama with R. Lee Ermey (Sgt Hartman), the marine drill instructor, Matthew Modine (Prvt J.T. 'Joker' Davis) as the intelligent, aspiring combat reporter, and Vincent D'Onofrino (Prvt Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Leonard) as the overweight, whipping boy of Sgt Hartman. The drama revolves around Pyle, as Sgt Hartman finds pleasure in belittling his screw ups in front of the others. Joker is paired up with Pyle to be his teacher and mentor. This part of the movie describes the dehumanization process a marine endures in basic training as preparation for them to be fashioned into a weapon of war. The second part is the recruits in the battle field. Joker's assignment as a reporter allows him to view the war experience from an audience's point-of- view. Eventually Pyle tags along with Prvt Cowboy's unit (a fellow recruit) as they patrol the ruins of the city of Hue following an attack known as the Tet Offensive. Towards the climax, 2 of Cowboy's men get picked off by an unknown sniper. This represents the hidden death that lurks at every moment during that war when battling guerrilla fighters. Finally at sundown, Joker leads some men to a building where the sniper is positioned. The palm trees and fire in the ruins of the city makes for an eerie, oriental temple like atmosphere. The music (like elephant cries) in the background also contributes to this effect. Finally the sniper is found and wounded. It turns out to be a girl. Badly wounded, she prays and then asks the men to mercifully killed her. Animal Mother, a heavy machine gunner (like Rambo), wants her to suffer to death as payback. Joker, on the other hand, compassionately chooses to put her out of her misery. The segment of the movie with the sniper is Kubrick's commentary on that war. The Vietnam war was sold to the Americans and those who fought it as the U.S.'s answer to help liberate that country from communism. Ironically, it was reduced to a frustrating effort on the part of young recruits to fight an invisible enemy who very much hated them for their presence in their country."
"PWNYCNY","8","1","1","1 June 2017"," Institutionalized brutality
","This movie has two parts: Part one is basic training, and part two is war. Although, set in during the Vietnam Era, this movie is not about the Vietnam War. It is about the dehumanizing effect of institutionalized brutality. The instrument through which the brutality is inflicted is Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, played by R. Lee Ermey who delivers one of the great performances in cinema history. Sgt. Hartman is the epitome of the sadistic authority figure who represents a culture that repudiates principles of consensus and democracy in favor of instilling the urge to kill on command through the use of terror. In Sgt. Hartman's universe, the purpose of the military is not only to produce killers, but to produce killers who want to kill. The results are poor. Instead of producing well motivated soldiers who can operate effectively as a unit, Hartman's brutal methods produces grotesque caricatures of soldiers who lack any real motivation or purpose to do anything accept act out. That is, instead of being motivated, they are demoralized. Indeed, Hartman himself is killed by one of his own recruits. Ironically, he becomes a victim of his own brutality. There is a general understanding that the Vietnam War was bad for the United States and had a hugely corrupting influence on the military and more broadly on American society in general. This movie further reinforces this understanding. Sergeant Hartman is a truly bizarre character. He is a caricature of a soldier, yet he must be taken seriously. His destructiveness cannot be ignored. He is an agent of destruction. His anger is real. He is the voice of the angry American."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","15 March 2011"," ""Kubrick is Genius"",.. ""War is Nihilism"" .., ""Second Segment is Useless"" ...
","Whoever talked about dehumanization missed the point, it's about desensitization. It's about producing killing machines whose soul is only dedicated to the Marine Corps. It's a brotherhood, a sort of community that transforms you into an animal with the most implacable killing instinct. It makes it clear; you're here to kill, because if you don't, or if you hesitate, then the enemy will exploit this weakness to kill you first. It's a matter of one second but this is the primal basis or survival. The title sums it up : it's all about killing.<br/><br/>**************************FULL METAL JACKET Segment 1**************************<br/><br/>The first part is how to make a killer out of a young man, a boy, an ordinary schmuck not less idealistic and enthusiastic to go defend his country than the next neighbor. How? The answer is incarnated by one man, one attitude, one power. Sergeant Gunnery Hartman. <br/><br/>Hartman incarnates the progressive loss of innocence, of human compassion, of every thing centuries of humanism did fight for. No room for tolerance, for heart, not even for patriotism, the point is to become a man capable of not only killing but not dying. I said no patriotism but that's because the security of a whole nation must rely on men so dedicated that they'd kill anyone who's suspected to be a potential threat for the country. A powerful country needs this spirit, and even patriotism might corrupt this ruthlessness because it's made of idealism, and that's intolerable. In other words, better to be a Lee Harvey Oswald than a John F. Kennedy. <br/><br/>And one soldier will become a Lee Harvey Oswald. Gomer Pyle. A heavy man whose first reaction he inspires us, is how the hell did he make it to the Recruit Camp. He's fat, clumsy, and incapable of any physical effort, therefore an easy target for the foul mouthed intransigent Hartman. Yes their interactions are both sad and funny, but in fact, they're funny cause we're too distant from this world to get the sad aspect, and sad because we're still too distant to get how this is so real. <br/><br/>These boys were like you and I, but by being hit, they learned how to hit. It's all a question of psychology. And it worked for Pyle, it took Hartman's humiliating words, some soap and blankets, until he became as competent as Oswald and as ""idealistic"" as him. Nothing else mattered except killing. War is the negation of anything that is not War.<br/><br/>**************************END OF SEGMENT 1**************************<br/><br/>When Pyle kills Hartman, it's the training's success. Pyle had a killing instinct but he reached his breaking point too fast. He was already in a world of you-know-what. It was like the war had already started for him, his war was Hartman Â… Pyle was already illustrating the alienating impact of the war. He named his gun with a girl's name but talked to Charlene in a sensual way, because she was his deliverance. Hartman was his war. God it's like the movie didn't even need to go further to illustrate the whole nihilistic epitome. Just look at Pyle's eyes before he shoots on Hartman and you'll know what's being in a world of you-know-what means, you see in his eyes, there is simply no feeling, no future, nothing ... <br/><br/>**************************FULL METAL JACKET Segment 2**************************<br/><br/>I'm perplexed. This part didn't show me anything I didn't know before. After watching ""Platoon"", ""Apocalypse Now"" and even ""Born on the Fourth of July"", I wonder which newness this part brings. What's her contribution apart from two or maybe three classic scenes: the one with the hooker, with Animal Mother, and with the sniper. It's good, but not Kubrick good. <br/><br/>It's like the quality dropped as soon as the most pivotal characters disappeared as if their whole antagonism were sufficient illustrations of the hellish and nihilistic states of mind war puts you in. I'm frustrated because I wanted to review the second part with the same enthusiastic approach than the first one, I really wanted and I could do it, I could over-analyze the thrilling aspect of the sniper part. The apparent dullness of those who encountered death so many times the sight of dead corpses only inspire one comment : ""Better you than me"" <br/><br/>I wish I could, but I would feel like losing my time, and like Kubrick lost his, he felt obliged to make a war movie. Without the war, it could have been a risky but genius choice, with the war segment, it's just, well, a war film. Kubrick is too important to be associated with this second segment.<br/><br/>**************************END OF SEGMENT 2**************************<br/><br/>I guess I share the same feeling than the Marines when they discovered that this sneaky dangerous sniper who wasted three of their friends was just a frail little girl. I had the same feeling ... that could have been worse if it wasn't for the great ending song scene, nothing can describe the effect of the Rolling Stones' ""Paint it Black"" . A pity it doesn't match the overall quality of the first half of the film.<br/><br/>**************************FULL METAL JACKET**************************<br/><br/>Not full appreciation. But to the credit of Kubrick, the first part is one of the most gripping examination of the desensitizing effect of War. And the irreversible damage it exercises on a fragile mind. A genius part, brilliantly written and supported by outstanding performances by D'Onofrio and R. Lee Ermey. <br/><br/>I think Kubrick's nihilistic approach to the war didn't need the second segment. And if this movie needed war, well, it could have been handled better for two reasons: to match all the great war films made before. First point. And second point. We're still talking of a Master named Stanley Kubrick."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","1","18 October 2010"," In ""Full Metal Jacket,"" Stanley Kubrick throws terror upon us with a shovel
","In terms of an ostensible plot outline, ""Full Metal Jacket"" appears to be much like any other period piece set in any war. As a matter of fact, the way that director Stanley Kubrick has constructed his story, it almost seems familiar and routine. It starts us with a collection of mug shots as new Marine recruits are shaved and prepared for basic training, takes us through their grueling preparations for war, and leads us into one of the most harrowing denouements of all time, in which many of those faces we saw at the beginning can no longer be found. But it is not the originality of this story that makes ""Full Metal Jacket"" so great (because it is not original in its plot), it is the sheer harrowing and gut-wrenching plethora of style and nihilism that Kubrick instills into its content.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning, Kubrick alerts us that we are not in for a pleasant experience. Even though he creates images that rival the majesty of his 1968 masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" this movie does not leave you wrapped in spectacle, but in sheer horror. Watching our cast having their heads shaved with mask-like expressions devoid of happiness hints to us that it'll get worse for them. And it does. The basic training scenes, which consume half the picture with R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio dominating every frame, are grueling and heart-pounding as we watch these young and naive men be transformed into cold-blooded, deranged killers, some of whom are struggling to maintain their humanity, and others who will lose it entirely.<br/><br/>For the back half of the movie, Kubrick almost seems to give us relief at first, by avoiding combat. Then he not only gives us it, but throws it upon us with one of the most shocking third-acts in cinema history. The climax becomes a mixture of three different war movie traditions. Number one, the gungho joy of killing best personified in black-and-white war serials. Number two, the fear of being killed in combat. And three, the traumatizing aftereffects of experiencing the first two. Anybody who does not find the ending of ""Full Metal Jacket"" haunting should sit down and think about their own morality. Kubrick has haunted us before with the terrors of HAL 9000 in ""2001"" and the Singin' in the Rain sequences in ""A Clockwork Orange."" Here, he piles terror on us with shovels.<br/><br/>The movie is crammed with fantastic performances. R. Lee Ermey, once a Marine himself and in fact initially hired only as a consultant, is hands-down visceral and brilliant as the drill sergeant determined to turn his recruits into mechanical killers like their own rifles. Matthew Modine is commendably convincing as the baby-faced Marine who would rather write about Vietnam than experience it. The other two most notable performances are by Adam Baldwin and Vincent D'Onofrio, who are first-class examples of what war and combat do to people.<br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" is just as great as any film made about any other war. In the category of the Vietnam War genre, it ranks up with ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" and is probably the second-best of the four. Kubrick may have been telling an ostensibly familiar story, but the way he constructs it and manipulates our responses makes it idiosyncratic and towering above its familiars. It is one of the two best films he ever directed."
"B-Seide24","10","1","1","11 May 2010"," Stanley Kubrick is Pure Genius
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Stanley Kubrick did an amazing job of creating an aggressive beginning to the movie. The constant abuse of Gomer Pyle by Sergeant Hartman felt real and the versimilitude in the movie was frightening. The film also carried some of the greatest scenes in history. The scene between Pyle and Joker which awoke Sgt. Hartman was intense,raw and the words ""Full metal jacket"" will forever ring in the back of my mind. It also opened the eyes to the world of what an abusive drill instructor could do and what it could lead you to do.The other scene that was horrifying and the realism of the hazing of Pyle was as if you were there witnessing as a bystander. Kubrick did a terrific job of filming that scene and showing you the angst of Joker as he reluctantly gets in on the action. I feel like Stanley Kubrick attempted and completed in showing you what the Vietnam war could do to a average normal person and the aftermath of what a war like that could do."
"williamreinsch","10","1","1","16 April 2010"," Masterpiece!
","Now this film starts off slow and gradually makes you feel more and more for pvt Pyle as you see him getting pushed and pushed even further into insanity. Finally after the build up comes in my opinion THE GREATEST SCENE IN MOVIE HISTORY! Just in case there is someone who ain't taking notice of the spoiler I wont say what happens, I will say however that this scene left me scarred, speechless, upset and sick.<br/><br/>Moving on, the rest of the film was a lot more action packed than the slow beginning (taking out the pvt Pyle scene) and I found a lot more comedy involved. Probably the only truly sad scene onward from the pvt Pyle scene was with the Vietnamese sniper lying on the floor telling the soldiers to shoot her. This scene gave me the same feelings from the pvt Pyle scene but only to a much smaller degree.<br/><br/>The movie abruptly ends with pvt joker saying ""I am so happy that I am alive, in one piece and short. I'm in a world of sh**... yes. But I am alive. And I am not afraid."" This speech is telling you how terrible Vietnam and war as a whole is and shows you the comparison between pvt joker and pvt Pyle with the fact that pvt Pyle was afraid and in the sh** were as pvt joker was not afraid but also in the sh**, thats why one died and one survived possibly because pvt Pyle was the most brainwashed and mentally abused of the two.<br/><br/>In conclusion this film was a lot better than expected and for me was the most darkest and terrifying film of all time all because of one scene."

I saw this with my grandfather in the theater in 1987 (I was 15 and probably shouldn't have been allowed to see it). Even at that age, its clear depictions of the horrors of war and what it does to the main character and the rest involved in the story were powerful and sobering.<br/><br/>BTW: For those who like this film, read The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien (1990)"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","7","1","1","7 September 2009"," Thought Provoking
","Kubrick's Vietnam War film is a study of the human condition, specifically the soldier's human condition, during basic training and war time. There is not much commentary on the justification of the Vietnam War, only an examination of what war does to the mind. There is a scene where an officer asks Private Joker why he wrote ""Born to Kill"" on his helmet if he wears a peace sign on his shirt. Joker replies ""I don't know. It has something to do with the duality of man,"" or something to that effect. The whole movie is about the duality of man; everybody wants there to be peace, but when an authority figure tells us to kill, it becomes natural. For this, Full Metal Jacket is a thought provoking experience.<br/><br/>The first forty minutes of Full Metal Jacket follows a group of Marine trainees on Paris Island who want to serve in Vietnam. We meet our main character, Private Joker, but the first act is dominated by two performers, R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and Private Leonard Lawrence, nicknamed ""Gomer Pyle,"" played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Hartman is the toughest Drill Instructor imaginable; he is on his soldier's butts about something all the time. Pyle, however, is a natural screw-up, it is hard to imagine how he even made it to Paris Island, and Hartman is always the harshest with him, because he has been trained to believe that the louder you bark at a soldier the sooner they will shape up. Instead, it has the opposite effect on Pyle; he becomes mentally disturbed during his training, probably because he was never mentally fit to be a soldier in the first place. This segment typically receives the most praise; it is certainly easier to enjoy, because it progresses toward a natural conclusion, graduation day. Ermey also gives the best performance in the film, mainly because it was not a performance, as Ermey was a real Gunnery Sergeant. Almost all of his lines were ad-libbed. Sgt. Hartman is one of the most memorable characters in all of Kubrick's films.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie does not really flow toward a natural ending; it just follows Private Joker on his daily exploits in Vietnam, and ends rather abruptly, making it harder to enjoy. The film's themes are exemplified in every scene, however. As a journalist, Private Joker has not been disturbed by actual combat, but he meets many others who have, particularly a soldier named Animal Mother. He cannot understand how soldiers can kill with such ease, but but he comes to understand in the final combat experience of the movie.<br/><br/>Like all Kubrick movies, there is some good camera work here. I swear when people got shot in this movie I thought I had been shot too, especially during the sniper sequence. The only problem I have with FMJ, besides the disjointed quality of the second half, is that it never really feels like you are in Vietnam. The movie was filmed in England, and even though the sets were great, they still feel like sets. For these reasons, FMJ is the weakest of Kubrick's war movies (excluding Spartacus). It is still an intellectually stimulating experience that should not be missed if you like war films."

","This is not an epic movie. There are no heroes, no legendary feats in this movie, it's no band of brothers, it's a Kubrick film. And it's a fantastic one. Kubrick never did in complex scenarios, the plot in this movie, is simple, a group young Americans being trained to join the marines forms the first part, which to me is the main one. You can see Kubrick's work at its best in that first part. Seargeant Instructor Hartman, what a character! He is in your face from the first minute of the film, and those scenes at the camp were wonderfully shot. Close ups to bank on actors' performances and add intensity to the scenes, and intense they were. The humiliating and degrading treatment imposed by the Sergeant Instructor to the whole group, especially to Pvt Pyle, is frightening. The star performer in that first part to me has got to be Pvt Pyle. The scenes are shot in a succession of defining events, so that your eyes are scotched to the screen.<br/><br/>The second part takes place in Vietnam, a Vietnam ravaged by war. Now I have to admit here that there have been better war movies shot in the heat of battle if you are looking for spectacular, rapid, grandiose fighting. Apocalypse Now would be a superb example. But here Kubrick, offers a more intimate view of fighting and always keeps it simple but pleasing on the eye. Many will say that the first part is of higher quality than the second, it could be true. But I think that the second part had to be shot in this way, nothing too over the top, a plot so simple and intense, so that it is difficult to forget. Do you remember most of the scenes in saving private ryan? No matter how much you prepare for war, how well trained you are, you can never be ready for the real thing. At the camp, the guys were subjected to the worst kind of treatment and yet in Vietnam, the war is a different proposition. Each war is different, the Vietnam war was not the same as the second world war when you knew what you were fighting for. It is certainly different to what is going on right now. But the films treating the subject of Vietnam war will be rarer and rarer, Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket are the best three films on Vietnam war. Therefore, Kubrick's work here should be a collector's item even if as an adrenaline junky, you could see better war films."

","The most 're-watchable' movie that Kubrick ever made. It was also the least Kubrick-y movie that he made, in other words it does not have the signature color scenes, strange lighting, ultra odd characters or strange story twists.<br/><br/>This movie made the career of Ron Ermey, he has so many on liner insults in this movie that you could fill a book with them. He fit the part so perfectly because he spent over 10 years in the Marine Corps. In fact this movie has been so watched that a true fan can mouth along with most of the insults. Ermey's part in this movie has made him immortal, he will be forever linked to this movie.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was also excellent, this movie showed the rise of excellent actors such as Matthew Modine and especially Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio's part as Private Pyle should have won an Oscar, he nailed the part as a mentally challenged cadet that twisted to the dark side.<br/><br/>This movie got snubbed at the Oscars, one factor could be that it was so dark and negative that many people were put off. Another thing was that 78 was the same year that The last emperor and Fatal attraction came out.<br/><br/>The only reason this movie is not a perfect 10 is because of the non-climactic ending. I love Kubrick films but his endings have never been memorable, his films always peak at about 20min before the end of the film.<br/><br/>My favorite line is ""I do not discriminate...to me you are all equally worthless"""
"thetruecell","10","1","1","21 September 2006"," War is Hell
","It is rare that a film has nothing good to say about war. Though there have been an increasing number of films in recent years that work to show the true savagery of battle, there is always a touch of honor and nobility presented as well. In fact, in many films the overall presentation is that while war may be brutal, it is from that very brutality that true heroes are born. Indeed, these portraits of war show that fact as almost a given.<br/><br/>But this film, like Apocalypse Now, shows that sometimes there is no honor to be found in war, and that horror and inhumanity can often be the only true things to be found in battle. From the sadistic boot camp of R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman to the widespread death and destruction of the Tet offensive, Full Metal Jacket shows us that sometimes when we place ordinary men into combat situations, we do not get heroes but rather killers and sociopaths.<br/><br/>Kubrick is often known for giving us thought provoking films, but this title may be considered Kubrick at his best. Observing it all alongside Matthew Modine's pragmatic Pvt. Joker, we are encouraged to ask ourselves: what honor, what nobility are we supposed to find here? For many viewers, the answer will be none. This is a film both horrible and powerful, and should be viewed by all. Especially those of us who view conflict as the best means of resolving crisis. It may cause you to rethink that position. I know it did so for me."
"jldmp1","9","1","1","4 August 2006"," The Lethal Camera
","Even if this had no opening credits, this would be immediately recognizable as Kubrick's work. <br/><br/>All of his essential war film components are here, as self reference: the camera movement of ""Paths of Glory"", the 'fighting a square' and running the gauntlet from ""Barry Lyndon"". There is 'Rafterman' as the photographer (the camera operator) and 'Joker' as the writer. Modine is given the task of writing the story within the story as the character, and outside the story, narrating with retroactive knowledge.<br/><br/>We love the beginning third for the spot-on performances of Ermey and D'Onofrio. But as with all of Kubrick's work, the plot and dialogue are really just secondary concerns. What makes this grip, unlike the works of many lesser filmmakers, is the supremacy of the camera. On the Island, the camera is on a dolly...disciplined, humiliated. In country, it is held-held, it marches, charges, crouches and hides. We get a lesson from the master in how to build story inertia through visual narrative inertia.<br/><br/>And in the finale, the most striking feature here, the idea of the camera as rifle/rifle as camera duality. The camera literally becomes the sniper's weapon. And who ultimately puts a metaphorical end to the deadly vision? The photographer...then the writer dispatches it and the story with a prayer. Heavy duty stuff."

It is war, duh! Also having draftees in a war situation vs. troops who volunteer for such an assignment really shows.

","No doubt Stanley Kubrick is one of the best directors cinema has ever known. In his life, he made things like ""Spartacus"", an excellent gladiator, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a wonderful sci-fi film, ""Lolita"", a sexy and hot romance, ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"", an ironical masterpiece, ""A Clockwork Orange"", a portrait of a possible future and this ""Full Metal Jacket"", considered by many the best war movie ever made.<br/><br/>The film seems to be two different movies put into one. The first part shows the privates training in an island in the USA. Commanded by a brave, and sometimes cruel, man, the soldiers are often called ""maggots"" and they have to face really hard exercises. Some of them, like private Pyle, suffer from the pains and difficulties of their duties.<br/><br/>The second part is the war itself in Vietnam. Through the eyes of Private Joker (Matthew Modine), who writes to the press about the situation in the battlefield, we see the war from a very true point of view. We feel like we are there in the platoon and sometimes and have the feeling we are soldiers ourselves.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","This movie is one of my favorites. I have never read the book, have never been to Vietnam, so I'm just gonna give you a review as I see it. The first half of the movie is so powerful, so well acted by Lee Ermey, that the entire second half of the movie pales in comparison. Ermey really pulls off the drill Sargent role, having been a former drill instructor in real life. Vincent D'Onofrio does an amazing job at being Gomer Pyle. These two actors put in such great performances that they easily outshine the rest of the entire cast, and steal the show. Therefore, after Gomer Pyle puts a bullet in the drill instructor and then his own head, the movie sort of goes downhill. Once in Vietnam, the movie goes somewhat dull. There are still a ton of great scenes, with a ton of great lines, and some quality acting, but it lacks the energy and the intensity that the first half has. Nonetheless, I would still highly recommend it. 10/10!"

","This is such an uncomfortable movie to watch. I understand what the Marines do. There is one lead fighting machine and they are it. I like to think that what is done is a lot more humane. I believe that one can be toughened without being dehumanized. The character of Pyle is singled out. It seems that if one wanted to terrorize a group of recruits, you don't just focus on the one weak link. This guy should have been shipped out. He was never going to make it. Some guys achieve strength through suffering. He continued to submit to the horrors of boot camp despite the over the top attacks on him. If I wanted to show a definition of sadism, I would use this movie. Now, I agree with a previous writer that in wartime, the carelessness of one man could cost the lives of others, and the sergeant was making a point. But was Pyle becoming a better soldier? Did he ever becomes a better soldier, or was his spirit broken almost from the beginning? There has to be something to be said for the endurance of this man and how long he lasts, even if he fails. The ending did not surprise me. I anticipated it."

","Full Metal Jacket (1987) <br/><br/>Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, R. Lee Ermey, Arliss Howard, Adam Baldwin, Dorian Harewood.<br/><br/>There is one scene in 'Full Metal Jacket' that I want to talk about first. It is the scene near the very beginning with Leonard Lawrence and Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. Lawrence thinks that Hartman is very funny, but as the film goes on, he starts to hate him more and more.<br/><br/>'Full Metal Jacket' is really a different type of war film. It doesn't deal with war battles between Vietnam and America, but battles against ourselves. I don't mean like gun battles, I mean the way that we might feel when we see this film, we realize that we basically fought each other.<br/><br/>Soldiers are trained by a mean drill instructor to begin killers, then you actually witness them doing it. The film is divided into two halves. The first half revolves mostly around Pvt. Joker, Pvt. Lawrence (Gomer Pyle), and Drill Instructor Hartman. The soldiers go through training at a South Carolina Marine Corps camp. Joker is the second leader in the group, and Pyle is ranked lower in the platoon because Hartman dislikes him and believes that he cannot do anything. Pyle doesn't have any friends on the squad and only is good at one thing, combat training.<br/><br/>The second half is set in Vietnam. It revolves around Joker, Animal Mother, Eightball, and Cowboy, one of Joker's old buddies from training. They go off to fight as gunmen in the war, but also must save their fellow soldiers. Joker believes that war is a living hell, but at the same time, he believes that after fighting there will soon be peace.<br/><br/>'Full Metal Jacket' probably isn't the best war film ever made, but it is a great film. It has a good story, another brilliant direction by Stanley Kubrick, and interesting characters. The acting in the movie is just almost perfect. Lee Ermey gives his best and very memorable performance as Sgt. Hartman, mostly because he was a drill instructor in real life. Modine and D'Onofrio were also very good. Dorian Harewood and Adam Baldwin deliver clever lines, and are interesting characters. There are much humor in the film, and it actually is funny. Some of Ermey's line are very clever. It's interesting how he they thought up all of his lines.<br/><br/>At times, the film doesn't really fit together. It shows some unrelated material to the story. It loses its pace near the beginning of the second half, but recovers a little later in the movie. Joker's (Modine) narration throughout the movie goes no where. It's horribly told. I'm not saying that Modine was a bad actor, because he wasn't, but the narration sounds like he read it off of flashcards. The first scene that I mentioned really made feel bad for Pvt. Pyle, and it got worse later in the film. Pyle seems like he is Hartman's main victim, mostly because he seems worthless.<br/><br/>'Full Metal Jacket' is a really good movie and almost a classic. I don't know how it could have been better, but it is fine the way it is. It is one of the best from Kubrick, and is underrated by some people, but is loved by others. Overall the first half is one of the most effective pieces of film I've ever seen, whereas the second is more or less just good. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
"Captain_Couth","10","1","1","30 July 2005"," The World of Stanley Kubrick; Full Metal Jacket.
","Full Metal Jacket (1987) was Stanley Kubrick's entry into the Vietnam War movie sweepstakes that occurred during the eighties. But to be fair to Stanley Kubrick he planned out this film many moons before the others. But due to his infamous lengthy pre-production schedules, this one took forever to be released. The entire film was shot in England (his new home)and all the sets were built from scratch. Because of the subject matter, he received no military assistance from Uncle Sam. The movie was based upon the shocking novel The Short-timers (a brilliant read I might add that was even more darker and brutal than Full Metal Jacket).<br/><br/>The movie was filmed in two parts. The first half takes place in basic training. We follow the lives of a bunch of new marine recruits that are broken down and dehumanized into soldiers. Doctors and Sergents weed out the people who'll either snap or breaks down (those that can't cut the mustard). Part two deals with a soldier's life during the Tet Offensive and the Battle for Hue City. <br/><br/>Take a look folks because this will probably the last time you'll see a movie about war (made in the U.S.A. and backed by a major film company) to show war as gritty, nasty and vile. With all of the Patriotism/Nationalism going on today, the lines of free speech and censorship are ever so blurred. Stanley Kubrick pulled another one out of his hat by making an anti-war film that shows the brutality of not only warfare but the dehumanization process that recruits go through. Kubrick's gritty film style and hand held camera work was basically copied and stolen by many film makers today (i.e. Steven Spielberg). It's gotten to the point were you can't even enjoy war films anymore because they're all the same (direction, filming and editing wise).<br/><br/>Kudos to Kubrick for taking a chance and making such a non-commercial film. Too bad his cinematic input wasn't more prolific.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","The first ten minutes of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a disturbing, yet hilariously funny scene where a DI meets his new recruits.  Everything that comes out of his mouth in this scene is quoteable, classic obscenity.  What is truly haunting about this, however, is the transformation of the men in the marine corps.  Any other film would have followed the ""end of innocence"" cliche, but Kubrick makes sure that the audience knows there was little innocence to begin with in a confused, immoral war like Vietnam.  These boys are transformed into stone cold killers.  Robots, working for a cause they didn't care about.  In fact, one scene shows the DI instructing them to become as good as marksmen as Oswald!  Many of the men encountered in this film want nothing more than to kill as many Vietnameise as possible, horrifyingly enough, even if it means women and children.<br/><br/>     There is an unforgettable closing shot where all of the soldiers march on after a gruesome battle proudly chanting the Mickey Mouse theme.  In this harrowing, Kubrick-trademark close, Mickey Mouse becomes a metaphor for this sole attitude of Vietnam.  The great wars were over and these all-American boys had no intention of making any peace.<br/><br/>     Matthew Modine plays the lead, Private Joker.  He is brilliant as the faceless everyman of the Marine Corps.  Private Joker is to the brutality of vietnam just as Alex Delarge is to a society infatuated with sex in violence.  His helmet reads ""Born to Kill"", yet he wears a peace symbol to display the ""duality of man"".  He is very symbolic of how lost everything seemed to get.  We follow him through the three sections of the film, all conveying the horrors of 'nam.  The first act is boot camp in an opening that is ultimately unforgettable.  Here it is more than clear that there was a reduction in the vulnerable young men entering the corps.  Private Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Nofrio)is a fat, very dumb recruit whose screw-ups make him victim to the DI and his fellow soldiers.  The second fearlessly, unflinchingly shows the dehumanization of the Vietnamese people. Private Joker becomes a combat journalist, feeding his fellow soldiers lies so they keep their heads in the game.  He is assigned to a platoon where he faces action, which leads into the third act...the reality of combat.<br/><br/>     Stanely Kubrick made one of the best way films of all time.  His capability to tackle controversial issues made him perfect for a  Vietnam story.  This is not a film defending the war, it is a film exposing a reality that was lost like the whole purpose of the war was."

This gritty, uncompromising drama shocked many for its brutality, most notably Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as an ""oat-fed innocent"" private slowly transformed to a psychotic sniper with a death wish. R. Lee Ermey's unrelenting drill instructor is flawless and chillingly real, Modine is great as the cynical Joker, as is Adam Baldwin's portrayal of ""Animal Mother.""

""Full Metal Jacket"" is definitely the defining war movie because of what it does not attempt to be...cliched heroics and glory speeches (like other war epics ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""The Green Beret"").

"9khjxz","10","1","1","14 November 2002"," How the bell sounds
","If this movie was about war, it might be seen as mediocre. That's perhaps why there are so many people deceived with the development of the story.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is about the way the human soul reacts to warfare; The way we prepare men for it, the way we look at it, not only the way we suffer it but also the way we 'see' it. The films character 'Joker' is like the playing card with the same name: It changes 'ad hoc'. More than the anti-war person that he happens to be, 'Joker' is the distant observer of a phenomenon he doesn't regard as his own but one that he is progressively part of. This dynamic process, from the absent recruit to the compassionate executer of a girl warrior happens through the eyes of a camera, the scenario being the very 'ink' that paints blood black. That may be the main reason for the sequence of the second part of the film. Kubrik spares the spectator to an excessive exposure to the 'horrors' of war concentrating, rather, on the relationship of a conscious human, 'Joker', with the 'facts of war' as he becomes progressively familiar with them (that's why Joker is a journalist, not a nurse). Far from an unrealistic and static picture of war, the second part of the film is relatively stripped of action of men suffering war in order to expose war as an external phenomenon, through Joker's pictures. That's how Joker sees it in the begining of the second part. We have here a picture not of war itself, but the 'ways in war' of the type of warrior that went through the first part of the film and, eventually, survived and the critical observation made by Joker of their deeds. Note that if 'Joker' was pro-war character the film could be quite the same except for the feeling expressed by Joker himself regarding the killing of the Vietcong girl. Full Metal Jacket starts with a critical analysis of the distortion of human values by army training or, as one might see it, 'restraining' of the human being and ends with a reflection on the necessity and the inevitability of that distortion through the rendition of Joker's character.<br/><br/>The here is not 'Form whom the bell tolls', not even a remark (amongst many) that it does. Full Metal Jacket, a type of ammunition itself, is a look into the sound of the bell.<br/><br/>All in all, a masterpiece."

","This film is primarily about the dual nature of man: the primal instinct to be destructive and nihilistic versus the social instinct to desire peace. The destructive and creative forces of man pitted against each other is a theme common to many of Kubrick's films particularly ""A Clockwork Orange"". I rank this film above the grossly overrated ""Platoon"" simply because Kubrick says more about war than the trite cliche of 'war is hell'. Many people criticized Kubrick for opting to shoot the film on a sound stage in England. This issue is irrelevant to the message and content of the film. Kubrick dodged the typical depictions of the Vietnam war such as the drug use and the jungle warfare. Kubrick chose to focus on the city patrols. Matthew Modine is brilliant as the confused hero certainly more interesting and convincing than CHARLIE SHEEN in ""Platoon"". Most notable is the brilliant use of music in the film as well as the stellar camera work typical to all Kubrick epics. Lee Ermey is amazingly realistic  as the hard drill sergeant. See this Vietnam film and this one only. Unless of course you want to rent ""Platoon"" and ""The Green Berets"" and cry your eyes out with laughter."

The class of marines succeed in graduating, but Pyle does not. He goes crazy after the harsh treatment meant to harden him to become a killer and commits suicide. So this story gets to the point that preparing for war is inhumane and not worth wasting our youth.<br/><br/>The second story is about the marines fighting to win the war in Vietnam. This is told with two plots: that of winning the war and the second of the declining morality of the marines. The war is not won, it ends ambiguously as the marines win a small insignificant battle and return to camp while the morality of the marines shows a constant decline and ends with our hero committing murder.<br/><br/>The movie is a great testament to the anti-war movement and a visual essay on the meaninglessness of war. But it is not a very engaging story. The first half of the movie makes a tight dramatic point that training marines to be killer has some inhumane consequences and proves it with Pyle's suicide. But the second half doesn't have an overall story arc to hang its hat on. The status of the main external plot of winning the war is left ambiguous. So the moral decline of our hero who has to commit murder at the end doesn't create as much meaning since the murder doesn't get us any further in winning the war.<br/><br/>One can argue that that's the point of the movie, is that these atrocities are senseless and meaningless. And that is true. But in terms of a dramatic story, the meaning of the action is lost because the filmmakers abhorred making winning the war into any resemblance of a real plot.<br/><br/>In the first half of the movie, Pyle's suicide is juxtaposed with the success of class of marines all graduating. Thus it makes the point that his suicide is not worth it for us to successfully train marines. But in the second half of the movie, Joker commits murder but this action is not juxtaposed with progression of any other plot. So the action loses the chance to create meaning through a consequence for his actions. It feels like the movie was cut off without any real resolution, like another 15 minutes were missing.<br/><br/>My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca"
"st-shot","5","6","15","4 June 2007"," Kubrick out of Ammo with Full Metal Jacket
","By the time Stanley Kubrick made Full Metal Jacket it was evident the once enormously talented director had lost a step or two. Barry Lyndon was a beautiful bore to endure and his adaption of Stephen King's The Shining was drained of terror. Full Metal continued the slide but did not end it. The worst was yet to come with Eyes Wide Shut. <br/><br/>Jacket is Kubrick's late entry to a long line of Viet Nam films that followed the unpopular war. The first half takes place on Paris Island where Marine recruits are put through basic training. It is a brutal and suspenseful first half made all the more powerful by Lee Ermey's intense DI. Once overseas the film founders badly. Kubrick keeps his camera moving with elaborate pans and tracking shots but his actors become lifeless caricatures and psychos, a rich pastiche of ugly Americans and moronic commanders. In Strangelove there was a dark comic touch that made it work. Here it only shows an out of touch artist trying to be relevant and hip with a paler Apocalypse Now take that was done (and done a lot better) eight years earlier. <br/><br/>The last half hour really exacerbates matters with a scene that concerns routing a sniper. To maintain suspense this long is impossible in such a situation and it is proved here. There is also a contrived denouement to the whole scene that rings hollow. <br/><br/>Put another director's moniker on it and the crit's would give it passable grades as an anti-war film with a touch too much self indulgence and sluggish editing. But since it's Stanley's watch what you say. Well since it is Stanley's I give Metal a five instead of a six since the great cutting edge director of classic original film work as Dr.Strangelove, 2001, A Space Odyssey and Clockwork Orange followed this time instead of taking the lead as he has done in the past. In this case with a less than impressive effort that borrows heavily from some of his past works."

","Throughout cinematic history there have been films that have become classics, some have deserved it and others are wildly over-hyped. Sadly this movie is one such example of the latter. Truthfully they could've made the whole movie about the boot camp scenes as they're the only good parts of it. The boot camp shows how gruelling the training was, giving the impression it was worse than the actual war itself with a truly memorable appearance from R. Lee Ermey who you have to give praise to for improvising a lot if not all of his dialogue drawing from his experience as a real life drill sergeant around the time of the Vietnam War you do find yourself feeling sorry for Private Pyle who is the unfortunate SOB on the receiving end of Ermey's insults. However everything kind of goes downhill after Ermey's murder and Pyle's suicide in the bathroom halfway through. There is no excitement in the combat and nothing memorable in them whatsoever which is a shame. The movie could've been better either doing more for the combat scenes or been set entirely in the boot camp, ending just as they're being shipped off to Vietnam but alas it falls into that category of mine where a movie is so over-hyped that it just collapses upon watching."

","This is a good action movie, as a former Marine I've watched it a couple of times. Lee Emery the SDI, had the filthiest, gutter, sewer pipe mouth I'd ever heard. I went through Marine Corps boot camp, 1959, Plt. 344, All Colorado platoon. I, and it's been a few years ago, do not ever recall any of our DI's using the F word. They did use a few ""cuss words"" but not just filth for the sake of filth. The routine regarding, ""this is my rifle, this is my gun, etc."" We did have that, our DI's were way to disciplined and respectful to have us running around in our Quonset Hut holding our privates in one hand. Some may remember 3rdBn. at San Diego, were berthed in quonset huts just across from the confidence course, 1st and 2nd in hotels next to the grinder. There has always been a bit of a ""tiff"" among the Hollywood Marines and those at PI. The only difference I seen or found out later when I went to Camp Lejeune after boot camp, was the humidity and swamps in that part of the country. Being a native of Colorado, I'd never experience such high humidity, and it takes some getting used to. A DI's a DI, East or West coast."

","This movie will always be remembered on the internet and comedies as ""the show that had that guy that swore a whole lot"". And this disappoints me very much. Although everyone who has ever seen the movie knows that it is a classic film that will never be doubled in any way possible, there are still many people who just know it as the film with many words you shouldn't say in front of your mom. Although this is disappointing, it is necessary to the movies success to have so much vulgarity in it, because without it... how would it be a Vietnam movie? This is undoubtedly the 2nd best Vietnam movie ever made, and I know how that sounds. But when you are second to ""Platoon"", then it isn't all that bad. After watching this movie, you will be in awe. Why? Simply because it has such lasting power that it will always be in your mind when you think about war.<br/><br/>The movie looks at the war through the soldier's eyes. From boot camp to the front lines. The movie will show you emotion, integrity, bravery, heart, but most of all, a look at war that people have yet to see. Where small girls fight for their country just to survive, and where young men fight for reasons that they cannot even understand. This is what the movie surrounds. The conflicts of the soldiers, not the war itself. That's why this movie will always be a one of a kind classic that everyone must see."
"sj_cook","9","3","6","3 April 2000"," Kubrick pulls you in like no one else.
","'Full Metal Jacket', like most Kubrick films, is about emotions more than anything else.  The experiences of the characters are so well sculpted that you become almost another character.  Their fear, panic, anger, and sorrow are conveyed to the audience.  Kubrick manages to accomplish this through several techniques.  Often in the film, characters look directly into the camera when they speak.  They're not addressing the audience, but you get the sense that you're being addressed as one of the characters.  Secondly, Kubrick keeps his camera down to earth.  There are no sweeping panoramas of battlefields such as are found in other war pictures.  The film is shot almost entirely at eye level, down with the grunts.  This film is an emotional journey that is both painful and thought-provoking."
"thegrim9454","3","4","10","26 April 2013"," Not awful, but nowhere near deserves the credit it is given.
","I went into this movie with no expectations, I had never seen any other Kubrick films before and I never allow myself to condemn or praise a movie before I have seen the entire thing. I was disappointed. <br/><br/>Many people who just want to see a war flick will complain because of its slow points or lack of epic battles. While there could have been more action in a Vietnam war movie I wasn't complaining about the action. <br/><br/>My main issue was with the storyline, in that there wasn't one. This movie is simply a portrayal of the war crimes that took place during the Vietnam war. It is a jumbled collection of ""Shock Shots"" and Kubrick's personal beliefs about the war. I honestly believe that this film has such good reviews is due to the Kubrick bandwagon. Since watching FMJ I have seen several other Kubrick movies, (Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut included) and I honestly have no idea how Kubrick became successful. His movies have very weak story lines and average technical quality. Sorry to step on Kubrick fans' feet, but his work is nothing special."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","3","7","1 May 2008"," ""I must defeat my enemy who is trying to kill me""
","Full Metal Jacket gets a lot of negative criticism for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that people say that it doesn't do anything with the Vietnam issue that hadn't already been done before. I tend to feel like Kubrick already knew this, and that's probably why the film's plot is so thin that it's barely there at all. It is famously divided into two parts, boot camp and the famous TET Offensive of 1968. It's also true that, especially in things like the battle scenes, there is not a lot happening that is very far from what have become war film clichés, like a lot of guys hugging walls, pinned down under sniper fire. <br/><br/>But Kubrick has one of the most definable styles of any director in the history of the cinema, and in a lot of ways it's true that his style as an auteur doesn't lend itself to the war genre very well. He loves long, slow scenes, accompanied with equally slow dialogue that would sound truly bizarre in real life but makes perfect sense in a Kubrick movie. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Full Metal Jacket is a striking anti-war film, but it doesn't focus on the horrors of war, it focuses on the horrors of what people do to each other and become in order to prepare for war, about the irony of molding men into killing machines for the protection of our right to enjoy something as simple as Mickey Mouse. The movie knows that, even during times of the most intense war, the vast majority of people don't want to fight, they just want to live their lives and feed their families and watch their children grow. Kubrick gives us a tale of the cost of even just having a trained military force. <br/><br/>R. Lee Ermey obviously has the most memorable role in the movie, as the startling drill sergeant who loves nothing more than the Marine Corps except Jesus and the Virgin Mary, even though he has a vocabulary that would make a sailor blush. Much of the fun of the first half of the movie come through his dialogue, as he viciously whips his men into shape, taking special pains to try and make one particular recruit, nicknamed Private Pyle, to quit. The amount of memorable quotes from this movie has to be among the highest from any single movie ever!<br/><br/>Vincent D'Onofrio, by the way, as Private Pyle, is an absolutely astonishing performance. At the beginning of the movie, he is just like a kid misbehaving on the playground. As Sargeant Hartman screams insults and profanity into his face, he can't stop laughing, and for things like stealing and hiding jelly doughnuts he receives punishments like running behind the rest of the men with his pants around his ankles while sucking his thumb. The transition that his character goes through is the most powerful transition in the film, and drives home the film's message in no uncertain terms.<br/><br/>(spoilers) It's interesting to consider that the movie kills off it's two main characters at the mid-point, and unfortunately this is where it loses some of its audience. A Kubrick-style battle sequence is going to be unique in a way that will put some people off, because even though it's the same as so many other battle sequences in a lot of ways, it's also totally different. Kubrick doesn't zoom around the full battle, giving us moments of intense war action, but instead focuses on one small battle, involving a lot of the guys we got to know in the first half of the movie and a single sniper. Aside from allowing for some great moments of tension, it also gives a shocking example of the horrific kind of psychological war that the Vietnamese fought. <br/><br/>What I especially love about the movie is that, like so many of Kubrick's films, it can't be easily categorized. It probably raises more questions than it answers, which lends it its incredible staying power. It is tremendously entertaining, has several powerhouse performances, and shows off Kubrick's mastery of direction. It is stunningly photographed and, while the psychological impact of war may be shown a little heavy-handedly in the last act, it remains one of the best and most important war films ever made."
"dbdumonteil","5","4","11","10 December 2010"," A realist but highly overrated war movie
","There's no denying that Stanley Kubrick's films have become landmarks in the history of cinema. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) helped to make science-fiction a major cinematographic genre and ""The Shining"" (1980) is a spooky fantastic film. Needless to add that his visual virtuosity plunges the audience in a state close to hypnoses. His films are unique but not necessarily in the good sens of the term. Full Metal Jacket (1987) arrived seven years after The Shining. I read on several covers of the film: the greatest war movie ever made. It's not really appropriate to deem it this way.<br/><br/>The work is divided into two parts: the training of the Marines and men at war. Many critics were adamant that the adventures of Joker in Vietnam were the result of the catastrophic brainwashing in Parris Island. It's really hard to adopt this principle for there's virtually nothing in the second part that echoes to the first one; except maybe the compulsive character of Adam Baldwin who is turned into a real killing machine and it's blatant in the last third of the film.<br/><br/>Thus Full Metal Jacket looks like a clumsy film made of two halves that have virtually nothing in common. The first part, taking place at Parris Island is, all in all trite in the obnoxious devices commanded by Lee Ermey who nevertheless gives a genuine performance. It's the least he could do since he was a former instructor. Hartmann's humiliating methods aim at imposing discipline and hatred. But there's nothing new under the sun because many films and TV movies already showed it. And the evolution of Pyle is highly debatable. How can a dumb young man can progress in such a fast way? His suicide is at a pinch understandable.<br/><br/>As for the second part, i's hardly satisfying even if the scenery if impressive and original for it is made of ruins of a city. The filmmaker also makes us really share the fears of the bunch of soldiers trapped by an invisible snipper. But the end spoils the rest for it is pathetic and cozy. Furthermore, his symbolism remains shallow like for instance Joker who wears a badge to suggest the duality of man The only reason Full Metal Jacket distinguishes itself from other war movies is Kubrick's making that favors traveling and geometrical camera movements and shots. In spite of this, the film can't take its place alongside the greatest war movies ever made unlike ""2001: a Space Odyssey"" with science-fiction."
"stanleyhiggins","10","2","4","23 June 2013"," The Way it Was--Mostly
","As a young man of 17, I entered Boot Camp at MCRD San Diego in July 1967. The Boot Camp segment of Full Metal Jacket is the most accurate portrayal of Marine Boot Camp ever committed to film.<br/><br/>The Boot Camp scenes are filled with dark humor, irony, and satire, but nonetheless, this is the way Boot Camp was.<br/><br/>Drill Instructors could be both brutal and comical, but God help you if you ever laughed in formation, no matter how comical a Drill Instructor might be while doing his best to correct a recruit's attitude.<br/><br/>Both Gustave Hasford, a former Marine and the author of the novel, ""The Short Timers"" from which the film was adapted, and Stanley Kubrick used some literary and cinematic license, which is to be expected, but were still true to the actual experience.<br/><br/>The accuracy was enhanced by Lee Ermey's performance as GySgt Hartman, as he was Marine Drill Instructor during his ten years in the Marine Corps.<br/><br/>Due to having been singled out for Vietnamese language training before going to Vietnam, I missed the 1968 Tet Offensive, which was depicted in the film.<br/><br/>While the film also takes some license with the Vietnam scenes and relied as heavily on stereotypes as in the Boot Camp scenes, those stereotypes like all stereotypes, being grounded in reality, illustrated war as it really is and remained true to the actual events of the 1968 Tet Offensive.<br/><br/>I arrived in Vietnam in August of 1968 and I guess a bit ironically, I was wounded during the 1969 Tet Offensive, which if you haven't heard of it, don't feel bad.<br/><br/>The Leftist media got what they wanted by depicting the 1968 Tet Offensive as a victory by the Communists, when it was actually a huge and costly failure for the Communists, and hardly mentioned the '69 offensive, which was as massive as the '68 offensive and an even more devastating defeat for the Communists.<br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" is a monumental film in the classic Kubrick style and even if Kubrick meant the film to be anti-war and anti-military, it is in truth a tribute to those who served their country during a time of war when the majority of that generation sided with the enemy, refused to serve, rioted in the streets and campuses and denigrated, disparaged, and ridiculed those who answered the call of duty."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","4","30 August 2010"," Let the Debate Begin
","Full Metal Jacket (1987) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's film follows a Marine (Matthew Modine) from his basic training with a brutal Sny. Sgt. (R. Lee Ermey) to a final showdown in Vietnam where a group of soldiers are being picked off by a sniper.<br/><br/>Kubrick's return to the cinema after a seven year break came with a film genre that has pretty much played itself out in the past eight or nine years considering we got films like THE DEER HUNTER, COMING HOME, APOCALYPSE NOW as well as PLATOON. Many critics panned the film for being too familiar while others called it a masterpiece that showed the war unlike any movie before. I've always had a love-hate relationship with FULL METAL JACKET and it's probably a film I've seen more than any other Kubrick even though I think it's one of the director's lesser films. There's no question that the first hour is a masterpiece but I've never warmed up to the second half for several reasons but as any Kubrick fan knows, the more you watch his films the more you notice different things.<br/><br/>This latest viewing of the film had me enjoying the second half of the picture a lot more than any previous time. I think one reason was that I got to see it theatrically on a very large screen and it brought out certain elements that I had never really picked up on before including the incredible cinematography. The camera-work has always been a strong point to every Kubrick film and I really loved the way that the camera pretty much just floats around during the second half picking up the action as it moves along. This really gives the viewer a first-hand look at everything that's going on and it really does put you in the middle of the action and this is especially true during the final portion where the marines are going up against a sniper.<br/><br/>I still have some problems with this sequence including the interviews that are done by the film crew. I can understand why Kubrick would include these scenes but to me they really don't add enough to warrant their inclusion in the film but who knows... Perhaps my next viewing I'll see them in a different manor.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is probably the most unoriginal as the training camp sequence has been seen in dozens of films going all the way back to the silent era yet Kubrick shows it in a way that makes it an unnerving thrill that will wreck each of your emotions. Kubrick paints some very dark humor in the film and most of it at the expense of Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), an overweight idiot who gets tortured not only by the drill Sergent but also the men in his group. I've always seen the first half of the film as a portrait of how much a man can take before finally cracking up. The picture shown here certainly needs to give credit to D'Onofrio but the main credit goes to Kubrick and that amazing vision.<br/><br/>The way the camera glides around much like it did in THE SHINING brings the same claustrophobic sense of dread and one can't help but get caught up in the story. This portion of the film has some very funny moments but it's also incredibly disturbing simply because of the abuse Pyle takes and you can't help but feel sorry for him but at the same time you too want to hate him because of how stupid he is. The scenes are quite shocking in a way because of how raw Kubrick makes them and its this rawness that really makes this stuff seem fresh even though we've seen it before. Kubrick was a master with the camera and it's just amazing to see how quickly our emotions can change as one second we'll be laughing only to have that quickly go away as something darker happens.<br/><br/>This first hour can easily be called a masterpiece because of how raw and powerful it is and in the end there's really not another basic training sequence that can compare. The second half has certainly grown on me with this latest viewing but I still think there are just a few too many flaws here for me to call the film a masterpiece or even a great movie. With that said, for countless viewings I said the same thing about THE SHINING but now that's on my list as one of the greatest movies ever made."

","Full Metal Jacket is two excellent films by the late great Stanley Kubrick for the price of one.R.Lee Ermey gives the best performance of his career as the tough as nails Gunnery Sgt.Hartman.Ermey basically plays the same character in every film,but this role is tailor made for him.The first part of Full Metal Jacket is about young men being trained to fight in Vietnam. All though the main character of the film is Matthew Modine's Private Joker the first part of the movie belongs to Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio.Kubrick excels at telling stories of good men who are pushed to the breaking point.Ermey's Hartman drives Private Leonard Lawerence(or Gomer Pyle) insane. You'd all ready have a four star movie there but the second part of the movie adds even more. Joker is now in Vietnam as a correspondent reporter.Kubrick doesn't glamorize war nor does he put it down,we see what these men think and do.We have a very impressive sequence with a sniper the troops can't find.Joker has questions himself if he made the right decision Was he really born to kill? This movie looks impressive the scenes in Vietnam look like war correspondent news footage.We get a psychological thriller and a great war movie.Kubrick has a great cast to work with and the film excels.Highly recommended"
"mrgray83","10","2","4","30 April 2005"," Stanley Kubrick takes on the Vietnam War and the duality of man.
","This film will endlessly be compared to Oliver Stone's Platton which was released the year before it. I place Full Metal Jacket above Platoon only marginally. There's something about the way Stanley Kubrick shot that makes it stand above other films based during war times. One scene that sticks out in my mind is the one where the platoon is standing around the dead bodies of two of their fallen comrades in a circle. Kubrick places the camera in the middle of them so that it shoots a low angle shot looking into their faces. He then has them to say a single farewell statement to the fallen soldiers. The beauty in this is that the statements express each soldiers personification. I'm reminded of Citizen Kane, where the entire dialog of that film reflects each person's personification. Every time a word is uttered it reflects their personality and yet the dialog is as believable as they come. What Kubrick did in the scene I just mentioned is a simplified version of that method but it works wonderfully. He proves that it it possible to develop characters with few words and with even fewer actions.<br/><br/>This film is magnificent. Is it Kubrick's best? No. Is it his most beautiful? No. 2001 will always have that spot in my heart. Is it a classic? You'd better believe it.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly recommended."

","A fascinating, compelling and at times mesmirising depiction of the grueling nature of war and training for war. The film is done in two parts: training and the real thing. The transition makes the film seem confused about its purpose at first, however by the end of the film it ties in fine. The first section of the film is a masterpiece standard portrayal of preparing the troops for war, complete with a commanding performance by R. Lee Ermey. The second chapter is still tautly done  the intensity of which can be compared to the second space segment of the director's '2001: A Space Odyssey', however it is not as brilliant. Either way, the movie is always intense and very well shot throughout. However, although being high-powered, the film's condemnation of indoctrination is not very potent. Quite good nevertheless as another entry in Kubrick's collection of films documenting dehumanisation."

","Perhaps the most ridiculous factor in war is that the people participating in the war do not understand why they are fighting. They gave up their lives and forgot their deaths. Under the admonishment of the instructor's cruelty, humanity was wiped out a little. With his equipment on his back and his gun on, all those who fled everywhere were the Communist Party, and those who did not fled in place were all trained Communists. They embarrassedly set foot on the land of Vietnam and slaughtered the local people unscrupulously, but only because it felt strange that there was no horse there. This funny battle was performed by a group of funny people like a stage play.<br/><br/>Kubrick borrowed the background of the Vietnam War and wrote this masterpiece full of satire on the war. From the initial ""Curse of Motherhood"" to the later choice of life and death, the meaning of war is the topic that the director wants to discuss repeatedly. The United States waged war in the name of liberation and freedom, but it cultivated murderous machines with unhuman training. The instructor's tragic death also marked that the United States will eventually be repulsed by it in a series of wars waged for its benefit.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most appealing part of Kubrick 's film is his wide range of themes, the peculiar expressions, the soundtrack selection, and the unexpected conclusion at the end. With the singing of Mickey Mouse, these soldiers who were confused by the war seemed to have won the victory, but when they recalled the fighting on the ruins, they would think, what are they for?

","Stanley Kubrick delivers a film that makes a huge statement about war, the dehumanization of man, the duality of man, and the descent madness. Full Metal Jacket is unlike any other war film, as it blends humour with the harsh reality of what war does to a man. It is a film of two halves, both showing the decension into madnes, how man becomes an animal, and how psychologically tortured a man is, after boot camp and actual war. Full Metal Jacket really isnt about the Vietnam war, it is about the loss of indulviduality and human quality, to fit a system, which can be applied to more than just this specific topic. Kubrick'w use of Black humour is perfect. As the drill instructor degrading of the recruits in the first half of the film, shows the glamorfication of the destruction of a man's humanity. The second act shows the duality of ""Joker"", as he represents the duality of man, by maintaing some of his indulviduality, but with killer instincts. At the end of the second act, he kills a young girl, causing him to now lose his humanity, pulling him into his molded form of programmed killer. ""Pyle""' and ""Animal Mother"", display the theme of the duality of man as well, as ""Pyle"" was coming close to becoming the ultimate marine, ""Animal Mother"", but ends up killing Sgt. Hartman, and himself. While ""Animal Mother"", was what he was on the way to becoming. A killer with sense of individuality or humanity. This film operates on many thematic levels. Also showing man becoming what it hates, and descending into its evil side. Technically, this film is great, with stellar cnematography and editing, along with the soundtrack.
The performances are great, especially the realistic portrayal from R. Lee Ermey. Full Metal Jacket also has a theme of childhood, teenage years, and cultural influence. As well the idea of connection between sexual frustration and violence. This film could be perceived as Kubrick's critique of old fashioned american ideals and culture. Essentially, the marines are brainwashed, and Hartman uses things like Religon, sex, and the marines. The use of religon to justify killing, the use of sexual insults to implement frustration, to then awake violent urges, and connect violence and sex. Like Full Metal Jacket is a masterpiece. Stanley Kubrick is genius"

","Stanley Kubrick has done a remarkable job with this film. From showing how young soldiers become maniacs and killing machines on the battle fields and horrors of the war. The film gives a clear point of view of the soldier's perspective of the war, how they feel, what they think about it, what they are doing and if they feel like they are doing the right thing. The most powerful part of the film is the training process in the beginning with R. Lee Ermey and his acting skills. Also Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio are good in that part. the filming was perfect and the camera movements were really realistic to a soldier's P.O.V. the shots of zoom out and zoom in were good and the music during the more creepy scenes really gave a perfect tone of darkness and brutality. overall I can't find a moment that I didn't like during the movie or a bad scene that made the movie less good then it is already."

","I have only find one fault in this truly brilliant War Movie (by the maestro himself) Stanley Kubrick but thankfully it does not detract form the magnificence of both the acting performances and the tightest, most thrilling Direction. On one hand the part of Private Pile does not make too much sense, as I very much doubt someone so unsuitable and out of shape would ever be selected for the most torrid and physically demanding training to become a U.S Marine. Though stating this obvious plot ploy, he's also the most important character in the film. Rather than the construction of an elite fighting force, it simultaneously concerns the ultimate, deconstruction of any type of humanity (they once had). Lee Ermey (a real life drill instructor) is a real shock to the system and the rest of the cast is certainly up to the task. Also contains some highly realistic battle action, filmed in the Docklands (East London) and with a mind jolting ending scene, that will have you riveted to your chair! Terror, disbelief and the chilling horror of 'Nam'."
"krational66","8","0","0","23 April 2020"," How are you twisted?
","""Born to kill"" or ""human nature is good"" are not all of a person's instincts. This is the contradiction of people, and also the two sides of everything in the world.
From entering the boot camp to writing the news in the post-war base area, the clown actually reflects the human nature of the environment. At the beginning of his body, he openly contradicted the drillmaster's words, and even got some recognition. When people around him couldn't teach ""fat pie"" well, he took over the task and kept the other side in good order.
But it is here that the virulence of the story suddenly becomes apparent. The joker didn't stop the new recruits from destroying the party. Instead, he joined the group. To the joker himself, this may be interpreted as an outburst of repression. As an ordinary person, it is perfectly normal to consciously or unconsciously suppress their own nature in the environment, in this particular occasion has a proper release. But after, it will become his nightmare.
That's when fat pie changed. Mumbling, horrible eyes, quick action. But no one expected the final outburst. It is said that the suicide scene was supposed to take place in the dormitory, but kubrick changed it to a toilet. This kind of sudden in enclosed and secluded place can show a chilling effect especially, let alone specially chose white. White, which we have always thought of as the color of solemnity, purity and equality, became the spokesman of extreme violence in kubrick. Think of alex's clockwork orange, the milk he was drinking, and his tightly wrapped coat.
To say that perry was a victim of the pre-war system is not entirely true. The relentless routine required no warmth, but a killing machine, an environment in which everyone was at risk and had no time to look around, and in an era when you couldn't expect redemption from anyone else, perry's initial dullness held everyone back. Perry eventually killed hartman, but it wasn't a revolt. Instead, there was deep confusion. Then he turned the abb's cruel, piercing eyes, and turned them hollow, and blew his head open. This section, kubrick's treatment is clean, transparent, with a cold look on. In contrast to the first half of the recruit training in the lively opening and the irony of mockery.
The recruits went to war, and the joker became one of the war correspondents. There is no war here, but there is much reflection on the Vietnam war, which is especially represented by the clown. All he saw was a farce directed and staged by the United States to prove its ability, but it also had its own contradictions: he wanted to go to the front, and he wanted to win, even though he knew it was impossible, and the ""no way to win."" As he put it, every human being is ""born to kill,"" and even a dull man like perry knows how to pull the trigger to subdue his instructor, whom he never dares to disobey. On the other side is the desire of the heart to do good. I'm not an expert on humans, and I don't know what instinct is, but privately I think we should have both sides, depending on which side overpowers which one at the critical moment.
The final ironic moment came when a group of American soldiers broke through to find the sniper who had fired at them, only to discover that it was a young Vietnamese girl. This is a satire on hegemonic policy and power, and a lament for war - no one has a self any more, just a state's war machine. The joker raises his gun and still ends up with a girl who is better than dead. You can understand it as a victory for the human side in his body, but the sneer of a peary in the toilet in his mind will be his lifelong nightmare. Is the war has long been obliterated by the human nature, by the system seriously distorted under the brainwashed people, even if there was a brief recovery, but how?"

I knew that this Man was going to become a Giant Star. He was Crazy, Nuts, Mentel, Fat, and I been in Army Cadets before. They are very hard on you. After seeing that blanket beating that stuff really does happen to the weak cadets. Also, the stuff when cadets mess up and the others are punished. That stuff really does happen. When he got caught with that donut. That he took and the others had to do 200 push-ups as he ate it. Oh, trust me that stuff really does happen. That is why all those cadets were so angry with him. Because of the kept messing up. So they beat him to stop messing up. Then he went Crazy and Killed his main Captain. Then shoot himself in the head.

","Kubrick's take on the Vietnam War is haunting and powerful, with amazing performances from Vincent D'Onofrio and R. Lee Ermey. This isn't Kubrick's best movie, or even his best war movie, but it's definitely a memorable look at the horrors of war. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is Kubrick's deepest exploration of the duality of man, with the movie divided into two halves in order to demonstrate humanity's contradictory nature.<br/><br/>The first half, which focuses on boot camp training, is by far the best. It has the finest performances, cinematography, and pacing in the entire movie. The second half is still really good, but it suffers from unsympathetic main characters and a sometimes unfocused story. But despite these flaws the second half is one of the most entertaining and shocking depictions of war ever put on film. The climax in particular is truly amazing with its intense, horrific portrayal of a futile conflict. ""Full Metal Jacket"" isn't the best movie about the Vietnam War (that would be ""Apocalypse Now""), but it's still a must-see. 9/10."

","Except in humorous visions of war such as M * A * S * H or Hot Shots!, in every war movie the dehumanization, segregation, guilt, impunity and, in some cases, madness are reiterated. The ""state of the art"" comprises a longing for the corrupted and coarted youth: life ripped off at its fullest, young lives that have been regretted, the guilty naiveness of patriotism and the mistakes of the Cold war in movies such as The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Forrest Gump. The theme of an indoctrinated youngster converted into an anti-human killing machine man who is blinded (as well as officially justified) by the national discourse has its echoes in the literary pages of novels like Travel to the End of the Night by Louis Ferdiand Céline, The Good Soldier Svejk by Jaroslav Hasek etc . In all these texts there is a profound anti-skepticism. The cinema, along that tone, has been no exception. The wide appeal of war movies comes from Battleshkip Potemkin , The Bridge over the River Kwai , Go and see , The Thin Red Line etc.. All maintain the usual standard style, narrative and characters. But in this whole filmographic constellation nothing shines as much as the great war movie of Kubrick, premiered in 1987. Elliptical, full of subtle inner rhymes and profoundly moving, it's admirably & tightly crafted, like every single essay in Kubrick's small oeuvre."

","Kubrick's Vietnam war movie is actually two movies. One is excellent, while the other is just good. The basic training part of the film is pure gold. It's outrageously funny, endlessly quotable and features a career best performance by R. Lee Ermey, as the Drill Sergeant from hell. The Vietnam part, while not bad by any stretch of the imagination, is a bit of a letdown when compared to the high-octane first act. It does not offer anything new or provocative that has not been covered elsewhere. With that being said, Full Metal Jacket is still funny, unrelenting and ferocious.

","Kubrick has created a virtuous war movie. Excellent direction, screenplay, editing, score, settings and acting. All of the actors deliver great performances with Modine, Ermey and D'Onofrio giving the most mezmorizing. The plot revolves around the Vietnam War and follows recruits through basic training and ultimately into war. During basic training we see the most iconic Drill Sergeant ever to appear on film preparing and molding his recruits for war. He is also trying to weed out the weak for their own good. He finds his target and then unleashes the most horrific psychological and physical torment ever portrayed on film. It is very difficult to view without feeling remorse for the target and respect for the Drill Sergeant. After basic training the plot follows the main character nicknamed Joker which is appropriate. Joker understands the duplicity of man and the absurdity of war. He is sent into war as a journalist but in the end becomes a product of the violence and environment he is submerged in. After the Battle of Hue the platoon marches away from the battlefield singing in unison a song which this viewer believes Kubrick shot in order to convey his commentary on war and violence. The plot is dark, gritty, disturbing, violent and horrifying. This film has so many unforgettable scenes to this day. You'll also hear fans quote famous lines such as, "" Let me see your war face"". It is a masterful work of art and one of the most unique and insightful movies in it's genre."

","5 June 2016. Before Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) and its vicarious and explosive war during World War II opening, there was Full Metal Jacket that revealed a glaring look into boot camp and the prolonged isolating and deadly experience of patrol in Vietnam. Stanley Kubrick brings his classic stark look to the war film genre not with action but with storyline and the use of real time to expose the audience to a vicarious experience of war through the eyes of Marines. At times documentary in feel and at other times an artistic expose into the harsh realities of basic training and the frailty of life in real field of battle. As opposed to Saving Private Ryan's big canvass, Kubrick focuses on the more narrow but intimate smaller scope of the personal experience of small battles that are likely to have been more prominent in every soldier's experience.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket ranks among the war classics of Platoon (1986), more authentic than Apocalypse Now (1979), less use of exciting action and less personalized presentation of Black Hawk Down (2001), less political satire of that Kubrick directed in his own Dr. Strangelove (1964), Full Metal Jacket introduces a more raw and realistic look at war that an earlier film Sidney Lumet's Fail-Safe (1964) or the later films such as We Were Soldiers (2002) or Jarhead (2005)."

","Stanley Kubrick has made many movies that people either love or hate, A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Eyes Wide Shut, movies that are not very popular but are liked by some people, Barry Lyndon, Dr. Strangelove, Paths of Glory, and there are his movies that everyone pretty much loves, The Shining, and the movie I will be reviewing today, Full Metal Jacket. I picked this up at my local library on blu ray and watched it on a friday night. On the way home, my dad asked me what movie I got, I showed him the blu ray, and he was like ""that's a very good movie"" and yeah that was all. Watching Full Metal Jacket, it didn't remind me of other good war films I've seen. It was very different from Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk, Hacksaw Ridge, it is really unique, probably the most unique war film I've ever seen. The storytelling and the elements in the story about the Vietnam war really made it raw. That's how I'd describe the movie, raw. R. Lee Ermey really gave one of the best performances in history in this movie, in my opinion. Even though he was on screen for about 15 minutes, he made those 15 minutes so intense, so great, and gives the movie dark comedic scenes. I think his performance as Sgt. Hartman is one of the best performances of all time. Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as a private that struggles in the beginning of the movie because of military training camp being too hard for him, and R. Lee Ermey's character being a hard mentor, challenging Vincent D'Onofrio's character physically and mentally, it is really compelling stuff. The part where he shoots Sgt. Hartman, then shoots himself, is one of the most jaw dropping scenes of all time. The look on Vincent D'Onofrio's face in that scene haunted me for the rest of that night. There is also another main character in this movie named Joker, (that's his nickname). He is in this military camp with Vincent D'Onofrio's character, and he goes through this camp, watching horrific things happen, you really get into the shoes of this character. The next acts of this movie is Joker going to Vietnam and experiencing the war. This part of the movie was really different from the first part back on Parris Island. A lot of people thought this 2nd part of the movie was not as good as the first part, but I thought both parts were great. The Vietnam war was portrayed so rough and raw in this movie, it was pretty breathtaking. The message/allegory of this story was so beautiful and 100% true, it really makes me look at war differently. The only issue I have with this movie is that I thought the movie really dragged at the middle of the film. Not much things were going on, there wasn't really much of a direction either, it just kind of felt like the story was going nowhere. Other than that, I thought this movie was really good. 9/10"

","Being a soldier in the Vietnam War era had to be rough. Not only, was the war in Southeast Asia, a very arduous and evolving moral challenging affair, but going through boot camp for that date with the enemy was not kind. Especially, if you had to go through it, with a rigorous Senior Drill Instructor like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermy). However, somehow, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) was able to get survive this, only to find himself, in a world of hurt, once he finally see combat, and had to make the final choice to kill or not. Could he pull the trigger? Watch the film, to find out. Without spoiling the movie, too much; this film was loosely based on a book by author, Gustav Hasford called 'The Short Timers', which he wrote whilst serving in Vietnam. Both director, Stanley Kubrick, and screenwriter, Michael Herr, adapted this book into the screenplay, changing parts of it. While, the movie faithfully reproduces the first section of the novel, ""The Spirit of the Bayonet"", with only minor differences in events and names. The second part of the movie change a lot of the dialogue, scenarios, and characters; by combining elements from chapters 'Body Count' and 'Grunt' & merging them into one to save the movie from a long runtime. Because of this, several key important sequences were left out or change, including: a character lapse into cannibalism, a tank running over people, and the real person, the protagonist has to force to kill. Because of this, Kubrick and Hasford did not get along, it got worst, when the filmmaker worried that the book's title might be misread by audiences as referring to people who only did half a day's work. In order to further distanced himself from the original author, Kubrick changed the title of the film to what it is today after discovering the phrase while going through a gun catalogue. This was finally draw, as Hasford didn't meet Kubrick ever again, nor attend the Oscar ceremonies when the screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award. Anyways, regardless of the writing dispute, the movie is probably best remember for the scenes at Parris Island, at the Marine Corp Boot Camp, as most critics and audience love Ermy's portrayal as the strict drill instructor. His over the top bellowing acting & the comedic funny insults to Private Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) were by far, the most entertaining part of the film. However, it wasn't his first acting role like some critics may want to think. In truth, he play a similar character in Sidney J. Furie's 1978's film, 'The Boys in Company C'. Honestly, if you look at both movies as a whole, you would find a lot of similarities between them besides Ermy, to the point, that some critics believe that Kubrick & Hasford might have stolen ideas from Furie's work, or Furie's adapted Hasford's story without giving him, credit. It's hard to tell, who is the right and who is the wrong. All, I know, is both films, showcase the exposition of dehumanization & the loss of individuality and that catapults into men into fighting machines so well, with this movie's boot camp sequences being a little more accurate. Psychological & mentally conditioning techniques like the ones, show in the film, are indeed used to sharpen recruits, in order for them to obey all orders, work together, face mortal danger, and kill their opponents in battle. However, I really doubt, much of physically hitting used by Hartman is allowed, even back then, without embroiled in controversy. As for the film's portrayal of marines in Vietnam. It could easily be mistaken for another film, as the footage looks and feels like other over the top, somewhat cartoony, Vietnam War films from that era, including 1979's film 'Apocalypse Now'. While, it's true, heinous acts were commit by some of them. Nevertheless, most of the vets out there, were highly discipline and acted accorded to qualities of what a good combatant should be. In short, they were more like the realism soldiers in 1986's film 'Platoon', than the shocking extremists of Francis Ford Coppola's movie. Regardless of that, the movie does a strong second half, both in action and moral message. It does not all fall apart or seem disjointed as some people think. The journalism parts are great examples of this. They're very interesting, as the men interviews in a faux like documentary perspective really have no clue, who they, even fighting against and why. Nor if they really winning the world. I like how each of their answers ranges from topics like lack of sex, religionist duty to downright insanity. It mirrors to every coercive persuasion that people like Hartman altered into them, in order to reduce the subject's ability to think critically or independently. I also love, how it foreshadows, future events. As for the ending with the sniper, it's very much of a symbol of loss of innocence. No wonder, the movie ends with a satirizing military infusing singing of a children song. It's haunting. Even the catchy pop songs were very well used. Most of the music compose by Kubrick's daughter, Abigail Mead was also great. The creepy industry background music in the climax is one such example. Compelling as hell. Those scenes in Hae must had been difficult to shot with all those chemicals in the air. No wonder, why the movie took forever to film. Despite that, the movie is very well shot. As for acting, all the performers did their jobs; but D'Onofrio really shines, as he gained 70 pounds to play Pyle. Talk about going to great lengths for a role. Best acting in the film, by far. Overall: Despite some flaws. If you want to get some! Go see this movie! It's a poignant masterpiece. It's a must watch for any Kubrick fan."

","The only other Stanley Kubrick film I saw before watching this was ""The Killing"" (1956) a satisfying heist film which also had a definite aspect of film noir, and depicted a clever downfall of the human psyche.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a film of two halves. ""Full Metal Jacket"" follows the life of Private J.T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine) in the military and his squad during the Vietnam War. Starting in Boot Camp, the movie is absolutely perfect and I would have changed nothing if I had the opportunity. In that half, the acting is top notch and the script is sensational. Tensions and emotions continue to rise until the half ends. In the second half, the film definitely trails off a little from its hot start but still is enjoyable and interesting to watch. Especially in the second half, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Kubrick's intended message is definitely understood as the film ends, and I absolutely agree with it. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is one of the top if not one of the best war films I have ever seen, graced by brilliant director Stanley Kubrick's presence, and 30 years later it stills holds up very well."

","Full Metal Jacket's thematic exploration on the duality of man is not buried in the slightest...in one moment Joker (aptly named) even jests about the origin of his 'born to kill' slogan on his helmet and his inevitability at getting his hands stained with blood with war coming. This is not really actual engagement but rather Kubrick being witty. Suffice to say that most wars could end up going down the 'war is hell' pathway where there are no clear moral boundaries and fresh-faced young men are thrust into a chaotic, nightmarish world to cope. In Full Metal Jacket Kubrick has done the same as what Stone did in Platoon; obscure the surroundings in smoke, ash and explosions, give no sense of direction or control, and drop the inexperienced squadron right into the middle of it. Here, they have no idea who or what is shooting at them half the time, and it is terrifying and disorientating, and the film begins to close in on them and their paranoia rather than have it be an external battle. <br/><br/>The frenzy of war also reflects the stylistic shift that Kubrick has created here. First the rigid geometry of the boot camp, the long rows of bunk beds, the spotless surfaces, the coldly-lit corridors that allow for no non-conformity. And then the smoky, shaky battlefields where all sense of purpose and direction is lost. It is no wonder that so many viewers have found the first half of the film so riveting and yet cannot engage with the second half after the soldiers are dropped in hell. But is the raw and senseless portrayal of war really saying as much as it thinks it is? Many war films making the same bait and switch have long relied on the audience expectations, in particularly those who have never been so much as near a battlefield, of it being a precise and action-packed affair, especially with the less serious films paving the way for masculine, adrenaline-filled heroics and balls of fire. But the other extreme is also a bit nonsensical; there is only so much chaos and disorganisation and bodies flying that you can really throw at the screen until the message because senseless. It cannot at any point be an actual substitute for substance, an argument for the listlessness and meaningless experiences of these youths. Apocalypse Now was another film that went along the same lines, but found itself confused and with little to say at the end. But even that had a certain warping of the mind, of the physical and mental being muddled until we knew neither how long nor how far the crew had sailed up river. Here, the scenes are not part of a descent or a journey, but individually compartmentalised. If anything the vividness of the opening boot camp is an anti-climax. It promises the harshness and physicality and broken mentality of the battles to come, and then takes a little detour, if only to give that final extended sequence a little extra punch. Dishonesty is not something that Kubrick would normally be accused of. But here it is, flashy and in our face; Lee Ermey from a low-angle shot, seducing and making the audience clamour for more, and then overshadowing the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Gomer Pyle's fate is perhaps a little less impactful than it might have been in 1987. Back then it was edgy and serious - today these menacing, open- mouthed snarls, the zoom-ins to the dead eyes, the loving whispers to the rifle and the adoration of Whitman and Oswald have all been seen before, so their shock lessens considerably. It is not all lost, simply because Vincent D'Onofrio is excellent. When smirks at his first confrontation with Hartman, and we really believe that he is trying to hide is smirk, but all the same we smirk with him. Kubrick has something to say about violence, and how it is not all that it is chalked up to be. But when Pyle takes a shot at his drill instructor and finally finds satisfaction, the bullet piercing his chest is in slow-motion, and over-dramatised. Later he constructs an elaborate set-piece involving two sets of camera crews, and makes a pointed note at the artificiality of the Vietnam battlefield, but has not realised he has contradicted himself. He has also walked right into a massive oversimplification - it seems the world of Vietnam is separated thinly by two archetypes of solider. One is the blatantly racist and juvenile meat-head like Animal Mother and co., as seen by the martial arts routine of the camera thief, the way they massacre civilians out of a helicopter like a video- game, and the approach towards the prostitute (a funny irony as they later get terrorised by a little girl wielding a machine gun). The other is the saint within a hellhole, Joker as the solitary moralist who does not want to wade into waters until he is too far gone. Kubrick wants to make his inevitable fall agonising, but even that isn't a irredeemable act, but rather a compromise - he is mercy killing the girl to prevent further pain. In one moment a soldier simply steps on a landmine and is blown up. There is no droning of the soundtrack, only silence, and the life is taken from us just like that. But Kubrick is more content to smother the film in the plastic ironies of upbeat pop songs over senseless violence. The squadron marches along soullessly to the tune of Mickey Mouse, but we already knew the tone their lives would take."

","Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam War. In this film Kubrick shows the horrors and dehumanizing that war can do to someone. Technically there is two parts of the film, ""Boot Camp"" and ""The War"" and I will be reviewing the two of them separately. Boot Camp: What can I say about Boot Camp its pure genius. Stellar direction and lots of witty and dark humor makes this pure Kubrick, just a damn fun time, though as I did like the direction to me it just isn't as artsy like many of his other films like 2001 A Space Odyssey or the Shinning but never the less I still liked it. There's three main characters here, Private Joker played by Matthew Modine, Leonard/Private Pyle played by Vincent D'Onofrio and the best of them all Sgt. Hartman played by Lee Ermey. Lee Ermey is fantastic as the Sgt. Hartman. ""Do you feel dizzy? Do you feel faint! Jesus H. Christ! I think you've got a hard-on!"" He gives a performance that steals the entire movie. He was actually a Sgt in real life, which explains this. He and Private Pyle are the best part of the film, I just found them to be the most memorable out of all the characters and that they give their best performances in my opinion. Though Hartman is a fantastic (might I mention one of the most memorable and favorite character of all time) of a drill instructor, I might like Private Pyle's performance a little more mostly because of the deep character development. From being this nice normal guy to transforming himself into this killing machine that shows the dehumanization of war. Brilliant character development and I am a sucker for deep character development. The War: Sadly the second part of Full Metal Jacket isn't as good as it was at Boot camp. The movie still has some dark humor and shows more of the horrors of war but it starts slipping into some war clichés and at some points started to get boring. Private Joker has more of a part here but without spoiling anything without Hartman or Pyle here it just wasn't as enjoyable. But what almost made up for this was the sniper scene which I just found out that ""The Hurt Locker"" kind of copied off of it. This is probably the best part of ""The War,"" One of their guys in the troop is shot down by a sniper and they need to rescue him. They don't know where the sniper is, some of them say they have to move on others want to rescue him and take the sniper down. I liked all the characters each of them showing there own style of their take on war, it created deep suspense then, the movie already showed how war can dehumanize someone and that you can die at any time in war so I didn't know what character would choose to do next. Now the ending of Full Metal Jacket is fantastic. This part really showed how war can dehumanize a man and how they are living in a world of sh*t. This is actually one of my favorite endings of all time, just how horrifying it is, but yet funny. Very dark humor is the name and Kubrick knows how to do that. Full Metal Jacket is a brilliant war movie that isn't as artsy as Kubrick's other films. Sure the movie loses some of its momentum in ""The War"" part, but the suspenseful sniper scene the horrifying yet funny ending makes up for most of it. Plus with the brilliance of ""Boot Camp"" Full Metal Jacket may not be Kubrick's best (or like I said artsy) film but I still had a damn fun time with it. This is a war movie that everyone should watch. M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E !"

","(Note: the following was written when the film was first released in 1987...) Can anything new be added to the current cycle of Vietnam War films? Stanley Kubrick seems to think so, and he goes about his business after a seven-year absence as if his were the first film to be made on the subject (which it might have been, back when he began it). What's surprising is how well such a fussy and deliberate filmmaker like Kubrick captures the madness of war (much as he did in his earlier Paths of Glory). But the best part of this lopsided scenario (co-written with Michael Herr and author Gustav Hasford) has nothing to do with the conflict in Vietnam, focusing exclusively on the rigors of Marine Corps training and indoctrination (i.e. brainwashing). These early scenes are classic Kubrick, and would have made a near perfect short film if released independently. The subsequent battle scenes (famously, if not always convincingly, recreating Southeast Asia in rural England) are, by comparison, only anticlimactic padding, showing what happens when the hot-blooded fury of combat gives way to the cold-blooded reality of death, represented here by a single, harrowing incident where a squad of soldiers is pinned down by an invisible sniper during the urban fighting of the 1968 Tet Offensive. Never mind that Francis Coppola covered similar ground in one brief scene of 'Apocalypse Now'; for Kubrick, it's a welcome return to form, up to a point: a compact, mini-masterpiece awkwardly matched to a rambling, episodic war story.<br/><br/>(postscript: twenty-plus years and countless viewings later 'Full Metal Jacket', like any genuine classic, makes a lot more sense...not as an unbalanced film-in-two-mismatched-parts, but as a construct following the elliptical arc of a boomerang. I've said it many times but it needs repeating: if you've seen a Stanley Kubrick film only once, you haven't really seen it at all...)"

","Behold: the greatest villain in movie history. Okay, this may not actually be true. Hartman's probably not an actual villain, just a man who means well but takes it a bit too far. But damn it, he's such a guy you love to hate. It's the sort of character you can despise while the back of your brain wants to be him. There's no such thing as perfection, but R.Lee Ermey's memorable performance comes dangerously close at times. Some have stated that this movie plays all its cards in the first half and then just drags itself to the credits, but I can't agree, even though I can perfectly understand this opinion. It's true that the second half of the movie isn't as hard and direct as the first half, but that's exactly the thing: it crawls up on you. The first half is great while you're watching it, what follows is at times more brilliant when you give it thought afterwards. Also, that ending is downright beautiful. The ending monologue is delivered with such a saddening monotony that it brings over the horrors of war better than any amount of battlefield action scenes ever could. Wonderful movie."

","***SPOILERS*** One of the best movies ever made about the Vietnam War or any other war for that matter ""Full Metal Jacket"" shows what not only war but boot camp, in preparing one for war, does to young recruits who are exposed to it.<br/><br/>At Parris Island the new and raw US Marine recruits are put through the ringer by the foul mouth and in your face US Marine drill Sgt. Hartman played by former Marine DI R.Lee Ermey. Brutal and heartless Sgt.Hartman whips the recruits into shape by making them fear as well as hate him far more then those their trained to kill; The Vietcong, or just plain VC, and North Vietnamese regular combat troops. Sgt. Hartman who for some reason never takes off his drill instructor hat, even while asleep, during the entire time he's in the movie really gets to work on the overweight and dumpy Pvt. Pyle, Vincent D'Onofrio, whom he's determined to turn into a US Marine killing machine even if it ends up killing him; That's Pvt.Pyle not Sgt.Hartmen <br/><br/>It's really Pvt. Pyle's good friend and fellow US Marine recruit Pvt. Joker, Matthew Modine, who does the job that Sgt.Hartman failed to do. That's in Pvt. Joker making, by persuading instead of intimidating, Pvt. Pyle into a fearless and murderous US fighting man. But Pvt. Joker soon realizes that he did too good of a job in getting Pvt.Plye into the US Marine killing mode that Sgt.Hartmen tried by failed to get him into! The grueling and dehumanizing training drove the poor young man to completely lose his marbles! And it was Sgt. Hartman, in the marine barracks latrine, who was to find that out soon enough at the receiving end of Pvt. Pyle's M-14 rifle!<br/><br/>The second half of the movie ""Full Metal Jacket"" is when the real action begins as Pvt. Joker , now a sergeant, is assigned as a US Marine combat reporter for Stars & Strips during the bloodiest fighting of the Vietnam War: The 1968 Tet Offencive. It's during that brutal period that Sgt.Joker is reunited with his fellow marine boot camp buddy Pvt. Cowboy, Arliss Howard, during the battle of Hue in central South Vietnam. It's during the battle of Hue that Sgt.Joker a life long pacifist learns the meaning of kill or be killed. It's in the brutal and bloody assault on a VC sniper nest in a burnt out and abandoned building on the outskirts of Hue that Pvt. Joker sees what war is really all about when he suddenly becomes part of it. Something he'll now have to live with, if in fact he survives the war, for the rest of his life!<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** Brutally honest film about war and it's effects on those who participate in it ""Full Metal Jacket"" doesn't at all glorify war and the American fighting man but shows how he becomes the very monster that he's been brainwashed in boot camp to kill: The godless and dirty commie VC & North Vietnamese soldier! In fact the most humane thing to happen in the movie was Sgt. Joker, who was forced by his fellow US Marines, gunning down the Viet Cong woman sniper, Ngoc Le, who by single handedly holding it off had just about decimated his entire US Marine combat unit and killing his good friend and marine buddy Pvt.Cowboy in the process! At first opting to let the fatally injured VC sniper die a slow death, for all the damage she did, the gong ho and blood and guts US Marine Pvt. Animal Mother, Adam Baldwin, for the first time showed his human side in not having to want to put her out of her misery! He wanted her to suffer as much as possible for what she did in killing his fellow US Marines! Animal Mother who didn't think twice in gunning down VC or North Vietnamese soldiers in combat just didn't have it when it came to finishing the helpless and near death VC sniper off!

"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","0","22 August 2010"," Fully Trained Killers
","Kubrick's versatility is no unknown news. With 'Full Metal Jacket' he touches on a very sensitive subject: the insanity, brutality and sadism of war. He does not shy away from stating that soldiers are trained as killers, that their purpose is to kill. This is the sad disturbing truth that many people are in denial about. All this 'love for ones country', 'fight for ones country' motivation were secondary compared to the will to kill especially during the Vietnam war. It became a game, a competition of who could kill the most and who made the best kill.<br/><br/>'Full Metal Jacket' starts by showing us how the soldiers are trained to be killers and those who 'didn't have it in them' are humiliated and degraded. In a disturbing sequence the drill sergeant states the name of real-life murderers as examples of being great killers. Only the Joker character seems to have maintained some humanity as he opts for a journalist post and wears the peace badge (while his hat states 'born to kill').<br/><br/>In addition to its poignancy, 'Full Metal Jacket' is an exceptionally well crafted movie. The cinematography, sound effects and editing are first rate. The writing is excellent and the score goes well with the situations. Kubrick infuses some humour that works very well and doesn't overshadow the seriousness of the theme. The acting is very good. Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio are outstanding.<br/><br/>Very few war movies have made as strong an impression as Kubrick's picture. 'Full Metal Jacket' is among the ultimate anti-war films."

","The movie is divided into two parts. The first part is about practicing for being a soldier. I like this part very much, especially the soldier teacher. When I watch his acting, it makes me think of the part of my life when I had to practice in soldier school. In the scene that all soldiers stand in front of their bed and the soldier teacher talks to each person; we can see low-angle shot after he punches his pupil. In addition, we can see the camera cut to another side of 180 degree system while they are talking; I think the director tries to emphasis that the teacher soldier talks very loud near the ear of his pupil. The scene that the soldier practice in the evening time with the sun in background is beautiful scene and this scene gives the feeling of practice hard. Plus, the background musics and instrument(drum)(nondiegetic) are used in practicing scene to motivate the emotion of the audience. Every scene in the first part represents the practicing, so there are many cuts that are discontinuity editing. In the second part, the movie is about war, so the kinetic quality of the movie is high including the moving frame. Besides, there are many special effect scenes. Moreover, low-angle shot is used again when the soldiers talk to the dead people and the camera moves from person to another person."

This movie shows the audience how war can affect a person during and even after the war. See how the people react when there is death around them and they have to stay in control.

So much pain that it eventually leads to suicide.<br/><br/>All of Kubricks films have something different about them and I have seen everyone of them and the only one I didn't like was eyes wide shut but I can't really complain about any since they are all works of art."

I haven't heard one man express so much hate in my entire life, I think every man should be required to watch the scene before the sign up for the Army. He is so intense and crazy that can you really blame Pyle for snapping like he did I know I couldn't. Not only is the dialog in this movie well done the cinematography is breath taking. Even the shots at boot camp are done well, the scene shot is the sunset orange is beautiful. When the actually get to the war its even better. I don't know where they shot but it looks perfectly like the wore torn Vietnam I imagine in my history classes when we learned about the chaos that took place. Not only that but this film is probably the first War film to perfectly capture the feelings soldiers feel while at war since All Quite On The Western Front. Powerful scene of death and people losing control it countiue on throughout the film and they perfect capture the feeling of the soldiers at the time at the Vietnam war ; Shouldn't they fight there own war. The different character the come in and out of the film really captures all the different types of soldiers there are. The first scene of the film is extremely intense and long and it sets the tone for the entire movie. The scene when Joker shoots the girl sniper is so long and played out to really drag out the emotions in you. This is a very powerful and well done film that I would recommend to anyone."

","Another masterwork from Legend Stanley Kubrick<br/><br/>This is a must for any War Movie Fans.<br/><br/>Till date some of the accomplished Movies on Vietnam War include:  Platoon  Apocalypse Now  Full Metal Jacket<br/><br/>This is not the first time I have seen this movie and will also not be my last one... :) I think there will be very few members in this Community who have not seen FMJ.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is hard hitting with intense dialogue. I think Kubrick was well versed with what he was planning to do at the time of making this movie. There is hardly any place where I can point out flaws. <br/><br/>For those who have not yet seen (which I doubt..) this movie takes us to the time of on going Vietnam War. We are introduced to a company of rookies who joins the boot camp (USMC) Parris Island, South Carolina. Soon we are introduced to the unforgettable drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman brilliantly performed by Ronald Lee Ermey. First half of the movie deals with the dehumanizing process. On the way we are introduced to some the central characters. To me the most memorable character will be Pvt. Pyle. I think Vincent D'Onofrio had immortalized this character just like Heath had done for Joker in 'The Dark Knight'. Matthew Modine as Pvt. Joker was also very impressive.<br/><br/>Second half of the movie deals with the experience of these characters' Tet Offensive during 1968. We are not given a clear cut ending to this movie and I guess Kubrick left that part to the viewer's imagination.<br/><br/>This movie definitely falls under the category, which never ages. As far as I know this was the only War movie Stanley had ever directed. In my opinion, if some more action was included in the second half it would have been fine just like 'Platoon' still I would not complain, its still a great Movie. We do get some taste of some of the Classic Rock Songs which includes two of my favorites Johnny Wright's ""Hello Vietnam"" & Rolling Stones' ""Paint It, Black"".<br/><br/>Closing note will be, if any one is really interested to watch a movie with intense acting along with rich narrative script then FMJ delivers as it promises, without any degree of doubt. This is certainly thought provoking movie and should be with every collector. I think I am the lucky few who owns the Deluxe Edition (Widescreen) of Full Metal Jacket DVD which I got from Amazon UK."

","Finally I see a movie by Mr Stanley Kubrick that is up to my expectations. A solid war film full of twisted irony, acid mockery, and ""in-your-face"" performance of all the actors involved. Though I wish I did not read the trivia, because reading that the movie was filmed in the UK with the plastic palm trees does not add any respect to the production (I think I should quit the trivia for certain great films – it simply ruins the whole impression sometimes). Still, even without that kind of authenticity the movie walks along quite well. Its ridiculous amount of fowl language is justified (just think how many movies nowadays are crammed with bad language which is there just because the director thinks it's cool no matter if it fits the film itself or not). You don't expect the military guys saying something like ""Would you be so kind to run faster, Private Vincent D'Onofrio"", do you? The performance of Mr R. Lee Ermey deserves an Oscar without any doubt. However offensive his character is, you feel that he is making his job the best he can. His one-liners are something to hear. Sometimes you don't know: to laugh or cry.<br/><br/>I cannot help pointing out that remarkable music during the tense psychological scenes (beating of Pvt Pyle and Pvt Pyle 's pay-back). Those scenes stand out and overshadow the war scenes.<br/><br/>A great movie worth viewing. Definitely not for children. It's an example of film-making when any remake will not be up to the original. And I don't understand when spoof-productions of such war classics appear. I don't think that certain subjects can be made fun of.<br/><br/>It's a 9 out of 10 from me. Thank you for attention."

","Now, having seen the ""Inglurious Basterds"" about two weeks ago, you can imagine that Full Metal Jacket was quite a kick in the gut. I like the ""old masters"" directors (where have they all gone and where are the new ones...?) and Kubrick was no doubt one of them. This good movie, after a long time, gave me a proof that movies are worth spending time over, at least some movies, that is.<br/><br/>Well written, well shot, cut, directed - the hand of a skilled and experienced author is almost 'visible' behind the scenes. Technically very well done. Storywise - and here some people struggle with the 'two halves' - what more could you ask for? It's a ""hero journey"" of sorts, but twisted. It's so nicely tensed, between the peace and war, between the yearning for eternal peace and the ingrained disquiet and need for battle in man. If you ever wondered, like me, how does it happen, and how does it feel, that one finds himself in an army, and then in the battlefield, this film will gradually take you there - if you care to empathize with a bunch of main characters (I don't think there is one central main character in this movie). Training camp is gruelling and accomplishes slowly exactly what it usually does - collapse of individuality, gradual brain wash and eventually trained soldiers actually willing to go to war. But then - isn't some of this in the man already? Don't men feel good in a group of buddies, intoxicated mildly with a feeling of belonging and a cause that is greater than all of them together? I mean, don't we like to play hockey and all?? When the barriers of ""who started it"" are long forgotten, and a man is faced with a freshly shot body of his buddy, he will without a doubt devote himself completely to killing the enemy ""sniper"" right there. On a grand scale - this is a basic war conflict. The pull and push of the abstract ""body"" called war is way too strong to oppose. Only a coward runs away, and the protester asking for 'common sense' is bulldozed over, so the only thing left is to fight. The reality of this, and some other very ambivalent aspects of war fight are hinted on during the movie, especially during the second half.<br/><br/>The movie needed to move on from the training camp somehow. The montage of shots and cuts is wonderful, in my opinion, to establish that some time has passed - Joker is clearly more experienced, Vietnam is bombed out and the war drags. During his meetings at the newspaper office, I thought he wanted to experience some combat - and this was reinforced by his buddy photographer who was very hungry for it. After all - if one is sitting in the army base and sees other guys go to battle, then come back (a few dead), hear their stories and see it in their faces - wouldn't he desire to see it for himself? After all - war IS the place and time to become a fighter, to maybe become a hero. Joker has become disillusioned with the reporting job, being openly sarcastic with the chief editor. The story progresses as the base camp is attacked and Joker gets to the big machine gun right next to the gate. At that point, the movie mastery of this director (and the actors) rests in relaying the actual feelings during that fight - shooting with gusto but also with great fear for one's life, then resting with a hope in their eyes that this might as well be it. As it is said in many observations of war - it's one of the most 'real' experiences a man can get, so in a way, he becomes fixated on it. (Hence the adjustment problems of the veterans returning to society - punctuated by one of the soldiers remarking that he might as well miss the days when he could shoot these 'great people' on daily basis).<br/><br/>Later on, as Joker and his photographer buddy move closer to the front line, the tension grows and the scenery looks more and more like a battlefield. I thought this pacing was done well - from the training camp, to the base camp, to the 'safe' war zone, and eventually to the deep s*** battle, faced with a possible defeat (and death). At that point, Joker, who started wearing the peace-sign button some time ago, is faced with a wounded sniper, who has just taken lives of three soldiers, one being his buddy from the training camp. With some hesitation, Joker kills her, and earns remarks as ""this was hard core"" from other soldiers.<br/><br/>But again returning to the topic, Joker, being questioned by a higher rank commander on his wearing a peace-sign button and wearing his helmet with a 'Born to kill' writing, responds that he himself doesn't know why he's wearing both of them, and hints at 'something Jungian'. Jungian psychology helps here with its view of a man as essentially a dual being - consisting of a conscious, civilized part and a 'shadow', often unconscious part, which mix together in one unit known as human being, capable of wanting peace and killing another being in a conflict at the same time. This set up is implemented at very deep layers of human mind and there's no easy resolution. This movie shows that very pointedly - there's no easy resolution to this mess.<br/><br/>All in all, a movie that doesn't let up, has pace, has good story, has characters that viewers will find easy to empathize with (or dislike), has poignant points and leaves lasting impressions. They don't make these kinds of movies anymore. (I will have to check the ""Hurt Locker"" now). To the point of no easy answer to the question of war, leaving these young men changed forever."

","Recap: The experiences of a soldier nicknamed Joker first during the hard training and subsequently his tour of duty in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Comments: Seemingly a very honest movie. That being said by one that has never been close to Vietnam, not now, not then. But it feels real, and that's what important with movies, isn't it? <br/><br/>So it seems very real, and it is brutal. It is not a pretty picture that Kubrick paints. But it probably is sincere. It is an anti-war movie, it doesn't shrug away from any unpleasant parts. It shows the violence, it shows death. And it shows how it corrupts both soldiers and civilians that are part of it.<br/><br/>Very well acted, especially D'Onofrios performance caught with me. But Ermey deserves all the credit he can get too. Ironic that their characters became enemies.<br/><br/>Something else that stuck with me and caught my attention was the use of sound and music. Sometimes a perfect fit with the pictures, and something a deep contrast. Both ways worked well to enhance the emotions of the scenes and get the point across the screen. And Kubrick did well when to choose which method to use when.<br/><br/>A catching, interesting movie. I can recommend it well, even if it is not a very nice movie.<br/><br/>8/10"
"mgoldsmith","Null","0","0","3 February 2009"," War as the art of imposing order on chaos.
","As a preface: this will be an abstract review. As others have pointed out, this film is not especially plot-oriented, but moves from scene to scene as, plausibly, the transition from training to being stationed to boredom to combat and all the ephemera in between would actually play out for a soldier as subject.<br/><br/>Instead, this movie for me functions primarily as a thought experiment. You're young, say 18 years old. You enter the Marines. A thought process, a worldview is imposed onto you. You accept it because you see the harsh consequences that happen to those who resist. You try to maintain individuality throughout, though this is expressed mainly in admissible, largely futile symbolic gestures.<br/><br/>Training is over. You live a strangely divorced, comfortable life, stationed in an area where there is a civil war going on and unfortunates on both sides are dying every day. Now and then, you see inexplicable atrocities. When in the midst of them, you do not think of your side's role in creating geopolitical strategems or polemics, or who is right or wrong, or what your country is doing there in the first place, or... any number of possible questions. You understand that for survival's sake, you will function like those around you, serving your side. At this point, you are capable of anything, in the name of your own self-interest.<br/><br/>This, it seems to me, the movie believes is the nature of war. The cause may be damnable or noble, but the role of the soldier is the same. He is thrust into forces beyond his control and asked to do the unthinkable, for reasons beyond him.<br/><br/>(As a tangent, it's refreshing to me that this movie does not rehash the historical context, the protests, the question of administrative responsibility... but is also not a simply minded combat and conquest flick. Partially for this reason, it strikes me as being the most appreciative of the plight of the soldier while being against the ignobilities of war of any film I have seen to date.) Kubrick is a master, but on the other hand, I appreciate the fact that this isn't a director's movie. It is definitely not as imagistically heavy handed as 2001, Clockwork Orange or The Shining. The ideas in it can be savored by most anyone coming at it from pretty much any viewpoint."
"bobsgrock","9","0","0","2 February 2009"," Uncany and all too believable.
","For Stanley Kubrick, this material isn't necessarily new ground. He certainly covered the ideas and motivations behind war in Paths of Glory as well in parts of Dr. Strangelove and Barry Lyndon. Here, he took his most modern take on perhaps the most complex and enigmatic war the United States ever took part of. We follow closely a group of Marine trainees as they pass through many tests in order to become one of the Corps. For the first 45 minutes or so, the drama is unparalleled. On an island totally dominated by an unflinching and cruel drill instructor, these young boys quickly are forced to grow up and become the mindless and dehumanized killers the Marines require. It is here Kubrick seems to have much sympathy for all the privates as they gain knowledge, courage and strength but lose all sense of humanity.<br/><br/>The second part follows Private Joker and Rafterman, a journalist and photographer on search for a story to up the morale of the US troops. Unfortunately, they discover that what they have trained for is to simply survive and this is the part where you might just be unable to peel your eyes from the action. If you have seen any war film before, you know how realistic and brutal the action scenes can be. Kubrick, perhaps the greatest atmospheric director ever, plunges us into the middle of an attack on Hue City as well as sneak attacks and other very real and very scary situations.<br/><br/>I have to say this is a very unique war film in terms of American cinema. Being the most powerful country in the last half century, our position in any war usually affects the outcome. This is certainly the case in movies like Saving Private Ryan or Platoon. Full Metal Jacket, however, is much more personal than any other war film I have seen. These are sympathetic characters despite their attitude to life and the Vietnamese. Perhaps this is Kubrick's point. For the naysayers, I can understand why they would like the first half and not the second. True, they are polar opposites and at times the film feels like it is wandering aimlessly. But that is exactly what Kubrick wanted. Just like the soldiers themselves, we feel like their is no purpose in this foreign wasteland. Why are we here? Have we accomplished anything? Those are questions you can ask about the war today, which makes Full Metal Jacket all the more creepily prophetic."
"matlefebvre20","9","0","0","15 May 2006"," Ermey gets the job well done
","It took seven years to Stanley Kubrick for finding a subject for his next movie after ""The Shining"" in 1980. He decided to keep on the flowing amount of movies about Vietnam War and directed his own Nam vision, less than a year after ""Platoon""'s victorious night at the Academy Awards ceremony.<br/><br/>If you start up with that point, that's not very good news. When a movie like ""Platoon"" almost sweeps the Oscars, it's hard to believe that another film about the same subject or so will come out in theaters and look as great as the former movie.<br/><br/>Hard to believe, but that happens. At least, a good hour of it. I give the movie 9 stars, but there are two parts in it which are not on the same level.<br/><br/>The first part is by far the best and it would deserve a enthusiastic 10/10. In fact, this is an obligatory part which the other Nam movies forgot to tell about. A group of Marine volunteers enter into the Parris Island instruction camp, and after a quick haircut montage on the air of Johnny Wright's ""Hello Vietnam"". Right after that comes the meat of the movie.<br/><br/>It's the entrance of GySgt Hartman, masterfully embodied by real-life DI R Lee Ermey. Hartman owns the task of turning the innocent boys into ""ministers of death praying for war"". The best way to make it is to yell constantly, shouting explicit phrases and beat them physically when necessary.<br/><br/>And Ermey is excellent, and this is an euphemism. Almost entirely ad-libbing his text (a rarity in Kubrick movies), Ermey never repeats himself and he never lifts a doubt about his menacing quotes. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is about soldiers but is the only one which also focuses on their training and there couldn't have been a better way to portray it.<br/><br/>Ermey's role is already a part of the legend. He could appear in any kind of movie after this one, but this character will live forever in ""Full Metal Jacket"".<br/><br/>The remaining 'maggots' are many, but we only get to know four of them. There's main character Joker, who is an arrogant and humorous but intelligent soldier. There's also Cowboy from Texas, black Snowball and another legendary character: over-weight Gomer Pyle (a really good performance by Vincent D'Onofrio.<br/><br/>The second part of the movie takes place in Nam but it gets an 8/10. Instead of covering almost-unreachable Vietnamese forests, Kubrick focuses on destroyed villages. This particular setting is not exactly a winner, especially because we all know now that the director didn't want to shoot in Vietnam, result of a fear of flying.<br/><br/>On another point, it's interesting to see the effect of Vietnam War on the soldiers. On this point, ""Full Metal Jacket"" goes a little bit aside of the others: war doesn't drive soldiers crazy, they already are before they leave American soil. This is perfectly reflected in Pyle's transformation from a maggot to a skilled, almost insane killer. This is the kind of message that puts ""Jacket"" above the other ones.<br/><br/>Other than Hartman and Gomer Pyle, the only really interesting character of the lot is Joker, played by Matthew Modine. While the two former men are great, they're still two-dimensional. Joker has a much more interesting personality, dominated by his moral ambiguity. He is smart and has a strong sense of morality but he desperately wants to kill somebody. This duality (which even Joker acquiesces) is well shown through his 'Born to Kill' helmet and his peace pin.<br/><br/>After World War I with ""Paths of Glory"", Cold War with ""Dr. Strangelove"" and Seven Years War with ""Barry Lyndon"", Stanley Kubrick shows that he still has a knack for war movies. It doesn't resound as strong as his other war films, but we have to admit that he raises the bar pretty high by himself. That's probably why some critics were left cold somehow. But it's a really good movie.<br/><br/>This movie isn't the strongest Kubrick film of all, but it's another unmissable hit and still is one of the greatest war movies ever made."
"adrongardner","9","0","0","9 April 2006"," Wholly Original
","Full Metal Jacket is unlike any war film that preceded it. Kubrick's minimalistic visual style proves effective. <br/><br/>The writing and acting in the early boot camp scenes are so well done, for me this alone qualifies the film for greatness. Ermy's Sergent Hartman is so terrifying and funny, you simply cannot and will not forget his lines or the expressions on his face.<br/><br/>The violence in the film are also very impressionistic. No matter how many war films you may have seen before this. The first time you see Full Metal Jacket, the death of Pvt. Pyle is shocking. You feel when Doc J and 8 Ball get hit. The impact of the violence is honest and true.<br/><br/>The structure of the film is very unusual. And this is welcome. The movie does not arc like a traditional war film, or traditional film of any kind for that matter. There is no 3 part structure, instead there is boot camp and combat. Before 'Nam and during 'Nam. The scenes that work as asides, like the lament for ""handjob"" and the hooker scene adds nice diversion and humor to the stark <br/><br/>There is no showy, ""look at me"" camera shaking. The steady cam work is clean and when there is some shake, its very subtle. All too often lately in war movies, the directors have gone wild with over-cranking and wild hand-held camera shake. The tracking scenes of Ermy in the early scenes are so powerful simply because its not about the movement of the camera, but the performance of the actor.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is not about Vietnam per se. It is not just about war per se. It is not Platoon and it is not Saving Private Ryan. This is a good thing, because as good as those movies are in their own ways, Full Metal Jacket is better. This is not a film about war, or battle scenes, it is a film about people. It feels both real and surreal. The quiet death of Cowboy holds power precisely because there is no overpowering score or heroic framing to push the emotion to us. We feel for cowboy because he felt like a friend, not simply a character in a war movie that has his turn to die. While people constantly assail Stanley Kubrick for being cold in his approach to humanity, I think these critics have only their self to blame. His films and characters always have emotions on the screen. The Kubrick stare alone justifies my point. If you don't find emotion in a Kubrick film, then the place the emotion is lacking is in you.<br/><br/>At the end, Joker's resolution is not that he has lived and learned. He has not come to warn us of his tale. Instead, Joker marches with his fellow Marines free of fear and content with simply being alive. If you cannot watch Full Metal Jacket and feel something, then maybe Titanic is a film for you."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","0","0","6 February 2006"," Not a film of two halves (spoilers throughout)
","Most people see Full Metal Jacket as a film of two halves. They see the two different parts (before and after training) as pieces that don't fit. But they do, because the film is about how an ordinary person becomes a killer, and the film simply wouldn't function with either section missing.<br/><br/>One of the most telling things is that at the beginning Joker says that he wants to kill. Obviously, as his John Wayne impression illustrates, he's grown up on films and their idea of war and machismo. Therefore it's quite understandable that Joker wants a piece of the action. He even says that he wants to be the first kid on his street to get a confirmed kill. Well, through most of the film Joker is a relatively passive figure. He gets to see other people come apart at the seams and he gets to see other Marines kill, but he never really takes part. But then at the end he finally gets his wish to become a killer. He executes an enemy sniper. But as the film shows, it's not really that fun. Joker even looks rather appalled as his fellow Marines make jokes. This in itself would be a dark ending, but instead the film ends with Joker happily singing the Mickey Mouse Club song with his fellow soldiers. It suggests that his revulsion is temporary and that now he's finally become part of the club. He's finally got his wish and become a killer. But at what price? <br/><br/>Even though I mentioned that Joker really doesn't take part in things until towards the end, there is one notable exception  the part where he beats Pyle. Up until this point, Joker has tried to be helpful. He's tried to educate the dim-witted Private. But when the platoon gets punished for Pyle's mistakes, Joker finally snaps. He lays into Pyle with more venom than anyone else. And then as Pyle screams in agony, Joker can only cover his ears. It's a great scene as it shows how split Joker is; how he's capable of violence but how he also abhors it. And it's the point at which Hartman finally turns Joker into a Marine. He's finally put a dent in Joker's humanity.<br/><br/>But that scene's also the point at which Pyle snaps. Before he and Joker were friends, in Joker he had a person he trusted. In fact, Joker almost acts like Pyle's dad  he makes his bed and even dresses him. But once he's beaten by the one person he trusted, the feeble-minded but innocent kid is turned into a stone cold killer. And rather inevitably, he focuses his rage on the source of his pain: Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. And Pyle's final scene is rather chilling. Hartman finally succeeds in turning the kid into a killer, but the programming has gone haywire and he ends up getting killed along with Pyle.<br/><br/>But even though Hartman is a rather dastardly figure, I can't help but feel sorry for him. As he says, his job is to turn these maggots into Marines and weed out non-hackers. Therefore there's no room for politeness and hugs and pats on the head. The whole act of training an ordinary person into a Marine is an act of violence (one probably just as violent as war) but it can't be any other way, and Hartman is just doing his job. So there's no feeling of joy when Hartman gets killed. It's just an unfortunate incident  some people just can't take the programming; these things happen.<br/><br/>Still on the subject of that scene, there's one little detail that I like. Pyle turns the gun on Joker but he turns it away when Joker calls him by his real name (Leonard). It seems that all Pyle wants is to be recognised as a person  the person he really is. And there's a bit earlier on when Pyle ignores Hartman when he calls him by his adopted name. Then when he's asked a second time he screams ""Sir, yes, sir!"" at the top of his lungs. He's not going to take it anymore. He hates what he's been turned into.<br/><br/>But maybe Pyle does himself a favour by taking his own life, as none of the Marines in the field seem particularly happy with their lot. Joker is stuck with reporting on the war and he has to endure his government's rampant propaganda (like today there's a fixation on words and terms  'drag marks', 'blood trails', 'sweep and clear' instead of 'search and destroy'), a gunner blows away civilians with a big grin on his face, a soldier dies for a hand-job and in a series of interviews the squad gets all their grievances off their chest. It's clear that these kids have been killed, maimed and destroyed for nothing. They've been sacrificed for some ridiculous political agenda.<br/><br/>There are quite a few scenes where the soldiers express the pointlessness and futility of the war. They realise that they're not fighting for freedom. But still, when death is always an immediate concern, the only outlet is in racism, sex and killing.<br/><br/>The scenes with the hookers (like the scenes with Hartman) are darkly comic, but they're also depressing affairs. The soldiers' only reprieve is in a joyless lay. And then there are all the racist jokes  both at the expense of the Vietnamese and the black soldiers. This is what all the programming has been for. All the humanity has been drained out of these kids and their basic instincts drawn out so that they can kill with greater efficiency. And it's telling that at the end the only thing that unites the formless squad is 'payback'. Only when they're killing do they act as one and only when they're killing do they feel contented. The training was a success."

","An excellent film concerning war as a phenomenon in it's own right. What is so good about this film is that it makes no statement about war, it just presents it to you. Here we have Kubrick completely ignoring generic and traditional dramatic structure, as he sticks his neck out yet again to present one of the most uncompromising dramatic forms ever shot. It is brilliant.<br/><br/>We follow ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine) throughout the course of the movie, starting at boot camp and moving into Vietnam itself. We are not given any inside information in the film - we know and understand less than the characters themselves. All we know is, through the claustrophobia of the training barracks, that there is a war out there somewhere and that these soldiers will fight against something. Even the narration (provided by Modine) is empty and robotic, unlike the journal-esqu readings of ""Platoon"".<br/><br/>We see their meaningless and detached involvements, and can not help but feel shut-out from even the most basic elements of the entire Vietnam conflict. All actions are amplified as we are so close in (yet paradoxically, so removed) to the platoon/squad that the big picture and any perspective is completely distorted and even lost. The enemy is portrayed as invisible, un-killable and even mythical - and when they are revealed at close-quarters, the futility and lawlessness of war and human behaviour is hammered home. Multiple viewings are highly recommended, however not necessary."

","There seem to be a handful of War flicks made, but most of them aren't that great. I didn't much care for Hamburger Hill, The Big Red One, We Were Soldier, Windtalkers and 1941 with a passion, but loved Saving Private Ryan, Platoon and Apocalypse Now. The last four are probably the only war films made I'd praise as brilliant, but the rest are filled to the brim with tired clichés. 'Full Metal Jacket' was the most recent war film I've seen, and I really didn't know what to expect. Coming from the extraordinarily talented Stanley Kubrick I felt it would be engrossing and captivating as his other masterworks, but I wasn't entirely sure. You see, critics really rammed 'Full Metal Jacket' as being nothing more then mediocre. The critics praised all of Kubrick's other films, even 'Eyes Wide Shut' which I found to be so devastatingly average, uninventive and in poor taste. I felt if film critics dare to put down the man himself, the film has got to be terrible. Well, when those end credits started to energetically roll to The Rolling Stones' 'Painted Black' I realized I had witnessed one of the finest war movies ever created, and definitely the funniest. 'Full Metal Jacket' is a well-written, nicely acted and superbly directed electrifying jolt of energy that will wake you up and get your attention like a soldering iron to the head!<br/><br/>'Full Metal Jacket' follows Private J.T. 'Joker' Davis (Mathew Modine - Pacific Heights) and his journey through the long, tough and harsh conditions the Vietnam war had to offer. The first half of the film deals with him in military boot camp, under the supervision of perhaps cinema's most and biggest loud mouth army guy, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey - Mississippi Burning). He and the other soldiers in training, including Private Cowboy (Arliss Howard - Tequila Sunrise) and the fat, silly and certifiably violently insane Private Leonard Lawrence, or how Sergeant Hartman calls him - Private Gomer Pyle. For the first half of the two hour film, the story follows the soldiers as the try to survive both psychically and mentally through the harsh and merciless training of Sergeant Hartman. The film then transitions to about a year later, where we find Private Joker working as a war photographer along side his close friend Private Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard - Alien Nation). As a war photographer, Joker and Rafterman experience hardships when they get caught in the middle of a dangerous series of battles involving cadets such as the smart-ass Private Eightball (Dorian Harewood - Sudden ) and the tough and bigoted 'Animal Mother' played by 'The Inside''s Adam Baldwin (who by the way is of no relation to Alec, Stephen, Daniel or Billy). <br/><br/>'Full Metal Jacket' is blackly funny, philosophical and heart-breaking all at the same time, a task that really couldn't be done by anyone else besides the incredible Stanley Kubrick. This is Kubrick's war film and although it isn't his best work, it was definitely good enough for me. Stanley Kubrick deserved an Academy Award for his powerful, effective and uncompromising vision molding this short story into a stunning and impassioned motion picture that will be remembered as one of the great war films. Don't get me wrong, 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't nearly as consequential or remarkable as say 'Clockwork Orange', '2001' or 'Dr. Strangelove', the movie, although brilliant, has it's number of flaws. The first half of the film is near-perfect, but the second half drags significantly until the final vigorous, aggressive and powerful fifteen minutes. The acting is strong for the most part, with a satisfying lead performance by Mathew Modine. Dorian Harewood, Adam Baldwin and Arliss Howard are solid in all their parts, but the two stand-outs are Vincent D'Onofrio and the gnarly R. Lee Ermey. D'Onofrio is outstanding in providing us with his character's transformation from fat, silly hick farm boy to hardened and ultimately cold-blooded sociopath hungry for war . R. Lee Ermey is as hysterical as he is brilliant as the tough-as-nails foul-mouthed boot camp Sergeant from hell (the most memorably character of the film). Both Ermey and D'Onofrio deserved Academy Award nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, but unfortunately and predictably didn't get it (the Academy has always been short-sighted when it comes to Kubrick's talent and genius.) 'Full Metal Jacket' includes amazing film editing from Martin Hunter and an excellent soundtrack capturing the spirit of music of the time period.<br/><br/>While 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't Stanley Kubrick's finest production, it is certainly his most action-packed. War movie fans among Kubrick fans will enjoy this darkly funny and shockingly realistic motion picture that faultlessly paints a portrait of what the experience of fighting in Vietnam was actually like. I recommend 'Full Metal Jacket' despite it's shortcomings to anyone who doesn't mind harsh and harsh language (which especially comes spewing out of the mouth of R. Lee Ermey's crude and malicious Gunnery Sergeant Hartman). Grade: B+<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT # 174"

","FULL METAL JACKET is a great movie, but despite what the critics or other fellow users might have written, this is NOT the best Viet Nam movie. FMJ has an almost ""documentary"" like feel to it. You can pretty much cut the movie in halves; the first one being the brutal boot camp training the draftees have to go through. Lee Emrey's role as the brutal D.I. is perhaps the movie's most memorable performance. The second half is basically on-the-field action of some sorts. Don't expect bodies being hacked and maimed in a non-stop barrage of bullets and shrapnel. What we get instead is the camaraderie that exists between the soldiers, what their views are of this war (which are quite disparate!). It is during this last half that FMJ adopts a ""documentary"" feel. True, the very few combat scenes are done with the grace and excellence that Stanley Kubrik is well known for. The eerie orchestral music will remind you of THE SHINING and some ""period"" music (Sixties Pop) is thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>I haven't seen PLATOON, which many say it is THE ultimate Viet Nam War movie, but if you ask me which movie deserves that praise, I'd probably say THE KILLING FIELDS or maybe even THE DEERHUNTER. Still, FULL METAL JACKET is a very entertaining movie that views the Viet Nam war from a different perspective."

","The film ""Platoon"" brought out the worst in those who believed in their country, not knowing what actually went on in Vietnam. To quote the character Chris ""We were suppose to fight the enemy, but we wounded up fighting each other."" As an admirer of Oliver Stone, he liked realism and truth; in Stanley Kubrick's war epic, he shows the insanity, racial bigotry and what goes on in the world of a solider in Vietnam.<br/><br/>The narrator in ""Full Metal Jacket"" is Joker (Matthew Modine) a recruit, who has been stationed to a boot camp in Paris Island, South Carolina, where things have be turned for the worse. There are three stories in Full Metal Jacket: the boot camp, the actually war, and the sniper.<br/><br/>In the boot camp, we are introduced to Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) who scares off every recruit by calling them slurs, threatening them, nicknaming them based on personalities even punching them. We meet other soldiers other than Joker; we met a man from Texas nicknamed Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and a mental impaired solider named Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onifero) who is nicknamed ""Gomer Pyle"" by Hartman. I remember the conversation I had with my World History teacher Mr. MacAulay and he explained why they choose Lawrence in the war, told me that the recruits didn't care about records or who were handicapped as long as they got a bunch of young American boys to be dead soldiers.<br/><br/>Throughout the boot camp story, Hartman picks on Pvt. Pyle, as we all know that this kid shouldn't be fighting in the war but get special treatment as throughout the story, he is beaten up after screwing up on so many of the exercise and activities that go on. Later on, Pyle can't take it, as we all know that he is now suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder where his nervous system is about to break down. His anger gives him more strength to be more focus, as the drill sergeant is impressed that he is doing much better than the recruits, which leads Pyle to kill the drill instructor and himself.<br/><br/>Joker has graduated from the boot camp where he is now a journalist at Vietnam getting all the inside stories and the graphic images. In one scene he is questioned about the peace symbol he wears on his helmet and is ordered to get it off before the marines discharge him. Joker sees Cowboy (Howard) now a squad leader, who tells him the crazy stories about the war, even taking a picture of a dead Vietnamese.<br/><br/>Now we move onto the third story, the sniper. After the American soldiers have sex with a Vietnamese prostitute, they receive the wrong map as one by one, a solider is wounded where Cowboy would get shot. Joker and the remaining squad go after the sniper as we see the character change once he shoots the enemy. I feared that Joker will lose his sanity and will be like Lawrence (Pyle) where he turns against his squad.

","Long before the current wave of ""realistic"" (i.e. gritty, gory and shocking) war movies, Stanley Kubrick delivered this gem of a war movie.<br/><br/>
""Full Metal Jacket"" tells two stories: the boot camp training of a group of marines for the Vietnam war, and the actual war where we meet up again with some of the soldiers from boot camp. In terms of war movies, it's a fairly modest undertaking...there are no large-scale battles(like the beach landing in ""Saving Private Ryan"") and few action scenes. <br/><br/>Instead, Kubrick uses a series of fairly small-scale incidents and events to portray a gruesome image of war. There's no annoying flag-waving here, like in so many American movies that glorify war. There's no clear bias towards the US or Vietnam either. This movie isn't about who was right in that specific war, it's about war in general. And the message it sends is clear: war is hell, it brings up the worst in people. All in all, I think that's a far more valid view than all the heroism war movies normally throw at you.<br/><br/>
Generally, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is excellent. The cast is relatively unknown, but they all deliver very good performances, especially R. Lee Ermey as the drill sergeant of course. The movie has a very gritty and realistic feel to it, and contains very sharp dialogs, a lot of truly shocking scenes, as well as some undeniably funny ones (although the humor is admittedly very black). Like in most of Kubrick's movies the pace is a little slower than desired, but in this case that's easily forgiveable.<br/><br/>Movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Platoon"", and ""Black Hawk Down"" might initially appear to be much better and much more entertaining, but after repeated viewing, the small-scale and modest approach of ""Full Metal Jacket"" works a lot better than its more spectacular but ultimately less satisfying competitors.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of **** stars"

","( possible spoilers )<br/><br/>The 2nd half of this movie is quite good, but doesn't compare with the 1st. In fact, few sections of any movie do. Anyone who's ever experienced ""basic training"" will know what I mean :) Lee Ermey is brilliant and utterly terrifying in his role as Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann & I'm amazed (even angry) he wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar. I've heard many folks say what a wonderful job Stanley Kubrick did in recreating Vietnam just outside London. I'd agree with that, but, his version of ""Parris Island"" is excellent too. I'm sure the USMC training depot is actually an old RAF (Royal Air Force) station. Most of our RAF stations were built in the 30s and 40s and (unlike the americans) we gave them solid flat concrete roofs to protect the occupants in a surprise Luftwaffe raid. ""Not many people know that"" :) I also recognised the RAF street lights and those quaint little round windows in the brick buildings. I dunno why the basic training wasn't filmed in the USA, but that doesn't 'detract'. It was a stunning recreation. Without giving away any details, the tension in the 2nd half of the film is palpable and having a female actor play 'the sniper' was a master-stroke. I've heard that Kubrick was a perfectionist and very demanding of his actors, so I'm sure the various punches and slaps inflicted on Pile and Joker were real. Ouch !! Yeah. Excellent. My only criticism of the movie is that the characters (except for Hartmann and Pile) don't have much 'depth' to them. I never found myself rooting for Joker or hating any of the others. It's WELL worth watching."

","This is the first Staneley Kuprick's movie I've ever seen.  It is powerful. No doubt. The training of a soldier into a killing machine is vividly portrayed. The first half of the movie is filled with almost command like dialogues. Nowhere else I have seen such a vivid portrayal of a training camp. The second half is about the vietnam experience of soldiers trained in such a way. A good narration. But we could not connect the second half with the first. Hence we need fresh interests to get into the second half. When I compare the same with 'Platoon' and 'The Thin Red Line' this movie lags behind. In my rating 'The Thin Red Line' is the best war movie I've ever seen. It is philosophical and poetic.  But still don't miss this movie. Particularly if you are ambitious about becoming as a soldier to serve your country(is it really yours?) then you should watch this movie first.

","`How tall are you private?  5'9' I didn't know they stack s*@#! that high. Where you from soldier?  Texas!  Holy s*@#! only steers and queers come from Texas, and since you don't look like a steer that kind of narrows it down.' This is one of the most memorable quotes from the Stanley Kubrick film Full Metal Jacket, his only film about the Vietnam War.  Kubrick wanted to present the war as the injustice and un-winnable quagmire that it became to our country. The movie starts out by following the main characters Joker, Cowboy, and Private Pyle as they go thru basic training at the Paris Island Marine boot camp.  It is this half of the movie where the recruits are physically and psychologically broken down are re-built into trained killers who would supposedly think nothing of killing their own family if they were ordered to. R. Lee Ermey gives an all-star performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, the recruit's stern and abusive drill instructor.  Ermey was given the part by Kubrick because he had served as a Marine Corps drill instructor from 1965 to 1967 and much of what his character did was actually used by drill instructors at that time.  Not all the recruits can hack it but most do pass basic training. In the second half of the movie most of the characters have been shipped off to Vietnam and the rest of the movie follows their experiences in the 1968 Tet offensive. The characters experience the war first hand in the city of Hue, fighting the enemy street by street.  It is also reveled that the young Marines aren't valued highly by their commanders who send them out on a recon mission without any tank or air support to help them.  This scene also illustrates the fatal error of sending fresh troops on a mission that they are ill prepared to handle, and shows Cowboy's inability to be an effective leader to his squad. This movie highlights the grim irony of Vietnam and is one of the best films made by the late Stanley Kubrick. I give this movie 2 thumbs up; sadly I would have given it 3 thumbs up if I had more hands or could count big toes."

The first half is very poignant as well as funny.

","Full Metal Jacket isn't the best overall Vietnam movie but it does the best job of capturing a Marine's journey from Boot camp to the Nam. The first half of the movie, set in the Marine training barracks of Parris Island, are spellbinding in their power and raw brutality. This movie is not for the faint of heart and makes you glad you didn't join the Corps. R. Lee Ermey is perfect as Gunnery Sargent Hartman, a role he used to fill in real life. Although he has proven himself a capable actor in later roles, this is the role that put him on the map and it remains his signature and best character. Matthew Modine plays the protaganist Pvt. Joker with grace, humor and humility. Versatile actor/God Vincent D'Onofrio plays Pvt. Pyle with such skill that his performance is painful to watch at times. The rest of the supporting cast is great as well. Kubrick takes on the war genre with skill and turns out a true masterpiece. He is probably one of the greatest directors ever.

"yoyomagoo","Null","0","0","17 June 2003"," Important but flawed war film
","One of Kubrick's last films, Full Metal Jacket is revelatory and frustrating in its look at the much discussed Vietnam war. After such landmarks of war film making such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon and The Deer Hunter all discussing the vietnam war, it begs the question, ten years after the war, do we need another anti-'Nam movie? On the face of it, the answer is a resounding no, and therefore I went into the film with a certain amount of cynicism.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket tells the story of Private ""Joker"" Davis (played by Matthew Modine)through his training to become a ""killing machine"" through to the heat of combat. Originally wanting to become a reporter on the action in the war, Joker gets involved with a batallion leading to almost heartbreaking consequences. There is a famous two-part structure to this film; the first part being set at a training facility and the second part in Vietnam. This simplicity that Kubrick employs allows greater character development as the viewer's attention is diverted from getting to grips with a narrative (due to its simplicity) and therefore concentrates on the people. In this respect, it is similar to Platoon, as an everyman's view of the war. However the film is far more thematicallt complex from Oliver Stone's movie due to the more ambiguous shades of good/evil, light/dark throughout the piece.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is dominated by R.Lee Emery's foul-mouthed drill instructor giving Kubrick some intensity to play with. Therefore the first section of the movie works brilliantly as the director heaps on satire, humanity and terror. This is helped by Emery's fantastic performance. The second part of the film loses focus but is still strong. The problem with this half is that the two strongest characters (Pyle and Emery's character) do not appear here and thus the film feels formulaic. However the last ten minutes make up for it, with a showdown that rivals Apocalypse Now's final stretch.<br/><br/>Kubrick's penultimate movie is not perfect- it drags in the second half, feels a little cliched and unfocused in tone. However it is a film that should be watched- if only because it is brave enough to criticise not just the war but the people in it, too."
"rolinmoe","10","0","0","27 August 2003"," Should be shown again today
","What is amazing about Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket isn't its action sequences or its exotic locations, its plot sequence, its cinematography, score, or editing cues.  It is that no part of the film leaves your memory...everything that you see, everything that Kubrick wanted you to see, remains in your memory for the duration of the film, and in many cases, much longer.<br/><br/>I don't think many people realize just how well-acted this film is. Vincent D'Onofrio is nothing short of incredible in his performance of Pvt. Pyle, a Lenny-like character who unknowingly gets himself into trouble, and the military's lack of understanding causes trouble for all.  D'Onofrio is not a big man...many might remember his performance from The Cell and think of a massive beefcake, but D'Onofrio is the same guy who plays the squirrly detective on Law & Order: Criminal Intent.<br/><br/>As Pvt. Joker, played quite well by Matthew Modine, takes Pyle under his wing, compassionately teaching him how to succeed in the eyes of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman, we're brought to visions of Of Mice and Men, with George and Lenny and the care in that relationship, except here we begin to see Pyle succeed, and we feel good about ourselves and the world around us, seeing the underdog come from behind and become a success.  We even see small moments of kindness from Hartman, when his derogatory remarks to Pyle are tempered to show the only care allowed in the Marines.<br/><br/>
But this is not a feel-good story...this is not like a WWII movie where Evil is defeated.  In a scene out-of-nowhere, everything changes, and for the next 90 minutes, you never forget what you just saw.<br/><br/>This bothers a lot of people when it comes to the second part of the movie, but it shouldn't...it's what Kubrick wanted.  We see Pvt. Joker now in Vietnam, joking about the world around him, a complete reversal from the previous tone.  As an audience, we want to see resolution from the last part brought into this new part, but we can't...that's not how war is.  And as Joker gets deeper and deeper into war, the events on-screen don't weigh as heavily...they can't, because the evil of the situation is no longer new...we are accustomed to it.<br/><br/>Many people have a problem with the climax of the film, either that it comes too fast, that it's not as big a deal as the end of the first part of the movie, or that it seems out of flux with the rest of the film.  Yet again I point to intent.  Most movies we watch happen completely on-screen...we become a part of the action only to an extent, and when the lights come up, we feel resolved.  Kubrick makes the audience players in his films...we see actions, we react, and all of his future moves are predicated on our reactions.  They seem off-kilter because life is off-kilter...life is dirty and unforgiving, never leaving time to breathe and truly reconcile situations.  Kubrick keeps the movie going because he wants us to see just how awful war is.  And according to Full Metal Jacket, war is awful.<br/><br/>One last note...I was dismayed to find that D'Onofrio wasn't nominated for any awards for his performance as Pvt. Pyle.  However, Lee Ermey was nominated for several awards for his performance as Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. Ermey takes over the screen, bringing comedy to a scene where it doesn't seem to belong, yet remaining uncompromising at the same time.  His full-bodied portrayal of the drill sergeant is astounding, and I wouldn't be surprised if he and D'Onofrio both acted so well that they canceled each other out in the minds of the Academy.  Also, Full Metal Jacket is less than forgiving of its frank content and outlook on the military...tough to get the Academy to support something so brutally honest."

","Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam war is typically chilling and idiossyncratic, following a Marine platoon from basic training at Parris Island to actual combat during the Tet offensive; but it's the training sequences (the film's first half) that everyone remembers, thanks to the superb performances of Lee Ermey as the brutal drill instructor sergeant and Vincent d'Onofrio as the ""odd man out"" that he picks on and eventually leads to a violent breakdown (Ermey was an actual Marine instructor and had originally been hired as the film's technical advisor - then Kubrick got the inspired idea of casting him in the role). The film's muted reception wasn't helped by its timing - after ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Platoon"", it didn't seem at the time as if Kubrick had put a new spin on the subject. With hindsight, however, the film is as harrowing as any of its predecessors, tracing as it does the de-humanisation of the soldier, his transformation into a killing machine, and following it to its logical conclusion, the war theatre, to see how it all turns out (not surprisingly, the only soldier whose real name we are told instead of its military handle is the only one that never makes it through the training). Majestically directed and photographed, and surprisingly shot entirely on British locations."

","In 'Full Metal Jacket', Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam War, no easy answers are given.  This isn't a simple tale of men in war - it's a tale of how men become warriors, how they detach themselves from humanity and reality in order to deal with the worst horrors they'll ever see, and how some of them can't make it through that.<br/><br/>Powerfully acted by a group of mostly no-names at the time (though some have gone on to bigger and better things, like Vincent D'Onofrio, Matthew Modine, and R. Lee Ermey), the film starts off in boot camp.  There, Drill Sergeant Hartmann (played with great venom and bluster by Ermey) proceeds to dehumanize the recruits and turn them into the proud, killing-machine Marines they need to be.  Ermey has all the best lines in the film - most of them unprintable here (check out the quote section) - as he continually berates and belittles the new Marines, all the while shaping their mentalities for the war they'll be shipped off to.  Some don't fare as well as others, as Private Pyle (D'Onofrio) has a memorable meltdown as the film bridges from basic training to Vietnam itself.<br/><br/>There, Private Joker (Modine), working as a military journalist, finds himself the center of several nasty and brutal scrapes shortly after the Tet Offensive.  The scenes here aren't Hollywood polish - they're gritty, confusing, and seemingly random - just like real war.  The climax of the film culminates in a bombed out shell of a city, where the squad has to deal with the threat of a VC sniper and the uncertainty of a broken chain of command.<br/><br/>Kubrick creates a harsh and realistic view of war here, one that wouldn't easily be matched on screen for several years. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a different kind of movie altogether.  'Blackhawk Down' is probably the closest, and owes a lot of its battle-scene staging to this film.  Private Joker's continual John Wayne impressions send a clear signal that this is not your standard John Wayne-esque war movie, with clear heroes and clean victories.  Vietnam was a messier war, and the single goal of most men sent there was simple:  Get out alive.<br/><br/>'Full Metal Jacket' is a very powerful war movie, and probably has a good argument towards being the best Vietnam film ever made."
"chthon2","10","0","0","24 February 2003"," Excellent View of Dehumanization
","Full Metal Jacket, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is usually thought of as being two segments, although I have read here on IMDb (from the trivia section and other reviewers) that it is a three-part movie: boot camp, the Tet Offensive, and a struggle against an unseen sniper.  The first segment focuses on the conflict between the troops' drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and the tall and overweight Private Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), with Private J.T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine, the film's lead) as a bystander to this.  We then see Joker in a new troop covering the Tet Offensive for Stars & Stripes, and see how he doesn't quite fit in.  The third part follows the troops as they struggle against a sniper, ending the film with a rather intense scene.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is one of those directors who make a career out of making movies which are ""different""; this is not the typical Vietnam film.  The focus of the movie is not action, and consequently, the average idiot moviegoer will probably find this film ""boring"", because they are forced to think.  There are three main plot points for each section: dehumanization, the duality of man, and the physical conflict of war.  Much like Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, Full Metal Jacket lacks the fake non-stop action of other war films because, as most veterans will tell you, war isn't like Saving Private Ryan.  It's subdued; an entire battle may go on for two hours and only a few shots are fired.  Most of the time is spent in trenches, flat on your stomach trying to not get shot.  The battle with the sniper is dead-on to the gritty, drawn out, plodding nature of most battles, and done quite well.<br/><br/>The performances are all around good.  Matthew Modine is adequate in his breakthrough role, although I must say, he looked pretty scrawny here compared to how he is now; he must have just been a kid.  R. Lee Ermey gives by far the best performance ever of a drill instructor, although that could be because he wasn't performing; he was a Marine drill instructor for years, and was not allowed to fraternize with the other actors during the filming of this movie, probably so they would still be afraid of him.  A definite honorable mention goes to Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother; although playing a moronic dunderhead may seem easy, there are many examples of actors trying and going way off the mark.  And, of course, we all remember Vincent D'Onofrio's scary performance as the recruit driven to insanity.  He gained 75 pounds for this role, which could distract some from his excellent performance.<br/><br/>""I AM...in a world...of sh*t."""

Put shortly, this has to be, without one single little doubt, one of the greatest films (war or regular) of all time.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket's plot revolves around boot camp patrons such as J.T. `Joker' Davis (Matthew Modine), Leonard `Gomer Pyle' Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Private Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard) as they go through the living hell of boot camp, led by the fiery Sgt. Hartman (real-life boot camp instructor R. Lee Ermey). Hartman spares no mercy for any of the recruits, but he mostly takes his ferocity and vulgar out on Lawrence because of his struggles and his weight. Things keep getting worse for him, and he gets into more and more trouble with Hartman. However, with the help of Joker, Gomer improves his skills and earns more respect from their explosive trainer. But after all of the recruits have graduated and have been assigned, Joker finds Gomer sitting in the bathroom loading a rifle magazine late at night, even though they're not allowed in there. He has become darker in personality during the training course, and when Hartman comes in and orders Lawrence to drop the rifle, he shoots him and himself.<br/><br/>
After boot camp, the movie then focuses on Joker as he starts his tenure in the Vietnam War as a reporter. Joker is sent with other troops such as `Animal Mother' (Adam Baldwin) and Pvt. Eightball (Dorian Harewood) on brutal and heart-pounding missions in Vietnam, including one where he and a small band of troops seek a dangerous sniper amidst a bombed and rubble-laden city. It's scenes like these that leave a lasting impression on you, and when the movie ends you'll be thinking, `Wow. That just blew my mind.' The hilarious and scathing dialogue is some of the best you'll ever hear when it comes to movies.  For example (please excuse some of the language):<br/><br/>Hartman: `How tall are you private?' Private Cowboy: `Sir, five-foot-nine, sir!' Hartman: `Five-foot-nine? I didn't know they stacked s*** that high.'<br/><br/>Hartman: `Were you born worthless, or did you have to work at it?'<br/><br/>Joker: `Leonard, if Hartman finds us here we'll be in a world of s***.'<br/><br/>Gomer: `I am in a world of s***.'<br/><br/>Hartman: `What's your name fat-body?' Gomer: `Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!' Hartman: `Lawrence? Lawrence what? Of Arabia?'<br/><br/>
What more is there to say? Why, Stanley Kubrick deserved every shred of appraisal he received for this incredible masterpiece. Like in most of his films, there are no clichés, predictable outcomes, or likely story lines. It's a different kind of war movie, and it shines like a thousand diamonds. It just has to be seen to be believed. <br/><br/>Hopefully by now I have implied a sense that this film kicks butt. Even though Apocalypse Now is currently the best war movie in my book, this still has to be considered a contender for that title. So go ahead and give it a whirl. You won't be disappointed one bit. <br/><br/>**** out of *****"

","I got one thing to say...Kubrick!...If you are a big fan of cinematography and the art of a movie than any Kubrick movie will do but this one i one of his better ones next to Shining and Eyes Wide Shut. This is by far the most real war movie you will ever watch next to Saving Private Ryan. The training camp beginning is an excellent way to start out a movie. It has its unexpected twists but it is one great movei that you should not miss. Vincent D'Onofrio does another well performance. Baldwin and Modine also are excellent in the film. Amongst most of the war films this one should be one of your favorites."

","Full Metal Jacket is definitely one of Kubrick's best. It portrays the dark comedy that was present in the days of Vietnam in a way most other Vietnam films barely hint at. Although quite funny in its own way, Full Metal Jacket is still quite poignant and does a great job of making the audience feel for the soldiers and the ordeals they must face, like being baited with an injured friend's suffering at the hands of a sniper and not being able to guess the amount of enemy troops that await you and your friends around the next corner."

","You can't look at this movie as a straight war movie.  There are no huge combat scenes, it isn't set in the jungle, there aren't any technical war terms.  The way to look at this movie is as a SATIRE of war.  It is a movie about human nature during war.  About the duality of man.  (spoiler) I think it becomes obvious when the climax of the film is the killing of a young vietnamese girl rather than thousands of NVA or VC soldiers.  It isn't a war movie, don't watch it as if it is one."

All the phrases, comments, and  abuse come straight out of MC Boot Camp.<br/><br/>The movie description mentioned a ""sadistic"" Drill Instructor. I kept waiting for the ""sadistic"" part. This was very real to life.<br/><br/>The only problems were you NEVER use ""I"", you would never be able to smuggle food back to the barracks, and you would never be in possession of ammunition, all which Pyle did. Of course, then there wouldn't have been a story. Also, helmets weren't instituted during pugel stick training until the mid-70's, when a lawsuit was brought against the MC by parents of a boot who ended up in the hospital with possible brain damage from a pugel stick upside the head.<br/><br/>For the unintiated: The Navy has SAILORs, The Army has SOLDIERs, the Air Force has AIRMEN, and the Marine Corps has MARINEs. It is the ONLY branch that lends it's name to it's personnel. There are no Drill Sergeants in Boot training, but there are Drill Instructors. You never used the word ""you"" with a Drill Instructor, because they translate it to ""ewe"" which is a female sheep. Your poorly used ""you"" during Boot Camp would result in the Drill Instructor asking if you wanted to f*$@ him.

","This is one of the best war movies I have ever saw.  Kubrick is such a great director.  His choice of songs gives you an almost eerie feeling.  If you have watched any of his other you movies you know what I'm talking about. The movies has two parts, basically.  The first part takes place in boot camp on Parris Island, NC.  To me, this is my favorite part.  Vincent D'Onofrio's performance is excellent.  You hate him sometimes, other times you just have this deep sympathy for him.  He tries so hard to fit in. Matthew Modine's performance is equally remarkable as a highly intelligent wise-ass.  The end of the first half will leave you stunned.  But if you payed attention, you almost see it coming.  Now the second part.  The way it begins is priceless.  Matthew Modine's character is still a big part here. But, you see a change in him.  It seems as if he didn't realize what he was getting into.  Adam Baldwin has a great presence here.  He portrays the person you'd want to be stuck half-way around the world in a war with. The way the movie ends is a little ironic but it makes you feel better about what happened throughout the rest of the second part.  Wonderful movie as only Kubrick could have done."
"simcof","Null","0","0","3 November 2002"," Brief Comments *Slight Spoiler Warning*
","This film blew me away. As the other reviews have said, FMJ follows the story of Private Joker from Boot Camp to the war.<br/><br/>I won't talk about the first half of the film as there are already enough reviews talking about it.<br/><br/>The second half of this film is terribly underrated. From an artificial perspective its basically a series of events meant to shock the viewer into understanding the horror of war, but there is a lot more going on.<br/><br/>*Slight Spoiler Warning*<br/><br/>Kubrick sets up a number of really haunting scenes. One of the best examples of this is when one of the marines asks for a photograph to be taken of him and his VC friend. The friend lies pale and dead with a hat over his head. The soldier remarks to the effect: ""When the wars over and we've blown all these guys up, their ain't gonna be anyone worth shooting no more"".<br/><br/>
Another scene that worked really well because of how overt it was. A marine in a helicopter is picking off a bunch of civilians. There is small dialogue exchanged between him and Joker which ends with the marine relaying the old proverb: ""War sure is hell, ain't it?"". That scene really put forward the whole desentisation/insanity that a lot of the soldiers experienced during a war where the only motivation most of the soldiers had was the propoganda the US government sold them."

R Lee Emery makes the films first half as the sadistically harsh drill instructor who is also matched by Vincent D'onofrio who's performance as Private Pile must be the best of his career. Then we are thrust into the war with Matthew Modine leading the way as the journalist who sports a peace badge as well as a rifle ironically named Joker. Beckton gas works on the outskirts of London provides the setting of the war torn town and a good job it makes of it to. As with Clockwork Orange the soundtrack is spot on as are the locations and cast mentioned above.

Normally, I wouldn't base a score of 10/10 on just the first minutes of the film, but, those minutes are THAT DAMN GOOD.<br/><br/>Without the first half hour, the movie would just be another mindless, shoot-em-up, military movie.  But, with it, it shows what torture the armed forces had to deal with in basic training, especially before the 1970s. R.

","He did it again.  Another great movie by Stanley Kubrick.  The best part about Kubrick's films is his characters.  You gotta love them, whether it's a group of hoodlums that rape and beat people for no reason, or a spaceship that declares mutiny.  In Full Metal Jacket Kubrick introduces yet another great character, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  Played by Lee Ermey, GS Hartman is depicted as an a**hole for the most part.  The first time you see him in the movie, he does not hesitate to dish out insults and beat his recruits.  Ermey plays his role flawlessly.  Although you realize you would be scared to death if this GS Hartman was training you, you love watching him do it to other people.  His insults are hilarious, and poetic at times. <br/><br/>     The second half of the movie takes place at Vietnam.  Although GS Hartman is not in the second half of the movie, it does not mean the movie goes downhill.  During the ""war"" half of the movie, every negative aspect of war is depicted (not that there are any positive aspects).  Kubrick makes the audience laugh one minute then makes them feel disturbed the next (thats war). Full Metal Jacket is my favorite war movie and one of my favorite movies of all time.

"Herr Nosferatu","Null","0","0","9 September 2002"," Ain't war hell ?!??!! Ah hahahahaha...
","I won't go into details about the plot, I assume with all other reviews of this film, you got the gist of it... <br/><br/>I will however attempt to go through details which make this film one of the most fearsomely authentic and majestic experiences captured by a single man's uncanny vision.<br/><br/>Using the camera as a window into the human experience, Stanley Kubrick was among the (very) few directors to truly capture the human psyche as a rich and complex whole... <br/><br/>As some of you may know, Kubrick began his extraordinary odyssey as a director by first being a freelance photographer for Look magazine, a path which transpires on this film...<br/><br/>In this feature, he amazingly captured the loss of innocence, as a singular part of men, but also as a much grander totality of society...<br/><br/>
I just want to mention one striking scene to justify my phrase, the hair cut sequence. <br/><br/>These men arrive at a barber and get shaven, you clearly see their curiosity, fear and quest for adventure in their faces, unknowing what kind of hell they've embarked upon. It is a very powerful message as to how, as much as a singular part of -these- men, but as well as the Americans in foreign settings, how innocent and inexperienced they truly are... They send men to die in conflicts that don't affect or concern them.<br/><br/>And Kubrick uses a very strong metaphor to imply that idea, the hair itself represents innocence... One becomes comfortable with his hair, it is his identity, a way to differentiate himself from his fellow man.<br/><br/>Kubrick takes that away as a symbolic image in the way the system (militarily speaking) takes off your image, your true self, by shaving off the seemingly only way to truly distinct yourself from others...<br/><br/>From there, the cleansing begins... <br/><br/>In the following time period, a sort of routine sets in. Stanley is able to create a sense of relative normalcy in the first part of the picture, the men are together, at home, in America. As unpleasant and awkward as it seems, they get in a feeling of acceptance that this is what they came for, an adventure. <br/><br/>But something goes wrong in the plan <br/><br/>It is interesting to see the wide depth of knowledge or understanding the film's director had on human beings. As in 2001 and throughout all his career, Kubrick drew a picture to see humans as a mechanical tool of some greater force (A theme completely and brilliantly achieved in the haunting masterpiece, Eyes Wide Shut..) <br/><br/>This film is no exception to the quest. Man is an ultimate machine and is on a continuous journey to the ultimate truth, but as it goes, some flaws occur. As the characters come and go, the one being who appears as the most out of place is perhaps the most honest portrayal of man. With a mind blowing zoom-in on the face of Gomer Pyle, we see the absolute control of the situation, both within the plot and cinematically, and a complete loss of inner power all at once...<br/><br/>And this brings up to the next and somewhat lesser appreciated chapter of this film. The linear effect of the days in training is a way to amplify the chaotic mess that was the Vietnam war fiasco. It seems that few appreciates the second part of the film. To me it shows the true genius of the man who captured it, Stanley. <br/><br/>I would like to paraphrase a quote from a lesser impressive film, but with an interesting phrase nonetheless. From Vanilla Sky; 'without the bitter, the sweet isn't as sweet...'<br/><br/>Notice the stability of Parris, and the stark contrast it has with Vietnam.<br/><br/>Instead of the camera on wheels, he practically always uses a steadicam. In the process, it works as both extreme realism technically speaking, and another brilliant metaphorical aspect. One which clearly displays the instability of the geographical, political, social and more importantly, the psychological setting these young boys are in. <br/><br/>It is a much more impressive part of the film to me, because it shows the truly devastating aspects of war on its combatants at large, the pattern of instability which soon has total control over the men. I can see that the phrase, bitter/sweet, is seen here. I meant to say that one important aspect of the way we see Vietnam in the film is a much broader and lesser defined whole than America. But it is clearly as important in the picture he tried to take of the history. <br/><br/>We made a definable observation in the training, we understand the way things go, much like a prison, it has a tendency. Whereas in Vietnam, or any war theater for that matter, they're is no tendency. And that is ultimately how this film succeeds in showing. The unpredictability and challenges of combat. I worship films such as Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red Line, or The Longest Day for showing a wide range of how one can capture war, but it seems no film comes nearly as close to capturing the factual thing. It was fascinating to see how, in Apocalypse, war is seen with a breathtaking lyrical sense. But not here The Longest day, a masterpiece, showed war with an acute sense of patriotism, which is good for the way it was presented in history, but FMJ makes none of that, quite the opposite in fact...<br/><br/>There is no concessions here, what you see is what you get. The brutal honesty is what blows me apart in this film. No big explosions, no dramatic music at key moments, no heroism, just war.<br/><br/>I love this part more as well for the following, it allows an opportunity to see Kubrick, the photographer, the artist, in action. Granted, the entire film wraps like a documentary, but in the way he captured Vietnam, it is much more so The bleak light, the austere empty city, the long pauses of dreadful silences, it is an example of how Stanley Kubrick went against the stream of Hollywood as a director, never allowing any chance for relief or entertainment, he presents his view of what went wrong, why did the Americans lose the war, why they're so disliked abroad, the structure of the film goes against conformity. No one in history ever had the guts to do that, and that itself is a huge mark of honor !"

","That's right. If something happens in a film and you find it so outrageous that you want to get up off the coach, reach through the screen and hit someone has done its job (unless it's a Pauly Shore movie, in which case you want to hit the producer).<br/><br/>Seriously, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is probably Stanley Kubrick's best film. It's based on a novel called ""The Short Timers"" and is told in three parts, although most people think of it as two halves. The title refers to the hard metal casing surrounding the soft lead core of the bullets used in the M-16's and M-14's the Marines used in Vietnam. It's also an allegory, described the hard shells that are molded around soft, impressionable young men when they become killers as impersonal as a bullet during war.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is easily the best. Young recruits arrive at bootcamp, get their heads shaved and meet the drill sergeant (played to perfection by R. Lee Ermey, a then-recently retired real life Marine drill instructor). He curses at them and screams at them, assigning them goofball names that describe their personalities while dehumanizing them. The chief recruits here are Private Joker (Matthew Modine), who is here mostly because he doesn't want to join the Army; Private Cowboy (Arliss Howard, who's here because he wants to be), and Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio, who doesn't have a clue about life off the farm and is in for a rude awakening). Watching these ""numb nuts"" get turned into emotionless killing machines is quite disturbing at times. Even outrageous, although it is based on real Marine Corps training doctrine. Take, for instance, the marksmanship scene where R. Lee Ermey highlights Charles Whitman, who shot several people from the tower at the University of Texas, and Lee Harvey Oswald, who allegedly shot a mobile JFK from the sixth floor of a book depository. He then asks where both men got their marksmanship training -- the Marine Corps, as if he really wanted to glorify these guys just because they were Marines. Watching that, I wanted to reach through the TV and joke Ermey.<br/><br/>Part two follows Joker to Vietnam. Many people think the movie went downhill from here, but it is an essential part of the movie. Joker and his fellow Marines were trained to be killers, but they were trained to fight an old war. America was used to wars like Korea and World War II where you had a clearly defined enemy and clearly defined battlefields. Instead, we get men sitting around doing nothing, waiting to go into battle the next day like going to the office. Vietnamese women sell themselves openly while young Vietnamese men wait to either steal cameras or shoot GIs. Joker talks like he's ready for combat, but when the Tet Offensive opens in 1968 and he has to man a machine gun to protect his base, he finds out he's not ready. It's eerie to watch the Marines when they have to retake Hue City. They actually look happy as they mass up and walk behind tanks because the war is finally looking like what they had been trained for -- a straight up fight between two armies. The most interesting part of this section of the film is where a TV crew interviews Marines. Some of the comments are ordinary, some are profound and some are just plain boastful, if not moronic (if you watch some of the reality-based TV shows today, you'll understand).<br/><br/>The third and final section of the film depicts the biggest battle of Vietnam -- how it really changed the men fighting it. Joker hooks back up with Cowboy as he is leading his squad to an old part of Hue City where military intelligence thinks some enemy soldiers are holed up. The squad is ambushed and several members are killed. The squad shoots up an entire building in response, but don't hit the sniper. The harrowing scene has Dorian Harewood lying wounded in the open as the sniper shoots holes in him trying to lure his buddies out of hiding (John Wayne's ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" hinted at this scenario and ""Saving Private Ryan"" copied it). It's almost repulsive to see American soldiers cowering when one of their own is in need of help, but this is the reality of war. Later, when the surviving squad members finally get up the courage to hunt down the sniper, we get to see the true effect of war. Joker is trying to maintain his sense of morality while the other squad members are eager for revenge. Kubrick was trying to show the real tragedy of Vietnam in that most of the soldiers were not like Joker. They were hardened and haunted by war, but when it was all over, you knew they would be sent straight back into society (Think of Sylvester Stallone's Rambo in ""First Blood"" who wanders around homeless and aimless because Col. Trautman trained him for war, but not for peace).<br/><br/>The camera work of the film is great, especially the choppy style that gives us a bird's-eye view as soldiers run for cover. Kubrick never tries to overwhelm us, just show us the truth. The movie has been hailed by many critics as the best war movie ever made and I agree, although ""Das Boot"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are close. It is not an anti-war movie, per se, because it just shows what really went on in training and during the war. It doesn't take sides, like, say, John Wayne's unabashedly patriotic ""The Green Berets"" (which, by the way, inadvertently, showed the futility of combat in Vietnam during the camp attack scene).<br/><br/>Overall, I rate this 9/10. Too bad Kubrick died with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" as his last film. Hopefully, people will remember ""Full Metal Jacket"" instead."

It's one of the three best war movies I have seen, the others being Das Boot and Saving Private Ryan. It's not an anti-war movie per se, meaning that it doesn't carry any misguided pacifist message (neither do the other two movies i mentioned). A good war movie, in my opinion, doesn't really deal with the question of whether war is good or bad, it deals with portraying the reality of fighting in a war as a soldier. And from that, anyone with a brain can deduce what war is for the men fighting - horror. I don't think anyone needs a movie to tell them that huge masses of men shooting each other to death is bad. Wars have their reasons, some of them need to be fought. The merits of the Vietnam war are of course very much up for debate, but this movie doesn't take part in that debate.<br/><br/>What it does is show the experiences of young men drafted into a war, it shows how military training tries to shape machines out of human beings, and it shows how those men/machines react in a combat situation. The first half is more watchable, yes, but I think the fact that the second part in Vietnam is really disjointed and patchy is actually very crucial - Joker finds himself through the training, he's now a trained killing machine. He, and the audience expect action. What Kubrick delivers is chaos, men sitting around one moment, then fighting and killing the next, never clear on the reason, never reaching catharsis. I really really doubt a perfectionist of the order of Kubrick would simply let a movie 'slip', as some have said. I think this is how it was meant to be.

","The big difference between the Final Fantasy:The Spirits Within DVD and the Full Metal Jacket DVD is that the former contains tons of bonuses to mask the fact that it's a poor film while Full Metal Jacket has just a trailer as a bonus but it's infinitely better.<br/><br/>One of the best films about the horrors of Vietnam and probably one of the finest anti-war films ever made, Full Metal Jacket (a term for a fully loaded gun) is the story of Private Joker (Matthew Modine), a budding journalist who enlists and goes to Vietnam to fight the most hellish war American soldiers ever dealt with.<br/><br/>The film is split into three acts. First comes Marine Boot Camp at Parris Island, N.C. , where Lee Ermey delivers a superb performance as Sgt. Gunnery Hartman, a poetically profane Drill Sgt. who is abusive to all in his corp, especially on the nicknamed Pvt. Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) who slowly goes insane from all the abuse. Act two is Vietnam action, showing in non-sensationalistic form the horrors and strife. Act three is where a squad with Joker is faced with an ambush caused by a nasty sniper, and the decisions made by the squad to get revenge for the deaths of several soldiers due to the sniper.<br/><br/>Superbly acted by a fine cast and produced and directed by the fine director Stanley Kubrick, Full Metal Jacket delivers in spades the horrors of war. There's no doubt that this movie, alongside Apocalypse Now, shows the hellish nature of Vietnam than any other, including Platoon.

"Jawa11182","10","0","0","2 June 2002"," Full Metal Jacket, One Of The Best War Movies
","Full Metal Jacket, is one of the best war movies.  The director Stanley Kubrick is a master at movie making.  This movie is not only brilliant but also emotional because it is, of course, about war.  The movie is like two movies put into one.  The first half is when the men go into training and the second part is when they go to the Vietnam War.  The tracking shots were a very big part of the movie because it felt like you were actually in the war with the American soldiers.  The acting of Matthew Modine (Joker) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Private Pyle)is superb.  The scene with the men walking on the field at night singing the Mickey Mouse Club Song is brilliantly thought up of and brilliantly made.  I gave this movie a 10 because let's face it, it was THAT good."
"mike_76","10","0","0","25 May 2002"," a great war film, if not the best ever made
","From the dehumanizing of boot camp, to the battered cities of Viet Nam, the viewer follows a compassionate Pvt. Joker. Through this dark journey, and with Kubrick's ability to control absolutely everything to fit the film, he creates a highly detailed and realistic war atmosphere. Not only does Kubrick create in rich detail the ""world of s**t"" that soldiers live in, he puts you right there with them. Kubrick creates the enveloping sensation of being there as few Directors can. Beginning with the training and on to the real thing, you are the soldier. The action is highly satisfying, and as a bonus in this genre of movies, the film is also thematically pleasing. Kubrick's film-making genius allows him to make a war movie which greatly bypasses the usual substance one finds in such a film. Most movies in this genre will present the viewer with a basic ""war is hell"" theme, and back it up with loud, violent combat action. In Full Metal Jacket Stanley Kubrick looks, as he usually does, deeper into the human disposition. In this case, war's true affect on human nature.  With Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick takes the highly controversial events of the Viet Nam war, and portrays it in a way to show us the things which we often wish to ignore. Although, with all the dark images presented, Kubrick still leaves the viewer with a grateful view of life. Kubrick, as has been said many times before, is genius."

I believe you can only think the 2nd half is slow if your idea of war is a game of Quake deathmatch. In real life, it's not kill, kill, die, respawn. When you die, it's for good. If you can't wait when your CO tells you to wait, you'll be dead.

Lee Ermey does an excellent job as Gunny Hartmann, although he had no special training for the role other than previously being a DI in real life.<br/><br/>Having never seen combat I can only suspect that the war scenes were as accurate as a special effects department can do and also from what the lifers in my unit had shared with me. But as it should be, it paints the war as brutal and savage as war really can be. I had heard that the USMC was ready to endorse the movie up until the scene where Gunny Hartmann strikes the recruit.

You get pure, unfiltered boot camp brutality that glues your eyes to the screen. Those scenes are absolutely wonderful. They make you squirm in your seats the same way ""A Clockwork Orange"" did. R.

He deserved an Oscar for his riveting performance.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the rest of the film, set in Vietnam, is more conventional, not what you'd expect from Kubrick. It seems a bit too long and disjointed, with an unnecessarily drawn out ending. Still, there are some good combat scenes, with some especially potent violence later on.<br/><br/>It's interesting to notice that Roger Ebert gave it only 2 1/2 stars, but the late Gene Siskel gave it four.

The marine who finally kills her does so out of mercy. He has plenty of reason to withhold mercy: she's an enemy, a sniper, and a woman. It is very significant that this Vietcong is female. Recall how much of the ""humour"" of the first part is anti-female.

","One wonders what Kubrick was thinking here. This movie appears to be two totally unrelated films about Vietnam. The first half, starring Vincent D'Onofrio as an overweight misfit in basic training, is pure Kubrick, complete with his trademark ""upward-angle"" shots of D'Onofrio's face after he's been pushed completely over the edge by the rigors of training and confrontations with a truly nasty drill sergeant. The second half of the movie is a ho-hum depiction of a Vietnam sniper attack, with Matthew Modine as a low-level soldier running around on what is obviously a movie set. Why didn't Kubrick scrap the second half and lengthen the first? The characters were so interesting you wanted to see more of them. If he had done this, this movie would probably have been better than ""Platoon"" and a possible contender for Best Picture. What was Kubrick thinking by tacking on the totally unrelated second half? It's a shame, because this movie could have ranked up there with 2001, The Shining, and A Clockwork Orange. First half: 10  Second half: 3+  Go figure."

","Although there have been countless films made about the Vietnam war, Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" stands alone as one of the most powerful and most intense war films ever made!  It's interesting because it doesn't necessarily show the horrors of war as it does show the horrors of preparing for it.  I've had nightmares about going into the army after watching this film!  It's as hellish, if not more, than the grounds of Vietnam where the training will all prove to be of good use.  The most amazing aspect of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is that it manages to present the ""war is hell"" message without showing too much hell.  The combat sequences aren't as action packed and explosives laden as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Platoon"", nor should they be.  The sniper sequence was incredible, even though there weren't bodies everywhere and bullets all over!  I'm not saying that those things didn't happen, but I am saying that the sniper sequence shows how much can be done with so little.  It was awesome!  It really does give a realistic, intense feel to the film's transition to Vietnam.  But the film's real driving force is the boot camp half of the film.  Here, we literally see ordinary men shoved into a meat tenderizer and emerge as killers.  This idea is one that has put off many viewers, because the idea of the military is that the soldiers work as a ""brotherhood"", in which they watch out for each other, instead of a bunch of crazies out of control running rampant.  What many people have missed though is that ""Full Metal Jacket"" is not showing the reason why the military turns people into killers, it shows how they do it. And how they do it may be just as bad as the actual battlegrounds of war itself.  It's terrifying!  I wouldn't call it one of the greatest movies ever made, far from it.  But I do believe it to be a masterpiece from one of the world's greatest film directors.  It's groundbreaking and it shows us a different ""hell"" of war that audiences haven't seen before, the boot camp!"

The men must be stripped of any ego and humanity in order to survive war intact as a unit.  I've said it before and I'll say it again -- Great Literature about war is about Objectification of the Individual -- Go ahead and re-read Achilles' treatment of Hector's body in the Illiad if you have any questions.  This movie makes that point with its two halves.  Just think about how each character dealt with Boot Camp and then the War.  And for fans of Private Ryan I challenge you to compare the sniper scenes in the two movies!  The former makes it a sad scene, this movie makes it a real life horror nightmare akin to the surreal bridge sniper scene in Apocalypse Now.  Deer Hunter gives you before and after, FMJ gives you some glimpse into the how and why.<br/><br/>A masterpiece for any director, but seemingly a disappointment for those who expected -- what? -- from this one.  Glitz?  Dream sequences?  A music video?  No it's real Kubrick allright. It explores the individual in the context of the environment and how that makes and changes the individual.

It is often said that the 1st part of the film is fantastic while the latter falls apart, having no structure. I believe this was Kubrick's exact intention. The first part takes place in boot camp, a highly structured and disciplined environment, and we feel this, along with the unnerving, relentless verbal abuse of the drill seargent. Kubrick wanted us to feel like we were there in boot camp, just another scared kid being turned into a killing machine. In the second half, the movie has no structure, with the characters wandering from one place to another with no long term goals, which is how the war in Vietnam was conducted. The ""structure"" provided in boot camp for these ""killers"" is not present in Vietnam, which may be Kubrick's explanation for how so many atrocities could occur there. Kubrick, as always, was true to his cinematic vision without pandering to the attention span of the audience. So, what seems like a poor 2nd half to some is actually a more faithful account of what Vietnam was like, probably the most unstructured, undisciplined war America has ever fought.

This movie, I think it does not want to report Vietnam as Platoon wanted to, it really (as the character Joker said) shows men´s duality, with the Hippie movement confronting the War movement, and men´s own fears and psychological wars. Along with Barry Lyndon, FULL METAL JACKET, seems to be one of the less know Kubrick films.

Instead, we begin to learn how the affects of rigorous training (to become a killing machine) has affected characters we've known from the first half and characters we meet in the second.  Each of these characters has been affected in one way or another by their experiences in the jungle but Kubrick has allowed us a look into the days before the jungle to see the seed that was planted.  Most Vietnam films have focused on the insanity that was brought about from the war itself but never focused on the characters pasts.  Here is where we get to see what kind of soldier Joker has become. Here is where we get to the see madness of war and the desensitization of violence.<br/><br/>The movie would have always remained incomplete if we didn't see the characters ""survive"" and move onward.  In a strange way, you were rooting for the privates to make it out of Paris Island - but for what?

","Full Metal Jacket is one of those rare films from which you are unable to turn away no matter how disturbing the images. The film revolves around a character named private Joker. Few actual names of characters in the film are ever learned. Each person is represented by a dehumanizing or insulting nickname which he carries with him proudly. In such a coercive environment there is a fellow named Gomer (actual name Lawrence) who is not capable, at first, of completing any of the drills the breathtakingly brutal drill sergeant enforces. As Joker develops more into an individual or as he puts it ""killing machine"" Gomer slips silently into insanity. The images which fill the first half of FMJ are unforgettable. The second half, which focuses on Jokers tour of duty in the Viet Nam (filmed in England) is no less captivating but somehow the story seems to have been recycled from previous war pictures. Without question however, the influence this movie must have had on Spielberg is obvious in particular during the final harrowing showdown. This film is a must see."

","The common misconception about Full Metal Jacket is that it is a movie about Vietnam. This is not true. Full Metal Jacket is a movie about the brutal process in which young men are turned into killing machines. People that see this as a movie that is solely about Vietnam will have little appreciation for the film. I've talked to several ex-marines and have learned that the boot-camp scenes are very accurate. Kubrick's directing is, as always, top-notch. Too bad about his death."

","I realized tonight as I watched this movie in the wake of seeing Eyes Wide Shut that I honestly envy the people that can find a Kubrick film boring. These people probably don't have the kind of nightmares that his films echo so brilliantly.  All my life I have occasionally had dreams more horrific than the worst thing Freddy Krueger could ever offer; only Kubrick has been able to evoke those same kinds of feelings in me.  I don't always understand what I'm seeing, but I know it scares me to the point of not even being able to scream.  When I wake up from those dreams I rarely remember much about them, but I get flickers of them when I watch one of Stanley Kubrick's masterpieces.  I only wish I could call any of his films boring; that might mean they didn't haunt me almost as much as those darned dreams!"

","This movie is one of Kubrick's best.  When I first watched it, I couldn't stay involved in the second half so I praised only the first.  But after watching it again last night, I felt I had to write a comment about the mastery. The first half of the movie is well-done and realistic (not that I've ever been in the corps) as well as easy to understand.  It's relatable to many different people, no matter if you were alive during Nam or aren't in the army.  It has Kubrick written all over it. The second half is not as widely admired, probably because it isn't a movie in which you can sit back and watch.  It's far from self-explanatory, which is more the style of the first half.  You must live in the war with Joker and Mother and Cowboy and Rafterman to enjoy it. I myself think this IS the greatest war film made, and certainly one of Kubrick's best."

","The opening scenes of Full Metal Jacket seemed full of promise. Having seen many of Kubrick's previous works, I had extremely high hopes for the film, and was not disappointed. The Drill Sergeant was a great character (the constant barking was hideous and yet at times could be incredibly funny), as was Pyle. However, once Pyle's descent into insanity was complete and the Sergeant and him were both dead in the Head, I began to wonder where the film could go.<br/><br/>Downhill seems to be the answer. Sure, the Vietnam scenes were decent, but they did not belong in a film with such a fantastic opening. ""Joker"" irritated me - though I felt I was supposed to identify with him. As for the other soldiers: they seemed a little too 2-dimensional, being divided roughly along the lines of ""cool-headed"" and ""blood-thirsty lunatics"". To its credit, the Vietnam scenes seemed realistic enough in some cases (Kubrick highlighted this by actually giving part of the film the form of a documentary being made) - but they simply did not seem to fit in with what had gone before. There were several points when the screen faded to black and I thought it was the end, only to discover that there was more to come (I seem to remember sighing at this).<br/><br/>I suppose I shouldn't really complain about the ending not having been sooner though, since the end, when it did come, was beautiful, and complimented the dark tones which were far more evident during the Island part of the story than any of the rest of the action in Vietnam. Having the soldiers sing ""Mickey Mouse"" was an inspired choice."

I would almost say that it is a companion piece to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan-it showed the intense mental violence that is perpetrated on G.I.s before they ever hit foreign soil. Lee Ermey created one of THE great screen characters in movie history.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is thoughtful and more subtle than anything in Platoon and the other more famous 80's war movies but it's still kind of tepid and too conventional to mesh with the boot camp sequence, which is electric and unflinchingly real. I still rank this movie as probably my favorite war film but have to admit it's uneven."
"Walt-42","Null","0","0","7 July 1999"," Marines in the microscope
","Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaker blessed by a brilliant eye and cursed by an overly analytical mind. The result is a film legacy that is beautiful yet cold, exciting yet distant, hypnotic yet detached.<br/><br/>The people and characters populating Kubrick's movies are simply tools that act like slides under a microscope. They exist to help explore issues, such as violence or de-humanization, that intrigued the director. Fleshed-out characters that emotionally attracted audiences were shunned  -- they distracted us from the bigger issues. Given his goals, it's no coincide that Kubrick's most memorable and tragic character is a deranged and homicidal machine. The film's star was always Stanley, and Jack Nicholson, Ryan O'Neal or Keir Dullea always ran in second place.<br/><br/>Reviewing his concerns and style, Full Metal Jacket stands as a definitive Kubrick project. It's a beautifully shot film with a camera that glides effortlessly as it follows Private Joker (Matthew Modine) through Marine boot camp and Viet Nam. It deals with war and dehumanization, two of Kubrick's main themes, and features the amazing draftee-abusing talents of real-life Gunnery Sergeant R. Lee Emery as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Emery landed the role by keeping up a barrage of swearing for 15 minutes while crew members pelted him with tennis balls. Tim Colceri, originally slated to play the role, was bumped to the bit part of the crazed helicopter gunner.<br/><br/>But while the characters are interesting to watch, we come away from Full Metal Jacket not caring about them. There's none of the emotional investment we get with the grunts in Apocalypse Now, Platoon or the Deer Hunter. And that's very intentional. The killing, whoring and fighting is all displayed with a strange detachment. All Kubrick's soldiers spout military jargon or hollow bravado in flat, deliberate voices. In several scenes, the camera simply pivot as individual troops successively mouth one Soldier of Fortune cliche after another. The teenagers from small towns in Iowa, Kansas and Oregon have become transformed into killer bugs on view under Kubrick's microscope."
"dtaz","Null","0","0","6 July 1999"," War is hell
","Stanley Kubrick, with this film, has made clear his beliefs on war.  I say ""War"", because other than the ages (contemporary) of the soldiers, the attitudes and philosophies could easily be applied to any major war and Kubrick's lessons would hold true.  I don't believe he is simply condemning the Vietnam War, but war itself because of the effects it has on ordinary people.  When we venture behind the policies and grand visions of the brass, we find that war is messy and inflicts damage on more than what was intended.<br/><br/>As with any other movie of this sort, Kubrick inundates us with a boatload of stereotypes.  We have the screaming, cursing D.I., the cowboy, the pop-culture intellectual, the big, dumb guy, the laid-back, southern brother, the big, red-headed bigot, the stiff brass, the former athlete platoon commanders, the gook whores, and the angry, young, Vietnamese males. All these are handed well and the relationships between most of them are telling of the reprioritization that must occur in the face of the larger enemy.  There is nothing more distasteful for Eightball and Animal Mother than each other.  They don't fight each other, however, because aside from trading insults, they have bigger fish to fry.  Back in the world, they would not be able to carry on this relationship.  Even Cowboy and Joker would probably never have occasion to have dinner together due to their different backgrounds.<br/><br/>The ""fighting men"" themselves are not ridiculed in this film.  There are many moments of laughter from the audience but it is directed more at the situation than at the men.  Neither are these men portrayed as icons. They are what they are, kids caught in a wholly unfamiliar situation, with little preparation or support.  They are left to fend for themselves in a situation being run from the brigade/division level without regard for the individual. They know sex, guns, war movies, and a childhood filled with the ideals of manhood and the belief that, no matter what, the US will definitely kick ass and take names.<br/><br/>As opposed to Ike, Patton, and John Wayne, Kubric saw the average fighting man would have a completely different story to tell.  War is not fun and they are completely unable to see America's policies at work.  For others, society's misfits, war was fun, but it was most assuredly not gentlemanly. All of America's conflicting values such as ""guns are good, but killing is bad"" are thrown out the window when it comes to war.  This is how it must be, but there are consequences.  Now, finally, I get to shoot a gun and kill people, but without the normal consequences or repercussions.  There are no limits.  I can have sex with prostitutes and without love.  I don't have to worry about foreplay or concern myself with the female orgasm.  I can now vent my frustration at being on the ass-end of society, yet constrained by their rules yet fortified by their declarations that the people I'm killing aren't really people at all.  Kubrick makes us realize that ""society"" and ""civilization"" are ideals that supress our basic, and basest, human instincts.  It is a price we gladly pay, but if the shackles are removed, the animal will surface.<br/><br/>There are not many positives in this film.  Gunny Hartman is a positive. His rantings and cruelties aside, he is only concerned about the welfare of the men he charged to train.  He uses any means necessary to motivate them and prepare them to learn.  This is not an easy task, as evidenced by his Whitman/Oswald speech.  War, real war, not war as a concept, is ugly. Therefore, he is reduced to elevating these two sordid individuals in order to get across to these ""normal"" boys what is required to make an effective Marine.  All of the fighting men are positives, some in their own way, in that they are doing what they have to to survive.  Joker and Cowboy stand out, though, as the two who aren't sure why they are doing these things and aren't sure that they should be.  Doc J, the medic, although not a main character, truly embodies what this is about.<br/><br/>There are plenty of negatives.  The Vietnamese are all shown in the negative.  They are all whores, thieves, dirty-tricksters, and exploiters of their own people.  The ""brass"" are completely negative.  They are chock full of meaningless ""rah-rah"" messages, dry, company-line directives, and intolerance of individuality.  The military press with it's ""two major themes"" and it's glorification of the mundane are laughable.  Popular culture and the effect it has had on that generation of young men did them a complete disservice.  They are filled with unearned, swaggering, superiority complexes that blow up in their faces when they hit Vietnam.<br/><br/>There are many things to take home from this movie, but as for the mass audience, the main message is the old stand-by--War Is Hell!  Other, deeper messages include the parallels between sex and war; and the ""Frankenstein"" motif in which the doctor (Sgt. Hartman) is destroyed by the very creature he created, Pyle.  Due to the many laughs elicited from the audience provoked by the rantings of Hartman,I wonder if a mass audience might find it easy to conclude that basic training is all laughs and exercise and, in turn, not respect it.  ""Skull-f***ing"" may sound funny in the theatre, but I doubt it would be much fun to be on the receiving end."

","This movie is without a doubt one of those that will unsettle you and leave questions that some might find difficult to put into words. Without a doubt, Stanley Kubrick had a definite vision in putting together this movie and I, for one found the the thin grey line distinguishing black from white, become unmistakably wide after watching FMJ.<br/><br/>The boot camp portion of the movie, which like many people, I find to be wonderfully done, shows the harsh realities of military training and it's effects on those who can hack it and those who can't. The powerful performances of Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio bring the conflict of their characters to light. This part of the film just has to be seen to be understood.<br/><br/>The second part of the movie, which has now moved into Vietnam, features Pte.Joker's misadventures in Vietnam and his failings in ""getting with the program"". His pseudo-macho attitude towards the war only hides his true misgivings about the war and his desire to be away from the real ugliness of it all. As Joker gets more involved in the front line, Kubrick maintains his cold calculated view of the war and at times, one cannot distinguish between the movie and a documentary.<br/><br/>The final scene of this movie is powerful and poignant as Joker confronts the ugliness of war and it's pointlessness and the point is driven home that ""War is Hell for everyone"".<br/><br/>A must see on all counts. Stanley Kubrick has made an exceptionally powerful movie with a disturbing message to tell.."

","The first half of this film was absolutely brilliant. It was an honest view of life in the core. The characters were great. The drill instructor unleashed many vulgar, memorable quotes that I will never forget. He also showed how life in the core is REALLY like (though I wouldn't know myself, I could tell that this was it.) Private Pyle was a very interesting character. In the beginning I thought that he was simply not cut out to be a marine, but as the film went on I became very interested in his transformation to mental case. The first half of the film is #1 on my top 10 list, even though I saw the movie on a small TV with bad sound.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie, after the group ""graduates"" from Paris Island, is not nearly as good, and I didn't see a good deal of it because I stopped watching after a while. It focused on a character from the first part of the movie, Joker, who often makes wisecracks that get him in trouble. I didn't like this character. I think that the most dominant characters in this movie were killed at the end of the first half of the movie, and that the second half was not needed. I did catch the last scene of the movie. After many have been killed the group marches away chanting: ""M-I-C K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E Mickey mouse (mickey mouse) Mickey Mouse"" and a few other lines added. I thought that this was both a brilliant ending and simply a cheap ending. Perhaps if I saw all of the second half i would understand it better.<br/><br/>In conclusion, When Pyle goes psycho (i'll never forget the look on that face of his), and shoots the drill instructor and then himself, is where the movie should have ended. If you see this movie, stop watching when this happens. The movie will be a lot more meaningful to you.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10 for the first half, and a 5 for the second. Yet the first half is so powerful, I still give this movie as a whole a 10."

This is evident as Joker comments a few times that it is better to be alive than dead, and the beautiful ending. This film isn't pessimistic or overly optimistic and sentimental about life.

At the other end, you have the action-packed Animal Mother.  Both characters were acted out very well by Matthew Modine and Adam Baldwin.  The training portion of the film is probably the best part of the film, as the audience gains a new perception of how soldiers have been trained for Vietnam.  I for one have never expected the commanding officers to be that cruel, as FMJ's commanding officer was to Leonard Pyle.  This film very much deserves to have a larger distribution of videos (they are rare), and needs to be shown on TV more often (in my area it hasn't been on since the 1980's).

"stryker-5","Null","0","0","31 March 1999"," ""What Are We? Lost?""
","This is a remarkable film.  It could be described as two films - the Boot Camp story of a 1967 draft of marine recruits, then the entirely separate tale of marines in combat in Vietnam. It is a film about disorientation, about struggling to make sense of the senseless: Private Pyle flounders hopelessly and never gets into the Marine Corps mindset, then later Joker and the others lose their way in the weird wonderland of war-ravaged Hue.  These failures to comprehend are metaphors for America's national bewilderment.<br/><br/>With its first image, the film seizes our attention.  Recruits are having their hair shaved off.  We watch young men being stripped of their individuality while an incongruous country tune extols the war effort. Country music is inaccessible to these boys, appealing as it does (in 1967, anyway) to an older generation, and the song's unquestioning patriotism is at odds with the sentiments of many youngsters scooped up in the draft. This clash of opposites, and its resulting confusion, will be a recurring motif throughout the film.<br/><br/>The drill instructor (Lee Ermey) transcends the stereotypes to give us a bravura performance.  This cruel, foul-mouthed monster is, paradoxically, admirable and very funny.  That the infliction of such misery should provide a string of belly-laughs is central to the film's purpose.  Our objectivity is impaired because we are both attracted to and repelled by Sergeant Hartman.<br/><br/>Kubrick was famously uninterested in actors.  His concerns were always the wider ones, the movement of events which sweeps the humans along.  It is 20 minutes into the film before anybody speaks as a person (as opposed to a military automaton).  If the culmination of the Boot Camp saga is a little too sensational, it is certainly well depicted.  The sense of loss and foreboding carries us forward to Vietnam.<br/><br/>Private Joker (Matthew Modine) is now a journalist in the Marine Corps, another instance of dislocation - he must both fight and comment on the fighting.  His habit of slipping into 'John Wayne' has its significance - he retains an ironic perspective on the USA's war aims, but is also very much involved in doing his bit at the sharp end of the war.<br/><br/>The Tet Offensive has stuttered into being and died.  The Americans seem to be reasserting control in 'their' Vietnam, but in reality the death-blow has been delivered to American morale. Marines will continue to fight and die, but henceforth this unwinnable war will be in its endgame.  The nightmare panorama of Hue symbolises the quagmire of the war, as does the lone sniper who pins down a Marine unit with ease: the big military machine is powerless against its tiny adversary, and nothing makes any sense.<br/><br/>The ancient capital city of Vietnam, Hue was of enormous psychological importance to both sides in the conflict.  Its position close to the DMZ made it a barometer of the war's progress.  The communists captured and held it during 'Tet', a devastating blow to the South's credibility.  The clearing of the city by the Americans was a laborious, long drawn out affair.<br/><br/>The Hue of the film is astonishing.  These scenes were filmed in London's derelict docklands, out of which Kubrick has created an entirely convincing 'nowhere', an eerie tangle of shattered concrete which burns - literally - like hell.  The marines cannot find their way through this meaningless wasteland, another symbol of the national loss of proportion and purpose.  Striding back out of this gloomy moonscape, the marines sing the Mickey Mouse Song with gusto.  It is hard to know whether the grunts are being ironic about American values, or whether this is just another symptom of the crazy disorientation everybody is undergoing.<br/><br/>A lot of films have taken us through Boot Camp, sounding off about comradeship, self-discovery and the American Way of soldiering.  A lot have tried to deal with Vietnam, but none has succeeded in providing palatable conclusions.  For me, ""Full Metal Jacket"" will stand the test of time, because it alone captures the disorientation which is at the core of the Vietnam experience.<br/><br/>There are many like it, but this one is mine."

","When I talk about ""Full metal Jacket"", I guess I should clarify something. It perhaps isn't the best war movie ever made. Certainly, if you're looking for combat realism, Platoon is the sure bet. I think that it is the best movie about war (in general)ever made. I put it above other war movies because of its skill in delivering an anti-war message; it never presents any redeming qualities about war. In this film, war is just wrong, and there is nothing glorious or glamourous about it.<br/><br/>Most war movies are anti-war in a sense, but a great many of them view war as necessary or unescapable, and those that go and fight in wars are glorified as heroes (patriots to their country). Heck, they fought for their country, right??? This is very apparent in films like ""Saving Private Ryan"". This is one of the major problems that I feel the film has. It sends a contradictory message. On the one hand, it illustrates in gruesome detail how horrible it is to be in battle, but yet at the same time there are a number of times where the American Flag is plastered across the entire screen. The movie redeems itself so that audience members come out of the theater feeling comfortable. If a movie is to be a truly anti-war film, then people should not leave the theater feeling happy. Don't get me wrong, I liked ""SPR"" even though I am not am not a Spielberg fan, but I honestly think that it would have been more effective if it had been done as a documentary only showing the first half an hour. I have never been anywhere near a war, but in my opinion the opening sequence of ""SPR"" looks pretty real. This sense of 'redemption' does not exist in ""Full Metal Jacket""; its as anti-war as anti-war movies get, and for that I respect it greatly.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the opening sequence of the soldiers being trained, by Sgt Hartman (Lee Ermey). This portrays the training process of marines as raw exploitation of human beings.  These men have almost every aspect of their humanity torn away from them. Essentially, they become machines, killing machines. Numerous times in the film it is stated that the marines want""killers"". When Private Joker (Mattew Modine) says that he wants to go into military journalism, Hartman's response is ""you're not a writer, you're a killer!""<br/><br/>I have said that ""FMJ"" is the best movie about war in general. Films like ""Platoon"" or ""SPR"" are specific to certain wars, being WWII or Vietnam. ""FMJ"" is set in Vietnam, but Kubrick's ideas about war can be applied to war in general. That is where I feel that the true genius of this film lies. Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"" can also be seen in this respect."

","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a different kind of war film. In it, we find neither brave soldiers whose acts of heroism we can easily identify with, nor clear-cut black-and-white messages about the war in easily digestible bits. Rather, it examines the roles our sanctified military institutions played in creating and molding recruits into soldiers, and, ultimately, criticizes that whole process as having churned out unthinking robots devoid of moral and ethical reasoning. <br/><br/>The first half of the film deals with the boot camp experiences of fresh young recruits. From the opening shots of the young recruits having their heads shaved to the subsequent day-to-day experiences of physical and mental challenges they endure, the whole process is about one thing: conformity. They are presided over by the hard-nosed, no-nonsense seargent, played brilliantly by R. Lee Ermey, whose sole purpose is to turn these recruits into ""killers"". Those who are physically or mentally not up to the challenge are reviled and punished, as is the case with one recruit named Pvt. Gomer Pyle, a fat, uncoordinated and naive kid. There is an ironic twist at the end of this first half that is shocking, but somehow not surprising given what came before. <br/><br/>The second half of the film is set in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive, where we follow one of the recruits from the first half, Private Joker(played by Mathew Modine), now a soldier journalist, through the burned-out ruins of VIetnam. Unlike other Vietnam war movies where fights overwhelmingly are set in jungles, in this film, they occur mostly in rubble-strewn towns or cities, and are of short duration. I had problem with the second half of the film because there is no real sustained tension in any of the battle scenes: what battle scenes(more like skirmishes) there are seemed to have been afterthoughts in Stanley Kubrick's vision of Vietnam. Maybe, Kubrick was more interested in the message he was trying to convey in the film. I don't know, but I was disappointed. Moreover, the second half plays incongruously, juxtaposing scenes of violence or battle next to scenes of inconsequence, or worse, comedy.   <br/><br/>However, the final scene of the film is a powerful one. I won't give it away, but it poses a dilemma that the soldiers are ill-equipped to deal with. Only Pvt. Joker is able to see through the smoke screen of war, and see the moral or ethical dilemma inherent in that situation. How Joker reacts in that scene is ultimately true of war in general. That is, there are no clear-cut right and wrong, only ambivalence and more questions. Something soldiers are not trained or conditioned to deal with."

","Although he gets killed off early in the movie, Lee Ermey's performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the best.  This is a man who believes he has to abuse and swear at his men in order to make them excellent fighting machines.  Considering the military roles he has played in other films, Ermey was the best candidate for this role.  Meanwhile, Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as Private Pyle is brilliant and portrays a man who tries to take Hartman's abuse and the other abuse of his comrades as best he can and then finally snaps.  One can only wonder if he had survived the nighttime confrontation between himself and Hartman in the bathroom and had gone to Vietnam.  Would he have been alright?  Finally, another actor's performance as Animal Mother is also watchable, as he shows a solider who loves defending his nation against communism and shows only contempt for the Vietnamese, who he regards as terrorists and beggars.  Forget Eyes Wide Shut, this was Stanley Kubrick's true last masterpiece before his death.  It rates right up there with Spartacus, 2001 and A Clockwork Orange as one of his best."
"hip_priest","10","0","0","27 January 2002"," Mickey Mouse
","This is without a doubt my favourite war movie of all time. The direction, acting, music and settings are superb, and Kubrick's vision of war is both ground breaking and shocking. The first half, set in the boot camp, shows the soldiers preparing for war. Their training is brutal and psychologically disturbing, proving too much for one of the recruits. The ordeals at the training camp, however, are nothing compared to the situations the soldiers have to face once fighting in Vietnam. Abigail Mead's brilliant and boldly different score adds to the eerie atmosphere and the tension felt in the final scenes.<br/><br/>Also, a word on the Mickey Mouse song at the end - the song ordinarily would trivialize the scene of the soldiers marching, but having seen what we've just seen, the brutal fight scenes etc, it does no such thing, instead seeming out of context. I think Kubrick was trying to point out that while the Vietnam war was trivialized for its failure (and to some extent lack of justification), people forget about the horrific things the soldiers went through. Having seen what the average soldier went through, the war doesnt seem trivial at all any more - the Mickey Mouse song doesnt fit. It makes us realise that failure or not, it was a horrific thing to go through and should never be trivialized. ANOTHER possible interpretation is that this is an anti-America device - the soldiers were dehumanized by the American military. They were sent into a war they could never win by the American Government. The only thing they have to keep them going after seeing their friends killed in battle, and undergoing horrific ordeals, is a shallow song about Mickey Mouse - this is the only positive thing America has given them. And in the context of a war film, it seems a very shallow offering indeed (emphasized by how out of place it seems). In this sense, it could be seen as anti war, anti military and anti America. If this is the case, i think Kubrick had every right to express an anti America view based on this war - remember, if you take away the films expressing negative views, you are left with PROPAGANDA (and we all know theres plenty of that flooding out of Hollywood). This view makes an interesting change. There are 100s of possible interpretations (a reference to how sheltered the soldiers lives were before the war, etc) but i thought those might interest some of the more open minded of you."

","Many of those who have written comments about this film have talked at length about how absurd the use of the Mickey Mouse club song by Kubrick. One of the major terms used in the military in general to refer to the usual military B.S. is ""Mickey Mouse"". Some have commented on the obscenity and childishness of the marching songs sung during boot camp. Well, those are PRECISELY the songs we sang while marching. Kubrick has created a really realistic film here and many of the commenters are not qualified to write about it since they never experienced it. So, that said, the performances of the entire cast are brilliantly executed. A true stroke of genius was casting Lee Ermey as SSgt. Hartman, the Senior Drill Instructor. He was recently retired from the Marine Corps and was very convincing! The main star of the film was Matthew Modine, whom I regard as one of the finer actors around today. His performance generated a real personality on screen for Private Joker, such as  sitting around the barracks just before they are attacked by the NVA talking tough, but moments later saying he's not ready for combat. Kubrick very skillfully uses the first half of the film to show the transformation of the recruits from civilians to Marines. We don't get to know the recruits very well, excepting Privates Joker and Pyle, but the mix of characters is carefully selected. The fact that we don't know these recruits very well reflects the fact that they are all bald and that boot camp dehumanizes people. Contrast that with the second half, which depicts the horror of the Vietnam War. The character mix in the second half is more important as that in the first and the characters are more developed. Overall, Kubrick's best film ever. A solid 9.9999999 out of 10."

She not only keeps them at bay, but also, seems to torture them by only wounding each Marine who makes a rescue attempt. The irony is that this tough group of fighters could represent the entire U.S. war effort. They had the fire power to crush the opponent but that opponent was more highly motivated, dedicated and willing to make sacrifices for victory. By just wounding the Marines, she uses their dedication for each other against them since she knows they will not leave wounded Marines and one by one they come into her rifle sight."

","Stanley Kubrick's second war movie is divided into two parts.  At first, I thought the Paris Island segment was more engrossing.  It contains intense acting by R. Lee Ermy and Vincent D'Onofrio, who play a memorable game of ""mental chess"".  The Vietnam segment originally bothered me because it seemed so stagy.  (It was filmed on London sound stages).  And I thought Matthew Modine was pretty unconvincing. I didn't care for this movie when I first saw it.  I preferred Platoon, like many other audiences.  But it is interesting that I yearned to see it again after a few years, yet I really have no desire to see Platoon again.  The same can be said about the two big Vietnam pictures of the '70s:  Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter.  As much as I liked The Deer Hunter, it was more of a statement about the war and a human drama than a work-of-art.  Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket are works of visionary filmmakers and have stood the test of time.  I now believe that the second half is better, despite my original feelings.  Like Coppola's film, it has a surreal quality and its images (Cowboy's death, the background fires, helicopter sequence) are unforgettable. And Matthew Modine's performance grew on me.  Another ""one misunderstood, now legendary"" late Kubrick film."

""Full Metal Jacket"" is no exception.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is so powerful that the second half suffers. Kubrick shows you just how tough basic training is and in some ways makes you afraid of war and what you would have to endure. The performances are first rate, with newcomers at the time Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio (in one hell of a performance).  Kubrick once again sucked into his world and held on as long as he could.  Although the second half isn't as intriguing or moving, it still has the ability to entertain.

","There are some strange things going on in this film.  For example, a small statuette of Mickey Mouse sits on a window ledge, waving and smiling at the soldiers in the quonset hut.  You can barely see him, but he's there (and later referenced in the final ""Mickey Mouse Club"" singalong at the end).  A poster of Snoopy is also in this same office, overlooking the scene as the lieutenant gives a speech.  Both Mickey Mouse and Snoopy seem to be making fun of the Marines.  In a later scene, a documentary film crew photographs the soldiers in a long tracking shot.  A guy completely swathed in bandages -- his face and hands covered -- walks past, waves at the camera.  He looks like the Mummy, another mythic character like Mickey Mouse or Snoopy.  There are also phantom presences -- Ann-Margret, who is supposed to show up to entertain the troops but never does, and John Wayne, the very symbol of American self-assurance and swagger, referenced to juxtapose the certainty of the World War II era with the ambiguity of Vietnam.  It is also interesting to notice how black characters are treated.  The first recruit that Hartman picks on is black (""What's your name, scumbag?""), and this unfortunate receives a racially insensitive nickname (""Snowball""), and is the victim of a racist barb (""We don't serve fried chicken and watermelon..."").  Later, Dorian Harewood's character is on the receiving end of Adam Baldwin's racist insults (""Too bad about the Sickle Cell""), has to wait in line to have sex with a Vietnamese hooker, but is the first one sent out to find the sniper."

","Stanley Kubrick takes on boot camp and Vietnam in ""Full Metal Jacket"" and delivers nicely.  The dehumanizing (meaningfully, more so than mechanistic) drill instructor and tough camp fit in well with Vietnam--both represent meaningless exercises, with violence and a touch of insanity.  People become nonpersons, violence is a viable instrument of mechanistic existence, and Vietnam is nowhere, nothing, the journey into the abyss.  Snipers and jungle, no win, no lose, dark, amoral, disturbing.<br/><br/>Kubrick blends in elements of the surreal, using slow motion and generally good cinematography, to convey his message, which has elements of satire. One recruit has the worst time, but his ultimate reaction (in boot camp, before Vietnam) is more noteworthy for being paranormal than violent.  And Kubrick's visual interpretation of Vietnam, from which his viewpoint can be abstracted, is well worth watching."

","The late Stanley Kubrick was one of our most daring and ingenious filmakers. Doctor Strangelove was probably his most well known film with that scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb.  In 1957, Kubrick directed his first film Paths Of Glory with Kirk Douglas and it has since been hailed as a brilliant work. In my humble opinion, I feel Full Metal Jacket is his most brilliant work. I first saw this film in 1987 and have seen it countless times since. I guess as a career soldier, I have a special insight into its messages (it is one of the most popular films among service people).  I don't think there has ever been a film about the Vietnam war that was better.  In terms of realism and the depiction of war's horror and madness, FMJ is the best.  In a sense, we are really treated to two great films in one.  The first part is the most realistic depiction of military training I have ever seen. Many people dont realize that Lee Ermey had actually been a drill instructor at Parris Island and he is terrific as the brutal, sewer mouthed Sergeant.  I have to admit that I also found his performance hilarious in some parts! Vincent D'Onofrio is also brilliant as the slow-witted recruit pushed to the brink of madness. Not to be a spoiler, but the final scene in the bathroom between him and Ermey is chilling and haunting and unforgettable, I will never forget the expression of madness on his face.

There is no sex scenes thank God, but that part in the movie proved that Stanley Kubrick wrote it.  Or another where the soldiers compare their ""rifle"" to their ""guns"", if you know what I mean.  Please don't worry!  There is also no nudity, but these scenes where really stupid and didn't quite maintain the ""war movie"" feel.<br/><br/>Mathew Modine is a great actor, but I'm even more surprised that Vincent D'Onofrio is in the movie.  He plays a slow-minded overweight man who gets picked on by everyone in the first half of the movie.  Vincent is also a terrific answer, and what he does to himself is not ""war movie""-like, but it is so powerful and disturbing that I have to say that Full Metal Jacket is one of the most intense movies I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>With all the intensity and the war scenes, Full Metal Jacket goes on my top 5 of ""best war movies"".  See it for yourself, is you are a hardcore Stanley Kubrick fan (like me), or even if you aren't!  My dad hates him, but loves the movie.  I give my full recomendations on Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>8/10 (-2 for the sex references)"

","Bizarre yet fairly entertaining perspective from one Marine, Joker (Matthew Modine who is also the film's narrator) who fought in the Vietnam War.  The late Stanley Kubrick who directed the movie, divided it into two seperate parts (one for basic training and the other one based only in combat) or three if you want to count to reporting in the field.<br/><br/>
One of the problems that I had with the movie is that it lacked appeal and to top that off, the drill instructer, Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, a former D.I. in real life) spends most of his time, shouting out nasty and outrageous comments towards some of the men.  He even gives out nicknames to some men for any reason like Cowboy (Arliss Howard), who is from Texas. And the one who is targeted the most by Hartman is Vincent D'Ofornio, whose character is dubbed ""Gomer Pyle"".  D'Ofornio's character is a bit on the pudgy side and struggles at just about everything except for sharpshooting.<br/><br/>After he survives basic training, Joker is a member of ""Stars and Stripes"", a militarized version of a magazine like ""TIME"" or ""Newsweek"". Modine unleashes some gentle and colorful humor to superior officer here even though the John Wayne impersonations are lame.<br/><br/>During one assignment in the city of Hue during the Tet Offensive, Joker and his partner, Rafterman (Kevin Major Howard), a photographer find the infantry unit that Cowboy is in and introduces themselves to the unit. Nearly all the members have unusual nicknames and my favorite one of the bunch is Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), who is the unit's wily gunner and the first meeting that he has with Joker is hilarious as the two swap questions and putdowns.<br/><br/>This half is much better than the first as the unit patrol a part of the city which lies in ruins due to the severe fighting.  Kubrick gradually lets the suspense and fear build and it works wonderfully.  The best exhibit of that when Joker quietly confronts a sniper.<br/><br/>The performances here are nice, but the best parts of the film is Abigail Mead's score, a mix of oldies and composed bits are great and Doug Milsome's cinematography is done to sheer genius.  ""FULL METAL JACKET"" may not be a great film, but one that's provoctive and serious."

"virek213","10","0","0","16 July 2001"," Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?
","Throughout his life, director Stanley Kubrick made films that got people talking, both pro and con.  FULL METAL JACKET is one such example.  Though far less emotional and much more analytical than any film about the Vietnam war, this film is nevertheless a brilliant piece.<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes of this film deal with Marine boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina.  And they deal with it in a way that no previous film ever dealt with it, thanks to Lee Ermey's inventive and scathingly vicious, profanity-laden performance as Drill Instructor Hartman.  We see the recruits torn down and built up into remorseless killing machines, praying for war.  But one of them, the overweight Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), is about to show us how a remorseless killing machine can malfunction due to one slight imperfection.<br/><br/>Once the scene shifts to Vietnam, we find ourselves in the middle of the Tet Offensive, and the realization, as seen by the characters portrayed by Matthew Modine, Arliss Howard, and others, that war is most certainly hell. The most horrifying part is when the platoon led by Howard is caught off guard in the bombed out city of Hue by a VC sniper.  It is there that the true mettle of these men is revealed.<br/><br/>A lot of reviewers have mentioned that the first forty minutes of FULL METAL JACKET make the last 76 minutes seem routine by comparison.  I don't think that's the case.  Kubrick is very remorseless in his war scenes and how he handles the violence.  Certainly he takes his swipes at the military in a scathing way reminiscent of DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, and, thanks to Modine, even rips John Wayne's flag-waving patriotism apart (""Is that you John Wayne? Is this me?).  In truth, however, unlike a lot of war films, even PLATOON, Kubrick's film is not merely anti-war, it's apolitical; it does not take sides on the issue.  Complimented by solid acting and a faithful recreation of the Hue battle (filmed in an abandoned gas works plant near Kubrick's home base of London), FULL METAL JACKET is a riveting movie, a must-see for those who appreciate great filmmaking from a consumate master."

"rugbysharks","Null","0","0","19 June 2001"," Joker's character underestimated
","A lot of people seem to be overly impressed with the first half of this film and then either disregard or rubbish the second part. In fact, to me the second part stands out as a very unusual and fascinating study of human conflict. The first half though seems simplistic, stereotypical and contrived which (apparent) ex-marines on this web site have called into question. For example Hartmann's brutality which would perhaps not have happened in reality. However, the first half does have interesting themes of hardship, guilt, relief, humiliation and the emotional results of all of that(as found in D'Onofrio's character).<br/><br/>But to me the second half stands out in this film. Modine's character is explored in greater detail and reveals a cocky though very intelligent young man in a strange land, surrounded by murder, chaos and vengeance. We see themes of revenge throughout: the killing of Hartman, the dead villagers in chalk, the death of the sniper all of which our Private Joker plays a role (or there abouts). He uses metaphor and humour to relieve the strain of his situation to an extent. He is the alter ego really of the brutal kind of soldier that the United States produced for and indeed within the Vietnam war, for example Adam Baldwin's character, etc. Someone mentioned that joker is 'the beacon of hope' in a sense, a humane character we can find comfort in. This is very true and untypical of most of the soldiers we see. Joker's philosophical ideologising can be clearly seen in his references to Jung's 'duality of man' and his remark about 'wanting to meet stimulating and interesting people of ancient cultures, and kill them..', as well as in his desire to study military journalism as opposed to the typical 'infantry' role of the marine. The reference to the Vietnamese as 'the finest people on Earth' also struck me in the midst of all the soldier's prejudices. In that same scene, the soldier also speaks of how 'When this is all over we're gonna miss not having someone to shoot at' which spoke volumes of America's role in Vietnam and indeed other conflicts around the world. In a sense thus Modine IS Kubrick in the film, he is the camera and the eyes through which we see the war as Kubrick wants us to see it.<br/><br/>One of the superb ultimate ironies of the film of course involved the use of sex. There are constant references to sex, both in the first half and more explicitly in the second half, when the men encounter prostitutes. They nearly all treat women badly or have a degrading opinion about them (Joker's and Cowboy's banter, the scenes when the second prostitute is introduced to the group, etc..) but ultimately of course, it is the FEMALE sniper who proves so skillful and who dispatches three of these so-called 'finest killing machines on Earth'."

"Wizeace13","Null","0","0","30 April 2001"," another antiwar piece by kubrick
","Full Metal Jacket is a war film that is atypical of its genre, as many Kubrick films contradict the genre in which they are a part of. It is an anti-war classic that does not give any glory to war, and it follows in the footsteps of Dr. Strangelove and Paths of Glory. I think it is safe to say that Stanley Kubrick is not a very big fan of war, as none of these movies have a pleasant ending. The two-part movie commences on Paris Island, where potential marines are chiseled into killing machines, like Lee Harvey Oswald who was skilled with his gun, by Lee Ermey, the drill instructor. The second half of the movie deals with these men who are `no longer maggots' and part of a brotherhood known as the marines. They are stationed in the city of Hue in Vietnam. The fact that the movie does action in Vietnam does not occur in the jungle is atypical of the many Vietnam movies that were released during this time. It allows us the viewer to see the result of war on certain individuals and also allowed the semi-agoraphobic Kubrick to remain in England for filming.<br/><br/>There are many dualities contained in this film. It starts as a somewhat of a comedy and results in a tragic loss. Through watching this, the audience experiences exactly what the marines do. They sign up, optimistic of the war and the efforts of the marines, but when the men witness the tragedy of war, they see the real truth. Joker makes the duality concept very clear during his dialogue concerning his peace pin and `born to kill' on his helmet. This whole concept was something Kubrick did not wish the audience to miss. There are many connections that can be made to the Paris Island and Vietnam. Also, one could compare Animal Mother to the drill instructor in the sense that both were parental characters that watched out for other people.<br/><br/>The only thing that I did not like about the film was the absence of Ermey in the second half. I think he could have played an intricate role, and Gomer Pyle should not have killed off his character. Other than that fact, I believe the movie to be another excellent piece by the great Stanley Kubrick."

","This is possibly my favorite Kubrick film.  And absolutely my favorite war film.  'Full Metal Jacket' gives you a look into the lives of our Marines during the Vietnam War; a very vivid, disturbing, eye-opening look.  Once again, like with all of his films, Stanley Kubrick has done a perfect casting job.  Matthew Modine's performance as Private Joker combines the ideal combination of detachment from his experience and complete and utter humanity.  Nicknamed Private Joker by his drill sergeant on Paris Island, Modine's character adds the dark humor to 'Jacket', a quality prominent in all Kubrick films.  There are many unforgettable characters that add so much to this film; a Drill Instructor with possibly the most creative and amusing dialogue I've seen in a Kubrick film, and several marines with largely varying ideas about the war.  'Why are you boys here in Vietnam?' asks a new reporter, one marine responds 'Freedom', the next responds 'Poontang'. 'Full Metal Jacket' plays almost like a documentary, first exposing life going through boot camp and then directly into warfare, it also shows the process that so many Marines actually went through, practically brainwashing men into 'killers', developing 'the thousand yard stare' after being in the killing fields for too long.  The most disturbing scene for me is one where a marine is shooting a machine gun out of a helicopter aiming at innocent civilians.  `How can you kill women and children?' asks Private Joker, the marine responds laughing `Easy, you don't lead 'em so much!  Ain't war Hell?'  Indeed, war is Hell for these marines and 'Full Metal Jacket' exposes for all their 'world of s***'."

It's one of those films where you're gauranteed a great time.<br/><br/>It isn't a movie for the young ones though, because it is quite a disturbing movie (Kubrick's trademark), and has alot of foul language.<br/><br/>However being a member of the Armed Forces, I must admit the movie goes a little far (with respect to the Boot Camp scene). Given, the 60's and 70's the military was a little less 'friendly', the film does exagerate things alot. Yes, some violence existed in the military, but not to that extent. Never would a instructor beat his troops, or be so racist, etc. So please don't judge the military or the Marine Corps by this movie - IT IS NOT VERY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MILITARY/BOOT CAMP - THEN OR NOW. For the most extent, that sort if thing didn't happen, and it's all a figment of Hollywood's imagination. This also applies to the recent 2001 reality series called ""Boot Camp"" on FOX TV. Even though the Drill Sergeant's are ""real"", they would never do most of what they do on the show in real life. So much for my rant - I just don't like when people watch this movie and think that is what the military is like, because it's really not.<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie is pretty much factually correct.<br/><br/>It's a good, classic war film - well worth seing. You won't be disappointed. If you like this movie - you will also like ""Heartbreak Ridge"" with Clint Eastwood. It's also a funny 'Drill Sergeant whipping his troops into shape' kind of movie."

I'm no historian but I think forests and humidity had to do with Vietnam.  All in all, this film is still really good, and should be watched by anyone interested in war movies.  As with Kubrick's other movies, the film is moody and introspective, and the boot camp sequence is ickier than other war movie sequences.

","There is such a misunderstanding of Full Metal Jacket today.  But what can I say here that hasn't been said already?  What is significant about this film is its insignificance.  We all know that Kubrick could have made a sweeping Transcendental war film such The Thin Red Line (a brilliant, brilliant combination of WW2 and Emersonian beliefs) or one that more aptly shows human behavior under the most extreme of circumstances.  But in Full Metal Jacket he deliberately leaves out such glorification.  You will notice an absence of dramatic lines or symbolic encounters.  Not that there isn't plenty of symbolism in the movie (the ""head"" sign in the bathroom is one that stands out in particular) its just that Kubrick buries them so deeply.<br/><br/>After my initial viewing of FMJ, I was rather unimpressed.  The movie seemed to have a complete lack of substance or of meaning, and thus I felt no strong emotional involvement with the experience.  But the more I studied it, I realized that this entire film was a work of massive poetic justice to a concept which deserves no glorification and posses no substance: war. By no means am I attempting to say that Kubrick purposely made a bad film in order to emphasis the meaninglessness of war.  But it is necessary to understand what was left out of FMJ in order to better understand what was left in.<br/><br/>The soldiers in the film are like a deck of cards.  They are all distinct yet somewhat stereotypical.  We've all seen types like them before in various other movies yet Kubrick so shamelessly places them here.  Joker, just as the joker-card implies, is the ""wild card"".  He serves as the audience's beacon of hope in the midst of adversity.<br/><br/>And so the theme of the movie becomes clear: society is attempting to turn these human beings into mindless, remorseless, killing machines without an identity.  It's ironic that the Pyle, who has the hardest time conforming in the film, transforms into the most brutal killing machine- so deadly that he destroys himself.<br/><br/>And this is the tragedy of the film.  The real enemy is the unseen merciless hand of society.  When Joker must deliver the fatal blow to the dying sniper at the film's conclusion, he signs over his soul.  In the last few minutes of the movie, all the soldiers sing the Mickey Mouse song.  This is Kubrick's way of saying that pledging your allegiance to society is as empty and absurd and believing in omnipotent. Mickey mouse. -I love this film."

","After watching this film a few years back on TV, then finally managing to get my hands on a copy and watch it again and again, I still firmly believe that FMJ is still the best war film ever made, one of Stanley's masterpieces.  A lot of people, including me, say that for all of his films, but why does this one stand out?<br/><br/>For me, the first instance is the fact that here we have a beautiful war film, which is actively anti-war.  But what we see on screen, amidst Kubrick's stunning cinematography, is what 'Nam was all about, in my opinion.  But then we have the prominent characters; Hartman, who in my view is the stereotypical drill sergeant (superbly played by Lee Ermey) who lives for the Marines.  He'll fight anyone, it's in the spirit of the Marine core, the finest killing machines in the world.  We have the privates picked on for whatever reason by Hartman whose views on the world are all fascinating.<br/><br/>Pyle is the fat one.  The stupid one who everyone picks on (there's always one like him everywhere you go), but someone you get the impression from that there is more there than meets the eye, there's still a spark of mad intelligence in there, which we see when the poor private finally snaps and shoots his tormentor (and ultimately himself).  Then there's Cowboy, who is the guy who just gets on with things, just keeps plugging away and does well for himself, and finally Joker, the most intelligent of the three in my opinon, the one who dares answer back to Hartman and express his feelings, shows his morals.  What I found quite funny was the fact that Hartman would verbally squash someone, especially Joker for speaking up for himself, but later tells the men that the Marines 'don't want robots, they want killers'.<br/><br/>Another great contradiction I found was Joker's 'Born to Kill' on his helmet, and the peace sign on his lapel, but he beautifully explained this by explaining this is how he felt about the duality of war.  Lovely symbolism, very John Lennon :)  If you want peace, prepare for war, so true. When the guys are in Vietnam, and you see war at work, you fully understand this statement.  Although Joker did get his confirmed kill by shooting the injured female sniper, it was under humanitarian circumstances.  But the way the men react to everything, what they tell the camera when being interviewed, to me that's how it really must have been for a lot of young men.  Mindless violence, if you like, but can you really see every soldier out there actually enjoying their work?  And also, the fact that the Vietnamese didn't appreciate the Americans being there at all.<br/><br/>I really don't want to spoil the film for others, or get right into the whole Vietnam thing, we all know the politics, so I won't go in-depth in regards to the story, but I just really want to stress that through these characters, the action, even the soundtrack, here we have a beautiful portrayal of an ugly war, finally a Vietnam film with morals."

And all those profound themes are hidden under highly enjoyable movies.  Movies like ""The Shining,"" ""2001: A Space Odessey,"" and ""Path of Glory"" are great examples of Kubrick's utter brilliance for conceiving films.       <br/><br/>
  ""Full Metal Jacket"" is one of Stanley Kubrick's greatest films.  It is literally divided into two chapters: the training, and when the training is used.  The first part of the film, the training, portrays vividly the incredible mental and physical terror that the would-be marines go through. At times, the training seems unbearable, sadistic, and cruel, but in reality, that is exactly what they needed.  Stanley Kubrick shows how the Marine training camp dehumanized the trainees into killing machines.  Many people who have seen the first half of the movie describe it as being ""one good line after another.""  They're describing the lines of the drill instructor, played by former drill insrtuctor Lee Ermey.  In the pre-production of the film, Kubrick told Ermey to just make it real, something that he did with great skill.  One of the best scenes in the first part was when the marines gathered for the ""persuasive"" meeting with Private Pyle.  Even when they weren't in any training or combat, the marines gathered and executed the mission with total perfection and synchronicity, the sign of a true military force.  The first half of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is perhaps one of the greatest chapters in film history in that it showed development and dehuminization like only Kubrick could.<br/><br/>  The second half of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is when the intense training goes into use: combat.  The battle scenes in this movie were just spectacular. Violent and brutal yes, they showed correctly Kubrick's style: dark but true. If you like great combat sequences and action, you'll like this film. If you like artistic films but are sick of lighter, somewhat dull plots, then ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a film for you."

","Warning! May contain spoilers!<br/><br/>All throughout Kubrick's war drama, he suggests the duality of man, from the drill instructor's degrading rants and desire to see his men succeed, to Matthew Modine's assertion while in basic training that he is a killer contrasting with his obviously anti-war stance.  While some feel that the movie is only half finished, with the post-Basic action being tacked on without any reason for existing, it is obvious that the hell of Basic is being compared to the hell that was Vietnam.  As Modine finishes the movie with ""My thoughts drift back to erect nipple wet dreams about Mary Jane Rottencrotch and the Great Homecoming F*** Fantasy. I am so happy that I am alive, in one piece and short. I'm in a world of s**t... yes. But I am alive. And I am not afraid."", in basic he was in a world of s**t, but he was alive.  Vietnam could not offer him the same assurance.  It's not common that one can refer to a war movie as life-affirming but this one may be the exception to the rule."

"LordLeto","Null","0","0","18 December 2000"," Kubrick mystifies the minds
","I have to start by making one statement: this is not a war film.  Granted, I may be called an idiot by those who see the guns, the violence, the basic training, but in the end, this is not a war film.  As any Kubrick film, you cannot take it at face value.  This is not a movie where you can just watch and accept what you see on the screen.  This movie is made to be peered into, seen for what it really is: commentary on the human psyche.<br/><br/>Now with my rant out of the way, I will proceed with my review.  This is simply one of the best movies ever made, as are most of Kubrick's.  We are presented with several characters who we are not sure of: are we supposed to hate the loud-mouthed general?  Or are we supposed to feel that the private is the enemy for not believing in the cause of the country?<br/><br/>I have also heard that many feel only the first portion of the movie is entertaining, and therein lies the movie's fault.  Kubrick, for whatever reason, made the first part to be taken only at face value.  Only after joker is shipped to Vietnam do we begin seeing Kubrick's mind emerge, the that draws you in and traps you as a parallel to the human mind.  We are not looking at the Vietnam war through sane eyes, only through what ""sane"" would be to a soldier in Vietnam.  The second part of the movie shows the transgression on Joker's part, the gradual loss of his humanity as he becomes another machine.<br/><br/>Is this the best Kubrick film ever? No.  Is this the best war film ever? no, it's not a war film.  Is this yet another look into the human psyche?  Yes. And this is why I watch this movie over and over, not because I enjoy the violence, the language, or the first 40 minutes.  I watch it because I get yet another opportunity to open up to the world of Kubrick, to see the world through his eyes, and play another character in his world."

","Traditionally, this film is divided into two parts (as is the book upon which it is based), but I think that division does a disservice to Kubrick's vision.  The ""second"" half should be seen as flowing from the first.  I don't agree with the arguments that the first half is perfect and the second flawed. Instead, I think the film builds to a perfect crescendo that leaves us breathless, epiphanic.  I, for one, was caught off balance by the second part of the film and will never forget those mesmerising final scenes.  If these is an ""incompleteness"" about this film, surely that was intentional on Kubrick's part. He wanted, needed, to make us think.

"pzanardo","10","0","0","22 November 2000"," A masterpiece with Kubrick's ultimate judgment on mankind
","A masterpiece of a great artist is like a universe where one can find uncountable different deep themes and significant ideas. Here I venture my personal interpretation of ""Full Metal Jacket"", a masterpiece of the great artist Stanley Kubrick. <br/><br/>In my opinion, Kubrick makes use of this movie to pronounce his ultimate sentence on the human species: an utter condemnation worthy of Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels"". Yes, there is a war with people assailing each other like rabid dogs. But this is not a justification. Men are not loathsome assassins because there is a war: war exists because men are this way.<br/><br/>Through his own gelid, documentary eye, Kubrick shows us mankind at work, meanwhile ruthlessly judging it, like Gulliver in the land of the wise horses. Are we supposed to hate the satanic drill sergeant? Why? He just does his job, which is to destroy personalities, to turn men into machines. And notice that the consequence of this alienation is not to create better soldiers: all this is done because that's the sergeant's job, because that's human life.<br/><br/>Private Joker (Matthew Modine) is the guy who tries to preserve his freedom of conscience and of criticism. Yet the viewer is brought to have an instinctive dislike for the fellow, and in fact the director depicts him with no sympathy. After all, he is a shirker and his continuous jokes are not funny at all. We ask why he doesn't share the sufferings of other soldiers. Perhaps, since he has brain? And who cares intelligence in hell? Indeed, when Joker is (justly) rebuked by a general for his uniform (with pacifist symbols, slogans etc.), he cuts a very poor, ridiculous figure, clumsily showing his dubious academic learning on philosophy, sociology or what is. In conclusion, Joker is a man, the same lousy stuff as others. Of course, women are nothing better: see the two Viet prostitutes, with their exhilarating lines.<br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" has enormous merits. The visual effects are fantastic, as always in Kubrick's movies. The escalation of psychological violence in the boot camp and the sense of derangement of soldiers in Vietnam are represented with powerful art. The whole film is pervaded by a grotesque, sardonic humor which is like the sneer of the hell. Which most amazes me is that the director was able to turn obscene talk (which I normally abhor) into true art: in my humble opinion, not even Rabelais succeeded in this exploit.<br/><br/>Often the greatest works of art have some minor faults (Dostoewskij's major novels are plenty of defects, for instance). Let me remark a pair of flaws of the film. When the marines are shot by the sniper, we see squids of blood in slow-motion. This is Peckinpah's visionary style of representing violence, which grates much with the cold-blooded documentary-like style, Kubrick's trade-mark, which we find in the remainder of the movie. Moreover: some puns in soldiers' talk, and in fact the most obscene and disgusting, are too brilliantly elaborated to appear authentic: everyone, who has spent a period as a conscript, knows that bright wit is not common goods inside the barracks.<br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" is both a terrible and profound masterpiece. It deserves a major place in the history of cinema."

After a spectacular beginning, I had high hopes for the film to get a lot better than the way it turned out. While it seemed only natural for the film to carry out the way it did, I was disappointed in the direction Kubrick went. <br/><br/>Without giving away any spoilers, ""Full Metal Jacket"" went from training soldiers for war to having them fight in it. However, the problem with this is there were new characters introduced and not much time to  develop their backgrounds like ""Saving Private Ryan"" did.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent job by an unknown cast who have grown and matured into big box office names.

What begins as a vulgar training exercise becomes a battling bloodbath at the end. It provides a very tight example of being prepared to live or die in wartime. Slowly, the movie builds up to the point of fair interest when the Marines fight at Vietnam, an element of Stanley Kubrick's unique presentation. The story is compelling and provocative from the start, outweighing the further drawbacks. I would almost have to give the entertainment value a strong ""10"", though, if only it weren't for the last few minutes, which was a letdown, although it gave us a clear mystery about what may be predicted to happen next. For this to be the greatest war movie around, it needs PLENTY of hell-raising, heart-gripping war action to create a higher excitement level, and despite some bloody casualties, there should have been more of it badly. It actually will have viewers wondering why our drill sergeant shoved the hell out of young recruits (including ""Pyle"") preparing for the worst time of their lives.

Lennord is a misfit not good at anything then finds out he's an expert marksman and starts improving.  Srgt.

","The first movie involves Basic Training during the Vietnam era.  Although the Basic depicted is that of the Marines, I can attest to its accuracy, because I took mine in the Army at Ft. Jackson, SC, just a hundred or so miles away.  About the only inaccuracy I spotted was that of allowing weapons with live ammo in the barracks.  This would have been unthinkable in the Army, and I suspect it was in the Marines as well.  But it was necessary to the conclusion of the (first) movie, so some ""artistic license"" may permitted, I suppose.<br/><br/>Although many reviewers here have found this movie ""funny"", it is anything BUT.  The point of Basic Training was to break down individual egos to the point that we would be willing to do our government's immoral bidding. Having attended a boarding military prep school, I knew how to play the game.  I vowed to myself that I was checking my ego at the gate when I entered Ft. Jackson, but I saw many other ""troops"" who didn't, and, though they failed to act out their resistence in the way depicted in the (first) movie, their lives were ruined.  The first movie is a true Kubrick classic, and I honestly believe that it should have been released as a separate entity.<br/><br/>The second movie is somewhat more problematic.  It's not that it's bad nor innacurate; it's just that it's already been done (in some cases better) in ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Platoon"", (especially) ""Apocalyse Now"", et al.  All of these other films are what happens after decent men are turned into killing machines; Kubrick's genius (in movie one) is in depicting HOW that transformation happens.  I just hope that viewers stop laughing at and start THINKING about it."

The movie then moves out of boot camp and to Viet Nam.  From here, the movie loses its satyric edge a bit and becomes more dramatic.  To some, this transition seems to be too much, but it works well to show the difference between boot camp and war.  No matter how hard your DI, you cannot be prepared for the atrocities of war, and what a person will do, no matter how unthinkable, when their life is at risk.

Kubrick's directing helps me to see that. In the army, you are taught to lose yourself to orders, to follow primitive survival instincts, and to shut out your conscience.  The soldiers in Full Metal Jacket go through changes like that.  One of them can't handle the changes and commits murder, then suicide after his graduation from the Marine Corps, before he even leaves the U.S.  This film is hard to truly understand, and I doubt that many people who see it do understand it.  But then again, war doesn't make a lot of sense either.  The movie may seem unfinished at the end, but then again, didn't Vietnam?"

The big problem is that there are two parts that aren't equal...the first hour of the movie is the training and it must be one of the most shocking war propaganda (well, depends how you wanna call it) ever, especially because of the superb acting from R Lee Ermey who plays a totally awol sergeant, but once the troops are landing in Vietnam the movie sucks, and the main reason is that there is just no story, just shooting and that's it, unless you call the war seen through a warphotographer a movie.<br/><br/>Watch the first hour over and over, but once they're in Vietnam push the rewind-button!"

In the first half of the film, Matthew Modine's character can only look on helplessly as one of his fellow recruits, an overweight misfit, is slowly driven crazy by military life.  The second half is made up of a series of short vingettes showing the dehumanizing effects of war but also the bizarre reasoning people use to justfy it.

","I went into the Marine Corps in January 1968 and I must say that this film is by far the most authentic depiction of Marine Corps boot camp you'll ever see. If you weren't in the Corps, just watch this movie and you'll learn what it was like. When I was in, I can remember trying hard not to laugh at a lot of the one-liners my DI would utter, just like Pvt Pyle. Fortunately, though, I wasn't forced to ""strangle myself"" like Pyle was. I thought that was a very powerful scene, one that melted your smile away as you watched it.<br/><br/>I don't understand why the DI was shot at the end of the first part of the film. Perhaps it's intended as just retribution because he was so harsh, but I think killing him sends the wrong message. The DI was not a ""bad guy,"" per se; he was doing the best job he could to prepare the recruits for combat. He was doing it so these guys would have the best chance possible to survive in war. My DI was like this guy: a strange blend of caring and meanness. And believe it or not, I carry with me fond memories of him, and always will.<br/><br/>The war in Vietnam certainly was a mistake. I was fortunate enough to survive my tour, but so many others weren't as lucky. I had close friends die.

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>Was this ""the best war movie ever made"" as the dust jacket proclaims, or just a contrived bit of entertainment, seductive, but ultimately paper thin? Or maybe this was anti-war propaganda with chuckles from a bleeding heart liberal? Looking back and seeing it again some fifteen years later (and about fifteen other years after the fact) one can say, ""no"" and ""no"" and ""something like that, thank you."" The sheer waste and stupidity of war is gotten across, and Kubrick is to be thanked for that. Comparing Full Metal Jacket to some other war movies, say, the pretentious Saving Private Ryan (1998), we note that it may be the funniest war movie ever made. (But then one recalls Mister Roberts (1955).)<br/><br/>Vietnam was a lovely war, as all wars are, kind of like America's loss of innocence. One would suppose we'd lost our cherry long ago at Gettysburg or somewhere thereabouts, but we proved in Vietnam it wasn't so. We helped to pile them high at Ypres and Verdun, but that was a limited engagement, and we learned jack-zero. And in World War II we really had no choice. But in Vietnam JFK and LBJ thought with a little use of force we could stem the tide of a feared ideology, not yet knowing it would start to die of its own accord, and so we sent off a few of our youngest and brightest as a small price to pay. Well, maybe not our brightest, just our unluckiest or perhaps just those stupid enough to go (""hell no, we won't go!"" said some) or poor enough to have no choice. Those who went were mostly ""young and dumb and full of come."" But, what the hey, wars are always a good way to kill off superfluous males. By the time we figured out we weren't getting any kind of bang for our buck, meaning we could pile them high at Da Nang or anywhere in the Mekong Delta and it wouldn't make a rat's ass worth of difference, it was too late. The body bags were coming home and some of the bro's of conscription age clearly didn't like the fit. They staged a protest or two, and amazingly enough a lot of people saw the wisdom of their position, and we were forced to declare a victory and pull out, this in the heyday of Tricky Dick.<br/><br/>Kubrick recalls those balmy times with boot camp ditties and a whole lot of well expressed jar head jargon to which he adds some amusing audio selections, e.g., Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots were Made for Walking,"" ""Paint It Black"" by Rolling Stones, and most appropriately in the classic Kubrick ironic style, the Mickey Mouse Club theme song, ""Em-eye-cee, kay-ee-why, em-oh-you-ees-ee! Mickey Mouse! Mickey Mouse!""<br/><br/>Kubrick got the story from the novel The Short Timers by Gustav Hasford, the title referring to those lucky soldiers with only a short time left before rotating back to ""the land of the big P.X.'s,"" the luckiest of whom were ""so short"" they could ""crawl under a rattlesnake's belly with a high hat on.""<br/><br/>Best poetic line: the lieutenant is telling Rafterman how to photograph Ann-Margaret, who is coming to entertain the troops, ""Take some low shots, but don't make it too obvious. I want to see fur and early morning dew.""<br/><br/>By the way, comparing this to Barry Levinson's fine Good Morning Vietnam from the same year, it's interesting to note that two directors independently came up with practically the same treatment of our experience in Vietnam, albeit with a different emphasis. I think they got it right."

"chaos-rampant","Null","3","8","26 November 2008"," A good first half that is bogged down by a meandering and pallid second one lacking a sense of urgency
","I know FMJ is widely lauded as a war movie classic, but I thought it was surprisingly weak. Is it because I saw Klimov's monstrous and harrowing WWII war film COME AND SEE the night before and FMJ inevitably suffers by comparison, even without me trying to force one? Could be. But I thought a relatively good (not great) first half is bogged down by a meandering and pallid second one that scavenges the ruins of Vietnam in search of meaning and momentum and comes up with canned one-liners.<br/><br/>Kubrick suffuses the second half with notions of false bravado and how American aggressiveness brushes off in young freshcuts. I didn't find any of it much riveting though, probably because the ideas are too damn obvious. I mean, if there's a more potent symbol for gung-ho right-wing patriotism to make fun of than John Wayne then I sure don't know about it. Now, I'm not one to suggest subtlety is the only way to go about in war movies. After all I love FIRES ON THE PLAIN and COME AND SEE and neither one is quite the epitome of that. I like being grabbed by the neck and plunged headlong in the grime and brutality and told SEE. I just don't think FMJ's politics were particularly successful.<br/><br/>And then you have the faux-interviews of the soldiers when one of them starts talking about how they're not fighting for freedom and how it's a slaughter and maybe they're shooting at the wrong *beep* Is Kubrick poking fun at war-is-hell genre conventions? That may very well be so even though I don't believe it. But what exactly is the point in that? I think what the second half severely lacks is a sense of urgency and foreboding, a sense of progression to a fateful conclusion. They're all laughing and teasing the Vietnamese hooker with the black guy's alabama snake in one scene, and in the next they're getting shot at by a sniper. Just a succession of scenes strung together in a haphazard manner. APOCALYPSE NOW is similarly constructed as a series of scenes that depict the American dream gatecrashing and being gatecrashed by the war but there's that sense of urgency that makes it riveting."
"Lando_Hass","5","5","18","8 July 2005"," Watch the first 40 minutes or so, then turn it off and do something more effective....like going to the bathroom.
","Full Metal Jacket. This title sounds cool. It sounds pretty bad-ass already. This movie had a reputation.and that reputation.stated that this movie was bad-ass and effective. It turns out, those people who said this movie was effective forgot to mention how utterly boring that last half was. I've taken craps that affected me more than the second half of this movie, honest to god.<br/><br/>The movie details some Army recruits through boot camp and the Vietnam War. The movie starts out in the boot camp process, where we're introduced to the characters. It's too bad that only two of those characters stand out: Private Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). Ermey is effective as the drill sergeant who terrorizes, insults, and tortures these people during boot camp. D'Onofrio plays Leonard Lawrence, nicknamed Gomer Pyle, an overweight, underachiever who gets attacked and insulted nonstop.until he can take no more! It's no surprise, folks, that you probably only know the name of these two characters, seeing as how you barely get to know the rest after these two exit the movie. These two characters make for one effective first 35 or so minutes. Unlike the rest of the movie, you actually feel an emotion other than boredom. You feel sorrow for Pyle because he's being tortured, and you want Ermey to desperately stay throughout the movie because he's the only person (next to D'Onofrio) that make the movie worth watching. I mean, come on, Shelley, come on. This movie builds up so much energy and some strong emotions in the first 35 minutes, so then what the hell went wrong after that? I'll tell you what, someone else stepped in and started adding touches to the script..probably.<br/><br/>After this first 35 minutes, and after Ermey and D'Onofrio leave the movie for reasons I won't say exactly, but I will tell you that it involves Gomer Pyle and Hartman getting a special airline ticket..TO DEATH! Well, let me get back to telling you about the separate movie that follows the first 35 minutes of this one: We are now watching a bunch of Army recruits in Vietnam, and the story of this movie is that they are supposedly ""Dehumanized"" by the war. If dehumanizing means putting in needless (and bad) music cues, and absolute boredom during the war scenes that are SUPPOSED to be effective, than yes, I guess you can say that these people are dehumanized. Come on, Shelley. I read that plot outline, expecting to truly see an effective movie about people dehumanized by war. I thought I was gonna see a truly dark movie that depicted dehumanized people. Nope. When you're in the middle of a war scene, and for no reason, you put in a music cue (terrible uppity-ass songs), that kind of destroys any chance of the movie making you feel any emotions other than complete awe because of how ridiculous what you're seeing is. Seriously, when Army recruits are spouting stupid cocky lines in the middle of a damn war, that really doesn't give you the feeling that they've been dehumanized, and when you put in subtle jokes during war scenes, that's just ridiculous. I expected to feel sorry and depressed as I watched this movie.<br/><br/>I should also add that none of these characters are interesting. They're just stupid, and when they get shot, you feel absolutely nothing for them, even when you should be. Honest to God, whenever one of these characters got killed, I was a little bit happier because I knew the movie was coming to an end. You almost forget that you saw such a great 35 minutes in a movie that's this crappy and BORING AS HELL.<br/><br/>I don't understand it. I can't understand how everyone loves this movie. I can guarantee, someone's reading this, and saying, ""Well hey, the reason why you don't feel any emotion during the last half is because none of the soldiers are feeling emotions, are you stupid, LOLLOLLOLlOL!!!"" Yeah sure. That's the reason why this last half was so boring and why there was so little character development. I'm expecting to see the following above this review: 0 out of 99 people found this comment useful, because apparently, if you don't like a Kubrick movie, and you don't like this one, you're an idiot and you have ""No understanding of the genius of this FILM or FILM in general."" <br/><br/>It's hard to believe that this movie started out so good and ended up so bad. That just goes to show you, only two characters truly can make a movie good. If it weren't for the first half in the boot camp, and the bad-ass song ""Paint it Black"" during the end credits, I'd hate this movie completely. Go watch Saving Private Ryan. At least you'll feel an emotion other than complete boredom. Or better yet, go watch the first 35 or so minutes of this, turn off the movie, and go take a crap. I guarantee, that first 35 minutes and that crap will be more effective than the entire last half of this movie. I've said it before somewhere, and I'll say it again: COMEDIC OVERTONES DO NOT BELONG IN A WAR MOVIE.<br/><br/>This movie's like a hamburger. The first parts are good, but the middle and last parts are terrible. That doesn't make any sense, but I don't care.<br/><br/>Score: 5<br/><br/>UPDATE: Now, the counter reads: 2 out of 6 people found the comment blah blah.

"pioneerstkd","6","2","5","5 June 2008"," Anti-war, anti-military, but Ermey's great
","When ""Full Metal Jacket"" premiered in 1987 we were only 12 years removed from Vietnam and still 14 years from the 9/11 attacks. I would submit that the public's views on Vietnam have changed since Kubrick made his film. Many Vietnam vets are now retiring and in recent years have finally been getting recognition for their service. The public's current determination to support the troops ""downrange"", fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, is a reflection of the shame we feel for the way we treated Vietnam vets back during their war. Even those who bitterly oppose the current war are quick to say they still support the troops---which to me his hypocritical, because how can you support people who are doing something you despise?<br/><br/>I bought the movie after my brother linked me to a YouTube cut of the opening scene in the barracks where the gunny dresses down the ""maggots"". A fan of Gunny Ermey, I enjoyed his performance, but from what I know of today's recruit training from TV documentaries and talks with current troops, many of Sgt. Hartman's methods would never be allowed in today's Marine Corps or other services. The training is tough and demanding and it must be so, because on the battlefield there is no room for sissies or cowards and attention to detail and willingness to follow orders are often life-or-death matters. Discipline is a must in a military unit and very few of today's young people, or those from any era, who enter the military have much in the way of self-discipline. <br/><br/>The second half of the movie, depicting the Marines in Vietnam during Tet, has anti-war imagery that is almost too obvious. The Marines are now shown to be less than orderly in their discipline and sometimes close to being psychotic. They have little or no regard for the Vietnamese people and have no compunction about ""wasting"" civilians. The only Marine who shows empathy for the natives is Joker, who conspicuously wears a peace button in violation of direct orders from his superiors (and is apparently never reprimanded). The South Vietnamese culture is depicted as corrupt, as the only South Vietnamese we meet are thieves, pimps and prostitutes. By contrast, the only North Vietnamese soldier we see is a teenage girl, who prays as she is dying, something no American is shown doing. (How can she be a loyal communist and still be religious?) The message is clear: the communists were noble patriots seeking to overthrow the corrupt Saigon regime which was being propped up by the imperialist Americans. Yes, there is the scene of Joker and Rafterman at the mass grave of South Vietnamese who have been murdered by the NVA, but the impact of the scene is lessened---indeed, its message completely turned around---when the officer describing the atrocity continually smiles for the camera and then the colonel upbraids Joker for wearing the peace button. What kind of message would Kubrick have sent had he shown the officer weeping as he described the murders, or had the angry colonel rip the button off Joker's vest and toss it into the grave, saying something like, ""These people could've used your (expletive) button, Marine. Then the peace-loving freedom-fighters would've left them alone, wouldn't they?"" <br/><br/>It's been said that historical perspective about an event or era can only be achieved some fifty years after the fact, especially once many or most of the principals have died and so more objective accounts of their lives and contributions can be written. Now some 35 years after the end of our Vietnam involvement, we are beginning to see some of this. <br/><br/>The Tet Offensive, launched by the NVA and VC during the holiday truce, was a sign of things to come; after all, Hanoi blithely ignored the Paris accords once their own military and infrastructure had sufficiently recovered from the pounding it received from us in the early '70s and Nixon, who had no qualms about sending armadas of B-52s over the North, was out of office.<br/><br/>Kubrick was undoubtedly a good filmmaker, but his films seemed often to be almost too cerebral for the average viewer, visually stunning but conceptually muddled. At least to those of us here in the heartland; it's not surprising that the critics who live on the enlightened coasts loved him so much."
"Steffi_P","6","2","5","23 June 2007"," ""We've got to try and keep our heads until this peace craze blows over""
","The major Vietnam anti-war films all took different approaches to the subject. Apocalypse Now cranked the war experience up into a surrealist nightmare. The Deer Hunter avoided dwelling on the conflict itself and instead focused on the psychological aftermath. Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, made at a later time when the Vietnam was coming to be regarded as the previous generation's war, focuses on the transformation of men into soldiers.<br/><br/>Like most of Kubrick's films, Full Metal Jacket is divided starkly into informal parts 1 and 2. Opening with shots of the recruits having their head shaved (their individuality literally being stripped away), part 1 looks at the training process. Kubrick emphasises the gruelling nature of this process with drab, Spartan sets, straight, symmetrical shot composition and scenes which are relentless and repetitive. It's the stronger half of the film  part 2 just isn't as tight, and despite it's being more varied some segments are just boring.<br/><br/>Compared to other Vietnam pictures, Full Metal Jacket has a rather small-scale, cheap look to it. This was the price Kubrick paid for his artistic independence. Having said that, it's impressive that the whole thing was shot in England (aided by one use of footage) and it demonstrates how much an imaginative director and design department can do with limited means. Take, for example, an abandoned industrial estate (of which England has had plenty of since the 1980s), remove anything that gives the location away, graft in a few palm trees, slap on some genuine signs and murals  and you have an authentic looking Vietnam battleground.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket isn't bad, but there are lots of things I don't like about it. Most of them are down to the screenplay. The dialogue isn't as smart as it thinks it is, full of philosophical pretensions and trite moralism. Kubrick makes some poor decisions as a director too. The over-the-top stylisation of Pyle's mental breakdown  brilliantly staged as it is  doesn't sit well with the realist, occasionally documentary approach used in the majority of the film. Later, in the combat scenes, he uses some really clichéd slow motion shots when people get shot. Peckinpah popularised that, and he's also one of the few directors who could get away with it. Here it just looks amateurish.<br/><br/>This is yet another Kubrick film which all too often gets overrated because it is startling and different. It has its strengths (there is some great use of music, although even that is disappointing compared to Kubrick's sublime rhythmic direction on Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon) but overall it's one of my least favourite of his."

All that legendary Kubrick meticulous scrutiny to detail simply seems 'absent' in this film's second half: when the theater goes 'Asia'. So because of his other films 'rea;ity' it annoys the crap out of me that he goes 'half-arsed' with this. The palm trees aren't even the native ones to that part of the world and they look planted because they are.The script; however, is simply divine.

","Full Metal Jacket is a rarity, a war film that, like ""Deer Hunter"" is not about way as much as one would assume. This movie is far more psychological than physical, and is roughly divided into 2 parts. The first is the boot camp part, and the second is the actual Vietnam tour of duty. The first part is absolutely incredible. If this were the movie, I would give it 10/10. We see privates Joker, Cowboy, Pyle, Snowball, and others, (mocking nicknames given to them by caustic drill sergeant Hartman) at boot camp, trying to endure the abuse and psychological brutality that the drill sergeant throws at them. Hartman is one of the all time favorite movie characters, and has the most imaginative ways of insulting people I've ever heard. While hilarious, it is also very disturbing to watch, as he routinely humiliates and demeans this young men. Then they go to Vietnam. The second part is certainly not as good as the first, but, contrary to what people say, it is certainly great, and not bad. They encounter a variety of odd and unique circumstances not often seen in war films; Vietnamese hookers and pimps, mass graves, propaganda, and, most memorably, insanity. The scene I refer to is the scene in which they are flying in the helicopter to their destination. The door gunner, more animal than human, and completely psychotic, is shooting at the fleeing civilians below, killing dozens, and laughing about it as he does. A scene that I did not easily forget. Obviously, this film is not for the kiddies. The language is harsh (particularly with Hartman) with at least 75 f words. The violence is realistic and gory, in particular a graphic suicide, and there are the aforementioned hookers. While not as masterful as some war movies, this nevertheless is a classic, and should be owned by any movie/history buff."

"bbraat","5","3","11","29 November 2006"," Two separate movies
","This film was really two separate movies that, like conjoined twins, should never have been joined and should be separated. The first movie was a terrifying expose of American military training and how people are changed by the experience. IT had a beginning, a middle, and an end. It had it's own moral and theme. That movie ended when the gun went off in the bathroom. That's it. End of that story. THEN some other movie started which was a 'slice of life' movie and thus no beginning, no middle, no end. It took place in Vietnam with many of the same characters that appeared in the other movie but was otherwise a meandering mess. An interesting side-note is that Anthony Michael Hall was the first actor hired to play Matt Modine's character Joker but was fired for arguing too much with the director. think about this, while Hall was a very well known comedy actor at the time, his comedy career was already tanking having had several flops and bombing on SNL. This would have been a great chance to segue into more serious acting the way Sean Penn did. At the very least he could have extended his career considerably. Instead, he faded out of the limelight and made the career of a lesser known Matt Modine. Modine came from a similar cinematic history as Hall but lasted much longer. It reminds me of how John Travolta invented Richard Gere's career by turning down the movies that made Gere famous. Or how Montgomery Clift similarly made James Dean's and Marlon Brando's careers."

"MaxBorg89","10","2","6","26 July 2007"," This film neither blows nor sucks: it punches the viewer right in the gut
","""In Vietnam the wind doesn't blow, it sucks"". This not-so-subtle tag-line (which actually led to some posters being censored in Canada) was used to advertise one of the most brutal war films ever made, one that still resonates with rage and gravitas: Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>Based on Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers, the movie can be distinctly divided in two sections. The first one takes place on Perris Island, a boot camp facility where newly recruited Marines are trained before going to fight in Vietnam. It is a brutal training, its aim being solely to turn innocent men into killing machines, and the lifelessness these soldiers are moving towards is evident from the opening sequence, where they all get their heads shaved without as much as blinking. That, however, is nothing compared to how they must put up with their instructor's foul-mouthed orders: Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) is one of the scariest film characters of all time, his verbal abuse of every single soldier, especially an obese kid he renames Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), being much worse than anything they could possibly experience in Asia.<br/><br/>This point is proved in the movie's second half, entirely set in the 'Nam, where Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine), having completed his training, leads the rest of the unit in a series of bloody missions, behaving in a way that openly contradicts the nickname he was given by Hartman.<br/><br/>Kubrick made another war movie at the beginning of his career, and though Paths of Glory (1957) resembles FMJ in its open anti-militaristic position, those two films couldn't be more different: the WWI drama dealt with the injustice of war that takes place outside the battlefield, while Jacket explores the effect of conflicts on the human psyche. In fact, it can be said that the film's analysis of mental distortion is a sort of expansion of themes previously covered in A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, the director's almost morbid passion for humanity's downfall being at its most explicit in those features (there are also echoes of 2001 in the legendary bathroom scene, HAL's actions being mirrored by one of the soldiers).<br/><br/>Strangely, though, the build-up turns out to be more shocking and memorable than the pay-off, the Vietnam section clearly suffering from Ermey's absence. The most frightening thing about his performance is of course the fact that he isn't acting: a real Marines instructor who was hired as a consultant for the picture's first half, Ermey was so committed to the job Kubrick hired him on the spot. It is not hard to see why: there aren't that many actors who could be able to shout obscenities the way he does, relentlessly, without ever repeating himself or hesitating (that he also improvised a large part, perhaps even all, of his dialogue adds to the character's iconic status). Thus, how powerful and unflinching it may be, the movie feels a little weak once he's out of the picture (pun not intended). Also impressive is D'Onofrio: best known for Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Men in Black, his portrayal of the miserable, incredibly overweight Pyle (the actor reportedly gained so much weight he actually injured himself during the shoot because he was too heavy) is among the most gripping ever seen in any film, especially when Hartman's violent methods start ripping out his humanity.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is a great film for its seemingly mythological take on the Vietnam war; Platoon is a milestone because it shows the conflict exactly as it was, unfiltered and brutal; as for Full Metal Jacket, it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath for showing that not all insanity starts in the war zone: sometimes it is woken up earlier, by our very own fellow countrymen.<br/><br/>9,5/10"
"burgershmurger","Null","2","6","29 December 2003"," overrated, lacking inspiration, derivative second half
","***MINOR SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Even though Stanley Kubrick deserved the adulation for several of his films, in the case of ""Full Metal Jacket"" one can't help but wonder at the praise and what he wanted to get across: The dehumanisation in war? Oh, what's new? We know war can be atrocious, but we also know war has sometimes been a necessary tool in history. The problem with most war movies is that they are too one-sided. They hardly ever depict the complex moral considerations leading to war. It seems as though all directors simply take to the anti-war side and they know they are on the safe side because ""war is evil"" you know. So does Kubrick . Does he give us the lowdown on the reasons for the war North vs South Vietnam? No. It was not as if the USA started this war. It was a conflict between democrats and communists. No doubt whose side America were on. But Kubrick never tries to elaborate on these issues. The American soldiers are merely victimised in a putatively unjustified war. The first half sees the recruits being drilled to inhumane killing machines. But what is the outcome? Are they really so dehumanised afterwards? No, they still display human emotions just before the drill. So what was Kubrick's point in the first half anyway then? Was it just the shock and entertainment factor he was after? It admittedly is very gripping and dwarves the second half which is just not memorable as it does not present the viewer with any new insight on war. The whole movie is inherently flawed and the ending just leaves you uninvolved as it is simply not as absurd or unimaginable as Kubrick might have assumed. First half: rivetting; second half: yawn! No big news from the war front. 5/10"
"rmax304823","Null","2","6","17 November 2003"," Definitely Kubrickian
","SPOILERS.  <br/><br/>Nobody in Hollywood would touch Vietnam with a ten-foot pole until Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" became a ""major motion picture.""  It was followed quickly by Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now,"" which had been in production for years.  And then came Kubrick's take, ""Full Metal Jacket,"" which, being last in the series and therefore not much of a novelty, didn't get the kind of reviews the first two had gotten.<br/><br/>A strange thing about all three of the films is that none was made by a first-line storyteller.  Stone's film was about good and evil that happened to be set in Vietnam.  Coppola's expressed his own obsessions.  (He announced to a French audience, ""My film isn't about Vietnam.  My film IS Vietnam.""  This got lots of applause because the French love big metaphysical statements.)  Kubrick's film has his fingerprints all over it. The lighting, the ironic humor, the static shots of people lined up motionlessly with regard to one another, the lowering skies of an unmistakable English twilight.  But, most relevant, its episodic structure. Kubrick gave us straight narratives, pretty much, with taut plots, until ""2001,"" when the structure became more, let us say, cubistic. <br/><br/>
This one is divided into two main parts, not quite independent of one another, although there isn't much overlap.  The first part is a hilarious and yet tragic view of Marine Corps boot camp.  R. Lee Ermy is fantastic and became a media icon after his performance here.  That the man is no real actor was demonstrated when he made a movie in which he plays a zombie or a pod person -- I forget the name of it, possibly a remake of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers.""  You will find that your memory of Ermy's idea of a zombie is indelible.  Part two of this film follows Mathew Modine to Vietnam where he undergoes various adventures.  This second section is filled with jokes that only half hide their dramatic content.  ""You've gotta hack it,"" says a Marine to his dying comrade, ""you're my favorite turd."" <br/><br/>
And there is an exchange between Modine and a colonel in the field that has more resonance today than it did when the film was first released.  The colonel snaps at Modine:  ""I ask nothing of my men except that they obey my every command as if it was the word of God.  We have to bring freedom to these people because inside of every gook there's an American trying to get out.  We've all got to keep our heads until this Peace craze blows over.""<br/><br/>I think it's a better film than it's usually credited for being.  The comedic leavening doesn't stop it from ultimately being a tragedy.  It ends on a note that is a mockery of jolliness, the Marines marching back to base singing the Mickey Mouse song from the TV program that they grew up with. But Modine has just deliberately shot and killed a wounded young Vietnamese woman who was a VC sniper, forsaking the jokes that had enabled him to keep his distance from the others.  (Watch the transformation in Modine's features as he aims his pistol and pulls the trigger.)  Some bunch of Mousketeers."

","From the very opening of the film it's just one great moment after an other. So much of this masterpiece is so very original, from the quotable lines to the perfect scenes. The film is very well acted and very well cast. Stanley Kubrick famously stated that he preferred adapting novels and improving upon them, and he proves his theory here. The use of music is great as well, particularly in the ending scene as well as in the one with the prostitute, which might be one if the single greatest scenes in any film ever. And while I'm not normally crazy about narration in film, it is very well done here. I've seen it many times and it never gets old. Some people don't enjoy it the first time, possibly due to the unusual structure, but I think if you watch it again you'll really get to see it for what it is: a masterpiece."

"nikxatz","9","1","2","9 August 2019"," Something about the duality of man
","Kubrick strikes again with a great, fun and genius film about this wild and nightmarish thing called war. Just like with some of his previous films like Paths of Glory or even A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick is not a director that gives a focus on facts but instead empasizes on the effect on human nature. In Full Metal Jacket, we carefully see how war targets at gradually dehumanizing every bit out of a human being. We want killers!<br/><br/>
The first act is a clear example of that, with a private being the tragic victim of the sickness of war. I have to admit I loved the first act, because it is fun and funny but at th same time it rips my heart and challenged my mind. The characters are brilliant to watch, the humour is so spot-on and there is so much meaning behind everything. The introducton scene is probably my favourite Kubrick intro ever. The clever use of the song, the symbolism behind the idea of it, the first look to our characters who lose a part of themsleves even rom the first scene.<br/><br/>
Now, the second act might be really slow-paced and kind of all over the place, but it is as meaningful as the first act. Our main character, Joker, though being a soldier, has maintained his morality and personality, he is not cold and still has not become a complete war machine, thuswe have the perfectly placed and written ""something about the duality of man"" scene. He has a heart, he cares for life. And then we see him fail to keep going like that, he has to comromise to the brutality of war and beocme a killer, a man born to kill, a war weapon and completely lose his individuality and character traits and morals.
The second act might be hard to follow, because of the lack of fast-pacing and humour, but it really takes the story to a meaningful finale and we are lead to a realisation about the cruelty of war and how it forcefully transfers a human into a war ultra killing machine. Just take a look at the first and last scene and you can see the transformation<br/><br/>
Perect camera move, even greater cenmatography, realistic sets and the soundtrack is a blast.<br/><br/>
One of the most meanigful and important war films ever."

","""Full Metal Jacket"" will always be judged by the shadow of previous Kubrick's movies. And that's why I think it could be much better. I watched it ten or more times and I always ask myself why Stanley Kubrick chosen this script. You can't forget that his previous movie was ""The Shining"" back in 1980 and he was desperate for a good story (not a statement about Vietnam war) and this option came as a surprise for everyone in the industry. The movie is build around characters and there wasn't much space for the attention for that little tiny microscopic detail, so important to Kubrick's work, that's why I consider it an atypical movie in his directing career. That care for the visual detail would return with his final and baroque movie."
"spenrh","7","1","2","9 January 2019"," First half much better than second
","I've read that Lee Ermy's sergeant in this movie is not an exaggeration from how many sergeants have acted towards their recruits during basic training, the only difference is now sergeants are no longer allowed to put their hands on the trainees. However, all the verbal action and style in how they push them through training is spot on.<br/><br/>Ermy, as Sergeant Gunnery, has the hapless Private Pyle as his favorite target due to his overweight, lazy, slacker yet smug attitude he had, well he started out smug before Gunnery broke his spirit. And he made sure to keep any of Pyle's laziness, his wiseacre tendencies, and his spirit away for good if he could help it. Much of the first half of the film is centered around the basic training and Ermy's constant belittling and bullying Pyle.<br/><br/>In the real life military basic training, most trainees like Pyle would've been discharged or dropped out before Pyle went anywhere. Ermy seemed to have had a special need for keeping him there as his punching bag. However, it could also be argued that maybe also he felt underneath that through enough pushing, he could eventually have made a real soldier out of Pyle. He was wrong about that, with the top climatic showdown of the movie (which was not near the end like in most movies) between Gunnery and Pyle, along with his famous ""what's yer major malfunction!!!?"", and the surprise (well, the surprise for someone not like me who seen this movie many times).<br/><br/>Other great moments during training including Pyle's reprocussions for sneaking in a donut (and the other recruits with the socks full of metal locks), the obstacle courses (particularly with Pyle's struggling through them), and the always tense introduction of the recruits with the Sergeant when standing down (along with the line copied from ""Officer and a gentleman"", ""Only steers and q****s come from Texas!! I don't see no horns!!"").<br/><br/>All above being the first half of the movie which was much better than the second. The second part took place in Vietnam, minus the two biggest characters from the first half, and was basically just another cutout copy of films on troops in Vietnam. And, there have really been better movies about troops fighting in Vietnam such as ""Platoon"", ""Good morning Vietnam"", and even in ""Forrest Gump"".<br/><br/>Arlis Howard was one of the main characters in the Vietnam section, who I remember from ""Plain clothes"" where he played an undercover cop posing as a highschool student to help solve a murder of one of the teachers. And there was that talked about prosritute scene in the Vietnam part which I didn't find that great. I honestly have on several occasions only watched this movie to see the basic training half, and have only seen the movie all the way through about half the times I've seen it."

The first half has you laughing in part but incredibly sad at the way some of these marines are brought up to fighting status. In particular we see one man totally broken by it and this takes us to a harrowing scene and the beginning of the second half.<br/><br/>What we get in the second half is not a massive amount of action and it kinda follows around 5 main characters that have survived the humiliation, gutsy training and sheer brutality in the first half. They with their patrol come across an isolated small battle for their life and that's both physical and mental and for me with the score one of great mental horror...a simple scene but so damned powerful and strong.<br/><br/>This film was actually 98% filmed around 3 miles from my home in London England along the Thames in Docklands where a regeneration programme to build new homes was taking place...I could actually hear the bombs going of when they were filming it and didn't know what it was till I saw it mentioned in local news.<br/><br/>It's frickin awesome, powerful, sad, angry and as I said one of the best war films there are...."

","The director's intention was to provide an image of a Marine's daily life. The scenes that helped the director's intentions was a specific scene in which the marines were sitting around talking and bidding on a girl while the rest of them were fighting and another scene where the soldiers are lounging around while the tanks are blasting. Also, when the general pushes them to their limits leading to mental breakdowns. This scene supports my claim because the movie illustrates the marine's life of how they fight and protect our lives while risking theirs and suffering at the same time. The plot of the movie is how all the privates graduated to be marines except one that killed himself and when they became marines they fought in the Battle of Hue in Vietnam. The main plot in the movie fails because someone kills himself and at the end three marines die. The acting felt forced but also authentic. The actors did not show their full potential but authentic because you would always hear a general screaming. Cinematography is an important aspect of this movie. The cinematography helps the director's intention of a marine's daily life, but the particular shots that made it worse were the shooting animated blood and fake props. I rate this movie 7/10 because I really like how the director made a movie based on a marine's life and made it interesting and fun. I also believe that the acting and plot was not executed perfectly and needed more potential and the action is more waiting and not enough suspense or thrill. All in all the movie is great and I encourage you to take some of your time to watch this."

","Full Metal Jacket was released in 1987 and was directed by Stanley Kubrick. It is about a marine nicknamed Private Joker (Matthew Modine) and his journey through the Vietnam War, starting in Boot Camp and eventually ending up in the war itself.<br/><br/>The film begins in boot camp and is certainly the strongest part of the movie. This act is dominated by the Drill Instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and the performance given by Ermey is absolutely fantastic. The fact that Ermey used to be a drill instructor himself certainly added to his performance and something that was unusual for a Kubrick film was that he allowed Ermey to improvise his lines which made for a more unpredictable performance. Another great part about this act was the character Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) and D'Onofrio's great performance. His character displayed the dehumanising side of the war and was something rather unnerving to watch. I also must mention that Matthew Modine is really good as Private Joker and over time he becomes a character to root for.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film's second act is a drop in quality. The majority of it was just mindless fighting scenes with no real context and it was something that got dull quite quickly. However, we are introduced to multiple new characters such as Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) which was a high point of this act.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film redeems itself with its gripping final act, which shows Kubrick knows how to direct a suspenseful sequence. The act shows the group of marines up against a sniper, however the sniper is nowhere in sight and they must act fast due to one of their own being slowly killed by the sniper. The sequence has little-to-no sound which adds to the suspense and with one of their own being gradually injured adds to the sense of urgency. Overall, this is a sequence that left me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>The film is a huge mix of all sorts of emotions; the film is mostly satire which Kubrick has proved himself to be a master of with Dr. Strangelove. Some instances of satire include Sergeant Hartman's constant insults; while you know what he is saying is very unpleasant, it's very humorous at the same time. Kubrick could've been trying to point out the ridiculous nature of boot camp in the sequence and would be another anti-war message which he is famous for with films like Paths of Glory and of course Dr. Strangelove. As well as satire, the film also has some very dark sequences, such as the final act which really does show what an unpleasant thing war was and how lives simply don't seem to matter anymore.<br/><br/>Overall, Full Metal Jacket is a unique war film which is full of many variations of emotions and themes. The performances given by the cast are all great too and while the film does have a rather dull and senseless second act, the final act certainly makes up for it.<br/><br/>8.2/10"

The scene steal the nut job sergeant played by the real life sergeant Ronald Lee Ermey ,who is also the sergeant in Toy Story ,true story (:))!<br/><br/>The second part of the movie is in Vietnam in which the devastation is more or less a mandating thing and the soldiers there seem to be calm in a alarming level. For Christ sake they sing ""Micky Mouse"" while marching with casualties of war left and right!!! In short the movie shows with a brutal way that human aren't meant to be in War, for in War we go mad and nothing is holy then.<br/><br/>In short you should watch, if you haven't already' for it is a landmark of cinema and a blush of flick in general. Have a good time!"

","An awesome movie by Stanley Kubrick, not his best one, but still outstanding. ""Full Metal Jacket"" shows the ups and downs of army life, i love how the first half of the movie focuses on how it is to be in marine corps. To be honest, the first part was more action packed than the second part, which was about an actual war, not training.<br/><br/>I can't say i was really fascinated about how the war in Vietnam was displayed here, sure, the effects and scenery created was stellar for a movie from 1987, but i didn't feel the intensity i should have felt. They never really directly faced their enemies and didn't show too many fights between them. Yeah there were like 2 small skirmishes and that's about it. In my opinion the ending was kind of lack luster too, i really could not find it enjoyable, this is one of those great movies with a bad ending, unfortunately.<br/><br/>If it was only for the marine corps part of the movie it would have definitely been a 10/10, loved their training, struggles, Sergeant Hartman was just an awesome character. Still people, who really enjoy war movies are going to like this and enjoy it throughout. A Recommended watch!"
"bryank-04844","10","1","2","12 August 2015"," 'Full Metal Jacket' is an intense yet darkly funny war film that continues to force us to question the duality of man as Joker so delicately put it.
","After five years spent making 'The Shining', Stanley Kubrick decided to venture once again into the war genre. This time, the focus is on the Vietnam war in 1967, centering on a group of marines going through intense bootcamp and traveling overseas to fight. Adapted from Gustav Harsford's book 'The Short Timers', Kubrick has concocted a masterpiece of war with deep themes of humanity and the struggles to be good and evil. The film itself plays out like a two-act play with half of the film taking place inside the first day of bootcamp, going through graduation. The latter half is war itself as we follow one particular marine with the handle of 'Joker' (Matthew Modine).<br/><br/>Set to the excellent music of the 60s, we see America's youths getting every strand of hair from the hair cut off. I think Kubrick wanted to show us how our humanity is basically stripped and taken away once we enter the military so we can be reborn and trained again as a vicious killer in order to keep the peace. It's quite ironic, as 'Joker' states in the middle of the film when he is questioned on why he has a peace symbol on his marine helmet. He answers with, ""It's supposed to suggest the duality of man.""<br/><br/>And Kubrick wanted to show Joker's journey as he sees both the good and bad in humanity. A lot of people say that the first half of the film that takes place at bootcamp is the better part of the film if not the only part of the film you need to watch. And while it is quite fun to watch Gunnery Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) yell at everyone for the better part of an hour, the actual war shows us just how some marines take to the atrocities of war. Some are sadistic, some are funny, and some are cautious.<br/><br/>But when faced with the most extreme circumstances, our basic human instincts are usually the same. It's what keeps us moving forward as Kubrick shows in the final moments of this brilliant war film. And Kubrick's inclusion of all the actual Mickey Mouse songs and props were genius throughout the film. It was a subtle way to show us that in fact the marines thought this war and evil was indeed crap, hence the term Mickey Mouse was used as slang to describe something as amateur. And add to that all the marching and singing in the Mickey Mouse Show and it standing for American, Kubrick was on to something here, showing us through visuals and singing this theme song what we all really thought of the war as an entire city burns to the ground.<br/><br/>It's truly a remarkable film with some damn fine performances by Modine and Ermey, but a little known actor at the time by the name of Vincent D'Onofrio delivers one of the best performances of that year and is still most recognized for this movie today (other than playing Thor in 'Adventures in Babysitting'). But his character Pvt. Pyle goes through such an intense time, that D'Onofrio transforms into something unrecognizable from when we first meet him with a smile he can't seem to remove. It's one of the more powerful scenes in cinema when we see Pvt. Pyle for the last time. 'Full Metal Jacket' is an intense yet darkly funny war film that continues to force us to question the duality of man as Joker so delicately put it. And Kubrick's camera-work, once again is the best there is."

","Full Metal Jacket is undoubtedly the finest war film I have ever seen. Startlingly authentic and deeply intimate, the film is carried by a sharp screenplay, spectacular direction and some bravos performances. Though the film does have central characters, the main character here is the war itself and the story of recruit to hero. Some may argue that Matthew Modine's Private Joker should have been a more developed character, but I would argue he was given just the right amount of depth.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes - the story of Staff Sergeant Hartman and Private Pyle - is a flawless masterpiece. A combination of Hartman's spectacular one-liners, delivered with such flawless execution, and Vincent D'Onofrio's Oscar-worthy and woefully under shadowed performance, for the entire first act of the film I was captivated. The drills are real, the characters are real, and the mental anguish of Gomer Pyle is very real. The film dips very slightly when we go to Vietnam, as it misses any characters with the memorability of Pyle and Hartman. However, the film's superb screenplay and frighteningly staged battle scenes - superior in feel if not quality to every other war film I've seen - more than keep you engrossed. <br/><br/>Kubrick's direction is masterful. There are moments throughout - tracking shots, behavioural quirks of minor characters, the dialogue of a dying Vietnamese, the hiring of R Lee Ermey - that scream ""master of his field"". In one scene, a lieutenant is asked about casualties as he stands next to a war grave. Clearly unaware of what to do, he constantly stops and smiles for the camera, a horrific juxtaposition given the horror just behind him. It is moments like this where Kubrick is to be considered in the conversation for Best Director of all time."
"Smoky","9","1","2","21 March 2015"," Ain't war hell?
","Yes, indeed, war is hell. And a lot of men seem to enjoy it. Like the crazy helicopter gunman in Full metal Jacket that utters this phrase after explaining his techniques of shooting women and children. But also the other characters we meet, like Private Joker, take a keen pleasure in killing. We follow them trough their Marine boot camp, where they learn to connect their sexuality with their killing instincts, through more or less random events in the Vietnam war, where they have an alternating lifestyle between fighting and having sex either with a prostitute or on their own, into the final showdown where - at the peak of the movies irony - a woman turns out to be the most effective killer.<br/><br/>It took me almost to decades and several viewings to vaguely understand what Kubrick is trying to say with this movie. It's of course a bitter and cynical war movie, but ultimately the real message is about the relation of men and women and how this tension so drastically shapes our world.<br/><br/>Compared to Kubricks other war movies - Dr. Strangelove and especially Paths of glory - this one doesn't hold up quite that well. While the inevitable logic and human nature itself drive the plot forward forcefully in these other pieces, this one is more of a philosophical statement about human nature and it is very dark and cynical indeed. I would not count it among Kubricks best, but it nonetheless is a really great movie."
"noebes2","9","1","2","26 February 2015"," A masterful war film
","""This is my riffle. There are many like it but this one is mine"". This cue could encompass this excellent movie released in 1987. Eight years after the end of the Vietnam War, Stanley Kubrick decided to depict it in a very original way, by representing the war as a tragic love story between a man and his weapon.<br/><br/>The film is divided in two complementary parts. The first one focuses on a training camp, in which we follow a young man nicknamed ""Joker"" discovering the life in a barrack, and being bullied and humiliated by his sergeant. It is a transcription of the human relationships that appear when a hundred men renounce to think by themselves, which leads to terrible consequences. The second part shows Joker covering the Vietnam War as a correspondent for the newspaper ""Stars and Stripes"". We follow him from the rear to the very front, so we can confront the views of different unconventional characters about their situation.<br/><br/>The originality in Kubrick's film is that he doesn't present the war as a hell where human are sent to being slaughtered, on the contrary of the majority of war films: blood is here considered as a God. And the dichotomy in the structure permits to distinguish the dogmatic part (the training) and the fanatic one (the fight). This religious presentation of the situation implies that the film is not the story of one person discovering the war: it's a real fresco of the soldiers. We are confronted to the ones who live killing, the ones who are disgusted, the ones who have become mac because they couldn't stand what they were doing Blood is omnipresent, as a powerful and evil character.<br/><br/>But the most important and stunning part of Kubrick's work is that he manages to transcribe the atmosphere of this very odd period, split between the horror of the war and the societal progresses of the sixties. The film is a superposition of contrasts, between good and bad, silence and noise, color and gray, calmness and violence For example, Kubrick's alters long shots and very rapid cuts to oppose the cohesion and the hatred between soldiers. The music, that is nearly absent of the movie, appears once in the second part and is in total contradiction with the horror of the images shown. The paroxysm of those contrasts is when the soldiers joke about John Wayne on the battlefield.<br/><br/>So in summary, Kubrick's movie mixes human relations, numerous representations of soldiers, a stunning direction Definitely a masterpiece."
"tangietangerine","9","1","2","4 August 2014"," ""The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir""
","I'll start by saying I was never exactly fond of war movies, and so my judgment would be prejudiced, but seeing that this is not only a ""war movie"", I guess I'll go on. By 1987, we had already seen great anti-war films, such as Platoon and Apocalypse Now, and Full Metal Jacket may be put in the same category most of the time, but that only shows how Kubrick was once again misunderstood. Not that there's anything wrong about making a statement through a film, especially when the subject is war, but I think what this movie shows us is how things can't be really that black on white all the time.<br/><br/>Matthew Modine's character, Private Joker, represents perfectly what the movie has to say, in my opinion, which is to show how people are often confronted with so many different impulses and conflicts that go a long way beyond whichever moral principles a society can convey. It's the duality of man, ""that Junguian concept"", expressed by Joker to explain the bitter irony in his combination of a peace symbol button and the ""Born to Kill"" engraved on his helmet. It'd be very much simpler to just state that war is wrong for this and that reasons, that we all know, but to show the other side of it renders a much richer analysis.<br/><br/>Joker might have thought that the Drill Instructor was an asshole and pitied Private Pyle, but it's clear that he also took pleasure in being one of the best of the squad and not being in Leonard's shoes. We are led to believe he is a ""good"" character, as opposed to figures like the drill instructor, but in the end, he is the one who ends up shooting the Vietnamese girl and then returns home with his mind clear, thinking of nothing but a well-awaited homecoming lay. Private Pyle and the girl shooter are nothing but war casualties now. To me, that's the genius thing about Full Metal Jacket, it gives you the feeling of being a politically correct war movie, but I think it hits a much more subconscious nerve when it refuses to state anything but things as they really are."
"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","8","1","2","9 April 2014"," The duality of man
","The movie follows a group of aspiring young men as they endure the trials of basic training in their quest to become Marines and, ultimately, soldiers in the Vietnam War. In the first half of the film, Privates Joker and Pyle struggle through the mentally and physically tiring stresses which are intensified by the strict guidance of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The second half of the film is set in Vietnam. Privates Joker and Rafterman go out into the field to get a firsthand account of the bloodshed and atrocities of war.<br/><br/>The basic training scene alone could have given the movie a fantastic rating right from the start. It was not only hilarious but also very true to life. It also shows how hard and stressful basic training is for the soldiers that go through it. It shows just how fragile some people's minds can be in such stressful situations as well. It makes you realize just how strong the notion of patriotism is. It's a word that can put a nation to collectively agree to go to war or make someone put themselves in a situation that they know they can't handle.<br/><br/>Contrasting the limits is the hellish chaos of Vietnam, where Marines can try to march in line, but the unpredictable can, and will, throw them off. The film as a whole is distinguished by how intimately it depicts the psychological impact on the Marines, whose cracking faces are often quietly observed in close-ups. Joker and his boys go to war mimicking John Wayne movies and expecting to be heroes in the same sort of Western showdowns. What they get instead are abusive sergeants, hookers with tuberculosis, people who don't want to be saved, and a shootout so traumatizing that, by the end of it, they revert back to infancy for security, chanting the Mickey Mouse song just to get by.<br/><br/>It details the lives of several Marine Corps. Infantrymen. The most recognizable is that of ""Private Pile"". Private Pile is not your standard Marine Corp. soldier, as he is on the overweight side and a bit clumsy. Pile must also survive the basic training of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman, who gives him utter hell as he progresses through training. his movie has many iconic and classic quotes that have made it a classic. As far as philosophical content , there are some morality questions that may be raised; especially those about how soldiers are trained and how another individual can decide whether an individual lives or dies. However, those seem to be some of the realities of war.<br/><br/>This film is darkly humorous, uncompromisingly brutal, and subversive in every way, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is easily one of the best war movies without being remotely similar to your standard issue war flick. Through out it all though, Kubrick is subversive, funny, and offensive to authority, which fits in well with his style. I think Kubrick again draws you in by showing you the true nature of war and the character of the me n required to go fight and die; they are humans each and every one, just like us all."
"neeraj31071991","9","1","2","24 December 2013"," Much more than just a war movie, Kubrick nailed it!
","Full Metal Jacket begins with perhaps the most enjoyable forty-five minutes in the history of all film. FMJ is one of my all time favorite movies by one of my favorite directors. This movies is just another staple in Kubrick's more than impressive film career. Unlike Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan, FMJ takes a look into a soldiers Psyche. It shows us how these guys actually went through hell to become Marines and how they are put under so much stress and pressure. Its more about their journey into the war than the war itself and that's what makes this movie stand out. Just an incredible film that is sure a classic. The totality of war, from the loss of self to ultimately the loss of life, has never been as thoroughly examined as in Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.Its not only about of what does a soldier lives on the battle field is also all the process it take to become a man a killing machine, an excellent psychological movie that show you other side of the war stories."

","This movie is great. Great story, great acting and a lot of memorable scenes. You know a movie is good if you here quotes from it on a regular basis from people who probably don't even know where the saying came from (ie the younger generations).<br/><br/>I love how it takes you from boot camp to the war and lets the viewer experience every aspect of the Vietnam war. It was a gritty time and the movie pulls no punches: if you are creating killing machines you have to be tough. Unlike todays army that is volunteer, most were there not by choice and the basic training scenes show the deconstruction of a boy and the construction of a soldier.<br/><br/>The war scenes show these newly minted soldiers struggling to maintain their human element. We watch as the try and find balance between taking lives and knowing they will have to live theirs upon return.<br/><br/>Many of these actors went on to play other great roles and I can't help but think it was due to their involvement with Full Metal Jacket."
"axel-koch","9","1","2","22 July 2013"," An outstanding and unique war movie
","In 1987, 30 years after he'd firstly dealt with the subject of war in Paths of Glory, legendary American auteur Stanley Kubrick returned to the award-promising genre and released Full Metal Jacket. While it neither got the praise nor the awards it deserved when it came out, it has since then become a fan favorite and one of Kubrick's most beloved movies.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is split in two cohesive parts: the first and shorter one setting place at a military boot camp in South Carolina and the second one depicting the actual war events in Vietnam. The audience's relationship to the characters is supposed to be very distant and Kubrick lets us know very little about them. The narrator, nicknamed Joker, is a spectacled young man that believes to see through the military indoctrination. He tries to resist the system and, as he says himself, is only here to be the first kid on his block to get a confirmed kill. This is, of course, highly unconventional for a war movie protagonist and Matthew Modine plays him in a realistic, yet not particularly likable manner. Vincent D'Onofrio portrays the burly and universally untalented Private ""Gomer Pyle"", who gets permanently insulted and degraded by the vulgar and loud Drill Sergeant Hartman, who is played extraordinarily well by R. Lee Ermey, who was a real-life Drill Sergeant some time before. His eloquent and absolutely R-rated speeches are hilarious and simply the best part of the movie. It's sad somewhat, that his character doesn't accompany the recruits in the Vietnam War that follows; at some parts, I really wished for awesome one-liners like "" I bet you're the kind of guy that would f*** a person in the a** and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach-around!"" But let's not be too harsh: the second part, if remarkably more serious, is again entertaining and because of the excellently crafted war scenes utterly gripping.<br/><br/>Typically for a Kubrick film, Full Metal Jacket has a lot of ongoing themes and motifs in it that you may not even recognize when watching it for the first time. He's dealing with sexuality and not only in the two scenes in which Vietnamese hookers appear. The recruits have an absurd relationship with their rifle - especially D'Onofrio's character - and in the film's second part the killing scenes seem to bring an orgasmic feeling to the soldiers. Furthermore, you can probably correctly interpret religious imagery as well as father-mother-child themes into the movie - the minute director Stanley Kubrick is likely to have intended all of them. But you don't even need to think about the film in such a 'sophisticated' way, Mr. K shows a great game with the war scenes already. There may not be as many as in genre classics Apocalypse Now or Platoon and, admittedly, they don't have the aesthetic greatness that the ones in the aforementioned Coppola flick had. However, what Full Metal Jacket has is an authenticity that is even more impressive if you are aware that the Vietnam scenes where in fact shot in a disused gas work in the vicinity of London. Kubrick made the most out of it and also did terrific work with the sound and the editing which is impeccable.<br/><br/>Because Kubrick wanted to make the recruits as one multi-persona character, there isn't as much to find out about the individual characters as some people may have wished for. Yet still, there is a very interesting and often only subliminal character study on the protagonist, Private Joker. Most of all, while Full Metal Jacket has the same view on war as the majority of other war films (even though the movie's protagonist is a war advocate, Kubrick himself is, of course, against war - I hope you noticed that), it shows us something new. A partly documentary and partly alarming new take that could have been boring. Thanks to Kubrick, it's not. <br/><br/>At least not at the first time watching it - the prolonged war scenes lose their thrill once you know what's going to happen."

","This is a great movie that really depicts the life of a recruit going through Marine Corps Recruit Training. It is so real and straight to the point. Even with the additional Hollywood input in the movie, it still displays that reality that recruits go through to become United States Marines. Skip to the Viet Nam half of the movie. The Tet Offensive was a great part of the history of the Viet Nam war and this movie captures that history in great detail. The scenes of the fighting in the city is unique because most Viet Nam movies only show the fighting in the jungles and the rice patties and villages. Stanley Kubrick outdid himself with this movie and R. Lee Ermey immortalized himself as the Senior Drill Instructor and as the Gunnery Sergeant that everyone will always think of when anyone mentions the Marine Corps. Mathew Modine was outside himself in this movie and played a character that is totally outside of his normal range of characters. I give him a 10 along with R. Lee Ermey a 10 as well."
"adeck14","10","1","2","16 April 2013"," ""war is hell""
","WARNING: this review may contain spoilers <br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is by far one of my favorite war movies. This movie, in my opinion is very much anti-war. Upon entering boot camp, the soldiers are still normal in the sense that they have not been stripped of their individuality. However,as we see with Sgt. Hartman's statements like, ""You're not even human f-ing beings"" and ""you are all equally worthless,"" the marines are not made up of a group of individuals: they are a part of a mean, lean, fighting machine.<br/><br/>To become a part of this machine, the soldier has to be dehumanized. As we see in the film, the soldiers are subject to strict, systematic instruction that is supposed to bring about a methodical obedience. In this context, even the most harmless of men can become ruthless killers. This says a lot about human nature in general: we use violence to survive, or obtain peace and security. While this may be the ultimate goal and purpose of the military and war, Full Metal Jacket does a great job at painting a very different picture.<br/><br/>The soldiers leave boot camp ready to fight and kill. Raptor Man complains about not having to shoot his gun at all after 2 years of being in Vietnam. Other soldiers boast about how many kills they have had. It becomes clear that these soldiers are not fighting for honor, liberty, or whatever we are told by our government (at least in this context). They are doing what they are trained to do (or, as the logo says on Joker's helmet, ""Born to Kill""). They are trained to kill the enemy, and all Vietnamese are seen as the enemy. The Vietnamese are not seen as human beings, which is made apparent when the soldier in the helicopter shoots at innocent civilians. While I realize this is not the case for every soldier, it does coincide with the whole idea of ""war is hell."" This is the picture Stanley Kubrick is trying to paint for us: war is hell, seemingly normal men are capable of committing atrocities against other human beings, and this is all in the name ofwhat? <br/><br/>I give this movie 10 out of 10. This movie is a must-see for fans of all genres. The acting, script, and cinematography is amazing!"

","I was too young to be in Viet Nam, but from the comments that I hear about this movie from those who were there, this movie has realism that still affects them emotionally.<br/><br/>This is probably the best role Mathew Modine has played up to that point. Not all the soldiers were like soldiers in this movie but I guess that's what the reality of it was at the time. The dichotomy or what didn't make sense was why did mostly middle class Americans have to be sent into this brutal war, that United States had no moral reasons to be involved.<br/><br/>The part that was most memorable was the scene where a Viet Namese sniper took out an American soldier. One second you're alive, next second you're dead. I could see why you could be psychologically distressed after seeing something like that.<br/><br/>To me many of the things that happens in this movie didn't make much sense. I guess you had to be there to understand it. The movie had a mood like no other movie I've seen.

"Kubris","9","1","2","28 May 2012"," Well, pilgrim, only after ya...
","IMDb Top 250: 87<br/><br/>Like Joker's view of men, Full Metal Jacket is filled with duality: in the plot, structure, characters and theme. The only singular conclusion that can be drawn is that it is a great film, one of Kubrick's best.<br/><br/>Famously FMJ follows Private Joker's time in boot camp, and then part of his experience in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. Primarily the film is about 'dehumanization', saying that the war experience strips men of their identities. But, unlike many, many war films, this is not in tandem with the message of ""war is bad"". I found that Full Metal Jacket doesn't choose to suggest that nature or civilians suffer, or convey the futility of war, but instead to primarily push that the soldiers involved lost a part of their humanity. I also fond the film to be decidedly pro- war, at least in comparison to films. This is suggested by the attitude of the soldiers, shown laughing and joking with each other, shooting up the bad guys with upbeat rock n' roll playing.I'm not saying Kubrick was pro- war, as he has made several films with opposite intentions, but that this is an interestingly refreshing angle for a war film.<br/><br/>Characters are a key strength here, with a very colourful cast. Most notably and iconic is Hartman with his incredible insults. Of course he's scary and dominates every scene for the first half of the film, but some of his material is very funny, like his view on Texans and Lawrence (of what, Arabia?). I'd comment on the extraordinary script here, but R. Lee Ermey improvised many of his lines. But the script is excellent, with the film summary being a favourite quote of mine. Hartman's tone, scary and funny, is present throughout, wavering constantly, as the line between light and heavy material is often straddled.<br/><br/>Our protagonist is nicknamed Private Joker, and that's all we really learn about him. He's the straight character in this zany world, levelheaded and intelligent. I'm reminded of Nick from The Great Gatsby, but more likable and witty. But not even worldly Joker is safe from the effects of the war he observes in others.<br/><br/>Then there's poor, Private Pyle. All Hartman wanted to do was weed out the weak, to avoid sending the unprepared into the heat of combat. He was tough, very tough, probably too tough, as shown by the comparison between Hartman and Joker's teaching methods. However he was excellently acted and believably led to the shocking conclusion.<br/><br/>I've forgot to mention with the past several Kubrick films how technically strong they are, but I can't avoid it with this one. The sets are lively, the sound is booming, the costumes have personality and the cinematography is strong. It's difficult to believe the whole thing was shot in Britain.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is one of the best war movies ever made, affecting its viewers in a way I can't quite understand. This is one of Kubrick's finest, and one of the most prolific pieces of pop culture he made. Witty, somber, outstanding. 9.0/10"
"Desertman84","10","1","2","6 March 2012"," Full Metal Jacket:Kubrick's Extremely Violent Vietnam War Film
","Full Metal Jacket is a war film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick. It is an adaptation of the 1979 novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford and stars Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, R. Lee Ermey, Arliss Howard and Adam Baldwin. The film follows a platoon of U.S. Marines through their training and the experiences of two of the platoon in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. The film title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by infantry riflemen.<br/><br/>This film crystallizes the experience of the Vietnam War by concentrating on a group of raw Marine volunteers. The first half details the volunteers' harrowing boot-camp training under the profane, power-saw guidance of drill instructor Sgt. Hartman.While the second half takes place in Nam, as seen through the eyes of the now thoroughly indoctrinated marines.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is not a realistic film -- it is horror-comic surrealism, from a God's-eye view -- but it should fully engage the ordinary movie grunt.This is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since Dr. Strangelove, as well as the most horrific; the first section alone accomplishes most of what The Shining failed to do.Aside from that,it was the harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric new film about Vietnam, is going to puzzle, anger and fascinate audiences as much as any film he has made to date.Finally,it was an extremely graphic, violent Vietnam War film."
"gigan-92","10","1","2","14 February 2011"," ""I love the commie bastards""
","Stanley Kubrick is one of the finest directors to have ever lived. He has made genuine and breath taking works of art in an each and every last genre, from sci-fi, to horror, drama and so forth. Naturally, when Kubrick took on a war film, it was bound to be stunning. The result is just as expected. It's pretty standard for people to distinguish the film as almost two separate movies. To me, that isn't so. The first 'half' is merely to show that the dehumanization starts in training. The inner demons, the act of killing, is brought out to its fullest by their Gny. Sgt. Hartman, played excellently by the awesome R. Lee Ermey. It is also clearly depicts that some men are not as attuned to this natural instinct as others, as seen in Private Pyle who's struggle to become one of these well groomed and structured killers leads to his untimely insanity. Vincent D'Onofrio was just plain psychotic looking, and was so damn good in his role, it frightened me. In a sick but all too true sense, the characters are trained to let go of decency, morality and mercy, as long as they accomplish their mission in the war.<br/><br/>In reality though, who am I to say I'd live up to the 'codes of conduct' of war in the field? Who are any of us to say so? Many of us have not been in the heat of battle, had to watch our friends blown to pieces, or the fatal decision to take a life you really don't know. That is the struggle of Joker, who Matthew Modine played excellently by the way. The whole cast portrays this loss of human compassion that savage war has engraved in them. Aliss Howard as Cowboy was pretty good as well, but I loved Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother who has a understandably nihilistic view of it all. I'll never forget his helmet writing, ""I Am Become Death"", from the Bhagavad Gita.<br/><br/>It's incredibly hard to name my favorite scene, not just because there are so many to choose from but because of the disturbing content. Sure, there are small jokes here and there, but under lying the whole Vietnam segment is an atmosphere of a strangely accepted brutality which Rafter Man calls ""hardcore"". Whether it to be the scene of Sergeant Crazy Earl's ""best friend's birthday"" or the Alabama black snake scene, it's all just great to watch. Perhaps it's Tim Coleri's scenes as the door gunner. As the bodies fall, all he can do is laugh and accept that war is truly hell. All together a masterpiece of film work and a war film that ranks among the best ever shot."
"secondtake","7","1","2","6 July 2010"," Well made, with punch, but very straight forward for Kubrick
","Full Metal Jacket (1987)<br/><br/>An extremely straight forward, funny, and tragic Vietnam War movie, going from the excessive rigors of boot camp to the hard core horrors of hand to hand combat. <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick shows the bare bones of it, without romanticizing, and without making heroes out of anyone. There are two main emotional turning points, one at the end of boot camp, and one near the end of the movie, and both are about the madness of war and about death. And both are pulled out of the mainstream thread of the story with a jolt. It's sensationalism, really, but made with Kubrick rigor. <br/><br/>A balance to all the horror is the humor, not as insane as, say Dr. Strangelove, but with a similar dry wit. The first forty minutes of the film are justly famous for their almost campy but still believable scenes of the sergeant training young Marines. (And this sarge is a real Vietnam vet who did this kind of training.)<br/><br/>Compare this movie to Platoon and you'll see a much more restrained movie, and without the jungle warfare we usually associate with Vietnam. Platoon makes people out to be larger than life, and Kubrick intends more to say, hey, this is the real deal, whatever cinematic tricks are showing. <br/><br/>But compare this to Apocalypse Now or Deer Hunter and you might start to wish Kubrick hadn't played it so straight. Full Metal Jacket lacks, above all, imagination, and as a movie, it needs it."
"sddavis63","9","1","2","12 July 2009"," Perhaps Stanley Kubrick's Best Movie
","I'm a fan of Stanley Kubrick's movies, and ""Full Metal Jacket"" has to rank among his very best - if it's not the best, period. From the very first moment, the viewer is drawn into the film, as we watch young Marine recruits having their heads shaved in preparation for basic training. Then comes - basic training! What a horrific and yet at the same time hilarious thing to watch, as Drill Instructor Sgt. Hartman (played by R. Lee Emery, who was in fact a Gunnery Sargeant in the Marines who served in Vietnam and was told by Kubrick to ""make it real"") hurls ongoing and unrelenting abuse at the men as he prepares them to go to Vietnam. This first half of the movie gives us the character of ""Private Pyle"" (perhaps the most memorable character in the entire movie) - a clumsy Marine recruit at best, who becomes the target of special abuse from both Hartman and his fellow Marines. His ""evolution"" is the most frightening thing in the movie, as he progresses from a kid who obviously shouldn't have been a Marine in the first place to a literal cold-blooded killer. Vincent D'Onofrio was perfect in this part.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie shifts abruptly to Vietnam. The movie seems to weaken a little bit in this second half, maybe because it seems that we've seen this before. Movies about combat in Vietnam are hardly rare. Still, there's a great climax revolving around the fate of Eightball (Dorian Harewood) and the final demonstration that Joker (Matthew Modine) - although generally a non-combatant military reporter - has learned his killing lessons well.<br/><br/>The odd time, Kubrick (or the writers) throw in what I thought were unnecessary scenes (I think here of the scene in 'Nam where the guys share the prostitute - that's not depicted, but we know what's happening!) That served no purpose in my opinion. The movie also lacks any really organized and consistent plot or story. It's just the experiences of these Marines. Still, it's brilliantly told. 9/10"
"jckruize","9","1","2","6 June 2007"," Once more unto the breach.
","Following upon such previous works as PATHS OF GLORY and DR. STRANGELOVE, Stanley Kubrick again turned his scrutiny to the follies of war in FULL METAL JACKET, based on Gustav Hasford's autobiographical Vietnam War novel ""The Short Timers"". This 1987 drama, featuring a talented non-star cast headed by Matthew Modine, did lukewarm box office in the wake of more grandiose and/or traditional entertainments like APOCALYPSE NOW and PLATOON. But time has been kind to Kubrick's second-to-last film, and to my mind at least, it shines more icily brilliant with each viewing.<br/><br/>The film consists of two parts: Marine Corps basic training at Parris Island, South Carolina, where we meet our hero, Private 'Joker' (Modine) and his fellow recruits; and the second, longer section set in Vietnam, chiefly involving the 1968 Tet Offensive.<br/><br/>The early scenes are both harrowing and blackly humorous, with a riveting performance by neophyte Lee Ermey (an actual former Marine drill instructor who was originally hired as a technical adviser) as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, who focuses most of his object lessons on the unfortunate Private 'Pyle.' The latter is played by a young Vincent D'Onofrio (of ""Law and Order"").<br/><br/>Kubrick's trademark clinical eye is in evidence here, with deep focus compositions that reveal in unflinching detail the dehumanization process of basic training, ostensibly designed to mold from these callow youths the killers desired by the military brass. That the sequence of incidents escalates to a blackly ironic but inevitable conclusion does not diminish its horrific fascination.<br/><br/>The story then leaps forward in time to Joker's adventures as a reporter for ""Stars and Stripes"" in Vietnam. Most of the action follows Joker and wet-behind-the-ears colleague 'Rafterman'(Kevyn Major Howard), as they travel ""in country"" with the former's buddy 'Cowboy' (played by Arliss Howard from the opening sequence) and his squad on a reconnaissance mission into the bombed-out city of Hue. There death again rears its head, more randomly this time, and Joker and the other Marines must do what they have to to stay alive.<br/><br/>The ending has Joker and his comrades, M-16's at the ready, singing the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" song while marching into the dark and uncertain future. They are alive. They are not afraid.<br/><br/>It's a disquieting tale, but its truths seem simple and clear. Kubrick may have had a jaundiced view of the human condition, but there's no doubt he believed in man's ability to survive in dire straits."

","I love Vincent D'Onofrio. I am one of the few that think that ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" is the best of the three because of him. He is an outstanding actor, and I have seen him in many films, but this tops them all for him.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes of this film is a movie unto itself as we watch the interplay between the f*ck-up Pvt. Pyle (D'Onofrio) and the drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermey). Ermey played a brilliant over-the-top drill sergeant that would definitely scare anyone out of joining the Marines. His dance with Pvt. Pyle comes to a predictable end as Pyle is transformed into a killing machine. The whole movie is worth this 45 minutes.<br/><br/>The Official line: ""Son, all I've ever asked of my marines is that they obey my orders as they would the word of God. We are here to help the Vietnamese, because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out. It's a hardball world, son. We've gotta keep our heads until this peace craze blows over.""<br/><br/>After the first 45 minutes, we move into combat. This is where you see real combat soldiers, not some wannabes that look like they are auditioning for Universal Soldier.<br/><br/>The soldier's line: ""If I'm gonna get my balls blown off for a word, my word is poontang."" <br/><br/>""Personally, I think, uh... they don't really want to be involved in this war. You know, I mean... they sort of took away our freedom and gave it to the, to the gookers, you know. But they don't want it. They'd rather be alive than free, I guess. Poor dumb bastards.""<br/><br/>Written and directed by Stanley Kubrick, this is the definitive Vietnam War movie.<br/><br/>Beisdes Ermey and D'Onofrio. it has Adam Baldwin (Cruel Doubt, Independence Day), Matthew Modine (Short Cuts, Streamers, Notting Hill) and Dorian Harewood (Gothika, Glitter).<br/><br/>Semper Fi!"
"ctrout","10","1","2","5 May 2007"," Paint It Black
","Stanley Kubrick takes us on a voyage into darkness with this humanity tale of the horrors of the Vietnam war and how it affects the human beings who went through it. This is a story of people, real people and what they must do to survive in the harsh world of military boot camp and, ultimately, in the depths of hell.<br/><br/>We see this world of terror through the wide eyes of Matthew Modine. During his stay at Parris Island, he meets his extremely tough sergeant, R. Lee Ermey, and he learns that all of the other recruits are just like he is. Many people believe that boot camp is the highlight of the film and I can see why. I can't think of another movie that makes the viewer feel worried for their own sake when someone is yelling at another character.<br/><br/>The first half really sets us up for what's to come. We get to understand our protagonist and end up feeling just like he does. Modine is an everyman type that you can't help but feel for. You know what's going though his head in the bathroom scene because you're thinking the same thing.<br/><br/>After boot camp, we're thrust right into the Vietnam scene. Not with combat, but with the way it really was. Prostitutes walking down streets and giving venereal diseases to the soldiers who bring them back home are some of the things you think about when you see the city landscape of where we are.<br/><br/>If you've seen and love war movies like I do, you know that after the first combat scene, the feeling of having bullets flying by you just isn't the same. It's different with Full Metal Jacket. The tension in those scenes is drawn out so much that you're hooked into the moment so that even your heart is racing. I believe that these scenes are the best part of the film because there are very few war films that can do that. <br/><br/>What makes Full Metal Jacket different from others of its genre is that we know all of the characters. We've met people or are very close friends with characters like Animal, Cowboy, Hartmann, and even Pyle. Very few films do that anymore and to have a war movie do it is something you can't take for granted.<br/><br/>The finale sums up everything about the 1950s and '60s. It was the end of an era. When you see the scene, you realize the innocence that was taken away from this country so violently. An entire generation was lost because of this conflict and the world was changed forever."
"maiwol","10","1","2","1 May 2007"," A brilliant sample of the hell in Vietnam: on the streets and on every American soldier's head.
","One of the few Kubrick's movies about wars, Full Metal Jacket is, in my opinion the best Vietnam War movie along with Coppola's Apocalypse Now. The dehumanizing process begins the first day of the training. The drill officer treat the privates literally as ""the lowest piece of life on the planet"", and after eight weeks turn them into violent, resentful, killing machines. By humiliation, yelling, and offending the soldiers are educated to be ""killer machines"". Once in Vietnam, the whole training shown at the beginning makes sense: American soldiers kill with excitement women and children, constant fights and troubles happen between them, instead of being united, and, above all, destruction takes place in the hell known as Due, Vietnam in 1968. The whole story narrated by main character Private Joker's voice, brings an alternative, unique, critic, and powerful version of one of the darkest pages in human history."
"JH_Kalashnikov","10","1","2","10 April 2007"," An Excellent War Film.
","Stanley Kubrick, the master director behind such masterpieces as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"" comes out with an M-16 and a full case of ammunition for this classic war film, ""Full Metal Jacket."" Shot entirely in England and with a roster of A-List actors, you get a senses-shattering look at the Vietnam War during the bloody Tet Offensive. This film delivers what it says: ""The Best War Film Ever Made"" and that tag line certainly describes it well. Matthew Modine's Private Joker is both comical and adds humor to this mix but as well as emotional depth and how one is truly altered by war. Vincent D'Onofrio's Oscar-worthy portrayal as the loving-turned-maniacal Private Pyle focuses on the way war recreates people is a chilling reminder to what happened over three decades ago. Of course one can not forget R. Lee Ermey's best film role as Lieutenant Gunnery Sargeant Hartman as the no-nonsense drill officer.<br/><br/>The screenplay, written by Kubrick, Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford and based off of Herr's memories in Vietnam as well as Hasford's novel ""The Short-Timers"", is comprised of three ""chapters"": The Marines boot camp on Parris Island, the Marines first experiences in Vietnam and the disturbing yet suspenseful ending in the ruined city of Hue. A lot of people compare the three chapters in the film and say that the first chapter is the best and the other two pale in comparison. I completely disagree. I think the film balances the action and tragedy of all three parts and carefully molds all of them into one great film.<br/><br/>All in all, a terrific motion picture experience and one experience you will never forget. Indeed if you want to make a war film, THIS is how to make one.<br/><br/>This film doesn't glamorize war in any way compared to other war films in any shape, form or fashion whatsoever. A definite MUST SEE.<br/><br/>P.S. Stay tuned during the closing credits (or should I say opening since this film, like many Kubrick pictures, put all the credits at the end) to catch the Rolling Stones playing ""Paint It Black."""

","This movie to me is one of the all time great ones. Being in the military I loved the basic training part...especially now that I'm an instructor I love it even more....but that is where it should have stayed. It should have been all about basic training and a little more about the characters. The Vietnam part was OK it just turned too political (liberal) and to me it just took away from the initial shock value of basic training. There were parts that I feel were rushed just to be able to get them to the Vietnam scenes...if anything they should have just made like 10 minutes of Vietnam. If you saw this as a civilian then you were really in shock...watching it as a military person brings a huge smile to your face."

","I've viewed this many times since 1987, and each time it's absurdist, pessimistic view of the military machine seems more up to date. You could easily set this in Iraq: military training that dehumanizes; there is the U.S. Marine killing of civilians from the air; a suicide attack on a U.S. base; a young fanatical sniper; a disguised roadside bomb; unwilling allies; the uselessness of high-tech weapons when a war is reduced to street fighting; even the shooting of a prisoner - all chillingly familiar on the news. As the American Empire slowly wanes this film was one of it's pointers. Once again Kubrick predicted the future as in ""2001"" and a ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"". An amazing experience."
"FlaviusAetius","10","1","2","31 December 2006"," A brilliant black comedy
","Following the dehumanization of Marines as they go through basic training and Vietnam, Kubrick's black comedy stands heads and shoulders above his other works, even Dr. Strangelove. The comedic situations are poignant but hilarious: you laugh, but then you frown as you come to a realization about the horror of war and the effect it has on the minds of men. From the psychotic redneck gunner who slaughters Vietnamese civilians to the uptight Marine commander who believes the cause of the war is just, the movie is packed with characters that weave and overlap to paint the dark, dryly humorous but ultimately disturbing picture of war, suffering, and most of all, insanity. It shows that the perfect soldier is the perfect killer, and the perfect killer is inevitably a madman. Perhaps the ultimate black comedy. Skip Dr. Strangelove and head right to this dark gem from one of the best directors of the twentieth century."

","pages of pages of user comments here have already'sung this fantastic film's praises. The ultra-memorable Parris Island sequence featuring Gunnery Sgt.

Pyle's descent, the final scenes with the sniper, etc.etc. It's simply a sublime movie, and no-one questions it.<br/><br/>No, what I'd like to add is that this movie looks and feels simply spectacular. Stanley Kubrick's patented long takes, slow zooms and steadicam work, which permeate such wonders as ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"", are in full effect here, as well. The outdoor Vietnam sets are huge, foreboding and 100% real (they were sites in England set for demolition, but put to astoundingly good use as burned-out Vietnamese cities). This really shows how visceral a movie can be - and with not a single CGI shot in the entire movie! That's the coup de grace of this film, which will keep it looking more and more impressive for every passing year. A remake of ""Full Metal Jacket"" would feature copious computer graphics, and it would look a lot worse.

","I just recently saw this awesome film....I wish I had seen it sooner! I hadn't ever seen full metal jacket until a few weeks ago but finally gave in and watched it. I had heard of it before. I am an incredible stupid *beep* for not watching it sooner. It is an incredibly powerful realistic look at enlisted military service. I think any young people should watch it before they consider enlisting. It gives a nice look at some of the military mindset. Better than Western Front, Platoon, and others. They realistically show that the military does train to kill. That is their job. Indecision and softness physically or mentally on the combat zone gets you killed. Teamwork is survival. Some people just don't make it. <br/><br/>It also stars some of my favorite actors. Matthew Modine plays the military journalist lead. I like him on and off screen and most of his work. Vincent D'Norfrio gives one of his best performances. Of course I like most of his work too. Lee Ermy gets it spot on as the drill instructor. He's the real deal folks. Talking about his beloved core. Thats why I rate this movie as so way much higher than Platoon, Apcolypse, and their ilk. It is and feels way realer than them. <br/><br/>One minor complaint I have with this movie is that they under represent the number of black marines serving in the unit/war as is usual Hollywood practice in movies and TV. That is why I gave it a nine instead of a ten."
"Det_McNulty","9","1","2","28 June 2006"," As Deeply Flawed As It Is, I'd Still Take Kubrick's 'Nam Vision Over Stone's
","Of all the films spanning Stanley Kubrick's career, 1987's Full Metal Jacket has to be the weakest and most unorthodox of efforts, excluding his feature-length debut Fear and Desire. This was the director's penultimate work, and the one which holds testament to an artist's ability to embrace the fundamental genres of contemporary cinema. Such versatility is surely commendable; nevertheless, Kubrick unwittingly crafted what many would agree to be the worst of his career. In a decade of numerous anti-war features, produced in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, it is hard understanding why someone of Kubrick's calibre actually made this predicament of whimsical proportions. That is not to say this is not something of good intentions, but rather a work which drives its message home to such a degree that it conflicts the nature of its artist.<br/><br/>Released seven years following The Shining, Full Metal Jacket marked the second Kubrick picture of the '80s. Twelve years later, Eyes Wide Shut was released posthumously a few months following Kubrick's death. I say this simply to note that Kubrick fortunately avoided finishing on such a questionable feature. The project was first penned in 1980, with the director considering directing a holocaust study, but eventually he opted for something Vietnam based. Two years later, the director stumbled upon The Short-Timers; a retrospective, semi-autobiographical novel written by war veteran Gustav Hasford. Screenwriter Michael Herr (previously famed for his other Vietnam screenplay, Apocalypse Now) was asked to write an adapted screenplay and while originally reluctant to do so, he eventually agreed. The screenplay eventually earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.<br/><br/>Prior to filming, Kubrick spent many years researching the entire period of war; pouring over memoirs, documentaries, newspaper cuttings and any related information which could possibly contribute to the overall accuracy of the project. His commitment and dedication to being informed was a tradition Kubrick adopted before embarking on any film-making venture. As with Paths of Glory, it is purportedly claimed that Kubrick was not concerned in shaping a manifestation of anti-war, but instead wanted to matter-of-factly depict the nature of war, i.e. men transformed into killers.<br/><br/>Commencing with a montage of young army recruits having their hair shaved off (allegory for the beginnings of dehumanisation), you instantly recognise that you are watching something relatively unique. The sudden cut to the army barracks, the stillness of the blank room and the abrupt barrage of profanity directed at the troops from Sgt. Hartman is both timidly amusing and brusquely alarming. It is the first 45 minutes of Full Metal Jacket which projects a mirage of greatness, with the whole time spent depicting the metamorphosis of young men turned born-again killing machines. This first act is in complete odds with the latter act; when the troops are placed in the combat zone. The film suddenly becomes desperately obnoxious, revolving around grown men making puerile jokes at each other and running around Vietnam aimlessly, with no conscience. I personally believe that the narrative should have remained in the barracks for the duration, simply presenting the viewer with the development of the soldiers, instead of also incorporating their war experiences.<br/><br/>It is hard to pinpoint the exact problems with Full Metal Jacket, but I think, for the most part, it comes down to its inconsistencies. For one, very little actually occurs throughout the runtime and there is an icy lack of humanity in many of the scenes, but not in the comprehendible, Kubrickian way. Its ideologies and pathos are concealed by a desire to litter so many scenes with narcissistic humour, and so the audience looses its respect for the characters. On the other hand, the performances are, with all reason, up to scratch; particularly those performances from R. Lee Ermey as the inescapable drill-instructor and Vincent D'Onofrio's role as his pitiful victim. Beyond those two performances lies little else on the acting front, with most of the other performers' roles being compromised of heroic despondency and lashings of misunderstood cynicism. Most of all, the message of the film is entirely jumbled and to such an extent that it is in fact difficult to decipher the underlying crux of the ordeal. One thing is for certain that Kubrick perfectly demonstrates how much of a transformation regular men go through before entering war. Such is perhaps the only way man could cope with such a deathly periphery of mouldering principles.<br/><br/>This is very much a work of undermined greatness, a meagre example of something which could have been great, but eventually became a rambling mishap, fuelled by ill-defined notions of grandeur. Throughout the '80s there was a string of hefty and effusive Vietnam pictures, some were good and some were bad. The ironic, tight-fisted Full Metal Jacket lay in the midst of it all and many acknowledged that it contained a concept which could have been so much more."

","M*A*S*H is anti-war. Dr. Strangelove is anti-war. FMJ is more of a documentary about the war experience. There are already enough reviews of FMJ, that I don't need to rehash it here. HOWEVER, people born after 1960/1968 do need a history lesson to understand WHY we were in 'Nam Men will always kill men. That's part of our DNA. Those of us from military families, or those who have served, accept this movie as a true enough account of the military experience, and most service men and women list this movie as a ""top ten"" favorite.<br/><br/>The world was different in 1939, different again in 1944/45, different still in 1948/49, and went to hell in a hand basket in 1963/64.<br/><br/>It was America's favorite Democrat, JFK who got us into Vietnam after the French were thrown out. LBJ was already committed to Vietnam, by Kennedy, just as Kennedy was already committed to Bay of Pigs by Ike, and Truman inherited WW2, and the A-Bomb by FDR.<br/><br/>Beginning with Truman, America and Britain developed the ""Containment Policy"" of stopping Communism where the borders were in 1945. If Truman had lost in 1944 or 1948, and MacArthur had been elected, he would have sent Patton (in 44) into Moscow and ended the cold war before the Soviets got the A bomb in 1949. No Cold War would have meant NO Korea, and NO Vietnam. MacArthur was also extremely AGAINST fighting any war in Asia. During Korea, he wanted to Nuke the Chinese back to the stone age, rather than fight on the ground and lose American and Allied lives. MacArthur warned Ike, JFK, and LBJ to get out of Asia, and none listened.<br/><br/>Ho came to Washington in the middle of WW2 to ask FDR to liberate Vietnam from the French. FDR was too busy trying to liberate France from Germany. Ho left Washington angry and changed his colors from democratic to communist.<br/><br/>Truman restored Vietnam to France, and refused to allow Patton to advance into Moscow. In 1948, China became communist, and in 1949, the USSR got the bomb. The opportunity to nip communism in the bud was lost.<br/><br/>Following success in China, Ho began his CIVIL WAR in Vietnam. Vietnam was two wars at once: Liberate the Vietnamese from France, and change the puppet government in Saigon from democracy to communism.<br/><br/>After the French were expelled from Vietnam, IKE sent the first advisers to shore up democratic South Vietnam.<br/><br/>Sputnik meant that the USSR could place nuclear bombs into ICBMS and attack the US from space. Ike had lost his opportunity to liberate Russia and Eastern Europe. The Space Race and Apollo project were the civilian face of the nuclear arms race. Rockets strong enough to launch a man to the moon could be used to attack Moscow and Bejing. NOW America and her Allies could only fight the Communists by Proxy.<br/><br/>JFK sent more people in and sent troops to protect those advisers, but avoided all out war. THEN JFK was assassinated, and LBJ and the US Congress suspected a communist conspiracy and Vietnam became a ""police action"" then all out war that LBJ was not committed to win. FDR did not care how many civilians were killed in WW2, television made mass murder of civilians impossible. Look up Dresden. Truman dropped fat man and little boy during television's infancy. If CNN had existed before 1945, he could not have done it. Despite carpet bombing by LBJ, Ho Chi Minh would not negotiate. That's the beauty of communism, unaccountability; kill anyone who disagrees with the Chairman. Look up Stalin's purges and Tienamen Square.<br/><br/>Truman betrayed the Poles by giving Poland and Eastern Europe to ""Uncle Joe"" Stalin in exchange for Stalin committing Russian troops to Berlin. Poland was a democracy, and ally of Britain and France, and a buffer against the USSR before Hitler invaded. Truman had the world handed to him by FDR and threw it all away.<br/><br/>IKE was a democrat but had to run as a Republican because the other Republican candidates wanted to dismantle NATO which IKE had set up to counter the USSR. IKE had to choose hardliner Nixon as his VP. By 1950 MacArthur no longer wanted the Presidency. Mac died in 1964 urging LBJ to get out of Vietnam, but MacNammera constantly urged LBJ to commit more bombing. LBJ should have fired MacNammera, but couldn't since Bobby Kennedy was accusing LBJ of staging a coup. The pressure was on LBJ.<br/><br/>Nixon was the wrong man to President in 1968. Perhaps he would have made a better president in 1960, when he was younger, and paranoia had not gotten to him, as it did by 1968 and 1972. Perhaps Nixon would have listened to MacArthur and withdrawn the few American advisers. Kennedy placed more Americans in harm's way. LBJ was committed to protecting Americans already in Vietnam, and was genuinely asleep when the Pueblo was lost to Korea, and someone panicked and shot at a whole bunch of nothing and called it a sneak attack in the Gulf of Tonkin.<br/><br/>IF Kennedy had not been killed, or at least not been killed by a Communist sympathizer, then Kennedy or Lyndon could have withdrawn a handful of troops, and Vietnam could have been avoided.<br/><br/>American men and women went where they sent. They did what they were ordered to do. We still do.<br/><br/>Back to FMJ.<br/><br/>I personally do not see anything anti-war about it.

His lines about Whitman and Oswald are honest, true, and a little prideful. The USMC wants riflemen like that. That's the job of a Marine, to kill, and that's it.

"gabzz103","7","1","2","13 February 2006"," Full Metal Jacket - Great first act, disappointing second
","In Stanley Kubrick's second-to-last film, Full Metal Jacket, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) tells an account of what happened to him in Vietnam. The film starts off in a boot camp. Private Joker, along with many other men are forced to follow extremely strict orders by Gunnery Seargeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). We see how the men are brainwashed into making them emotionally ready for battle. They are screamed at by the Seargeant that they are worthless, punished for the most minor mistake, etc. We meet one of the men, Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), who is the less physically active man who just can't get anything right. He is continuously harassed by the Seargeant, being completely humiliated all the time by the Seargeant and the other men.<br/><br/>In the boot camp, we mostly see the mentality that the army wanted the soldiers to have. The yelling of ""I am a killer."" shows how these normal men have become something completely different than when they first came in.<br/><br/>After the first half in the boot camp, Private Joker is assigned to be a journalist. For me, that was the point where everything turned into an average film. Many soldiers tell their views about the war, they are now desensitized to the killing of Viatmese soldiers, sometimes even civilians. The conclusion of the movie is quite surprising but they should have added more in my opinion.<br/><br/>For the technical aspects, the direction was fine. Just fine, not excellent, extraordinary or great, I found it just a bit above average. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Kubrick, I have A Clockwork Orange and 2001 : A Space Odyssey in my top 20 but I didn't feel any genius or brilliance in Full Metal Jacket unlike the movies that I just named. The acting was decent but Vincent D'Onofrio played his character quite well, a very memorable and creepy performance.<br/><br/>In the first half of the movie, I really enjoyed the character development of all the men in the boot camp. It was very good, it really made the viewer think. After we first go to Vietnam, the movie turned into an average war film. To me, nothing really stood out, the quality of the movie suddenly dropped. It wasn't bad, no, it just didn't feel like a Kubrick picture or a ""great"" film.<br/><br/>Overall, I would still recommend this movie. I was disappointed but there is still a lot of good in it. Much more good than bad by far but I just don't see how it became to be considered as one of the best war movies of all-time.<br/><br/>My rating : 7.5/10 - almost an 8/10"
"nh3nh4","8","1","2","1 December 2005"," The real message of this movie...
","People seem to have totally missed the point of this movie. This is a war movie, but its more so about soldiers - American soldiers to be precise.<br/><br/>It shows the shallow gang-ho attitude which is ingrained into marines at booth camp, creating a sort of ultra ego for them and where they can hide from their insecurities. Those who are 'honest', Pyle cannot live with that and flips.<br/><br/>Then how these 'super soldiers' actually perform in real war. Well, they talk ' the talk' but as it shows, 'they really can't walk the walk'. The battle scenes, soldiers talking to the camera, and the final scene is all an indication of that.<br/><br/>In this movie Kubrick is at his best, poking fun at US army and its culture. and also American machismo male stereotype and their utter ignorance of the rest of the world.<br/><br/>With Iraq a hot issue today, this movie resonates more then ever."

The first half show the military training alienation, and throughout you wonder what in the heck Modine's character is doing there. Feeling you'll keep over the other half of the movie, the actually on-the-field, all hell break lose Vietnam. The movie culminate in it's most terrifying theme: almost half a squad is wiped out by a sniper, who turn's out to be a frail tiny woman. Do you get it?

","I really like the way that the Late Stanley Kubrick gives us several movies in one. He did it with 2001 and he's done it again with Full metal Jacket. This really is the hallmark of a great Director...<br/><br/>Part One runs for the first 40 minutes of the movie and is set in the USMC Recruiting Depot in South Carolina. It deals with basic training, where Gunnery Sargeant Hartman teaches men to love their rifles: to sleep with them and give them a girl's name. The whole training routine is dehumanising, and Private Pyle cracks under the pressure. This was the most interesting part of the movie for me, focusing on the psychology of war.<br/><br/>Part Two is set in Vietnam and deals with the politics of war, the nightmare of combat in the field, and the impact on the local people.<br/><br/>The dialogue is spiked with scathing humour, but this is a dark movie which doesn't avoid harsh realities, and it seems appropriate when the end credits roll over a black screen and The Stones sing 'Paint it Black'."

","I found the first half of this film to be a very realistic portrayal of bootcamp. I was in the Corps from '77-'81 and this is the real deal folks. This is how it was (still is?)- like it or not. One thing that was different in my time though- the physical abuse was pretty well hidden- due to some recent scandals, I think. So I never got punched or saw anybody else get whacked but the verbal abuse was awesome. As some guy once wrote, ""it was the worst of times, it was the best of times."". I'm 46 years old and I still have nightmares that I'm back in bootcamp! Anyway, I found the 2nd half of the film to be pretty much a snooze- maybe I'll try watching it again someday. It really is two separate movies. Show this to your son who wants to be a Marine and then see what he says! :-) Hell, show it to your daughter- they have it none too easy either... (I was stationed at Parris Island for most of my enlistment.) Oh yeah- we had our own ""Gomer Pyle"" (actually a couple of them now that I think of it). Ours was ""Dawson"". Man, did they give that guy hell. And then there was ""DeWolf"" an overweight, 30ish guy who had NO BUSINESS being in Marine bootcamp. I remember him doing the barb wire crawl down the middle of the squadbay during the night. Right before they kicked him out. We started with about 80 guys in the platoon and ended up with maybe 50-55 I think.<br/><br/>Watch this movie and see how the other half lives. This is scarier than any made up crap like ""House on the Haunted Hill"" or ""Natural Born Killers""."

","I agree there are some flaws, but the cold inhumanity is one of its core ideas. The inhumanity is what gives it life. It's like another world in there where people don't value life as much and for some reason I took an interest in seeing that aspect. Plus the undecided feeling of it was not a flaw. The who's side are you on deal made it unique. I seriously think that(even though i plan to join the Marines) it is very hard to see the right side of a war. I mean sometimes,yes, it is possible but if someone doesn't know what they're fighting for or doesn't care for that matter makes the war a totally different war and those people are the people that make Full Metal Jacket unique. Basically I think Joker's attitude is like "" I don't care about this war but I guess it's just where I fit"". Plus R Lee Ermey is kick ass in this movie. I laughed my ass off during the first half. Yes the second half wasn't as great but this movie is still one of my top favorites.<br/><br/>You can learn more about a person in a hour of play than in a year of conversation ~Plato"

","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I just did my film class paper on the characterization of Pvt. Pyle (Leonard Lawrence). Really it was rather weak, we see him only as a loser trying to redeem himself from alienation and scorn...but failing even under the tutelage of Pvt. Joker. His descent into madness needed no explanation outside extreme oppression. However, Kubrick seems to have cut out any depth of information regarding Pyle's history, beliefs, and opinions. A blank slate, really. You can't easily put yourself in his shoes...unless you are a total loser and get pushed around all the time. <br/><br/>Despite this film's many merits, characterization is not one of them. That is not necessarily a bad thing (besides being opposite to what we expect with such a tortured main character) because it allows us to be a little less wrapped in the eventual suicide. It strikes most people as just freaky, that final scene. Instead of being overwhelmed by sadness and empathy, we just don't know what to feel. I think Kubrick wanted to shift our focus from the characters to the ideas. Hence the dry acting, with lines spoken awkwardly and unevenly. The quotes are important, not who said them. Check the ""memorable quotes"" section of FMJ and you will see exactly what I mean."

","Stanley Kubrick makes extremely disturbing, and yet extremely good films; examples of his disturbing movies are ""A Clockwork Orange"" ""The Shining"" ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and the film I am reviewing ""Full Metal Jacket"". Full Metal Jacket is a two-segmented film; the first segment is basic war training and the second segment takes place in Vietnam itself with former trainee, Joker. Let me just say that the first segment is what makes this film so disturbing. Everything that Sgt. Hartman puts the character Leonard through, and what happens to Leonard towards the end... bone chilling. It's one of the best Vietnam films I have seen. i love war films, especially Vietnam films for some weird reason. Full Metal Jacket compared to other war films is... different. It's kind of surreal, but I wasn't in Vietnam (obviously) , so I can't say if the stuff that happens in this movie veterans can relate to or not. Overall, it's a heavy and disturbing (the best word to describe this film) masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Should have been so much better than it is. The first half is magnificent. The second half has that plotted meandering feel that Kubrick fans know and love. Not as surreal as a lot of his films, and not quite as good either. The whole sequence of events along the second half seem to move like a parade. I think this is the most clichÃ©d movie Kubrick ever made. It's Stanley saying this is my version of the ""Hollywood"" Nam film. That's a shame. It is exciting though. Chasing down the sniper in Hue is the best sequence. I have a cousin who rarely comments on his 13 month tour in 1968-69 and even he says that sequence makes his skin crawl. He refers to it as ""Been there-done that syndrome."" A fairly good war movie for the war movie buffs, others might have a different opinion. The film's only about half the book. I found the book not to be all that satisfying either. Kubrick's best war film is still Paths of Glory. That's just this war movie buff's opinion."

","""Their's is not to reason why. Their's is but to do and die""<br/><br/>Lord Tennyson sums up the spirit of this film so well...a film which is divided into two parts with each part being rather better than the whole. The first part concerns the transformation of raw recruits into marines, a process of dehumanisation into killing machines.  In the second half we see a group of fully-fledged marines in action in Vietnam calling for tank support as they watch a couple of their buddies ripped apart by sniper fire.<br/><br/>The build up of hatred for the drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermy) is the main feature of the first half with a very dramatic and tragic ending. Extremely well done.  As for the second half, good though it is, I never felt that what I was watching was actually in Vietnam. Never the less the sniper scene is exciting and tense. And what a surprise when the identity of the sniper is revealed.<br/><br/>Like most war films the message that comes across stresses the futility of war and the dehumanisation of man on his mad path of destruction.<br/><br/>It's a film worth watching if only to remind us that war solves few if any problems."
"jazzest","8","1","2","30 May 2004"," Two Separate Narratives Make Kubrick Look Indifferent, While His Commitment Makes the Film One of the Best
","Stanley Kubrick has a vocabulary of how to put the distance between the subject and himself, while flawlessly completing the exterior. The way in Full Metal Jacket, his installment of the Vietnamese War, is to present two separate narratives: one about a troublemaker in a training camp and the other about a Vietnamese shooter in a battlefield. The seemingly random combination of these two stories makes him look indifferent to the subject, while his commitment makes the film one of the best in the genre.<br/><br/>Matthew Modine's persona perfectly fits into his role of Joker, who always tries to handle the various situations with a sincere manner. Directing actors may be the best part of Kubrick's genius, making all supporting actors look great. Music selection is well-thought: most notably, the end title, Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones, follows the soldiers singing Mickey Mouse in the last shot."
"Philby-3","Null","1","2","31 March 2004"," A split personality movie
","Those who say this is two movies are right. The first 40 minutes set in the US Marines boot camp amount to an almost perfect short film on the boot camp theme of bastardisation to produce trained killers. The story is perfectly balanced, the three central characters beautifully and economically drawn, the whole thing as clean and as austere as the marine's barracks. The drill sergeant is not a monster, just the hard man the job requires, though we only ever see him on duty. I had to remind myself that anyone serving in the marines has volunteered to be there, so perhaps one should not feel too sorry for the recruits. The sexual element seems to be laid in rather thick - this is one very imaginatively foul-mouthed instructor - but I suppose one way to unite men and give them a sense of purpose is to get them to despise women.<br/><br/>The remaining hour or so, set in Vietnam, during the Tet Offensive in 1968, is rather more problematical. It's three years later and Joker the journalist, far from killing people as he was taught to do in boot camp, is in Da Nang filing reassuring copy for the ultimate house journal, the US Army's Stars and Stripes. He gets sent up country to cover the action with a photographer and is dragged in to action in a patrol commanded by an old friend from boot camp. Here he discovers hellish things do happen in war, even to principled people such as himself.<br/><br/>This second part is a kind of slide into the pit, and rather dismaying to watch. The atmosphere is like `Apocalypse Now' but without the personal journey of Charlie Sheen's character Willard. Kubrick and his set people do a good job re-creating Vietnam in Berkshire, but the limitations are obvious - at times it's like watching a theatrical set. But my biggest beef is that here Stanley K has nothing really new to say. Perhaps he forgot he had already made a definitive war movies 30 years earlier in `Paths of Glory' His mad officers are nothing new and have little impact here. `The Thin Red Line' did a much better job of capturing the dynamics of combat units (in Guadalcanal) and `Apocalyse Now' really stuck the madness of war to the audience. And `Saving Private Ryan', for all its deficiencies, puts the viewer in the front line far more effectively.<br/><br/>As the drill sergeant, Lee Ermey ( a former marine drill sergeant and accomplished actor), gives a flawless performance and Vincent D'Onisforu as the unlucky Pyle is a perfect quivering heap. Matthew Modine is only adequate as Joker though he finishes well.<br/><br/>Perhaps Kubrick was too static a director to make a really convincing action movie, but he has to be given credit for the first 40 minutes, the finest rendering of military bastardisation put on film."

Lee Ermey's performance, and I'm not going to be different - I didn't think it was possible to hear so much invective from one man in one sentence and keep a straight face, and even as jaded as I am, I can only look on in wonder and admiration at the passion he put into his part.<br/><br/>Quick synopsis: Bunch of kids from all over the USA are sent to Parris Island for Marine training, most of them get through it, they go to Viet Nam, and some of 'em die.<br/><br/>And if that was all the movie was about, it would still be a reasonable flick.<br/><br/>Watching the characters develop, deciding who to hate and who to like, listening to R. Lee Ermey (""Here, you are all equally worthless"" and ""Were you born worthless, or did you have to work at it?""), and finally seeing them become Marines were all very entertaining, but this was only the under-card for the main event: Viet Nam.<br/><br/>Of course, through all the death, destruction, and carnage all around, we were still treated to moments that were so on the dark-side, they were actually hilarious.<br/><br/>Papillon Soo was our ""introduction"" to Joker's life ""In-Country"" and apart from the much-quoted attempts to pick up the G.I's (Me love you LONG time), she was actually one of the most poised and least forced-looking of the cast, but even her appearance has a nasty undercurrent that took me two viewings to see.<br/><br/>The black humor is more prevelent as the movie gets toward the end, and there are moments of pure madness that are so obscenely ridiculous they are probably closer to the truth than the more ""acceptable"" scenes, but probably the funniest lines of all are from the second section of this movie (""You know there's not a single horse in the entire country of Vietnam? There's definitely something wrong with that."" and the ever-colourful Animal Mother's ideas on Patriotism: ""If I'm gonna get my balls blown off for a word, my word is poontang.""<br/><br/>All-in-all, this was funny, disgusting, sad, hilarious, sickening, and moving - all the things a great movie should be.<br/><br/>The final scene, however, was probably the most poignant of any war-film made in a VERY long time - a bunch of kids with rifles marching through devastation singing and whistling the theme to the Mickey Mouse show .... we always revert to that which is most comfortable in times of greatest stress, and for this movie to end any other way would have weakened it to the levels of Platoon and Tour Of Duty."
"movieguy1021","10","1","2","7 May 2003"," Full Metal Jacket: 10/10
","Full Metal Jacket is the fourth Stanley Kubrick movie I have seen (the others are 2001, The Shining, and Dr. Strangelove). This is my second favorite out of those four.<br/><br/>It's basically a two-part story. The first part is clearly the better part, and is one of the best acts in a movie I have ever seen. It has a drill instructor (R. Lee Ermey) sadistically dehumanizing recruits into the Marines for the Vietnam War. This is one of the basics of Kubrick movies, the dehumanization of humans. It is most clearly seen in The Shining, also. Among some of the new Marines are Joker (Matthew Modine), Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Cowboy (Arliss Howard). Gomer is fat, so the drill instructor likes to pick on him. The second part has them actually going into the war.<br/><br/>It's really hard to put the first part into words. Ermey spitfires insults and hateful things for about ten minutes straight, without taking a breath or anything. He was a drill instructor before becoming an actor, and it shows. He was outstanding, just truly outstanding. He was screwed from winning Best Supporting Actor for his role. Just like the narration of Fight Club, it's hard to put how I feel into words.<br/><br/>Something I didn't expect was that it had bits and pieces of humor that were in it. Most of it, yet again, came from Ermey as he was yelling at the recruits. I laughed a lot, even though they weren't that appropriate. The laughs, obviously, tapered off in the second part. Much of the humor wasn't P.C., either, but this was 15 years ago.Only a genius could put humor into a time of turmoil. Thank you, Mr. Kubrick.<br/><br/>Overall, I have two complaints about the films. First, the editing was poor. Second, the second act could obviously not compare to the first one. Although the second part was good, maybe a 7/10, the first part was over a 10/10, so I took around an average. The second part, however, was very realistic and made me feel like I was in the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>Ermey was terrific, as I said before, but Modine proved himself to be a good leading actor. Although he hasn't done much recently, he could come back as a good actor. I really liked the music in Full Metal Jacket, sometimes it was cheerful, especially in the beginning, when the recruits were getting their heads shaved. The narration was rather odd, coming and going.<br/><br/>The violence isn't gratuitous, but there is a lot of it. It looked realistic, which is good. It's better to have realistic violence and blood than fake. Instead of sugarcoating the violence to a PG-13 level, they showed everything, graphic but not over the top. Unfortunately, all of the deaths were in slow motion, but that didn't stop me from looking at it and gasping in awe. Kubrick makes another bravura masterpiece here.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong language and violence, and sexual refrences."

"jhclues","7","1","2","23 September 2000"," Kubrick Addresses The Complexities Of War
","The dual nature of man, wherein he is able to embrace both war and peace simultaneously, is addressed by director Stanley Kubrick in the decidedly anti-war film, `Full Metal Jacket,' starring Matthew Modine.  Divided essentially into two parts, the first half follows raw recruits through basic training at Parris Island, where the effects of what it takes to turn a man into a Marine / killing machine is explored, predominately through the characters of Private `Joker,' played by Matthew Modine, and Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), dubbed `Gomer Pyle' by the D.I, Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey).  It's a hard, stoic study of techniques and motivation that inherently questions the system itself, and is deftly and succinctly illustrated by the results achieved, which are not entirely those desired. It's hard stuff to swallow at times, but engrossing, and Kubrick manages to gradually build the emotional intensity that gives such impact to the climax of this first part, which is without question the strength of the entire film. 	The second half switches suddenly to Vietnam, where Kubrick takes up his pallet and canvass, and while attempting to paint a realistic portrait of war, instead takes more of a turn away from reality, and the film takes on a sense of the surreal; the result is more reminiscent of the visual artistry of `The Thin Red Line' than of the truly gritty realism of `Saving Private Ryan,' and rather than make his statement  directly through the use of the story, he uses the movie to stage sequences of events to demonstrate the contradictory nature of war and it's consequences, and man's involvement therein.  And while he compares the moral and emotional conflicts with the physical, it is an acknowledgement of an inner struggle devoid of any proffered solution, though delivered quite subjectively.  The pace of the film is very deliberate and much of the dialogue has a `staged' sense about it that, rather than underscore the issues being addressed, has more of an alienating effect which serves to neutralize the emotional aspects of what is being presented. 	The story is told from the point of view of Modine's `Joker' , but though Modine does a passable job, his is a rather unsympathetic character whose purpose it would seem is merely to act as narrator and to serve as the `eyes' of the camera.  And, again, it only manages to distance the audience further, as Joker becomes a kind of buffer between the viewer and any sustained level of emotional involvement with the story or any of the characters.  Instead of a stirring fulmination against the lunacy of war and man's enablement of it, Kubrick's approach creates more of a sense of rather cold ambiguity.  Had Joker (as the lead) been a stronger character, and had the second half of the film been more like the first, instead of nothing more than a series of vignettes, this could have been a dynamic movie; as it is, because of Kubrick's choices, he made a good movie, but not a great one. 	There are two memorable performances here, one by Vincent D'Onofrio, who did an exemplary job of creating the hapless Leonard; the other by Lee Ermey, as the Gunnery Sergeant who could be the poster-boy for an anti-enlistment campaign.  Also worthy of note is the work of Arliss Howard, who brought `Cowboy' so credibly to life.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother); Dorian Harewood (Eightball); Kevyn Major Howard (Rafterman); Ed O'Ross (Lieutenant Tinoshky); and John Terry (Lieutenant Lockhart).  With `Full Metal Jacket,' Stanley Kubrick raises issues that are important, and makes some valid points about the causes and complexities of war, and the moral and ethical challenges of those presented with it.  Obviously, this was a passionate endeavor; if only he would have allowed more of that passion to make it's way onto the screen.  What a movie this could have been.  I rate this one 7/10."

","Since i am quite young, and consequently new to the domain of movies pre-1990 era, IMDb serves as my catalogue for catching up on all the masterpieces. so it was with quite a lot of expectation that i watched FMJ, in-spite of being shockingly disappointed earlier with A clockwork orange and 2001. Kubrick's work to me is...dysfunctional.<br/><br/>I am a real admirer of artistic direction and deep, intriguing story lines with philosophical connotations, but i also firmly believe that every movie should be entertaining, be it at a superficial, sensual, intellectual or emotional level. Sadly, FMJ is none; just a collection of distraught, disturbing scenes that display a reptilian, hollow way of movie direction.<br/><br/>the first half of the movie, that primarily focuses on the android-like training of the marines, would have been effective had it been juxtaposed with the usual camaraderie and banter of the trainees (like in Band of Brothers). it was creepily unnerving to see and hear joker, pyle and company talk to each other like they were from different solar systems. i've never been to military training camps, but surely soldiers everywhere develop affectionate rapports with their colleagues, right? then we switch over to a make-do Vietnam where the movie gets even shabbier. the fighting scenes look like enacted in a theater (slow motions groans and blood spill), the dialogs seem to have been scripted by arnold, stallone and vin diesel and the storyline seems like a headless chicken, going nowhere and painfully bleeding to death. What kind of a person in his senses would walk onto the war-front, with a peace symbol and a gory message printed on his helmet at the same time, and then expect to justify himself by explaining Jungian philosophy to ticked off soldiers? enough said. time to put a FMJ in the original reels of this nonsense."
"darin-wissbaum","5","2","7","21 September 2009"," Should have ended after the first part...
","This was a film in which greatness was in Stanley Kubricks grasp and he failed to grab it. The first part of this film (the BT part) was so convincing that it really should have been left at that. I did not need to see the second part with the typical Kubrick trademarks and violence of Vietnam to be convinced that war is hell. The part of Sgt Hartman played by R. Lee Ermy made you believe that war is hell, and he is not so much a mean person but mean in a sense to the young new recruits because he knows that the real terror will start once they are on the ground in Viet Nam and he needs to prepare them for that. His toughness to his men take their toll on reject Pvt Pile (Vincent D'Onofrio) in which the stress of BT reaches a point of Sgt Hartman getting killed and D'Onofrio putting a rifle in his mouth. The first part of this film was truly terrifying as you could feel what it must have been like to know you were going to Vietnam after BT and what may await you once you were there. The second part once the troops were on the ground in Nam was not what the first part had prepared me for. In fact it played like a comedy and was a bit silly. The sets and locations were not convincing and it all lead around Matthew Modines character Pvt. Joker who writes for a military newspaper, who has a chance to go with group of grunts into a blown out city and experiences combat for the first time. Basically just running around in and out of buildings and getting shot at with jokes in-between. I felt it contradicted everything the first part was about and what I thought it was preparing me for. Maybe it was Kubricks anal way of directing in which he would do a scene 35+ times that did this one in....who knows but the real title of this story before it was changed to Full Metal Jacket was ""The Short Timers."" They should have left it at that."

","The movie starts with meaningless shouting between officer and soldiers. Trying to say this is military life. Naive. Half of the movie is training.

"JamesHitchcock","8","2","8","5 October 2007"," There are losses in every trade
","""Full Metal Jacket"" (the title is taken from a type of ammunition) is a film of two unequal halves. In Act I we follow a platoon of US Marines through their basic training at a military base in South Carolina as they prepare to fight in Vietnam. This part of the film is dominated by Lee Ermey who plays Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, the man charged with licking the raw recruits into shape. As I have never served in any branch of the services, I cannot say from experience whether the picture given of military life in this film is accurate, but as Ermey was himself a sergeant in the Marine Corps and was originally hired as a technical consultant rather than an actor, his portrayal of Hartman is presumably drawn from life. <br/><br/>Hartman is not only a strict disciplinarian but also a foul-mouthed bully who sees it as his job to make the recruits' life hell. He has a particularly fertile imagination when it comes to insults; no category of abuse, be it scatological, sexual, racial or blasphemous, is too disgusting for him to use. Although he says that all the recruits are equally worthless in his eyes, this is not strictly true. Some are more worthless than others, especially the overweight, unfit and incompetent Private Gomer Pyle, for whom he reserves his choicest abuse. (Pyle's real name is Leonard Lawrence, but Hartman has a habit of renaming those whom he dislikes; a black Marine becomes Private Snowball). <br/><br/>Hartman's methods are presumably approved by the military as the best means of maintaining discipline and moulding the platoon into a fighting unit, but in this case they misfire. Hartman has promised to make the men into ""ministers of death"". In the case of Pyle this prophecy is fulfilled, but those whom he kills are Hartman and himself when he is goaded beyond endurance. There are a number of arguments against conscription, and this film encapsulates one of the strongest. Hartman says that his orders are ""to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps"", and in normal times a recruit as unsuited to military life as Pyle would doubtless have been weeded out at the end of his first week, but during the Vietnam war the military needed every man it could get, regardless of quality. Although Pyle is a murderer and suicide, he remains a character we can pity, bringing to mind Kipling's words in ""Thrown Away"":-<br/><br/>""Some- there are losses in every trade- Will break their hearts ere bitted and made, Will fight like fiends as the rope cuts hard, And die dumb-mad in the breaking-yard"". <br/><br/>In Act II the action moves to Vietnam, where we follow another member of the platoon, Private Joker, the only man who attempted to befriend Pyle. Joker is employed as a journalist on a military newspaper, but is frustrated with his job, which he sees as dishonest, slanted reporting for propaganda purposes. (His situation is similar to that of Robin Williams' radio DJ in ""Good Morning Vietnam"", another film from the same year). He wants to see some military action, and gets his wish when he is sent to report upon the battle for the city of Hue during the Tet offensive. Remarkably, the whole film was shot in Britain, with the London docklands standing in for Hue and the Norfolk Broads for the Vietnamese countryside. <br/><br/>When I described this as a film of two unequal halves, I was referring not only to length (Act I takes up rather less than, and Act II rather more than, half of the total running time) but also to quality. Act I, with its two great performances from Ermey and Vincent d'Onofrio as Pyle, is a superb piece of work, both as a critique of the military mindset and as a human drama, and the equal of anything else in Kubrick's output. Act II, although it is a perfectly competent war film, is not in the same class. Despite obvious differences of subject-matter and style, the film reminded me of another Kubrick film, ""Lolita"", which also starts much more effectively than it finishes. (In that case, much of the blame lies with Vladimir Nabokov's source novel). <br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" formed part of what might be called Hollywood's second Vietnam cycle of the late eighties and early nineties, which also included not only ""Good Morning Vietnam"", but also ""Hamburger Hill"", ""Casualties of War"" and Oliver Stone's trilogy of ""Platoon"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Heaven and Earth"". The first Vietnam cycle (""The Deer Hunter"", ""Coming Home"", ""Apocalypse Now"") had come about a decade earlier. Most of these films had a generally anti-war tone, showing the war as brutal and savage, but generally did not analyse its political causes in any great depth. <br/><br/>It was not, therefore, a terribly original move to make a Vietnam war film in 1987, and originality- the ability to make films quite different from anything else, such as ""Dr Strangelove"" or ""Clockwork Orange""- was generally Kubrick's strong suit. He could work within an established genre, as with the sword-and-sandal epic ""Spartacus"", but that film is perhaps the best example of that genre ever made. The action scenes in ""Full Metal Jacket"" are well done, and Matthew Modine is good as Joker, as is Alec Baldwin as the brutal soldier Animal Mother, but Kubrick does not really find anything new to say about the war which had not already been said by the likes of Cimino, Coppola and Stone. 8/10. (An average; 9/10 for Act I, 7/10 for Act II)."

","I'll get this out of the way. Watch this film. The first storyline with Vincent D'onofrio's Pvt. Pyle is amazing. The performances are spot on. But, after this strong start, it becomes a generic war movie with little to no character. It all feels so sudden, like two separate films, which is a shame. It isn't terrible, just unoriginal. You're better off watching the first third or so, and then going off to watch Saving Private Ryan."

","Someone wrote exactly what I think and rated it what I did too. I guess I'm not the only one that feels there are two very different parts in this movie.
First is full of character development, great acting, and there was a better and clear direction on what was the point of that act.
On the second part we get action, shootings, explosions, but no direction on where is it going. The journalist is quite superficial, and everyone talking is quite dumb and unidimensional. I didn't feel like everything was being shown in terms of the horrors of a war like that.
After the strong characters on the first part (not many though, really), the second part feels quite shallow and aimless.
I'm guessing the point was to show how horrible is war even from before getting to the front line, so we've got the two halves to portrait that.
I just think they didn't add up as a great story and couldn't care really about the characters that survive throughout. They're all quite basic and crazy triggering freaks thirsty of blood, I honestly (and hopefully) have to believe that in reality not everyone was enjoying killing people.
Of course cinematography is always interesting and the productions are great in Kubrick's movies, but I don't feel this was a great one about Vietnam, I definitely prefer Platoon."

"audrablum","3","1","3","15 March 2018"," Why is this considered a classic?
","This week I watched Full Metal Jacket (1987). Let me just start out by saying that I was not the biggest fan of this film and I am surprised that this is such an occult classic. I thought the storyline was kind of weird and directionless. I felt like I kept waiting for a climax that never came. I didn't care for the content of the film and I see why my ex was so obsessed with it. It seemed geared for someone like him -- not me. Being a military brat I get that this film is supposed to represent ""how it really is"" in the military, and I do think the film gave an accurate depiction in that regard. Who knows? Maybe that's why I didn't care to watch it. Most of the scenes I felt were drawn out for too long and Kubrick took advantage of the shoot up scenes to get a little extra gorey, which I also didn't care for. Some of the music seemed out of place -- and not in a good creative way, but in a weird I don't get it way. Traditional to Kubrick films the cinematography was an artistic manifestation of the internal turmoil of the scenes. The editing seemed to shift throughout the movie, which I also didn't care for stylistically. For most of the movie the editing was traditional cinematic, and about Â¾ into the movie, the editing suddenly becomes ""TV news style."" Some people might be into that, but I thought it felt out of place, abrupt, and strange. Perhaps that was Kubrick's intent to make the viewer feel strange because he wanted us to feel that war is strange. I think that the film translated Kubrick's vision well. I believe that the point of the film is an anti-war message. I see a lot of undertones for this in the script. The film's plot seemed to be ""real-life"" war from the perspective a a journalist/soldier. And as for payoff? As I mentioned earlier about the editing, the pacing changed a few times in the film and was strange. There wasn't really a good payoff to this film in my opinion, but I think that's what Kubrick was going for."
"yakhou42","6","1","3","17 February 2015"," Unfortunately, not what I expected...
","Full Metal Jacket is composed of two parts : in the first one, privates train in a camp of the Marine Corps and learn how to use their rifle ; in the second, some soldiers are sent to Vietnam and deal with violent Vietnamese attacks.<br/><br/>Texas, Pyle and Joker : these are the nicknames of the identified soldiers who are dominated, insulted and brainwashed by Sergeant Hartman. They represent three profiles of soldiers (the obedient, the failure and the kind) and they meet different fates in the army. This part gives a well-balanced portrayal of soldiers' training, highlighting its flaws : Hartman is always yelling, giving absurd orders and singing silly mottos made to transform his men into death machines. It also shows what happens to a mere human traumatized by the army as soon as he is taught how to shoot and how to kill...<br/><br/>The second part is utterly different, and disappointed me a lot... The plot follows the Joker, embodiment of the duality of man ""born to kill"" but seeking peace, in the backstage of Vietnam war. Kubrick shows again the perverted side of the army - control of information ; inhumane soldiers - but I am not convinced at all by the evolution of the characters. Indeed, I do not have any empathy for them, their fight, their achievements nor their death... I think the mise en abyme created by Joker's work (when he interviews or films the soldiers) ruins this part since it puts the spectator in an unsettling position. Throughout my watching, I was doubting : Is it a feature or a documentary ? Aren't these soldiers prepared to die ? Didn't they accept it ? How could I feel pity for them after what they did to Pyle ? What I saw are childish men put in a battlefield : it may have been what really happened, but today it is a well-known fact which does not surprise anymore.<br/><br/>Despite some catchphrases and must-see scenes (the interview of the soldiers in Vietnam is hilarious), I dislike fifty percent of Full Metal Jacket. However, I can understand why it has a high rating on IMDb (8.3/10) and I would recommend it to someone who would like to discover Kubrick's style."
"CherryBlossomBoy","5","1","3","20 January 2015"," A good film - DESPITE Kubrick
","That ""Full Metal Jacket"" was any good is almost entirely thanks to four men involved: Gustav Hasford who wrote the novel this film is based upon, Michael Herr who wrote the screenplay, and R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio who gave two most memorable and satisfying performances in it.<br/><br/>As for Stanley Kubrick who directed the whole thing, to give credit where it's due, he contributed with a couple of memorable and well shot scenes and the fact that hadn't been for him, the adaptation of ""Short-timers"" would probably never have seen the light of day. But he also made it disservice the way he handled the material. He took the subversive and satirical source and adapted it into a tedious and old-fashioned (for the 80s' standards) war flick.<br/><br/>I don't know where the reputed effort and meticulousness went when it comes to direction. I don't see it. I used to love Kubrick but I think ""Lolita"", ""Dr. Strangelove"" and parts of ""Oddissey"" were his peak. Here he's clearly out of form and reported numerous retakes of shots indicate that he had no clue what to do. He still had too many static shots that have ""made-for-TV"" written over them. He missed a lot of bad acting and the fact that his key villain at the end of the film cannot hold the rifle properly. He cast an absolute sleaze-ball in the lead role (Matthew Modine). I don't know if I was supposed to identify with him, I only wanted to kick his arse and I'm sorry Adam Baldwin's character didn't. Also, he didn't seem to notice that his ""Vietnam"" doesn't look like Vietnam much. And frankly, after Coppola brought us an 'almost' real thing, through the landscape of the Philippines in ""The Apocalypse Now"", I find it bizarre that anybody thought a couple of palm-trees in the studio back-lot would do it. Even worse is that the sets were amended by a man who once made his name by raising the production standards.<br/><br/>The structure of the film, though, is what really begs for being redone. The inexplicable omission of the third act from the book makes the film look empty and unfinished. and to simply edit it straightforwardly was unwise. We see two separate stories that connect badly to each other. There was some kind of juxtaposition clearly in Kubrick's intentions, but it's heavy-handed and frankly, after 15 minutes of act II you forget all about the act I. The structure of another Coppola's masterpiece, ""Godfather II"", is what would have benefited ""Full Metal Jacket"" greatly - to cross-cut between the two stories. There would've been all the juxtaposition one desired and the whole film would seem tighter and better paced. There wouldn't be a need for the third act because every part had its own three acts already, and the point that Kubrick ostensibly had to make, that war machine produces killers, would come across much more clearly.<br/><br/>All in all, a memorable film that could've been so much better with somebody else in director's chair. Of that generation, Robert Altman comes to mind. He handled satire and stories made of bits and pieces much, much better. He has proved it with ""MASH"" 18 years prior. He also can sneak his attitude in the whole ""impartial observer"" approach, to make it more engaging for the audience. Kubrick couldn't or didn't want to. His ""impartiality"" came off as indifference. It made ""Full Metal Jacket"" pretty cold and, despite the point made, pointless."
"Sylviastel","7","1","3","5 January 2015"," War is Hell!
","I am a fan of Stanley Kubrick's films but this is not one of my favorites. He follows marine soldiers from boot camp on Parris Island where they are dehumanized and demoralized all at once. The marines go to fight in Vietnam where they find themselves an unwanted presence. Matthew Modine plays a soldier and a reporter for the Stars and Stripes newspaper. Modine gives a terrific performance about a man disillusioned with war. Kubrick is a perfectionist and a realist. This film is crude, honest, candid, brutal, and realistic. It is an anti-war film anyway. I still don't understand the ending. The war scenes are realistic and violent all at once."

","The movie is well reviewed by others and most people find it very compelling. I like it to but am bothered by some shifts in tone in the final third although I think Kubrick deserves credit for not dodging the issue of atrocities.<br/><br/>I prefer war movies that don't glorify war more as in ""Platoon"" or the great German U-Boat film ""Das Boot"" (see it in German with English subtitles, when they overdubbed it in English they wrecked a great background soundtrack). All in all there's a bit too much flag waving in this for me but it's a great movie but I can help remembering that part of the promotion for ""Full Metal Jacket"" including displaying the novel that served as source material for it in supermarket checkout lanes. Seeing Kubrick's name on it I picked it up. The novel was called ""the Short Timers"" written by Marine Gustav Hasford who was in theater during 1968-69. The great prolific essayist, columnist, novelist, screen writer (including my favorite sci fi movie, ""a Boy and his Dog"") Harlan Ellison said of Short timers ""It is one of the most amazing stretches of writing I've ever encountered."" Even though I know this is a movie review, not a book review, I have to tell you the source for most of the movie was written largely in a different kind of English called jarhead lingo. It was very cool to read inspired sections that are prose written with those word. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, way more people were interested in watching Kubrick's movie than reading the real deal, the book didn't sell well, his deal with Kubrick wasn't very good and Hasford died alone almost broke in a motel room in Greece of heart related diabetic problems.<br/><br/>I don't know which is more heartbreaking. Hasford's early death or the fact that ""the Short Timers"" is out of print while people still buy Kubrick's movie and somebody gets paid. <br/><br/>The book has now become a rather expensive collector's item selling online for between $15 and upwards of $400. <br/><br/>If you Google the title and his name you'll find a link to a scribd page that will load the whole book like a pdf. But you can't save or download it without paying. But you can read it."
"Bowserb46","9","1","3","17 June 2013"," Still one of the best war movies ever
","Like any philosophically accurate war movie, FMJ does show the excesses of preparation followed by the hopelessness and insanity of war generally. The boot camp portion of the movie is not unlike Army basic training. ""Drop and give me twenty!"" is an order I'll never forget. There were a couple times, I was so tired, I'd rather have given the drill sergeant twenty dollars...even though I was making $78 per MONTH at the time.<br/><br/>Also, for being shot entirely in England, the similarity to and feel of Vietnam was captured, as far as I'm concerned, better than movies shot in the Philippines.<br/><br/>However... 1987 isn't the 1950's, and the suspension of disbelief that worked so well with never empty western six-shooters and machine guns that would fire forever and soldiers walking around with their fingers on the rifle triggers, just won't work in modern times. The Leave it to Beaver generation demands historical and technical accuracy. So, here we go.<br/><br/>Head scene with ""Gomer Pyle"" shooting the DI. NO WAY he could have gotten that rifle and ammo in the barracks. No way. In a real training base, you couldn't walk off the firing range with an expended cartridge case (I know. I saw a guy try!), much less live ammo. And rifles were controlled to an extent that even Bloomberg would have approved.<br/><br/>At the mass grave scene in VN. Saluting an officer in a combat area. Not done. Also a colonel would not have shiny metal insignia. And the end of that scene, the colonel salutes first. That is not military courtesy. The lower ranked person salutes, then holds until returned by the officer or superior officer. But again, they wouldn't salute at all. Two major gaffes. Also in that scene, the colonel refers to Joker's peace symbol on his ""body armor"". I never heard a flak jacket called ""body armor"" in Vietnam. I'm pretty sure that's a Gulf War era term.<br/><br/>Rifles. All the M-16's in this move look like the early XM16E1 or the Air Force model M-16 (three prong open flash suppressor, no forward assist). By 1968, all front line units would have had M-16A1's with the closed front flash suppressor and the forward assist.<br/><br/>A lot of the actors seemed to have remembered their orientation to gun handling--they carried their rifles correctly with their trigger finger in register--along the side of the lower receiver, NOT inside the trigger guard. Many others though were probably handling guns and rifles for the first time and forgot. Looks bad.<br/><br/>At one point, Cowboy ejects a magazine and inserts a new one, and that's it. When a mag empties, the bolt carrier locks back, and when you insert a new magazine, you have to either press the bolt catch or pull back and release the charging handle to chamber a round. He doesn't, but a moment later he starts firing again. Others, during lulls in the action, hit their mag release and let the mags fall to the ground. You don't do that unless you have to due to circumstances. Of course they do that ""in the movies"" because it looks cool.<br/><br/>End of rant. Still a good movie. 9/10. Without the technical goofs, it would be a ten."

It was a very effective style of putting drama in it other than romance which was made into effect on the movie Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>However, I gave this movie only a score of 7 because I don't find the second part of the movie, which was after the training inside the camp, interesting.

Also, it's about how the soldiers became nobodies to killing machines without no fear. <br/><br/>The acting here is solid. I think Lee Ermey steals the show as the drill sergeant.

"johnnyboyz","6","1","3","9 May 2009"," Rather empty and meandering exercise that spends about two hours just to tell us that 'the Vietnam War was rather unpleasant'.
","Full Metal Jacket is uneven and oddly uninteresting at the best of times, muddling whatever study of war it wants to make and substituting what should be quality, quality scenes of great drama with iffy bits of 'this and that' action as soldiers sit around, maybe coming under fire, shout a lot and then quite possibly do something stupid enough to get themselves shot. Full Metal Jacket tries to cram in as much as possible to do with the Vietnam War, as it shoots from basic training; to graduation from that; to Vietnam itself; to the battlefield on which the film will conclude whatever documentation, rather than study, it has made. At the be all and end all of it, it's underwhelming at how all this ground and all this distance is covered with not much product at the pinnacle.<br/><br/>There are scenes that you feel should work more than you feel they actually do. One such incidence involves a long take of the lead character walking down a muddied Vietnamese road with someone as tanks and trucks drive by beside them. The lead and the other soldier are talking about whereabouts and locations as they glance at a map of some kind. Your attention is drawn to the ongoing number of vehicles rolling on beside them, the dirt road acting as a metaphor for a conveyor belt as a continuous procession of troops are churned out and into their would-be doom as two human beings discuss the would-be whereabouts of a certain location. It captures the Vietnam War as a whole; a place in which a lot of fire power and lot of people kept getting rolled on into as those outranking them desperately tried to figure out what the Hell was going on and where the Hell everyone should be.<br/><br/>People say the film is split into two 'parts', but it's not. It's actually one particular 'part', complete with characters and study that materialises into something else that just happens to be set elsewhere. Kubrick introduces his film; sets characters up and in true Hitchcockian style, kills off the one character that drives his opening third. But he is left wanting from there on in – with that one, distinct shot that kills a certain someone, I'm tempted to say that the film dies right there in that washroom along with said personnel. What is a pretty brutal, but I would think honestly portrayed, account of what it's like to become a United States Marine, shows various young, drafted Americans being trained to become killing machines for the world of war. But Kubrick is laying a rug under our feet and when the lead character decides it's journalism in which his beck-and-call lies, all this prior show and tell revolving around combat and 'what it's like to be a soldier' was really for not very much, as the lead branches out into another area of expertise. The rug is pulled away and people will say it's clever from Kubrick, I say it's cheating and just a little clumsy.<br/><br/>Matthew Modine plays a certain Private Joker, 'Joker' being an alias he is given by his drill instructor Seargent Hartman (Ermey). The use of an alias and avoidance of use of Joker's real name attributes a certain ambiguity as to his identification, a renowned sense that everybody and anybody could 'represent' him as a character or as a real life person. The opening can be read into one of two ways; either you're going to find it a disturbing and very accurate look at the psychological effects of training for warfare or a series of 'fat' jokes that aren't particularly interesting. The fall guy is Leonard Lawrence (D'Onofrio), given the alias 'Private Pyle'. Pyle is the figure of ridicule throughout, with failings to accomplish the physical tasks the army demands consisting of the brunt of events in the opening hour. He is additionally a part of the film's one glaringly annoying scene during which the camera slowly zooms in on him pulling a would-be psychotic face as Hartman talks of Lee Harvey Oswald, himself an ex-marine, when he assassinated a certain person of a higher 'rank' than him. This foreshadows what is to come in regards to Pyle's own actions.<br/><br/>The majority of what happens in Vietnam is just stuff strung together. Joker goes from one bombed out location to another; he meets someone he knew from his training; he gets into a daft egotistical confrontation with one of those big, bulky, clichéd soldiers who exist purely to maim the enemy and enjoy it (think Andy Serkis in Deathwatch). He'll engage in dialogue by some ancient ruins and pay sly reference as to how, deep down, all the people who survive Vietnam will miss it because a little piece of them will remain here given what an ordeal it really is – but it feels heartless and a little silly. Kubrick marks his finale with a lot of red tints and smatterings of loose flames here and there, burning up the scenery. It's an obvious visual representation of a decent into some sort of Hell as the final confrontation with a sniper is played out. But when people do get shot, Matthew Modine forgets to react and when other G.I.'s are downed by the Vietcong, there is no real reason to feel for them other than to remember that ""it really happened, thus I must feel bad for those that really suffered this fate"". The film is actually quite a soulless exercise and from what I have seen, is Kubrick's worst work."

","After a gruelling marine training programme, the flippant Private Joker finds himself a military journalist covering the US-North Vietnam war in 1968. When he hooks up with a platoon on a search and destroy mission in Hue City, he finds he will need all his courage, intelligence and humour to stay alive and sane ...<br/><br/>This is arguably the greatest war film ever made; anybody anywhere thinking of joining the military should see it first before signing up. The incredible thing about it is that dramatically it's not in the least bit realistic - like all Kubrick's work it's highly stylised and meticulously orchestrated - and yet somehow it's also the most realistic film anyone's ever made about combat, military training and what it really means to be a solider. Based on the book The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford, and brilliantly scripted by Kubrick and Michael Herr, it unflinchingly shows what happens to men in extreme circumstances and how the dehumanising process of training affects them differently; Joker escapes through his sardonic humour and Pyle simply goes insane - these two performances by Modine and D'Onofrio are simply outstanding in every respect. The entire ensemble are great but there are two other memorable turns, by Ermey as the hard-as-nails drill instructor in the first half and Baldwin as the psychotic Animal Mother in the second. Much of the film's authentic atmosphere is due to Ermey, a former real-life marine, who was the technical adviser on the movie, trained the cast and delivers a performance from which there is simply no escape. The photography is simply breathtaking in its fluidity and composition. Every frame is artfully rendered and almost every scene is powerful and hypnotic. The blue nightmare of Pyle's beating, the unforgettable murder-suicide confrontation, Animal Mother's astonishing charge towards the sniper's hideout, the down-and-dirty tracking shots through smoky ruins; all are brilliantly constructed. Astonishingly for a story set in Vietnam, virtually all of the location shooting was done in east London in condemned factories, retro-fitted and dressed to look the part thanks to brilliant art direction work by Anton Furst. Only Kubrick would have the audacity to pull of such a masterstroke (he lived just outside London and hated going on location) and the results are breathtaking. The eerily effective electronic music was composed by Kubrick's daughter Vivian (using the pseudonym Abigail Mead), combined with highly effective period songs, particularly Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones. Trivia - the voice of Murphy, the radio dispatcher, is none other than Stan the Man himself. This is a tough movie for sure - there aren't many chuckles and it doesn't have anything complimentary to say about the human race - but its drama is potent and profound. Part of Kubrick's genius was not to preach in his films, but to simply present his stories and his characters and encourage us to judge them for ourselves. Full Metal Jacket is about what conflict really does to people. Too many war films moralise, simplify, omit the unpalatable and show actions without consequences; this movie puts us through the wringer, forces us to identify with people we'd rather not, and weaves an intense suspenseful story of the depths of human folly. Outstanding."

","Upon watching this movie for about the tenth time since it came out, I found a goof or error that has not been mentioned. When Hartmann is giving his first speech to the trainees, and the camera pans the barracks, the positions of both Pyle and Joker change. When Hartmann punches Joker, Joker is at the end of the line. In the pan view, Pyle is at the end. They switch places for the punch. After Joker is punched, Hartmann walks up the line of recruits and gets to Pyle. Pyle is in the position previously held by Joker. This movie is great for the emphasis is gives on recruit training. Although I was never in the military, I know several people that were. My son's friend just completed his tour on ""The Island"" and the movie is a little soft compared to the actual training regimen."

This was a good movie. It wasn't great. The film is about the many adventures of Private Joker (Modine) as he goes through boot camp and goes off to the Vietnam War. The first 45 minutes are the intense boot camp program led by R Lee Ermey playing a heartless jerk, doing the best performance in the film. The second half of the film is Joker and his buddies at war, whether it be fighting, or playing around with the dead bodies. My problem with this movie, is there really is no plot or a center to it. It's just a big timeline of somebody's life that ends us wondering, ""Well, what next?"" However, Stanley Kubrick has a great war movie here and one of my favorite war films of the 80's.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 115 mins. R for strong violence and language."
"pawebster","7","1","3","25 July 2006"," At the gas works
","I enjoyed this the most of the Vietnam films I've seen. It's a weird film in many ways. Many have commented on the fact that it is actually two films rather flimsily stuck together. The first half, on the training, is rightly famous as the most extreme of its genre, but let's face it, it was not exactly a new idea, even in the mid 80s. An Officer and a Gentleman had visited the area not many years before. The way that that sequence ends is overdone in my view. It's certainly not subtle.<br/><br/>What makes FMJ better than other films, such as Platoon or Hamburger Hill, is that it has some humanity about it. The end sequence with the sniper is touching. In contrast, Platoon goes so far in showing that War Is Hell and Life Is Meaningless that one starts to lose interest. Meaninglessness is actually uninteresting.<br/><br/>It shares with other Vietnam films the problem that we don't really get to know the characters enough and cannot sufficiently follow or empathise with their motivation and actions. Matthew Modine's character can be summarised as 'nice guy with a sense of irony' and that's about all. This is not really enough to carry the film.<br/><br/>For a British viewer like me, it's hard to forget that this was almost entirely filmed in England, a country not exactly famous for its similarity in geography and climate to the jungles of S.E. Asia. The use of the old Beckton gasworks as Hue City is weird. It's very obvious that no one is sweating and no one is fighting off mosquitoes, etc. They were probably wishing they could wear overcoats at the time!"

The boot camp scenes were my favorite. Every time the drill sergeant yelled cuss words and said weird stuff to Gomer Pyle it always made me laugh. In some ways the movie should of been longer. It's only like 2 hours long and I just wanted to see what happened to the platoon after that sniper shootout scene at the end and how Private Joker developed after losing his friend.

"theplanetsmasher1","Null","1","3","5 August 2004"," One of the most realistic war films ever produced
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I bought this movie a while ago knowing it was a really great movie and I had some money to burn. After I watched it I just thought, ""Wow...this is one hell of an original war movie."" I was blown away at how well it depicted boot camp and the war. Boot camp I especially enjoyed because it was so fierce. It's not like Stripes or anything where it's comical and people have a good time, it drives people insane!<br/><br/>The film is broken up into two different parts. It starts out in a montage of new jarheads (some of which are later revealed as main characters) getting their heads shaved coming into Paris Island. It then flashes to their new drill sargent, Lee Ermey, greeting the new troops. From there they are spiraled into a veritable hell as they are abused, physically and verbally, and whipped into shape for the Marines. The major character here is Private Joker (Matthew Modine) who is a bit of a smartass but kind none-the-less and is forced to help out Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) who is drowning in the pressure of the camp. Pyle still can't improve so the sargent decides to punish everyone else when he screws up. This turns into a backlash from the rest of the recruits which changes him. Pyle becomes more reclusive, learning every single rule and becoming a machine. He is finally driven over the edge one night before they are shipped out and commits suicide and kills the sargent in front of Pvt. Joker. <br/><br/>The next part is the recruits we've met in Vietnam. After about a 10 or 15 minute period in their base they are sent out to fight. A few minor things happen, they are filmed, a friend of theirs dies, but not anything groundbreaking. Then they are given orders to go to a city to clear it. There the film culminates in an extremely well done and shot sniper attack where most of our soldiers we have met die including one of Joker's best friends, Pvt. Cowboy. This triggers a huge scene where men run in to kill this sniper who they find out is a little girl demanding to be shot to be put out of her misery. The next scene is a recap of events from Joker as they are marching away in the night. THe Micky Mouse Club theme they are singing adds a little bit of humor to it. <br/><br/>The movie is R for language, sexuality, and war violence. Most of the language is in the boot camp scene and comes from the sargent's mouth. All of the sexuality is from Vietnamese prostitutes that come on two occasions. The latter of which is more in-depth when they talk about the one's penis being too large and he takes it out to show, we don't see it however. Of course, the war violence comes in the second part, most of which is in the final scene. It nothing too graphic but may disturb some.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a masterpiece. Some parts lag a little but they are compensated in the rest of the film. Final Grade: 9/10"
"Ben_Cheshire","10","1","3","1 July 2004"," About individualism at war. A memorable work, except for voiceover.
","(SPOILERS! I pretty much describe what happens in the movie)<br/><br/>Its structure mirrors the experience of the individual at war. Not the entire war like Griffith's Birth of a Nation, not the family at war like The Patriot or Saving Private Ryan, or a platoon like The Thin Red Line or Platoon, but a very individual individual: as in an American who values his individual values and personal expression (Matthew Modine). What is his place in war - which is a collective institution, something the United States is not naturally. The US values individualism, which is the conflict at the centre of Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>The movie is all about the relation between the individual and the group: you start off by yourself in the barber's chair, yet to the barber (and to the audience, during the credits), you're just another face in a long line of anonymous recruits. Without realising it yet, you've already lost your individuality. Then, during basic training, you're with a misleadingly cohesive and small group of people, and the hard-ass drill-seargent (in a memorable turn from a real drill seargent that Kubrick hired to put the actors through realistic basic training and liked him so much he decided to use him in the movie) tries to make you all look and act the same, the way he wants you to act. But basic training ends, and you don't necessarily see the same people again - so we don't. Many characters we never meet again. Matthew Modine, being an individual, chooses the only way to express yourself at war, journalism. Then, when Modine finally goes out into the field, its not a large-scale depiction of an important manouevre, but a small-scale, just a small group moving around until they get into trouble, without any idea of the relevance of their specific actions in the large picture of the war.<br/><br/>I love Full Metal Jacket - its another highly sculpted and architectured work by Kubrick - and an unforgettable one, with great music. I always find the last part particularly visceral - with the sniper. A great metaphor for the uselessness of war. The group are not achieving anything by moving through this area, its just a routine movement from place to place, but they get themselves one by one knocked down by a sniper, because they can't just walk away, they can't stop themselves from involving themselves. And when they finally meet the enemy (SPOILERS WARNING!), they are nothing like they imagined - hardly a menace at all.<br/><br/>My only regret about Full Metal Jacket is the voiceover. You know how you sometimes listen to a voiceover and its really obvious that the actor who's speaking it has not made the film yet, or has no idea of his character, or anything to do with the situation. Matthew Modine's voiceover stands out for me as the single worst example of this, particularly in a phenomenal picture like Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>9/10."

I agree, but for different reasons: 1.) It's pretty much on the spot of what boot camp is like. But it is more violent. But they had to ease down for the audience. 2.) The acting is amazing. I actually thought to myself ""I'm not sure if they're actors, or if Stanely Kubrik just decided to go to a boot camp and just ask if they can film what goes on at boot camp for a few weeks.

"MadReviewer","6","1","3","10 May 2001"," What Is Your Major Malfunction?
","""Full Metal Jacket"", which often seems to be more a random collection of loosely connected stories than an actual movie, dooms itself to mediocrity by telling its best stories first. The first half hour is incredibly powerful, possibly the best work that master director Stanley Kubrick ever captured on film . . . and then the film stumbles backwards, unable to maintain the impossibly high standards that it established for itself. Since the film has nowhere to go but down, down it goes, and without a unifying theme holding the film together, ""Full Metal Jacket"" degenerates into a confusing mess. <br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" is about the journey of one man, Private Davis(Matthew Modine), during the Vietnam War, starting with boot camp and heading inexorably onward to the horrors found in Vietnam. Throughout all his experiences, finds nothing but madness and chaos in everything he sees, from his maniacal drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, whose performance is absolutely flawless in this film) to the Vietnamese ""enemy"" to the soldiers on his own side. In a way, the original movie poster for ""Full Metal Jacket"" best describes the film -- it shows a soldier's helmet decorated with both a psychedelic peace symbol and the angrily scrawled phrase BORN TO KILL. <br/><br/>The strength of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is ultimately its downfall as well - the opening training scenes at Paris Island. While Davis is essentially the main character of the film (or at least the main observer), the basic training sequence of events focuses primarily on the horrifying relationship between Drill Instructor Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and one unfortunate recruit nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). To be fair, Sergeant Hartman treats all the recruits (including Davis, whom Hartman nicknames `Private Joker`) with equal amounts of venom and disdain, but it's Private Pyle that's affected by it the most, and as such, Pyle's relationship with Sergeant Hartman becomes the cornerstone of all the basic training scenes. R. Lee Ermey (who in real life was an actual Marine drill instructor before his foray into acting) puts on such a brutally honest, harrowing, and disturbing performance that it's unforgettable . . . and it easily blows the performance of almost every other actor in the movie. (Watch for a priceless scene where the sergeant tries to inspire his recruits for a sharpshooting drill . . . and uses Lee Harvey Oswald as his shining example of marksmanship.) The exception to this is Vincent D'Onofrio, who turns Private Pyle into a ticking timebomb of insecurities, wanting desperately to succeed and to please the sergeant - although, deep down, Pyle knows he'll never be anything but a failure in the sergeant's eyes. Two masterful performances, both bordering on film perfection, but since neither Sergeant Hartman nor Private Pyle continue onward with Davis to Davis's part in the Vietnam conflict, the rest of the film suffers greatly. After basic training, it's off to the Vietnam War, and this is where the film just falls apart. Some scenes are undeniably brilliant, some are uninspired and awful, but no matter the quality of the scenes, there's nothing linking them all together. Perhaps this was Kubrick's intent, to show that one of the most horrifying things about war is just how meaningless it all is. But telling the truth doesn't automatically translate into telling a great story, or even a mediocre one, and ""Full Metal Jacket"" degenerates into a muddled heap of conflicting messages and morals despite its raw honesty. Yes, it's sad and horrifying, but it's done in such an detached, unfocused manner that the brain becomes numb to the horror, instead of outraged by it.<br/><br/>
Two grades for ""Full Metal Jacket"": An A+ for the basic training scenes, which are equal parts brilliant and distrurbing, and a C+ for the overall movie, which sadly falls apart once those basic training scenes end. Not one of Kubrick's better films."
"cfcpg","4","3","18","25 November 2005"," Kubrick's weakest movie
","If Kubrick has done only masterpieces then this one fails. Here there is no magic touch, no vivid colors, no famous music score, no fancy camera movements in his style. Very little cinema. And the format 1.33:1 doesn't help.<br/><br/>The first part is OK with the training camp. Good psychology. Well done. But that is it. The movie ends. It isn't even spectacular. I don't know what message Kubrick wanted to portray but I think Francis Ford Coppola did a far better job with APOCALYPSE NOW. There is no comparison. Coppola really showed us and gave us an idea of the horrors of war.<br/><br/>Unlike all war movies where the action takes place on a vast territory, here all the war scenes wheel around a small abandoned manufacture. Besides a couple of gun shooting scenes there is nothing spectacular with the soldiers always talking supposedly saying so many profound things but I don't get their point. During the film did Kubrick run out of money?"
"lhhung_himself","4","2","11","27 July 2002"," Half a film from half a genius
","Kubrick must rank with Hitchcock as the most overrated director of our time. Full Metal Jacket is one of his pretentious half-failures. The first part of the movie is quite compelling. The real-life drill sargeant is so good that we overlook the fact that the other characters might as well be carrying cardboard sandwiches with what symbol they are supposed to represent. The second part of the film is supposed to, I think, contrast the chaos and reality of the battlefield to the order and artificiality of the parade ground. This was done beautifully in Kurosawa's two masterful scenes in Ran. Needless to say, Kubrick is no Kurosawa, and is not up to the task. The man has no understanding of how to shoot an action sequence, or how real people, not symbols interact. This artificiality, which was tolerable in the first part makes the second part completely laughable. I once saw a very good snippet of Godard (himself vastly overrated..), comparing shot by shot, the sniper scene with real footage from Vietnam and lamenting upon how static, sterile, and lacking in excitement the Kubrick version is. I think all the weaknesses are summarized in the ""surprise"" climax of the film which I found to be completely out of place and as dated as the film and its director. The years have been much kinder to Platoon, or even Apocalypse Now."

","This film brilliantly depicts the brutality of warfare from the beginning of basic training to the battlefield, it is set during the Vietnam war but could probably have been set during any modern war.<br/><br/>The film opens with a group of young men having their hair cut so short that they are virtually bald. We next see them in their barracks as they meet they drill instructor for the first time, he soon gives each of them nick names and we don't hear their real names again. It is clear that one of them, Private Pyles, isn't really cut out for life in the Marines Corps, whatever they are expected to do in training he seems incapable of doing it. As training progresses it is clear that Pyles is going gradually insane and we see just how insane he has become in a shocking scene on the night after the recruits have finished training and been given their assignments.<br/><br/>The film then moves to Vietnam where we follow Private Joker who as been assigned to work for ""Stars and Stripes"", the US Military's newspaper. Apart from Joker the only character from the first half of the film is Private Cowboy, Joker is reunited with him when sent to report of efforts to drive the enemy out of the city of Hue after the Tet offensive. We don't see large battles, instead the main action focuses on the engagement with a single sniper who has wounded one member of the squad in an attempt to draw the others out into the open.<br/><br/>This is very much a film of two halves with only one character having a major role in both. While Matthew Modine is the star of the film the most memorable characters are foul mouthed Gny. Sgt. Hartman played perfectly by former US Marine drill instructor Lee Ermey and Private Pyles played by Vincent D'Onofrio. The action is believable through out, I would never have guessed that it had been filmed entirely in England if I hadn't been told even though I've been to one of the locations used many times. As one would expect from one of Kubrick's films the direction is virtually flawless and he gets the best out of his cast.<br/><br/>I was surprised that this film has recently been reclassified down from 18 to 15 as it is fairly brutal and disturbing through out, in particular Private Pyles descent in to madness as he is bullied and humiliated relentlessly during training. That said it is still a great film that I would recommend to anybody interested in war films."

He and Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard) go around the front, interviewing different soldiers until they come across Eightball's (Dorian Harewood) platoon, there they meet Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), a tough killing machine who mainly just follows his superiors.

Not the director's best film, nor the best Vietnam war film either.<br/><br/>The film gives us an interesting 20 minute introduction, as we see how the young army recruits endure a boot-camp hell through training and pervasive verbal abuse from a hellish drill instructor played finely by Lee Ermey who reminds the marines that they are 'all equally useless'. The training is intense, the discipline is maximum - this causes one overweight recruit to finally blow his brains out from being psyched out by the pervasive drill instructor.<br/><br/>What is important, and Kubrick shows us this is the process of dehumanisation that so many young men undergo, so they can go kill other innocent people for an aimless reason. We are shown, the horrors of the war through Private Joker, as he embarks on a journey which takes in deserted places.<br/><br/>Kubrick frequently shows us the effects of war on man. In a scene, where Private Joker is on a helicopter, he observes a soldier menacingly fire the automatic weapon at women down below on the rice fields - the man later exclaims; 'ain't war hell?'.<br/><br/>Two criticisms I have for this film are, number one, it does not possess the gritty, realistic environment of Vietnam that films like 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse Now' and 'The Deer Hunter' possess. The second criticism is the film's small stories, some of them which are masterful, but others which are slow and inconclusive.<br/><br/>However, Full Metal Jacket possesses some gritty and effectively shot sequences accompanied with a pumping soundtrack - one thing that Kubrick cannot be criticised for is his choice of music. In every of his films, he seems to pick the perfect music.<br/><br/>The profanities in the film, which are frequent and coarse, are in many ways important in accentuating distress, fear and boredom.<br/><br/>Kubrick's FMJ is a worthy addition to the war genre; it is in many ways a unique and powerful film, but ultimately fails to amount to the harrowing mastery of other Vietnam films.<br/><br/>In the last scene, where Private Joker walks through ruins with other members of the platoon, he narrates to us that he can't wait to go home an have a 'home f*ck'... I leave it at that <br/><br/>7/10"

"Movie-12","6","1","4","28 June 2001"," Shocking to see the material, but is it really entertaining? **1/2 (out of four)
","FULL METAL JACKET / (1987) **1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>With Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" you get two masterfully constructed movies for the price of one-a movie about boot camp and a movie about Vietnam. Unfortunately, under most circumstances, neither film is worth viewing.<br/><br/>It's shocking to watch the risks Kubrick takes with this material. From the opening shots, against a soundtrack featuring ""Goodbye Dolly, Hello Vietnam,"" images flash before our eyes of marine recruits getting their heads shaven clean for training camp. Cut to a rude, obnoxious, drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey), shouting curses at these young recruits as he passes down the double aisle of bunks at a basic training camp in Paris Island. ""From now on you'll speak only when spoken to, the first and last words out of your mouth will be sir!"" In this segment, we witness the agonizing training sessions and dills that these poor young men must conquer. Most of them do a fine job. All except for a moronic, uncoordinated maggot nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). The personalities of Hartman and Pyle clash like water and oil, or more like fire and propane.<br/><br/>Little dialogue exists with in this personality conflict, but there sure is a hell of a lot of screaming and shouting of disgusting insults. I wanted relief from the Sergeant's nonstop obscenity and discrimination. Lee Ermey does wonderful things with his character, but the character is repulsive. He gave me a headache to the extent that I had to turn the movie off momentarily and walk outside to clear my mind and take a few deep breaths of fresh air.<br/><br/>Considering a lot of Ermey's dialogue was improvised, I admire phrases like these. This kind of dialogue is great if you're looking for a hard-edged, realistic look at military training camps. But play that same kind of tone and dialogue for over forty-five minutes, then is it really entertaining? Engaging? If you answer yes, then I have just learned things about you I did not want to know.<br/><br/>The second segment of ""Full Metal Jacket"" takes off when the trained military troops arrive in Vietnam. The movie then disintegrates into a series of detached, self contained war sequences. Most war movies, regardless of how disturbing or graphic, secure at least some rank within my emotions. ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" and even ""Tigerland"" captured my heart in very different ways, but this movie feels detached to all humanity and spirit. There is nothing harrowing about scene after scene of hopeless characters getting shot to hell if we don't feel for those characters. Kubrick eliminates his only two interesting characters in the first segment, leaving his second segment to shrivel and die.<br/><br/>
Although I disliked the film, I admire many things about ""Full Metal Jacket."" The film's serious attitude towards its subjects. Kubrick's ironic message that people produce killers, and that killers are not born, reverses his own stance as seen in ""A Clockwork Orange."" Kubrick's style also shows through; the film's finale holds true to his sardonic sense of theme and moralization. The two films also comment on each other. I never knew the phrase ""I am in a world of shit,"" could carry so much impact and meaning. I also liked how Kubrick refrained from glamorizing any aspects of the film. In several juicy sequences, there were distinctive possibilities of sex. While there is sex in the film, Kubrick avoids portraying sex on screen. I think he did this to evade a potential attraction and distraction to the audience.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick was one of the most vivid, courageous directors that will ever live. He was a perfectionist, always creating a true portrait of his visions. He took risks. Some of them worked, some of them did not. ""Full Metal Jacket"" displays a stunning quality of filmmaking; it was nominated for an Oscar for its achievement in screen writing. But the movie fails to actually entertain and enlighten. I was disappointed in the film. Many audiences will remember Kubrick's portrait of Vietnam as a film that defined a generation, but it's too bad that the film didn't do it entertainingly."
"JayPatton88","6","1","5","19 November 2019"," Compared to the movie ""Platoon""
","This movie does not stand a chance. Another movie about the conflict in Vietnam, but the plot and cast falls far short of my expectations because I watched the film ""Platoon"" first. Unlike ""Platoon"" , which I watch to this day, I watched this film once, and will never watch it again as I feel it's not worth my time."
"patrulescudariana","5","1","5","31 July 2017"," Whatever happened to Kubrick in this one?
","Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" seems to be composed of two movies, put together without any useful connection between them. The first part is also the most memorable one, with a terrific performance from R.Lee Ermey, who plays Sgt. Hartman. His training for the Marine Corps is harsh and brutal, shown with a subtle touch of bitter humor, like when Hartman asks a recruit who is introducing himself as Leonard Lawrence: ""Lawrence? Lawrence what, of Arabia?"" Nevertheless, his words are at all times a source of emotional abuse, aiming to annihilate the recruit' personality and to build indestructible men. And that, in the movie's own language, quite equals mindless killers in the Vietnam war. They are meant to be weapons, to take down as many enemies as possible. As one character puts it: ""Do you think we waste gooks for freedom? This is slaughter."" They know it, and they went in that devastated country for it. <br/><br/>The second part is an authentic representation of war as pure hell through plausible imagery of fire and ruins, but since the characters lack depth we can't empathize with them. The movie soon becomes quite shallow, empty of any feelings to convey to the audience. And what a shame that is, when its beginning was so promising!<br/><br/>Kubrick's music choice in other films established him as quite a master of finding perfect sounds to go with his most iconic shots, but the songs we hear in ""Full Metal Jacket"" have a life of their own. They don't blend with the scenes, nor do they add deeper meaning to the action. <br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" has some good moments and it shows the disillusioned America mostly through the eyes of Joker, trying to turn him into a symbol. A man who doesn't want to kill, but has to. A man who doesn't like the world he lives in, but is glad to breathe one more day. But Kubrick doesn't get to Joker's conscience, to his thoughts. Somehow this is his view, but strangely objectified, lacking a so much needed psychological expression. <br/><br/>This movie's idea is undoubtedly good, but not exploited enough, not powerful enough. There are times when Kubrick's direction can't be seen anywhere. Greater things were expected from him and he didn't deliver."
"writetopcat","4","1","5","18 February 2016"," Liberal Caricatures of Marines & Bad Over-acting
","Full Metal Jacket is a leftist oriented movie about a fictional group of Marines as they go through training and to Vietnam. It portrays Marines as ""killers"" who glorify killing, except for a few in whom the training doesn't take hold; these are depicted as generally decent, smartass, sarcastic, skeptical, opponents of the war. That is the general division of Marines in this movie: 1-men who have been brainwashed to love killing on the one hand, and 2- decent men with a few faults on the other hand. <br/><br/>The drill instructor tells the men in boot camp that Lee Harvey Oswald and Charles Witman are examples of the kind of Marines he wants them to become, because they knew how to shoot straight and to kill. There is an implication that the training in boot camp drives one trainee crazy enough to murder the DI and them himself. <br/><br/>There is plenty of stuff like this in the movie. The 1st type of Marine in the film goes overboard in acting boorish and stupid. It is overdone to the point that you notice how bad the acting is done. The idea is to create caricatures, making a distinction between the men Kubrick shows as having accepted the Marine training and those he shows as not having taken the training or the mission to heart. <br/><br/>The second type of Marine as depicted by Kubrick is often smartass to a great degree, almost to the point of openly ridiculing a general to his face. This Marine is given a hero status. The 1st type of Kubrick's Marines are depicted as dunderheaded morons, on whom the sarcastic wit of the smartass Marines is lost. There are no people in Kubrick's film who are representative of real life Marines: intelligent, good, decent men and women who fight when called upon to do so, but with no bloodlust or desire to kill anyone. <br/><br/>The Hollywood stereotypes are so stark in this film that it really is no surprise that it won so many awards."
"CazMcGovernMcKinnon","10","1","5","4 January 2008"," what a fantastic film - Kubrick has done it yet again
","Some reviews on here make me wince. A lot of people here obviously don't appreciate the art of film making anymore if you believe that Kubrick is a bad director. You don't have to like him but at least appreciate the pure genius of how he messes with your head Just like he did in the absolutely spell binding Shining. The movie is in a way philosophically one movie, but mentally like two. The first part lets the audience in on what it truly is like to be trained and pushed and pressurised to become at the end of the day - a killer. Kubrick's monotonous and often perverse and disturbing shots of the marines doing the same thing over and over and over again is just fantastic because not a lot is going on on screen - and yet your eyes are glued. Then all of a sudden, Kubrick jolts you with absolute horror to show how perfectly nice but slow people were and still are tortured for being different, for not being able to reach this demands which as human beings I truly believe we just aren't supposed to be able to meet- the scene when the other men are abusing Vincent Denoffrio could have been banal, boring and corny and yet it is a directorial masterpiece and this movie isn't even a horror but the toilet scene kept me up for two nights. The second part of the movie is simply wonderful. It's subtleties and short choppy scenes really are a clever way to make you truly believe you were there, in Nam. It becomes a 'war movie' that also tackles much deeper and emotional issues. I am part of a much younger generation, I was born in 1991 and had just finished studying this part of history in class and I felt an even deeper passion for these people and this awful, awful war. Kubrick is a genius bottom line- may he always be remembered for fantastic works of art such as this amazing portrayal of war, and humanity."
"Hannibal_Chigurh","9","1","5","25 October 2007"," Yet another Kubrick classic
","After a seven year hiatus following the release of the horror masterpiece The Shining, Kubrick returned with a war film, Full Metal Jacket. The film manages to take a slew of war clichÃ©s and make them into something wholly original. The movie opens at Marine boot camp, with R. Lee Ermey yelling his head off at all the new recruits. He focuses in particular on Leonard Lawrence, whom he dubs Private Pyle. Vincent D'Onofrio makes a stunning debut, playing Pyle with equal parts lovable simpleton and ticking time bomb. His performance is so unsettling that he (and Ermey's profane Sgt. Hartman) is the most memorable part of the film.<br/><br/>The second part of the movie takes place in the Nam, specifically in a fight for Hue City. Pvt. Joker, a Marine reporter, joins his training buddy Cowboy as he documents the battle. While many of the film's fans prefer the first, more comedic half, the second is where the film achieves greatness. The humor here is even darker than in the training segment, and Kubrick uses action sequences for a purpose. Rather than just having explosions to excite the audience, he uses the fight to show the effects of the war on these soldiers. Adam Baldwin's Animal Mother is the most fascinating study.<br/><br/>While the two distinct parts of the film divide viewers, the film is truly another triumph for Kubrick. It is the third best Vietnam film I've seen (the first two being Apocalypse Now and Platoon), and like those two films and all great war movies, the conflict is not with the enemy but with oneself and one's allies."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9","1","5","12 December 2004"," Very close to perfection, but not entirely there
","If I were to describe this movie with one word, I would say 'unsettling'. Then again, I suppose this could be said about most of Stanley Kubrick's films. I've seen a few of his films lately, and have become quite a fan of his work... so far I've seen A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey and this one(I've seen The Shining as well, but that was before I knew who Kubrick was and what kind of a director he was, so I didn't fully enjoy it). While I think both aforementioned titles are better than this one(if only slightly), I really did like this film. And while it isn't the best war film ever made, it is definitely one of the better. The film consists of two parts(though they aren't really that separated... and they are both parts of the same story), the first part being about the boot camp which trains the Marines, and the second one being about the Vietnam war. Both parts have essentially the same point and theme... and both deliver it quite well. However, there are a few flaws in the film... it seems uneven, somehow. Some of the scenes, especially in the beginning of the second part, seemed pointless and overlong. Kubrick is famed for his uncanny ability to set a mood and keep it, which makes his films more effective and even harder to watch than they were just with the chilling visuals and excellent use of music. However, here, he seemed almost lost for a few scenes... things didn't seem to go anywhere... maybe he's just not used to doing such a grand project... yes, he was a very ambitious director, with very big films on his resume... but I'm not sure if he had done something on this scale before(or after), so that might be it. Of course, this doesn't mean that the film is bad... not by a long shot. There were just a few scenes that seemed to have little importance... and the voice-over narration seemed tacked on, if you ask me. Like he was trying to implement it, but sufficed to just throwing it in here and there. The plot is great. The pacing is good, but not perfect. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written and credible. The music/score is excellent. Kubrick always manages to put in music that sounds really good in scenes that contain disturbing and unpleasant visuals to great effect. The film as a whole is a little flawed but I didn't find anything horribly wrong with the film. Great film with great theme. Any fan of Kubrick should enjoy this. This is possibly the most spoofed/referenced war film of all time... and it's the film that gave R. Lee Ermey the character that he would play for basically the rest of his career. That says something about how crafty and influential this film is, I think. I recommend this film to any fan of Stanley Kubrick and/or war movies. 9/10"

","'Full Metal Jacket' is structured like a play in two acts, with little connection between the two parts excepting one of the principal characters. The first part describes the brutal basic training that turns young normal kids, just out of their childhood into killing machines. It's sarcastic, tragical funny, with excellent dialogs, pace and logic. The second part looks more like a war movie, which is kind of a paradox because it's a war movie within an anti-war movie. Arrived in Vietman the young people in the America 60s find themselves immersed within the same world of cruelty and immorality as any of their fellows sent to fight the just or the unjust wars of the past and of the present.<br/><br/>Kubricks building has an internal balance despite the lack of symmetry of the two parts. The first scene is a typical disconnection between the normal life and the army. The last scenes show our heroes trying to exercise the feelings of human solidarity the real life, but facing the absurd and lack of any logic of the war. The common thread is the strong anti-war message, typical to Kubrick not only in this film."

","The FIRST PART:
featuring the military training of new American soldiers destined for Vietnam is gripping, sickening, real and basically sums up the whole destructive power of war, while the soldiers havent even left America.<br/><br/>The intense drilling and dehumanizing of the soldiers during training in America is being portrayed with such chilling excellence, that it even gives a better understanding of the destructiveness of warfare, than showing real combat on the battlefield. It would have sufficed had director Kubrick only made an entire movie about nothing else but the training of soldiers in America. Unfortunately he didnt. This movie breaks in half in 2 parts.<br/><br/>The SECOND PART:
Kubrick is NOT an action director. He is a subtle, intelligent director for whom dialogue and character interaction are most important. The first part had all these qualities of true to life dialogue and great character interaction. In the second part however, trying to portray characters interact with each other during action combat scenes looks out of place at times. The photography and the film set (London) didnt look convincing at moments either, which detracts from the credibility of the combat scenes. The acting performances were a bit off as well in the second part, although it does end with a magnificent, yet sickening climax. Sickening in an impressive true to life kind of way, portraying the real horrors of war...<br/><br/>Despite the flawed second part it is still a very impressive movie, which I would recommend, because it trashes any beliefs that war is a glorious battle.

The first half of the movie is far better, and feels utterly disjointed and disconnected from the second. By far the most interesting, intense, and grim part of the second half is the section with the hidden sniper, which did draw me out of my state of boredom. The ending was lazy, and the overall the film fall far short of the sum and its parts, failing to develop a coherent narrative, characters, or message. Heck, had it not dragged so badly in parts, and/or seemed so amateurish in its editing, it might not have been so bad. At least 'Full Metal Jacket' is still watchable, but it's not way near as good as the praise that's been lavished upon it. Had this movie been released today, it would have flopped critically and with audiences. But because its an established 'classic', the emperor with no clothes scenario continues ever onwards. Still, it has its merits, unlike that other alleged classic 'The Deer Hunter' (1/10* in my opinion), which is excruciatingly and embarrassingly awful, and similarly lapped up blindly by the masses. Don't view these films by their received accolades, but as a piece of cinema with an impartial eye. It's a pass, just. 6/10*"

"elicopperman","9","0","1","24 November 2018"," The War Genre Doesn't Get Better than This
","Stanley Kubrick was one of the several filmmakers out there who was able to make multiple movies in different genres and succeed in flying colors. Whether it'd be science fiction in 2001, horror in The Shining, comedy in Dr. Strangelove and dystopian crime thrillers in Clockwork Orange. So it wouldn't be a surprise for him to create an epic war film, and Full Metal Jacket was that. Based on the autobiographical novel The Short Timers by Gustav Hasford, who also co-wrote the script, this film went on to gain massive critical acclaim and is often seen as one of Kubrick's best, and I definitely agree on that.<br/><br/>The general storyline revolves around the training of U.S. Marines, primarily on privates Joker and Pyle, who struggle to get through boot camp under the abusive drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and Joker's later experiences in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. Many have criticized the film's odd method of storytelling, where the first act is structured well enough as a raw visceral depiction of army training camps, and the last two feel disjointed and all over the place. However, I think that actually works in favor of the feature, because all the casualties that come about during the war battles are just as sporadic as any given military combat. This movie stares straight at the ugliness of war and how violent mankind can get without being preachy or heavily metaphorical.<br/><br/>The film does have plenty of humorous moments, such as during the combat training and the witty banter amongst Joker and the other marines, but they're no more in contrast to the harsh tones shown throughout. The scenes of private Pyle struggling throughout camp training may seem bitterly comedic at times, yet the horrific abuse given to the poor guy ends up creating a monster rather than a ""killer"". In addition, Vincent D'Onofrio did a great job displaying Pyle as sympathetic, both when he's miserable in combat practice, and when he starts going insane. That being said, the actor who really steals the show is R. Lee Ermey as Hartman himself, especially given that he was a Marine corps instructor prior to this film. His rapid fire insults are worthy of being cherished and he excels at being so brutally hard on all the corps that you don't want to cross his path.<br/><br/>Lastly, the cinematography, fighting scenes and scope of the whole film are beyond admirable. Kubrick was always a sucker for letting the emotions come through in the visuals, and this film is no exception just for how tragically violent the war scenes really are. Whenever private Joker is in actual combat, the stakes get ramped up to 11, and it's never easy to figure out what will happen to the corps next. The usage of lighting throughout scenes where the characters are in burnt out facilities is beautifully crafted, showcasing how hazardous yet surprisingly gorgeous fires and smoke can truly be. Also, I have to give credit to Kubrick for having this entire movie shot in England as opposed to Vietnam himself. Often that suspension of disbelief would be thrown out the window, but everything is so accurate that it becomes hard to realize that we're not actually in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>I think James Rolfe put it best when he said that this is the kind of movie you only need to see once then you'll never forget it. Overall, despite being really brutal and tragic, Full Metal Jacket trumps through its depictions of dehumanization, its exuberant craftsmanship and stellar acting. If you are yet to check this film out, definitely give it a watch, for it's right up there with the greatest anti-war films of all time. It may leave you horrified, but it will still leave a massive impact on how terrifying war can really be. We never get a war film like this ever again, and that's what makes it one hell of a shoot out."

"eric262003","9","0","1","6 November 2018"," A More Facinating Look At The Vietnam War In Terms of Training and Action
","Even though most of the cast are not really household names, there is one major star featured here, the direction from the legendary Stanley Kubrick. After being off the spotlight for several years, Kubrick sought inspiration from Coppola, Cimino and Stone and give his perspective on the deadliest wars in the 20th century. In reality, 'Full Metal Jacket"" has a more fabricated perspective of the Vietnam War to date. The scriptwriters for this movie were novelists Gustav Hasford and Michael Herr based off of Hasford's novella ""The Short Timers"" while Kubrick had to depend on archives like videos and books in preparation for his project. It may be heavily borrowed, but the take on the Vietnam War is quite original.<br/><br/>The locations to where this movie was being filmed was actually in Britain at the famous Pinewood Studios. Kubrick did everything to make his movie feel American and look American, but his creation is as Britain as fish n chips. The scene of the actual Vietnam War is situated near an abandoned gas-works area around the Thames. The training camp that's set in South Carolina is really filmed at England's Bassingbourn's military barracks. Though this film may lack in historical accuracy, the set pieces and the artistic merit is very provocative. Aside from the self-built war zone, Kubrick added layers of sounds and effects to make the scenery more effective in its storytelling. When it comes to set-building Kubrick is his own Frankenstein.<br/><br/>The story centres on Marine Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine) is sent to Parris Island where his under severe training from the no-nonsense Gunnery Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey in an Oscar-nominated performance) transforms these boys into stone cold killers. The second half takes them out of the training camp and into centre of the action where he now becomes a journalist for Stars and Stripes that prides itself on boosting morale while reporting news in relation to the war. From there Joker befriends Pvt. Rafterman (Kevyn Major-Howard) where they assign themselves to meet with the deadly military group in Vietnam, the Tet Offensive.<br/><br/>Always the punster, Joker can succeed in keeping his character in tact while the other Marines have to kiss the dirt and eat it afterwards. Joker can still deliver dark humour even in the face of danger and succeeds in doing John Wayne impersonations as well. But still his icy morals are put to the test and learns that he can't escape from his situations or discover that life's not always a joke and that danger can laugh back at you which he discovers in a final climax.<br/><br/>The film is divided into two principals acts. The first is where Joker and other recruits are under intense training from a tyrannical Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. One notable recruit is a rotund simpleton named Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) whom Hartman refers to as Gomer Pyle. Hartman takes a likeness in verbally belittling Pyle daring him to strike at him though Pyle resists. While Pyle' s struggling, Joker is assigned to tutor him so he can be more better at following protocol and becoming less of a bumbling idiot. We discover Pyle has a knack of shooting firearms with exact precision and that Pyle is not stupid, but actually psychotic. The term ""full metal jacket"" derives from the bullet casings he possesses and discusses that before he meets his ugly demise.<br/><br/>The second act takes place at the battle field where Joker is joined by camp mates Eightball, Cowboy, Lt. Touchdown and an equally unstable Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) who's willing to kill anyone who's eyes are slanted. Like Pyle he also kind of has a rotund figure and also has equal levels of insanity like Pyle. Once his insanity is in full swing, Joker must confront Animal Mother much the same as he did with Pyle.<br/><br/>Sure the story is met with simplicity and purpose, it still very dreamlike and fatal in its quality. Many of the characters are fleshed out really well while others are just set pieces put together like board game ready to strike. The finale has a cat-and-mouse feeling as the Marines give chase to a sniper set in an eternally flaming building that has the feeling lie a satanic temple. The soundtrack is rather interesting in one cheeky humour moments as the men are lacing the boots while Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots are Made for Walking"" can be heard. the constant fire crackles of burning buildings can be heard while a prolonged bass line is very effective in these scenes. Rather than depending on historical accuracy, Kubrick depends on more technical features that are effective and not overkill."

"ausitnchiu-62105","10","0","1","22 May 2017"," Full Metal Jacket has a lot to offer the audience
","Many people may not think of ""Full Metal Jacket"" and also think ""artistic"", but the film has many strong Artistic values. The film grabs the audience's attention and gains complete control of our emotion. The first half of the movie tends to focus on Private Pyle. Many of us feel sympathetic toward him as we have all felt as if we are not good enough at some point in our lives. We begin to feel sad and anxious for Pyle up until his breaking point and he takes his own life as well as the life of his commanding officer. Anything that manages to make a viewer or listener feel that sort of emotion, can definitely be considered art.<br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" is a very entertaining film, which is proved by how widely popular it is. It is definitely a classic and it is a film that most people can relate to. Almost everyone has seen the effects of war or knows the history behind it. The film manages to remind an older generation of the past, and show a younger generation a possible future. Whether you look at war as an event of the past, or inevitable in the future, it definitely makes us think about our lives.No matter where you come from. The Vietnam war itself may be outdated but ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a classic that can be watched throughout time.<br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" teaches the audience as well. Some may argue that the moral of the story is to be a good person, no matter the circumstances. While I feel that the moral of the film is the question, what does it mean to be human. Throughout the film we see numerous people committing atrocities whether it be, shooting civilians from a helicopter for fun, beating an overweight peer, or posing a man you killed next to you to laugh about him. It becomes hard to see many of the soldiers on either side as human by the end of the movie. And arguably, that is one of the large aspects of being a soldier. They need to see the enemy as no longer human in order to fulfill their duty. The film certainly gets the audience thinking about who they are, and how the would act in a time of war.<br/><br/>It is almost impossible to argue that there is not a strong internal and external conflict within the movie. The first half of the movie tends to focus on the internal struggles and eventual breaking of Private Pyle. The second half of the movie focuses on the experiences ""Joker"" has in combat. The characters are more than part of a story of combat, the story they tell is one of human nature, overcoming differences, and soldiers as a different breed of man. Although there are strong conflicts throughout the film, most of them are not resolved. The war in Vietnam was lost through lack of conviction by the government, and because of the many of the deaths and scars of the war appear to be in vain. Although the events with Private Pyle and Gunnery Sargent Hartman are over, they constantly haunt the minds of everyone else it affected.<br/><br/>In conclusion ""Full Metal Jacket"" is an absolutely fantastic film which makes the audience think about themselves, and feel sympathy towards the characters. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a classic that has much to offer and is more than just a good military movie. The film is artistic, entertaining, educational, and has strong literary value. It is an incredible film and I would highly suggest it to anybody who is not sure if it is worth their time."
"RossRivero99","10","0","1","13 May 2017"," One of Stanley Kubrick's finest films
","During his career Stanley Kubrick had repeatedly denied claims that he was a perfectionist when it came to filmmaking, but with classic movies such as ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), and ""The Shining"" (1980), it is hard for people who have seen Kubrick's films to claim otherwise, but with this movie it isn't only one of Kubrick's best films, it is also one of the best war movies ever made. This movie is also the only war movie besides ""American Sniper"" (2014) to be a character study, the main character being a Marine Corps Private nicknamed ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine) who after his first day of basic training he and his fellow recruits ""Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard), ""Gomer Pyle"" (Vincent D'Onofrio) and many others are under the command of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). The first half of the movie are the basic training scenes, while the last half are the expertly shot, and extremely realistic war scenes. Though this isn't the best movie that Stanley Kubrick ever directed, it does have the trademarks of a Kubrick movie such as the character focus shots, and everything else. The movie is just perfect, the screenplay co-written by Kubrick and, the author of the book ""The Short Timers"" of which the movie is based, the cinematography is top notch, and the performances are very good. The movie also features an excellent supporting cast including Adam Baldwin as a soldier nicknamed ""Animal Mother"", my personal favorite performance in the movie was from Ermey because he literally embodies his character because of the fact that prior to this movie he was an actual drill sergeant in real life. The movie is a very good mix of totally hilarious and really dramatic, and Ermey gives the best performance of a drill sergeant in motion picture history here. This is one of the best movies of 1987."
"crculver","8","0","1","10 April 2017"," Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam film breaks down into two very different parts, the first a vision of (brutal) order and the second the chaos of war
","Released in 1986, FULL METAL JACKET is Stanley Kubrick's film about Vietnam, adapted from a novel by the reclusive and bitter Vietnam veteran Gustav Harford, and then further expanded by acclaimed Vietnam journalist Michael Herr.<br/><br/>The film breaks down neatly into two very different parts, though both are seen through the eyes of young United States marine J. T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine). In the first act, Davis makes his way through Marine basic training with a motley group of other recruits under the hellish command of gunnery sergeant Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey). Joker watches as Hartmann bullies an overweight and dim-witted recruit cruelly nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), until Pyle explodes into murderous revenge. In the second act, now set in Vietnam where Joker is doing a tour of duty as a military journalist, the protagonist and his fellow Marines find themselves on the front line during the Tet Offensive and Joker witnesses firsthand the savagery of war.<br/><br/>Few films consist of such drastically opposed parts that differ in setting and tone and don't have any overlapping characters besides the protagonist (and one minor character from the boot camp scenes). FULL METAL JACKET has often disappointed viewers because the first half is so thrilling that it proves a hard act to follow. That's all down to R. Lee Ermey, who actually was a drill instructor during Vietnam and initially served only as a technical consultant before Kubrick decided to let him play the role and improvise. Ermey acts with a white-hot intensity, realism, and brilliantly worded insults and obscenities that no screenwriter could ever have come up with.<br/><br/>As a young man, I too felt that the film was a letdown once it moved past the witty quips and. With time, however, my appreciation for the film as a whole has only grown. The two-part structure now seems to be a strong yin-yang structure: the first act is a vision of order, while the second is all chaos. Furthermore, the second half is a moving statement of how war is often senseless. Joker and his squad, while on patrol for an enemy they cannot even identify and whose ideology or culture they know hardly anything of, begin to be targeted by a sniper. Several men perish before the sniper is found and neutralized, and all that death is pointless: it doesn't contribute in any way to victory for either side. The brutality of World War I trench warfare, where dozens of men could perish for merely a foot of conquered ground, is shown to have persisted through the American quagmire in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>That said, the film does have its flaws. One is the unrealistic depiction of the Vietnamese landscape. Kubrick had a great fear or dislike of foreign travel, and he insisted on shooting the whole film in East London. Having merely a few palm trees shipped in is a poor replacement for a real Southeast Asian shooting location with its humidity and insects, and in the scene that shows an artificially constructed Vietnamese town square Kubrick obviously the same few cars driving around in circles. It's strange how a director who was generally so perfectionist, could be so careless about locales (this only got worse with his next and last film, EYES WIDE SHUT, with its inauthentic stage set New York City). There are also some anachronisms that this director and his technical advisors should have noticed. Still, even a flawed Kubrick film is classic cinema, so I would still rate this highly."
"filipemanuelneto","4","0","3","22 February 2017"," A good movie, but too much like ""Apocalypse Now""
","This is another movie about the Vietnam War. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, its full of violence and shocking scenes, as the director likes. However, in this particular case, violence is welcome, showing us the inhumanity of war, very clear and explicit, from the brutal recruiting of the Marines to the crudeness of the battlefield. It's hard to watch this movie, but this, combined with raw and intense realism, makes the film truly unforgettable. However, this movie is too much like ""Apocalypse Now"". Coppola's film has the same message, the same environment, the same violence and event a very close soundtrack. It's impossible not to observe this similarities without consider how much this film could be more original and is not. Okay, the early scenes, in the military recruit, are a good addition to the film and a good differential, but it's not enough. It even seems that Kubrick simply wanted to do a remake of ""Apocalypse Now""..."
"Marwan-Bob","9","0","1","11 February 2017"," Easily one of the best war movies of all time, and certainly one of my favorite Kubrick films.
","Full Metal Jacket states its primary concern fairly loud: Private Joker (Matthew Modine) is grilled for wearing a peace pin on his combat uniform while having ""Born to Kill"" scrawled across his helmet. He responds that it is a comment on the duality of man, warring and peaceable. The film reflects this two-sided dilemma with a two-part story. The dialogue in both sections is a constant clash between the inflating, propagandistic, and sickly comic language of professional soldiering (aided by the immensely foul-mouthed drill sergeant Hartman, played by former Marine sergeant R. Lee Ermey) and Joker's more self- preserving enterprises, first as the tutor of the inept Pyle and then as the journalist reluctantly covering the military perspective of the war and just as reluctant. He is never truly the vicious fighter the Marines want him to be, but he is every bit as detestable as his more unthinking counterparts. Kubrick's particularly effective stroke was to purposefully ignore the politics of Vietnam and keep both sides of this generalized central conflict right in your face. Kubrick works expressly on this level of the individual and unspecialized grunt to create a film that is less a defense or criticism of war than a strike at the mythologies of war-making. In its constant and irreversible violence, Full Metal Jacket, one of Kubrick's grittiest works, is also one of his most resonant."

","This movie could be classified as two short movies with reoccurring characters, but this is not detrimental to the movie as it shows the stages that the soldiers go through from raw recruits, to new arrivals to battle hardened veterans. The first part of this movie thanks to R Lee Ermey's, whose performance was phenomenal, real life experience as a drill sergeant made it really authentic and believable as the recruits went through their basic training, the fact that Kubrick let Ermey improvise his lines is an indication of how strong his performance was. The rest of the cast didn't need to act as if they were terrified of him as the genuinely were. In the second half, the movie focuses on Matthew Modine's Private Joker's time in Vietnam who observes the dehumanising effect of the war on both himself and fellow recruits, amid the carnage and bloodshed, when he sees first hand the war for the hell it really is. Now in comparing it with Platoon, as I've said in my review of that movie, you can't really compare it with this as they depict two very different aspects of the war. That movie depicts the war in jungle, whereas this movie, especially part two portray the urban warfare of the Tet Offensive, particularly the bitter bloody street fighting in Hue, which the Americans had to deal with the enemies underhanded tactics such as snipers and booby traps, and as a result has been described by some historians as the Stalingrad of the Vietnam war. In summary this movie is an authentic depiction of what raw recruits went through in the Vietnam war, and how they had to adapt to the hellish conditions which they fought, a must own for all war movie lovers."

In our company the screw ups were labeled the ""goon platoon"" and were made to march in a separate group behind the rest of the company. They were not allowed to sleep on their bunks and had to sleep on the deck (floor) at the rear of the compartment (Navy term for barracks). The scene in which D'Onofrio's character is sitting and sucking his thumb illustrates this. The extreme cleanliness of the barracks also lends credibility, and yeah, our first wake up greeting was ""drop your cocks and grab your socks"". Perfection!

It only stroke me after the movie that there were so many duality, so many contradiction in men. The helmet and and peace metal is most apparent. Then there's how the training in the Marines turns men into ruthless killing machines and how a whole platoon of people bully on Private Pyle, while there's also how soldiers risks their own lives to save their teammates. Or there's how soldiers think they're helping the Vietnamese and wonder why they don't appreciate it, while the Marines are actually ruining the country (it wasn't the last time). And there how Private Joker would bloodily kill every enemy on the battlefield, but hesitate to shoot the girl sniper. Full Metal Jacket doesn't say we should end wars. It implies that though war is horrifying and wrong in every way, human won't stop it. That's duality. Of course, much of this could be contributed to the author of the novel that Full Metal Jacket adapted from. What Kubrick does really well in is taking the audience into the Marines and the Vietnam War. The Marine officer in the 1st part of the movie is much more horrifying than J.K. Simons in Whiplash.

","Full metal jacket is a great war movie. In the film's opening shots there are close-ups o new Marine recruits getting their heads shaved at a military training camp. The next shot follows Hartman as he strides through a barracks and completes the first stage of the young men's intimidating indoctrination into the Marine Corps. The scene also establishes the measured pace that Kubrick maintains throughout profane, and hardcore. Hartman will mold these boys into killing machines. At that point, most war films would turn to the young men, sketch out their pasts and then show their transformation into a cohesive unit.

","""The dead know only one thing: it is better to be alive."" This is just one of the milder quotes from a controversial film titled Full Metal Jacket that Stanley Kubrick adapted from a book written by Gustav Hasford by the name of Short Timers. This is a review of the movie that is second only to Apocalypse Now as the all-time greatest Vietnam War movie. This film, Full Metal Jacket has great special effects, the actors portrayed their parts perfectly, and the stage is set very realistically for the time period represented in the picture. The actors were born for the parts that they played in this movie. There are two main actors in the first part of this film that really stand out. R. Lee Ermey plays the part of the Marine Drill Instructor, Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. Vincent D' Onofrio plays the part of boot camp recruit who comes to be known as Private Pyle. Onofrio does a great job at being a screw up who finally loses all control and flips out. Other recruits are played by Matthew Modine who is Pvt. Joker; Arliss Howard plays Pvt. Cowboy, Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother and Dorian Harewood who plays Eightball. These four all do great jobs portraying boot camp trainees, and then as soldiers as the movie progresses. There are many more actors in this movie but these are the main ones that the storyline revolves around. R. Lee Ermey was a real life drill instructor with the Marine Corps for 11 years and served two tours in Vietnam before becoming involved in filmmaking. This is one reason that he played the part so realistically and did such a good job. The directors could not have picked better actors to play in a movie that would immerse the audience into the times. This film is full of great special effects that combine visual and auditory sequences that will rattle the audiences mind. One of the first special effects that stand out is when Private Pyle kills the drill instructor and then proceeds to blow his own brains out. This is a very graphic scene and not for an audience with a weak stomach. While watching this scene the observer could almost feel the impact of the rifle round as the blood, bones and brains appeared to splatter on the wall behind his head. There are many more instances of graphic bloody scenes throughout the film that all appear as very realistic and are very well done. .Special visual effects are frequently combined with auditory effects to create very realistic scenes. There is bloody street fighting, ambushes, and booby traps that surround the audience with sensory perceptions and immerse them in the scene on the screen. The sound of music fades into the sound of helicopter rotors beating the air. This then fades into automatic gunfire. These are the familiar sounds of Vietnam. This is what a soldier remembers; the sights and sounds of a hostile land far from home in 1968.This all adds to the ambiance and pulls the audience into the experience of the film. The time period was the mid to late 60''s. There was rebellion in many forms. The United States was in a war that many thought had no purpose. Stanley Kubrick brings this time period alive in this film. Parris Island Marine training boot camp is very well duplicated in this film even though they were shot at an army base in England. The year is around 1967. The drill instructors were really like this during this era. The music in the picture captures the time period beautifully. Though this picture was filmed entirely in England, the audience could not tell that it wasn't America, and Vietnam, both were captured beautifully. The Beckton Gas Works which was abandoned and condemned became the war torn city of Hue. Kubrick spent months recreating the war torn city by destroying the gas works, blowing up buildings and using a wrecking ball on others using pictures of Hue from 1968 as a guide. By doing this, it appeared to the audience that the scenes of war and destruction were very real. To make England look more like tropical Vietnam, Kubrick had 200 palm trees flown in from Spain and 100,000 plastic jungle plants were added from Hong Kong. The extra trouble made the audience feel as though they were in the jungles of Vietnam. This is how England in 1987 was transformed into Vietnam in 1968. Special effects played a large part in making this film so interesting. This was a very powerful movie that left viewers with the feeling that they were there, in Vietnam, in 1968. After watching this film the viewer can begin to understand what Pvt. Joker meant when he spoke of the dead and their feelings about life. Stanley Kubrick sort of creates his own Vietnam Conflict in this film, as it would naturally contain his point of view of the times. Some may find it twisted and exaggerated, but it is a movie well worth watching."

"bscrivener-50810","9","0","1","5 April 2016"," Hilarious, visually stunning and brutal- Fantastically capturing the feel of war.
","Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 Vietnam war film, directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Matthew Modine, Adam Baldwin, Vincent D'Onofrio and R.Lee Ermey. What instantly stands out from an initial viewing is the fantastic mix of dark and black comedy with the much more poignant tone and effects of war, mainly the toll it takes on the soldiers both psychologically and physically. Kubrick stunningly captures the look, feel and atmosphere of Vietnam as well as an accurate representation of the mindset of those involved, with a colourful cast of quirky, naive and near- psychotic characters each one showing their moulding for war and the devastating damage it has on them. Accompanied with light-hearted and at times horror-esque soundtrack, Full Metal Jacket shows the contrasts not just in it's story and visuals but with its impressive scores. Despite it's praises, there are some notable flaws with the film these being in the films pacing. At times (generally through its middle act) little is done to advance the plot, with random interviews that feel a little out of place and slightly exposition heavy. However, the film's beginning and end are the definitive moments of not just presenting a story but showing a progressive journey of one soldiers descent into near insanity. The action is grand, the comedy is hilarious and the war is brutal. Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest war films ever made. 9/10"

","Full Metal Jacket (1984) Rating 9.5/10<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick may not be my favorite director because most of his movies I don't always like, but I defiantly loved this. I got bored yesterday and watched this on Netflix. Full Metal Jacket is a about how much Vietnam can make a man crazy and how screwed up war is. It opens up with the drill instructor at the camp which is by far one the best improvised scenes in movie history. Private Pyle doesn't know much and has a hard time there. We also meet Joker, the main character, and Cowboy. Pyle has had lots of things happen to him but after a soap beating he goes crazy. After the last day, they go to Nam and get a drama/comedy which I love so much about this movie. It's not supposed to be a comedy, but more of a war film. We get to meet many characters as in Nam a lot of action scenes come up with strong characters. I thought most of the scenes were funny at least to me. People call this movie a dark comedy that many people don't notice. The Mickey Mouse ending was perfect. ðŸ˜‚<br/><br/>The performances are great, Jokers and Pyle are great as the person who played Kingpin in ""Daredevil"" played him in this movie. I thought the directing and cinematography was amazing. Overall: This a much watch movie. If you like sprinkled comedy/war/drama movies you will love this one. It does get a bit uneven as it takes a brave turn from a 50 minute camp part to Vietnam, but Stanley Kubrick executes it perfectly. Joker, Cowboy and Animal Mother as well as the others play likable characters. If you have seen and know Stanley Kubrick's style of movies, this will be a great movie for you."

","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is part of a long string of classic films, such as Platoon and The Shining, that has made him a household name. A hardcore and satirical look into the experience of a group of military volunteers during the Vietnam War, Full Metal Jacket, takes the psychological aspects of war to another level. The bluntly realistic and bigoted profanity alone in this film is enough to make today's politically correct movie goer cringe at every turn. However, in the midst of all the cringing, the comedic relief seems to be sprinkled in just at the right times and, of course, great warfare scenes. The beginning of the film is set during marines boot camp which takes the viewer into a very different world from the rest of the film. It is where boys become men and pacifists become born killers. This is proved throughout the film by the dynamic characters of an overweight misfit nicknamed Pvt. Pyle (Vince D'Onofrio) and a tall skinny smart*** nicknamed Pvt. Joker who we first meet at boot camp. Here we also meet drill Sgt. Hartman (Lee Ermey), whose soul purpose is to transform these volunteers into marines, born killers. It is Sgt. Hartman's ""disciplinary"" interactions with an overweight misfit, nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vince D'Onofrio), that makes this part of the movie easily the best. It is amusing and terrifying all at the same time to watch Pvt. Pyle mess up, however, you could visually see the worsening of Pvt. Pyle's mental health which leads his and Sgt. Hartman's eventual doom. The rest of the film follows Pvt. Joker who struggles with self identity wearing a helmet that reads ""Born Killer"" but also wearing a peace button. He was sent out to be a photographer and story editor for a popular wartime newspaper The Stars and Stripes, but found that he wanted to be closer to ""the sh*t"". There he learns what real Vietnam is, battling through the the city streets during the Tet Offensive of 1968. The most noticeable thing about this film is how the film seems to have fragmented events, rather than having a single plot. Many scenes are obviously important to the overall plot while others seem out of place and unneeded. The only part of the film that really takes shape is boot camp which seems foreign compared to the rest of the film. The plot really builds up during boot camp just to let you down and change course in the rest of the film. I found that the fragmented plot of the second half of the film left me confused and not knowing how certain scenes fit into the entirety of the film. However that is not to say the second half of the movie was bad because it is not. These sporadic scenes were some of the most entertaining of the film. The acting was as unbalanced as the plot, as Lee Ermey and Vince D'Onofrio gave easily the best performances of the film during boot camp. Lee Ermey showcased his acting skills though great commentary, emotion and experience of being a real life Drill instructor. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman, is no act. His mouth is a machine gun of insults and his stare is lethal. Vince D'Onofrio's Pvt. Pyle, on the other hand, is a ticking time bomb that the audience is forced to watch. With little commentary his performance is masterful, relying on pure emotion. Stanley Kubrick once again dazzled with his skillful and iconic use of music. I found myself on several occasions going through mood swings just with a sudden change of music. One example I found exceptional was during a shootout with the Vietcong in an urban Vietnamese city. The music during the shooting was somber drumming, but as soon as the shooting ceased the music quickly changed to the upbeat and fun Surfin' Bird by The Trashmen. Full Metal Jacket is quite simply Stanley Kubrick's best satirical film since his beloved Dr. Strangelove and just adds another notch to his star studded belt of great films. The film is a classic and a must see to any and all movie lovers."
"Mr-Fusion","6","0","1","14 February 2016"," Not Kubrick's best, but still interesting
","""Full Metal Jacket"" isn't one of those movies I can watch with any sort of regularity. I'm pretty sure it's been 15 years' time since last I watched this, and it'll be another 15 before the next time. It's the kind of movie you see just to say you've done it; to finally get the pop culture references.<br/><br/>In any case, the movie is never more compelling than in its first hour. Lee Ermey's larger-than-life drill sergeant varies from amusing to funny to scary. The writing is on the all with Vincent D'Onofrio's character from the beginning, and the conclusion to his vignette is undeniably haunting. But then the gears switch into a wayward war movie, moving from one firefight to the next, nowhere near as interesting as it was in the barracks.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what you've got here is a great first half and a dull second, and the movie so clearly belongs to Ermey. But then again, a lot of this movie felt contrived in the service of that abusive drill sergeant. Pyle - drafted or not - should never have been there in the first place. That kid would never hold up to basic training, and the end result was foregone from the outset. He was basically there for Ermey to light into, and that makes the full metal jacket scene ring pretty hollow.<br/><br/>6/10"

"Screen_Blitz","8","0","1","11 January 2016"," Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam War epic is both gritty and spectacular
","From the early 60s to the late 90s before his death, Stanley Kubrick introduced audiences everywhere with some of the biggest masterpieces in the history of cinema. Touching on various subjects ranging including war, politics, crime, science-fiction, horror, and many others; this highly spoken director is found by many to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever step in foot in Hollywood, there is no doubt why. One of his biggest films I will forget was this Vietnam War epic based on the novel by Gustav Hasford. This gritty adaption tells a dual segmented story of a U.S Marine platoon during their grueling days of boot camp training. The platoon is ran under command by the ill-tempered, loud-mouthed Drill Sergeant Hartman (played by R. Lee Ermey) who pushes the fellow marines to the very limits, and does not hesitate butcher with loud profanity during training sessions. Matthew Iodine plays Private J.T Davis, nicknamed ""The Joker"", who stands as a bright example to his fellow marines. Then there is Vincent D'Onofrio who plays Private Leonard Lawrence, under the name ""Gomer Pyle"", an overweight marine who never seems to stay in line with everyone else, and results in constant scolding from Sergeant Hartman. The story then cuts to months later, with Private Davis on the battlefield during the 1968 Tet Offensive operation in Vietnam. There, him and his group of marine recruits face the harrowing realities of war.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick gives a powerful and realistic taste on the Vietnam War in this film, and his direction works magnificently. From the opening scene, the film presents sharp look at the characters during their boot camp training, and the dilemmas that go on during training. These scenes are handled very strongly and do nothing to sugarcoat, nor exaggerate the realities marines face while training before entering the war zone. R. Lee Ermey is the biggest prize during these scenes, sporting a powerful performance with his loud temper and mean- spirited reviling. Ermey doesn't just play the role, but just swallows it up with diligence, and his effort pays off well. Matthew Iodine plays the role of Private Davis very naturally, and shows great chemistry with just about every character on screen, especially when the story moves into the combat territory during the second half. When we get into the Vietnam portion of the film, the tone shifts into the darker atmosphere, with graphic and authentic scenes of combat set during the Tet Offensive , and how the rawness of war affects the characters. These scenes are shot so well thanks to solid cinematography by Douglas Milsome, and treat us with a gritty depiction of what the Vietnam War was like.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket stands as one of Stanley Kubrick's best pictures, and is great addition to the war genre. This is film is spectacular and something highly recommend to everyone. It may not stand at the top list of other Vietnam War flicks like 'Apocalypse Now' or 'Platoon', but it definitely deserves your attention."
"mail-898-219730","9","0","1","29 December 2015"," Avant-garde film comment on young men going to war
","Cult director Kubrick constructed an on point statement on adolescent men that have to find their place in a social system called war and its preparation. In the first half of the movie Kubrick deconstructs a recruitment camp and their inhabitants brilliantly by focusing on revealing the personality of the drill instructor and his men. We see how the young men react to the manipulations of their personality and how they give up their individuality to become the perfect soldier. The film shows this in reduced and clear photography. The rhythm is slow but intense through the sensible tension between the struggling boys and the drill instructor. The dialogue lines of Sergeant Hartman and the marines became widely quoted pop culture, mainly because of their sharpness and irony: the viewer is irritated if this is comic, cynical or sad. In the second half we see what war is like. The director shows a world where death of the enemy is a permanent decoration and the fraternization of field soldiers became the last moral compass. The protagonists meander in a hopeless room (the fragments of an urban battle ground) accompanied by the sound of the lonely squeaking of steel hinges. The marines found their role: they got rid of fear and became killing machines."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","17 November 2015"," Half a masterpiece and half a merely good movie
","Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" is generally considered one of the best Vietnam war movies ever and, for that matter, one of the best war movies in general. Told in two distinct but related parts, the movie begins in basic training before picking up again in the midst of the conflict in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Although there are memorable moments sprinkled throughout the film, only the first half seems to show Kubrick operating at the absolute peak of his powers. The second half is still worthwhile but it comes across as a letdown after the bravura first half. As I see it, the story becomes looser and slightly unfocused as a result. Also, I don't find Pvt. Joker to be a very compelling protagonist.<br/><br/>In terms of the acting, the two key performances come from R. Lee Ermey & Vincent D'Onofrio. Ermey was nominated for a Golden Globe for his indelible portrayal of the foul-mouthed drill instructor while D'Onofrio effectively embodied the dehumanization of military training. Matthew Modine was the only consistent presence throughout the film but I didn't find his performance or his character to be particularly noteworthy. The rest of the cast is likewise competent but unexceptional.<br/><br/>When it comes to Kubrick's direction, it's as well executed as ever. The visuals are consistently attractive and interesting. Credit should also go to production designer Anton Furst, who successfully recreated Vietnamese locales in England. The film's music is also worthy of praise. Vivian Kubrick's moody score is supported by intriguing period-specific soundtrack selections like ""Surfin' Bird"" & ""Chapel of Love"".<br/><br/>In the end, even though ""Full Metal Jacket"" fails to completely coalesce, it's still a thought-provoking and memorable look at warfare and those who take part in it. It may be notch below the lofty heights of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" & ""A Clockwork Orange"" but it nevertheless qualifies as essential viewing for movie buffs."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","7 November 2015"," A Harrowing Journey Of Man From A Human To A Killing Machine!
","Having earlier shown the futility & irony of warfare in Paths of Glory, Stanley Kubrick returns to the genre of war once again to observe the tactics used by military to transform its newly recruited marine corps into killing war machines and captures the dehumanizing effects the Vietnam War had on soldiers through the eyes of Pvt. Joker, who is also the narrator of the film. What does it take to transform a normal human being into a remorseless assassin? Full Metal Jacket is Kubrick's attempt to answer that question.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is a two segments story. The first one concerns a new batch of US Marine Corps recruits who arrive at Parris Island for training under the command of Sgt. Hartman, their strict, disciplined & foul-mouthed senior drill inspector. Hartman employs a rigorous training regimen to turn his recruits into marines ready for combat and is severely harsh on a dim-witted & overweight recruit whom he nicknames Pvt. Pyle. The second part follows Joker, one of the recruits, and covers his harrowing experience in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, Full Metal Jacket is definitely amongst the finest depictions of dehumanization on film canvas and works perfectly on many levels. Kubrick's direction is absolutely flawless in the first half but it stumbles slightly in the next half only to rise again during its nail-biting climax to finish on a high note. Cinematography has always been influential in Kubrick's films & this one is no exception. And with all things considered, it easily qualifies as one of the most technically sound examples of its genre.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Full Metal Jacket features many unforgettable characters and Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio & R. Lee Ermey do terrific job in their given roles which elevates the film to a much better status than it would've been otherwise. Modine plays Pvt. Joker, who joined the US Marine Corps to see combat and the film is, on a superficial level, his story only. D'Onofrio devotes himself completely to his character of Pvt. Pyle and does a remarkable job in illustrating the transition of his character from a naive & clumsy recruit to a pure psychopath.<br/><br/>But the real highlight amongst the entire cast is Lee Ermey as drill inspector Sgt. Hartman and thanks to his powerful, intense & show-stealing rendition, his performance easily ranks amongst the most dominating, memorable & extraordinary portrayals in cinema history. He is extremely punishing, mean, sarcastic & clever but when one considers his job of turning random men into heartless killers so that they can survive the horrors of war, the character of Hartman becomes fully justified. And out of all the amazing characters in Kubrick's films, Sgt. Hartman is undoubtedly my favourite.<br/><br/>The entire film, on a closer look, is a study of duality. The two segments this film is divided into are completely different in their plot & treatment. The characters, during their arrival in Vietnam, are neither entirely compassionate humans nor cold-hearted assassins and seem to be battling moral dilemmas. Pvt. Joker wears a peace symbol on his jacket while ""Born to Kill"" is written on his helmet. And there are many more references of duality such as that. Pointlessness of war, military brainwashing & dehumanization are other themes it deals with and all of these are addressed in an expert manner.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, there are very few war films out there which so meticulously depict the gruesome effects war has on human psyche and Full Metal Jacket is unquestionably one of them. The first half of this film clearly outshines the second half in almost every filmmaking department because of which it may disappoint some viewers. But it has all the trademarks of a Kubrick masterpiece and remains one of his most entertaining works. In Joker's words, it tells how important a human life is & how lucky it is to be alive and, on the whole, it's one of Stanley Kubrick's most tightly crafted films that is aesthetic, artistic & influential in every possible manner."

The first part of the film is not about Sergeant, who's funny mother. The first part - the story of a man, who has not passed this test. In the second part of the picture director It shows those who passed through the process of transformation of man in combat unit and what came of it. It turns out that you can not be present killer without killing anyone.

","There isn't a lot about Full Metal Jacket that hasn't been said, but I can absolutely recommend any movie lover to watch this movie. It's excellent.<br/><br/>I just want to talk about the separate parts of the movies. Usually what people say is that the movie consists of two ""halves"" and people say they enjoy the first half more. Well I have to say I don't entirely agree. I think the movie in fact consists of 3 ""parts"": the training, the everyday life in Vietnam and last: the actual fighting. The latter two usually get grouped together. In fact the three parts are all divided by a scene with the soldiers buying the services of a prostitute. It's what the second part starts and ends with.<br/><br/>Every part of the movie is excellent. The first part is the most entertaining by itself, but the second part is the best at setting atmosphere. Finally the last part feels like an ""ultimate boss fight"" of sorts.<br/><br/>All three parts of the movie have an anti-war message in their own way. The first part obviously is about the harshness of the training, not just the way Sgt Hartman tortures Gomer Pyle, but the whole group of soldiers. Even his best friend, Joker, gets pressured into hurting Pyle. Second part mostly sets up for the third part, but provides a good way of showing how desensitized the soldiers have become to death. Finally, the third part. It's a crucial battle with all soldiers fighting vs one sniper. Without seeing the sniper, it becomes a very scary enemy and assumed to be a man, of course. It turns out it's a young woman, eventually being shot in the face by one of the soldiers. That makes an impact. The Mickey Mouse song at the end is chilling.<br/><br/>2 Thumbs Up"

","Thirty years after Stanley Kubrick did Paths Of Glory about the futility of World War I Kubrick did Full Metal Jacket about the American experience in Vietnam. The wars were incredibly different and the French were fighting on their own soil, still the frustration of war and the stupidity of the high command make these films markedly similar.<br/><br/>Another Vietnam classic came out around the same time Casualties Of War and that dealt with the army. A very different experience to be sure because the army contained draftees and folks in the National Guard and Army Reserve who LBJ did not call up for Vietnam. Hence it was a haven for those of us not quite ready to give up our young lives. It was sure different from the training these guys were getting on Parris Island. In fact many was a night I comforted myself with the thought about what the marines were like.<br/><br/>Matthew Modine plays the lead here, a fellow who goes through the training and then is assigned as a journalist to Stars And Stripes. He is the voice of screenwriter and novelist Guy Hasford whose book Full Metal Jacket is based.<br/><br/>Today we are in open ended war in the Middle East started to be sure by an attack on our native soil. But we got sidetracked by some old fashioned imperialist objectives in Iraq and now we've got ISIS to contend with. What should our response be? Certainly it has to be a multi-faceted one, it can't all be about dropping bombs on people different from us. It's like we learned nothing from Casualties Of War or Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>I think if the film has a weakness it's that the training portion of Full Metal Jacket is better than the combat one. That is because of the performances of R. Lee Ermey as the redneck gunnery sergeant and Vincent D'Onofrio as the poor fat slob of a recruit.<br/><br/>I cannot emphasize too much that D'Onofrio, Modine, and the rest are all volunteers. That being said I'm at a loss to explain why wasn't D'Onofrio just not washed out. Ermey if he was doing his job properly would have. But he was having too much sadistic fun.<br/><br/>That being said when D'Onofrio prepared for the part no doubt he created a back story as to how his character came to Parris Island. I would love to ask D'Onofrio how that came to be.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is an enduring war classic and will be shown right along with Paths Of Glory as long as we have means to entertain and educate ourselves."

","Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director of all time. I have yet to see some of his films but every single movie of his that I have seen is an original, twisted masterpiece. Full Metal Jacket is no exception.<br/><br/>The movie is separated into two large acts and people like to say the first act is superior to the second one, but I strongly disagree. I think they are equally good and better yet, they have to do with each other but really you could watch any of them and not watch the other and still get it and have a blast. The first act follows Marine Corps recruits at boot camp. The performances are great and R. Lee Ermey gives an iconic performance in the movie that will live on forever. The second act has a very different feel to it, but that doesn't make the movie uneven because it's basically the same subject: the horrors of war. This act follows a graduate from boot camp in the war in Vietnam and the horrors he faces along the way.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to think of any flaws in Full Metal Jacket, so I'll leave it at this: The movie is phenomenal, it is one of the greatest depictions of the Vietnam war and, although the two acts of the film are different, they do not make the movie uneven. On the contrary, they create a masterpiece. Another A+ Kubrick Film."
"messinaitaly","9","0","1","21 June 2015"," A dark, realistic, and gripping tale of war
","This film is very dark, but it's dark mood is what sucked me in to this gripping story of the Vietnam War. Although I enjoyed it, I found the film to be very disturbing and creepy, more specifically, the 2nd half of the movie. One thing in particular is the scene near the end of the film where the US soldiers shoot the Vietnamese sniper, and the sniper, who is suffering in pain, tells the soldiers to shoot her. This among many other things makes this movie dark and disturbing, and there were probably worse things that happened in Vietnam during the war. <br/><br/>Even though ""Full Metal Jacket"" is dark, it shows people the horror's of war, just like the films ""Platoon"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" have done. But not all of this movie is graphic war. The 1st half of this movie is a look into the hard training of US soldiers on Parris Island, which is a lot less graphic than war. R. Lee Ermey's performance as Drill Sergeant Hartman is amazing, realistic, and Oscar worthy as it makes the 1st half of the movie a lot more interesting.<br/><br/>However, the first half is still disturbing as it shows the tough boot camp that soldiers had to deal with on Parris Island. The treatment of Private Pyle is one sad thing in this movie. Private Pyle is an example of a person broken in training as he was emotionally abused by Hartman for his mistakes and was beaten by his fellow cadets due to his mistakes causing the others to suffer. Pyle would eventually go crazy and kill Hartman and then himself,<br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" is an amazing film that benefits from it dark and realistic tone of war, it's amazing performances, Kubrick's directing, and it's camera angles that make it look like I'm playing a first person shooter or I'm on the battlefield."

","I remember when I saw Full Metal Jacket for the first time. I must've been about fourteen or fifteen years old and decided to watch it when it was on late at night of a weekend. I remember being compelled by the first 40 minutes (although finding it slightly repetitive) and finding the rest of it completely boring and aimless. Fast forward five years later to present day and you'll find me currently going through the whole of Stanley Kubrick's filmography and sticking on Full Metal Jacket for a second time. Have my opinions changed? Yes they have.<br/><br/>I no longer find the first 40 minutes repetitive. In fact, I think the first 40 minutes of Full Metal Jacket is one of the best things Stanley has ever created. The first 40 minutes are so strong that the rest of the film is unfortunately left in its shadow, but more on that in a bit. This half perfectly illustrates the conversion of human beings into cold, emotionless killers. Right from the off the recruits are stripped of their names and instead given labels. They're all made to have the same hairstyle (or lack of), same clothes and shout only when shouted to. All of them even act like robots when training in unison. All except Private Pyle.<br/><br/>The story of Private Pyle's descent into madness is one of the most memorable put on film. At first we find his physical and mental inabilities amusing with the electrifying Lee Ermey shouting hilarious insults at him and Pyle failing miserably at obstacle courses. However, as it progresses the constant bullying becomes incredibly disturbing. There's a fantastically dark moment where all the private's team together to beat Pyle late at night with some soap. In the end you can't help but feel sympathy for him.<br/><br/>It all accumulates to the most powerful moment in the film where Pyle goes totally insane in the toilet. Everything in this scene is flawless. The brooding music, Vincent D'Onofrio's haunting performance, the lighting, and the directing. All of this makes for an incredibly atmospheric and frightening scene with a chilling pay-off which is both surprising and unforgettable. The trouble is, how can you follow this scene? The answer is, you can't. So far the centre of the film has been the relationship between Vincent D'Onofrio and R Lee Ermey, thus with these characters gone a new film begins.<br/><br/>We're plunged without warning into Vietnam, however unlike my fifteen year-old self, I actually didn't find these parts boring. I just get frustrated because I'm not entirely sure what Stanley is trying to say. We sort of get little snapshots of life in Vietnam with Private Joker bobbing about and meeting folk. The film doesn't really go anywhere, yet it still remains largely interesting, just nowhere near as interesting as the mesmerising first half. I did like the prostitute encounters though and thought they had a lot of interesting things to say about humanity.<br/><br/>The film suddenly gets really good again when the team encounter a sniper. For Stanley Kubrick, it's actually a fairly conventional war scene, albeit brilliantly done. It's full of tension, remains gripping and feels very real. It's incredible to think that the whole Vietnam sequences were filmed in London! Stanley then turns to his unusual self when the group encounter who the sniper is. It's a very uncomfortable and haunting moment which results in the famous Mickey Mouse chant at the very end.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure what Full Metal Jacket is trying to say, but I'm sure that Stanley has popped in a load of horrendously clever hidden metaphors which still haven't fully been worked out yet. The whole film is of course a visual feast with superb directing from Stanley. However, content-wise I don't think it's as strong as his previous Paths of Glory. Full Metal Jacket may be much better in the technical department, but it feels uneven. Joker is nowhere near as interesting as Pyle and so the film begins to sag in comparison. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film farm more than when I first layed eyes upon it and will certainly be giving it some more watches!"

","In Parris Island, South Carolina, a group of raw recruits are brought in to be trained by the hard-nosed Marine Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.

Then the Tet offensive happens and Joker goes out to report. He's reunited with Cowboy (Arliss Howard) who is leading a rifle squad.<br/><br/>The first half is anchored by the great performances of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. They are incredible. The second half is the war. Matthew Modine leads competently but it is the mesmerizing directions from Stanley Kubrick. It is always The Trashmen's Surfin' Bird that comes to mind first. It's impossible to lose interest during the second half. Some people may want it to be more obviously anti-war. It is not quite so blatant. It is murky just like what I imagine the Vietnam experience actually was. The long uncut scenes impart an immersive feel. It is one of the most compelling extended war sequence."

But in the ending of part I, which is the last day of the training, he killed Hartman and himself. He want to be a normal person. I think part II is a trash.

They are trash. <br/><br/>Sorry Stanley Kubrick, but this film is failed. A Clockwork Orange is your best. I am very disappointed.

"tropicasia1992","6","0","2","2 May 2015"," A ""masterpiece""
","I rarely write movie reviews. And when I do, there must be a serious reason. Overall ratings which don't correspond to the reality, annoying movies that shouldn't someone even think to watch or unrepeatable masterpieces (rarely). This time I wondered how did this film managed to get an 8.3 and climb at IMDb's top 100! Many movies got criticized for much less. I understand that Vietnam War is a delicate subject for U.S.A. and scarred thousands of Americans over the years so the symbolisms of the movie and the emotional part are justified. But these are not enough to lift this movie to the best of the best of all times. The first half an hour is spent with a bad ass sergeant screaming and insulting the new recruits with a variety of silly swears and jokes. OK, anyone who has served even for a while knows that there are many crazy officers who would make your life even harder than it is already and I understand the need of the director to intone that but after 10'-15' the screams and swears just get embarrassing. We also have a fat ""wanna-be"" marine who can't even pass the basics to become a marine but after getting bullied a night by his companions he becomes a committed soldier but also starts becoming quite cracked to kill his superior sergeant and commit suicide in the end. In every country and every army of the world serving tests your personal limits and your state of mind, it's not a marine training originality nor a prerequisite to experience the Vietnam conflict. And of course anyone with few knowledge about the army could direct the first half. A bunch of recruits, a screaming officer, some training scenes and here you are. Where is the character development? Where are the relations developed between fellow new recruits, which are so important? Where is the tough training which is gonna crack you? Where's solidarity and mutual help? We barely see a couple of scenes showing this stuff in half an hour! And then we get to the second half. The story follows a marine who serves as a military journalist in Vietnam. And when he gets there, in of the most cruel war-fields of all times, which caused the mental instability of dozens of soldiers, where death was an every hour phenomenon in the first line, he joins a squad of happy soldiers, who make jokes all the time, have fun with whores and only their appearance implies their hardships. Even the losses of their squad are taken too easily by the fellow members. War looks like a game to everyone. And finally, what do we learn about the opponent? Instead of developing enough the opponent side, we learn that Vietnamese civilians steal from Americans, their women serve as whores and they don't like American help. What we learn about Vietcongs? They are communists, they kill civilians and hate Americans. I believe that if this movie hadn't the name of Kubrick behind it there would be at least 2 points down of its current rating. 2 for the music, 2 for the meaning and symbolisms, 2 for the general effort. I do not wish to insult anyone. This is just a critic of mine, expressing my personal opinion. Take care, Christos."
"lucheveraldi-257-400966","7","0","1","7 March 2015"," Nice first part but the second one is disappointing
","Full Metal Jacket is divided in two parts, one takes place in South Carolina, the other one in Vietnam. It shows war machines instead of soldiers. The training in South Carolina is managed by a sadistic boss who takes away the innocence and all hopes of the young boys. Kubrick made a satire not only of war, but of all America, through patriotic songs, yells instead of discussions, and constant humiliations. The aim is to make understand people that soldiers learned their lesson : as the famous helmet says, they are now born to kill. Despite the length of a few scenes, I think it was important to point out the psychological evolution of characters, which make the first part a good part of the movie. <br/><br/>As for the second part Vietnam; it is much more boring and useless. It is basically a succession of very similar scenes. I think the director wanted to focus on too many elements which are propaganda, soldiers, living conditions etc, it was too ambitious for a two-hours movie. The other issue is that sometimes, Kubrick only focused on music and images without anything else in the script."
"neranewaska","8","0","1","4 March 2015"," Kubrick's unique genius on War
","What happens to an ordinary-looking man, in the start of the 1970's, when he is put through a soldier factory ? He is forced to endure a psychological process that Full Metal Jacket brilliantly sets in its first half. The film opens on an island where the Platoon 3042 constituted of young soldiers-to-be, is confronted to a rough training, conducted by a merciless instructor. There, in this isolated training camp, begins a process during which they are deprived of identity, pride and almost come to lose their awareness of an outside-world. In the second part of the film, the training is over and they are released into the savage context of the Vietnam War to be faced with death.<br/><br/>Many a film was made before this one and has been since, following the same trail, dealing with harsh trainings and the progressive dehumanisation of soldiers. However, it has not prevented director Stanley Kubrick from stepping out of the mass with a brilliantly constructed plot and organized movie. The soldiers are introduced to a mechanical system through which they are constantly repeating their actions, reminded of their littleness, perfectly aligned, shouting their robotic answers to the chief's questions with the same voice. When joining the platoon, they lose the individuality of their appearances, they lose their names to take on comical nicknames such as Joker, Cowboy or Gomer Pyle, they lose their sense of shame... Difference is scorned while servitude is promised immortality.<br/><br/>Somehow, while witnessing the soldier's transformation, we are left wandering who these men's real enemy is if not war itself. The frontier between the soldier and the criminal grows thinner to the point when themselves lose track of which they are. Leaving the training, they may be returning to a more 'common' fight, it will have nonetheless affected each one of them permanently. In a way, the second part of the movie is rendered obsolete by the virtuosity of the first and the image it gives of the warrior resembles the one we already had : a sense of brotherhood, a little bragging, a need for heroism, but also fear, on entering the battlefield.<br/><br/>War itself has been depicted in many ways before today. For his part, Kubrick has chosen a 4:3 frame as is his habit, to tighten our vision and therefore match the soldiers'. The use of straight lines and symmetry enhances the unity of the military world. There is also a subtle balance between dark humor and brutality made possible by the mastering of the dialogs. In addition, Kubrick's knowledge of philosophy and psychology adds to the movie when, for instance, he evokes the duality of men or has the soldiers unconsciously associate the act of killing with the feeling of love and care.<br/><br/>I would totally recommend this movie while warning the viewer that it is quite violent (though justifiably). Without wanting to spoil anything, I would invite him to pay attention to the references that are made and the relations between some parts of the movie and other... such as the sound of water-drops falling or of a laughter echoing."

","In 1967, during the Vietnam war, a marines' group composed of young men who have just enrolled, arrives in a training camp called Parris Island. So start several weeks of humiliation, of physical and mental punishments in order to harden and prepare them to fight. One of them, originally named Leonard Lawrence until the Instructor Hartman nicknames him Gomer Pyle because of his fatness, becomes the instructor's victim and then the whole group's. Thus this film makes us discover soldiers' life in training camps, the way American army forms and transforms men so that, on the battlefield, they behave just as machines which will not hesitate to shoot a man if they have to. <br/><br/>What stroke me the most when I watched this movie for the first time was the way the film director puts the spectators into training camps's atmosphere. A shot especially called my attention, at the beginning of the film ... But I have to fall silent for I must not spoil the plot for you.<br/><br/>In a word, a film which makes you feel a huge amount of different emotions, rough ones of course, but not only."
"maloumercier","9","0","1","1 March 2015"," A good movie for a war film
","Full Metal Jacket is a movie, directed by Stanley Kubrick which is, according to me, quite complete. Indeed, we can divide it in two parts : the preparation and the action. In 1967, a group of men is prepared by officer Hartman to be sent in Vietnam. Among those men : Gomer Pyle and Joker. Hartman is the stereotype of the army officer : he doesn't talk but screams and reminds all the time the future soldiers that they are nothing more than the ground zero, they are not even human. It's actually well-known that killing people at war makes you so much more human  The viewer discovers the eight weeks of preparation, the special relation the soldiers have with their gun (called with girl names). Plus showing the difficulty of the trainings, the movie also shows the humiliation : Gomer Pyle, who seems to be stupid is actually psychologically unstable and he is during the preparation pushed too much : he has at the end of the first part a mental breakdown. In the second part the soldiers are shown in Vietnam and what I liked in this part is the portrayal made of the soldiers. The first part is quite light since it is fun and there is irony. The second part is a shock and reminds the viewer that it is a war film. Different soldiers speak and they have different point of view : some of them are the stereotype of the good soldier –like a Rambo- , some think that Vietnam doesn't actually want that war, that they are supposed to fight with the south of Vietnam but those are hidden, they have the feeling they are not killing the good people  The main idea is that they don't really understand why they are here, they feel like Vietnamese don't want them in Vietnam, like if they were trapped in this war. Those soldiers are sent to Vietnam whereas their country is blaming them, the Vietnam is blaming there too : they feel lonely. At the end of the movie, at the end of the war, the soldier's conclusion is that they are alive, in a terrible world, but alive. My conclusion about that film is that Stanley Kubrick made a really good job, in not directing a stereotypical film war, which is one of the most difficult things to do."
"Evemg","8","0","1","1 March 2015"," An Anti-War movie
","This film, actually adapted from the novel The Short Timer, in 1987 by Stanley Kubrick, is split in two big parts. In the first one, new recruits arrive to Parris Island for a basic training. The first scene set the atmosphere of the film; young men's head are shaved, their eyes seem totally empty and one of them even looks retarded. The narrator is one of the recruits, the whole film is set especially around his war experience. The recruits are trained to become war machines. The simplistic one is bullied by the instructor and even if he is helped by the narrator he becomes totally crazy at the end of the first part. From this first step of the movie, we can see that's it's an anti- war movie, the recruits seem to have been brainwashed in order to be programmed to kill. The send part of the film is set in Vietnam. The narrator is now a reporter at the ""Star & Stripes"" journal and because he is one of the less exposed soldiers he asks to be send to Phu Bai, where most of the combats takes place. During this experience, he discovers the different types of soldiers, the ones who shoot on everything and the others, including the narrator, who seem to be self-minded.Yet, at the end everyone ends to kill someone. The war doesn't spar anyone. Even the army let their soldiers down, indeed they don't send tanks although soldiers are about to be killed. It shows how the war wasn't well organized, and we actually understand why it was rejected by parts of the US society. I found the first part of the film quite interesting. Yet it was also disturbing to watch the evolution of a nice boy into a soul- less killing machine.S.K. probably wanted to show the result of war on the soldiers who are still young boys who don't realize what happens to them. Indeed the movie ends on a image of the soldiers coming back to the camp and singing the mickey mouse song."

","The first act is about a group of people training to be in the marine corps. Their drill instructor Lt. Lockhart, is really hard on them and his insults are actually quite funny. The first act was centered around Pvt. Joker and his experiences. As the scene continues on, one of the volunteers named Pvt. Pyle, is shown to be overweight and is often picked on by Lt. Lockhart. You can't help but to feel sorry for Pvt. Pyle and throughout the first act, you're hoping that he'll be able to turn himself around so he can pass. The ending of the scene was highly tragic but fitting. The second act showed that Pvt. Joker finished boot camp and was now in the Vietnam War. It showed him fighting through enemies as they advanced in the war. I don't think the second act was as good as the first act because the second act didn't draw me back in as much. Still I wouldn't describe the second act as bad because it was still entertaining. The scene when they are pinned down by a sniper is very tense. None of the fighting sequences carried on for too long and seemed to be just the right length. This is a very good movie so make sure you watch it."

Now Mathew modine plays the soldier joker and he is the one who we are meant to root for. Now he does a good job as the soldier that everybody else is but he doesn't do anything to make him really stand out. There is one scene towards the end of the film that helps but it isn't really enough to make his character that interesting. The supporting cast also does a good job as soldiers in the Vietnam war and Adam Baldwin is good in the role as the crazy soldier. But there was a fantastic performance in the role and that is the drill sergeant, this guy was super scary and intimidating and everything he says is gold and he is the best performance in the role. The story is a mixed bag as it is kind of split into half, I loved the first half in the army training camp and I kind of wish the whole film could have been in the boot camp. The Vietnam part of the film had enjoyable action but really lacked something and had allot of downtime. Also the end was a bit disappointing that could have been improved. The script is great in the film with all the army dialogue working and feeling natural for the film. Also even though most of the drill sergeants dialogue is not scripted it is great and deserves credit. The style was great and Kubricks cinematography made this film feel like a great war epic and makes you feel like you are in with the marines on their mission. Overall this film is great and I definitely think you should see it."

"williampsamuel","9","0","1","7 December 2014"," Perhaps the most accurate film ever made about Vietnam, or any war
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest and most honest films about war ever made. Descending neither to the level of gung-ho shoot-'em-up or self righteous anti-war screed, it instead earnestly tells the unflinching truth about the hell that is war, and how men deal with it. In following one James T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine) on his journey from wide-eyed recruit on Parris Island to battle hardened veteran in the battlefields of Vietnam, it shows us what it means to be an American soldier in wartime.<br/><br/>The first thing you should understand about this movie is that Kubrick does nothing halfway. Instead of a half-baked montage of training scenes as music blares, we spend nearly half the movie on watching the characters go through the Corps' basic training beginning to end. The drill sergeant (real life Marine Corps drill instructor R. Lee Emery) uses language that will make polite company spontaneously burst into flames. When a man is hit by bullets, red sprays in every direction. And when someone takes a life for the first time, you will see their face harden as a part of them changes forever.<br/><br/>The second thing to understand is that Kubrick is not interested in protesting our involvement in Vietnam, demonizing our leaders a la Oliver Stone, or making our soldiers into traumatized, debauched frat-boys a la Jarhead, but neither does he have any intention of shying away from hard truths. Full Metal Jacket is completely open about the fact that a large part of military training is taking away any qualms you have about killing, including making you see the enemy as less than human. It frankly acknowledges that when one of our boys got a come-on from a whore, his first response was most likely ""How much?"" And it does not try to make combat look glorious, heroic, or anything else but terrifying and bloody.<br/><br/>Thirdly, this movie wants you to understand that despite the dehumanizing effects of what they go through, our troops are still thinking, feeling human beings. They understand that they are in hell, and that every day could be their last. They turn to humor, nihilism, false bravado, or their fellow soldiers. Some men find ways to distance themselves from the insanity of their situations. Others, like Joker, embrace the contradictions of their existence. And at the end of the day, each man is just glad to be alive.<br/><br/>Some have complained that the second half of the film is shapeless, and lacks an overarching narrative. And they're right. Except for the presence of Joker, and the setting in Vietnam, there is no common thread holding these scenes together. But that's the point. The second half isn't about a battle, or how America lost the war. It is simply a record of one man's experiences in Vietnam. Real life doesn't follow a set plot line, with rising action, false crisis, false dawn, real crisis, resolution, and maybe a twist or two that no-one saw coming. A combat tour is not always a journey of personal development and self discovery, and it is rarely a series of ever more dangerous missions culminating in an explosive climax.<br/><br/>There have also been complaints that the film's message was 'muddled' or that its message was too little too late. Some of this criticism comes from critics I greatly respect. But once again, they are missing the point. Full Metal Jacket is not an 'issue' movie, or a 'message' movie. It is not for or against the Vietnam War. It seeks neither to glorify war and justify our actions in Vietnam, or to preach about the evils of war and why it must be avoided at all costs. It only seeks to show the reality of combat.<br/><br/>And I suspect that for some critics, this is the sticking point. They want a clear stand on the morality of the war, preferably against it. I can understand this. Many of them were proud participants in the anti-war movement. They want to hear Kubrick, who for many of them is practically an idol, agree with their views. Or like a college professor grading a student's essay, they want to know ""Just what is your position on the subject?"" But part of the beauty of Full Metal Jacket is that it doesn't take a side or tell us what to think. It doesn't want to advocate a position or alter our opinion on the war. It only wants to show us the reality of it.<br/><br/>So if you watch this movie, do not expect nonstop action and heroics, discussions about the wisdom of American foreign policy in Southeast Asia, or even a unifying plot line for much of the film. But expect to gain a greater appreciation for those who have been through the hell that is war. And expect to be impressed."

Incrementally feelings changed to less and less. Then came Tet, not long after frag incidents really kicked off. Short timers just counted days and tried to steer clear of engagements. The men still fought for each other it's just short timers were really careful. Overall not a bad movie maybe the youth of our country will learn it's not always wise to volunteer.

"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","1","22 November 2014"," Poorly executed war drama that try's to be too many things at once.
","The soldiers who served in the Vietnam war first had two traumatic experiences to face: Getting past the excruciating boot camps and not dying in battlefield. Legendary director Stanley Kubrick makes a poorly organized film that is more of an ill-matched compilation of two situations revolving around these two difficult paths in the Vietnam War. Hiring a real-life Drill Sgrt, Kubrick seeked R.Lee Ermey to scare the heck out of numerous amounts of soldiers in a boot camp. We spend way too much time here. None of the soldiers are three-dimensional, Vincent D'Onofrio keeps being traumatized by everyone, and this aspect of ""Full Metal Jacket"" should have been played as just an exposition rather than an entire half of the film. None of the characters change in a moving way. The performances get tired fast. The second half is about the soldiers from this platoon shooting their way out in Vietnam. While Kubrick does do a decent job portraying the hardship soldiers have to go through like almost every other war filmmaker has, Kubrick doesn't make this a compelling story. We get to see some undeveloped soldiers shoot around and go through a couple situations before the story cuts. This isn't a story. It is an examination of two aspects of Vietnam. Having both of them in the same film is ambitious, but both scenarios don't parallel or correspond with each other. It feels like two films put together, making Kubrick fail in his ambition. This film tries to blend forced black-comedy with choppy war scenes that have horrible editing and sound. The war scenes are not compelling at all do to no suspense what so ever and blandly executed energy from Kubrick. The slow-motion aspect doesn't work in this film either. It kind of makes it strange. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is an all over the place war film that plays more like a one-layered tough situation for characters we barely know."
"Rickting","8","0","1","6 November 2014"," Loses momentum in the second half but it still hits hard
","Proving there's pretty much nothing he can't do once again (except maybe for sweet kids movies), Stanley Kubrick returns to the war genre with this Vietnam drama, which is in 2 parts. The first half is at a training camp with a foul mouthed drill sergeant terrifying the new recruits and driving one to insanity. Then we get to the war front, and it's almost a relief. From then on the film is an intense, well directed assault on the senses as the film enters the battlefields. Amazingly, Kubrick created a vivid Vietnam set in rural England. Full Metal Jacket is another display of his incredible and singular talents as a director. The first half is soul shattering and utterly harrowing; it has the best improvisation ever from real life drill sergeant R Lee Ermey and the camera work is typically flawless. The bullying and eventual suicide of Private Pyle is harrowing to watch, and despite Kubrick's typical emotional distance the first half is perfection and will leave audiences shaken to the core.<br/><br/>The second half feels more like an afterthought since the message has been exhausted and the far less interesting sergeant Joker is given the job of carrying the film which he doesn't do brilliantly. The scenes of warfare are powerful and intense, and show the horrors of war reasonably well but we do have Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan for that. The screenplay is well written throughout and it is another fine cinematic vision of war, but the film seems to lose heart after the boot camp section ends. This is the weakest out of the 5 Kubrick movies I've seen but it's still excellent. Although the second half is weaker, it's still well directed and emotionally intense, so it doesn't drag the movie down too much. However, there is a sense of wasted potential and it would have been better to stage the entire film at the boot camp. The boot camp is far scarier than any haunted house and carries some strong thematic resonance. Although it feels like 2 different films, both are anti war films and both convey their message adequately.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The theme of this movie is during the Vietnam War, and it follows a group of Marines from boot camp to their duty stations during the war. The movie starts with the marines getting their heads buzzed down to hardly any hair but rough stubble from the very beginning of boot camp through the mental trials and tribulations of boot camp. Most of the characters in this movie when by nicknames, which is in most cases happens in any branch of military where your fellow soldiers take your last name and make a nickname out of it or just give you a simple word connection from a story you might have told about your hometown. <br/><br/>The main characters in this movie got their nicknames from the senior drill instructor in the barracks as he is communicating with them as they have arrived at boot camp. The main two roles are of ""joker"" whom makes a smart comment under his breath and the drill instructor hears him, then their his weak counterpart ""Private Pyle aka Pyle"" then there is ""Jokers"" friend ""Cowboy"" whom he meets later in the movie at his duty station during the war. There were others but the one I found most ironic was ""Snowball"" because he was a black gentlemen. <br/><br/>I felt through this movie that Stanley Kubrick did a great job with camera angles to make you feel as if you were part of the platoon. Many of the close-up camera angles I feel were to make you feel what the marines were going through during their training, mentally and physically. The lighting through the movie seemed very normal so that you could pay attention to the detail that was unveiling before your eyes, hence the detail because the military is very detail oriented. The only time the lighting seemed to get darker was when ""Pyle"" shot himself in the ""head"" in front of ""Joker"" and the drill instructor and then towards the end where they the platoon was being taken down one by one by a female sniper. <br/><br/>In ending I can relate to this war/military movie, I have went through the boot camp, physical and mental challenges that come with enlisting into the military of any branch. From one veteran to those who have and those who will serve our great country, Thank You!"

","An enigmatic war tale that was trivialized without proper direction.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick the master, shows war on the face yet again. The earlier film where he showed us war as it is, is ""Paths of Glory"". He returns to how brutal the training camp shall be to how gruesome and ruthless and merciless war shall be. He sure has a humane touch yet it seems disjointed in this one. <br/><br/>Based on the trauma of American Soldiers in the Vietnam War, this movie travels from the training camp to the actual battlefield and takes pit stops in between to devise strategies of the war. Walking through the corridors of the camp to the trenches of the war-field the ambiance created is perfect and it made me as if I were there. This is a commonality in most Kubrick movies as he takes the audience right to the place where the scene is happening and that's the reason he is so great. He transposes, trans locates and takes the audience into a trance of the movie, where we believe that it is happening for real. He then asks us the question, how do we feel? Ah, I love Kubrick just for this. <br/><br/>Having said that, this movie fails in terms of keeping the viewer focused due to the disorientation it goes through. I love Kubrick more than most and yet I found this to be a movie less interesting, though it made me sit for the whole length and just made a vague impression rather than a strong one. <br/><br/>It is superb technically, but Kubrick made much better war movies than this.

"poe426","6","0","1","8 September 2014"," Malingering malady...
","FULL METAL JACKET suffers from the same malady that plagued the even less well-realized FROM DUSK TIL DAWN (the first one): the first half is interesting enough to hold one's attention, while the second half is all over the road. What makes the second half of FULL METAL JACKET nigh intolerable are the clearly contrived scenes (some of the worst, most clearly STAGED scenes you're ever likely to see in a feature film) , coupled with shockingly amateurish performances. The greatest failing of the Great Technician (Kubrick) has always been the on-screen performances of his players: from THE KILLING to FULL METAL JACKET, his films have always relied more on behind-the-scenes TECHNIQUES than on on-screen performances; it's what makes THE SHINING a mediocre movie, and what makes A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, in the final analysis, little more than an exercise in cinematography (long, uncut master shots that play out ever so slowly). Like Dario Argento, Kubrick was more Technician than Storyteller."
"dworldeater","10","0","1","18 August 2014"," My favorite war movie of all time and one of the best movies ever made
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a powerful, original, well crafted masterpiece that is in a class of its own and in my opinion, flawless. Don't get me wrong, there are many great war movies that are also classics. Full Metal Jacket is unique from other Vietnam War movies as no one made movies like Stanley Kubrick. Stanley had a unique take on the subject matter, got the finest performances possible from his cast and made a film that still looks and sounds incredible nearly thirty years later. Lee Ermy, a decorated Marine and Vietnam War veteran serves double duty as technical adviser and as Drill Sgt. Hartman. He brings both authenticity and an unforgettable, intense performance as drill instructor. From what friends of mine who served in the Marines tell me, the training sequences are one hundred percent accurate. The other half of the film may be slightly less intense, but director Stanley Kubrick's story told through Joker's perspective flows smooth and is no less interesting when Joker arrives in the 'Nam. Matthew Modine is exceptional here and shows great range in his performance. He has a lot of charisma as well as great screen presence. In my opinion, Stanley Kubrick made an excellent choice casting him as he did a great job carrying the film. Of course Vincent D'Onfrio was exceptional as the ill fated Private Pyle and Adam Baldwin kills it Alpha male bad ass Animal Mother. The rock n' roll soundtrack compliments the film greatly and gives it a feel for the period. The characters in this story are brutalized and their lives are changed forever by what they go through in the course of the film. Full Metal Jacket is one of my all time favorite movies and is one movie you will never forget once you see it."
"wasscarrie","8","0","1","30 July 2014"," Another uncomfortable work of art by Kubrick
","Full Metal Jacket is not just another movie about the Vietnam War. It follows a young Private Joker (Matthew Modine) on his journey from boot camp, to graduation, and through his tour in Vietnam. It exposes the methods and mentality of war that brought out a darker side of the human spirit.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick tap dances around the political discussion occurring during that time period. He portrays the boot camp training of Gunnary Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermy) as a degrading, brainwashing journey to becoming a trained killer. For the first thirty minutes of the film the dialog is dominated by Ermy's trademark profanity-laden shout. After a bizarre moment involving Private Pyle's (Vincent D'Onofrio) death, the film jumps to Vietnam. Here the marines' demeaning treatment and resentment of the Vietnamese people is brought to the forefront. The documentary being filmed right in the middle of a hot zone showed interviews with some of the marines, who were asked their views on the war. The actors skirt the issues, for the most part. Even Joker's contradictory peace sign button and ""Born to Kill"" scribbled on his helmet hint at opposing views on their presence in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Platoon is also a film following a young military recruit and his tour in Vietnam. It was released a year prior to Full Metal Jacket, but did not have the though-provoking political content or the focus on the American/ Vietnamese relationship. Platoon is concerned with the relationships between the soldiers and their internal conflicts. <br/><br/>One way Kubrick makes Full Metal Jacket almost uncomfortable to watch at times is through the soundtrack and audio, or sometimes their absence. He makes the audience feel the tension in the scene by slowly adding a slow tribal drumbeat when the marines in Vietnam are ""hunting"" a sniper in the burned-out buildings. He also cuts from a very emotional and disturbing scene to an upbeat popular song from the time period. One overt example of this is the transition from Private Pyle's murder/ suicide to the first scene in a Da Nang market backed by ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"" by Nancy Sinatra.<br/><br/>Creative camera angles also accentuate the emotions of the movie. During one of Gny. Sgt. Hartman's rants on Private Pyle, the viewer takes the place of Pyle as Hartman violently waggles his finger and directly addresses the camera. The two unnamed, but familiar late marines are ringed by many of their brothers and the camera is located in the center of the ring. As each speaks their peace, the camera pans tightly to the next person in turn, giving an almost dizzying effect. These sporadic camera angles give the viewer a chaotic, almost vertigo- inducing point-of-view.<br/><br/>Kubrick's intention with the film, and most of his films, is to make the audience think, and sometimes feel uncomfortable with what he addresses in his films. He hints at both sides of the politics of Vietnam without blatantly stating his own view. He allows the audience to consider all parts of the film, like treatment and conditioning at boot camp and the degradation of the Vietnamese during the war, and make their own political decisions on the subject."

","I have been rewatching war films lately and just finished with Full Metal Jacket about the Vietnam war era. The story covers the lives of several recruits from boot camp thru to battle in Vietnam.<br/><br/>The best part is the first half of the movie at boot camp. The drill sergeant, played by Lee Ermey, blows you away with an unbelievably vivid depiction of the cruelty handed out by drill sergeants to new recruits. This part of the movie moves along nicely, showing you day after day how the training wears down the recruits into a single unit. However, one recruit Gomer Pyle, played by a young Vincent D'onofrio from TV's Law and Order, has a screw loose. And the screw gets looser and looser until the final scene of boot camp that literally blows you away.<br/><br/>Then, poof, the bottom falls out of the movie, as Joker (played OK by Modine) gets assigned to be a journalist in Vietnam. He displays a sly wit while he has Born to Kill on his helmet, but wears a peace badge. He's supposed to be cynically sarcastic about the role of the marines in Vietnam, but I felt his acting left something to be desired.<br/><br/>In Vietnam, he meets up with his buddy Cowboy, and they reminisce about things. Joker wants to see some action, so he joins the squad as they march thru this city. Bombs happen, shootings happen, snipers happen. But the action is not well-linked. I did not feel pulled into the action to feel the tension, not like from other better war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Born on the 4th of July, or especially Platoon.<br/><br/>In the final scene, with the Joker coming to grips with what war really does and what it can bring out in an otherwise normal human being, again, it fails to excite, and falls flat, just like the ending. Man, see Charlie Sheen in Platoon if you want to see the benchmark that Full Metal Jacket fails to reach.<br/><br/>I will soon rewatch Platoon, and possibly Apocalypse Now. But I don't strongly recommend Full Metal Jacket because after the boot camp, it fails poorly. Based on the great boot camp filmography alone, I give it a 6/10 overall. Good luck."
"bryr8883-29-191187","10","0","1","16 June 2014"," Spoiler Alert. School project. Detailed description.
","Full Metal Jacket takes place during the Vietnam War. I believe the major theme of this movie is how war dehumanizes the average person. What was once reprehensible is now commonplace. The movie begins in Paris Island at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot. There are several of the more prominent characters in the film. Matthew Modine is private Joker, Arliss Howard is private Cowboy, Vincent D'Onofrio is private Leonard Lawrence (Gomer Pyle), Adam Baldwin is Animal Mother and R. Lee Ermy is Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, the senior drill instructor. The first half of the movie follows the recruits through boot camp getting them ready to go to Vietnam. Joker and Cowboy are good friends throughout the film. Private Pyle is an overweight recruit that is slowing everyone down and has no motivation and as a prior soldier myself, that is the last thing you want when you're going to war. <br/><br/>Throughout the first half of the film all of the other recruits are constantly getting into trouble because of Private Pyle. After an incident regarding a donut that was hidden in his foot locker Private Pyle did not get in trouble anymore, the rest of the platoon did. This did not last long before they strongly motivated Private Pyle to try harder. It worked for the rest of the time while they were in boot camp and he eventually became an infantryman in the Marine Corp. All of the motivation that the other recruits gave him proved to be too much because he ended up killing himself and drill instructor Hartman. <br/><br/>The second half of the movie takes place in Vietnam where it takes the remaining characters through the perils of war. The dehumanizing of the marines starts in boot camp as demonstrated with Private Pyle but it becomes evident when they get to Vietnam. The use of the music to let you know something is about to happen is very prevalent while they were in Vietnam. It makes the suspenseful scenes even better because you know things about to liven up. Also the use of camera angles is a great technique used in this film. They are really good when the platoon is approaching the town behind the tanks and the camera is following behind showing the town as they approach. It almost makes you feel like it is your turn to run down the road to find cover. Also when the sniper is trying to pick off members of the platoon in the town center, the camera angles go back and forth from the platoon to the sniper. The zooming technique is also very effective in this scene. <br/><br/>The dehumanizing effects of war and preparing for war are evident in this movie. Similar themes like the one found in Full Metal Jacket can also be found in films like Platoon and Deer Hunter. These are movies about the Vietnam War also and the effects that war can have on a person. Overall Full Metal Jacket is a great movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"user-26-905621","4","0","2","13 June 2014"," Mise en scene in Full Metal Jacket
","This review includes our thoughts about the Mise en Scene used in the movie, for which this movie has become famous and we will also give you our collective opinion on the movie at the end of the review.<br/><br/>Props and clothing: Props don't seem to have a significant role throughout the movie, and that is exactly why they are so effective. One of the props that stands out most is the rifle. Some props also have a symbolic meaning. The peace badge and the helmet with ""born to kill"" may seem like some joke, but they can also symbolize that the soldiers are fighting for peace.<br/><br/>Since the movie isn't actually shot at a training facility, all of the obstacles are props. They are, however replicas of real versions. Because none of the movie is shot on location, even the helicopter scenes are made with scale models. This is done quite nicely, since it took some research to discover this.<br/><br/>The clothing also plays a significant role throughout the movie. All soldiers are shaved bald and wear the same clothes. This stands in sharp contrast to the drill sergeant, who wears much neater clothes. Because all soldiers wear identical clothes, and are we are forced to look for physical differences. For example this makes private Pyle (the chubby guy), stand out even more. Later on however, during the fighting scenes in Vietnam, the soldiers are much more recognisable. This is because they have hair again and personalised their uniforms. Also, throughout the entire second half of the movie, there is very little change in uniform. <br/><br/>The clothing also includes some special effects. Blood bags, for example, are used to fake death, because there was no CGI when the movie was made. We can see this in an earlier scene where the drill instructor gets shot. <br/><br/>Background: In addition to this we will now talk about the use of background in Full Metal Jacket. In Full Metal Jacket there aren't any animated background pictures, because the film was shot in 1987. At that time they didn't have the techniques that could do this. However a lot of the movie has been shot inside of a studio. Because of this the movie directors had to use pictures as background. Watching the movie the viewer will not notice the fake background. However if you pay close attention to the background, you will notice that the backgrounds are mostly fake.<br/><br/>There is one scene in which private Pyle is out of bed by night in the toilet room. The whole scene is dark and a lot of dark colours are used in this scene. In this scene Pyle is talking with private Joker holding a gun. Pyle blames him of his failure. From all the noises they make, they wake up the sergeant. He then goes to the toilet room to take a look. He finds Pyle with Joker in the toilet room. He tries talking Pyle out of shooting. When he realises he fails, he starts shouting and yelling towards Pyle. Now Pyle points the gun at the sergeant and shoots him. When watching this scene you feel that the scene is unbalanced. This is because viewers only notice something when it's abnormal. With the unbalanced distribution of light and colour in the scene, the scene looks unbalanced. This already gives a hint towards what is going to happen. Which you can see, is correct, because the sergeant is shot. Nevertheless there is a balance in the objects in the scene. On each side of the room there are an even amount of toilets, symmetrical opposite each other. This is a great example of the use of composition in the movie. <br/><br/>Actors: Another significant use of Mise en Scene was their choice for the actors playing the recruits. It was done in such a fashion to make private Pyle stand out due to his weight because all of the other recruits are skinny/decently built, while Pyle is fat, which gives you the impression that Pyle is going to fail at becoming a good recruit.<br/><br/>The drill sergeant also played a major role in the movie. He dominated in the first half of the movie, because he was always there to insult the recruits and thus mainly focused the attention on two other characters; private Pyle, who always screws up and private Joker for making remarks all the time. <br/><br/>Furthermore, in the beginning of the movie, the recruits are being shaved, in this scene you can see that most of them have long hair. This gave us an idea of what the recruits are like, which made us have some sort of relationship with the actors. Besides this, it also gave us an idea of the time in the movie, the 70s, which was confirmed by the song playing in the background of the scene: 'goodbye sweetheart, hello Vietnam'. By having their hair shaved off, it shows that they are ready to start their new lives as recruits.<br/><br/>Our opinion We will now give our opinion, with regard to the movie. We don't like the movie regardless of its humorist parts. This is because the movie actually never begins. It feels like you are watching a 2 hour intro. So when watching the movie you are expecting, scene after scene, the movie to actually start, which we think is very irritating. Further when watching the movie you don't exactly get to know who the main character is. In the first half of the film the film lets you think that private Pyle is the main character. But after he kills himself, it becomes clear that the main character is actually private joker. This is confusing for the viewer. Even tough Full Metal Jacket is considered as a classic war movie. It's just like the bible, just because it's considered a classic, doesn't mean its any good."

","Full Disclosure--This is one of my all-time favorite films.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick, Director of such films as ""A Clockwork Orange"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" to literally name a few can add ""Full Metal Jacket"" to his insane catalogue of classic films. It remains the best war movie that I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Matthew Modine Takes the lead as Pvt. ""Joker"", sliding quietly into his role and relaxing the viewer w/his performance. Modine doesn't bring a gritty edge to any character. Instead he meets his characters halfway, combining his personal likability with whatever truth makes the character tick. His performance was solid, if not remarkable. The truly remarkable performances come courtesy of Vincent D'Onofrio and R. Lee Ermey. D'Onofrio is mesmerizing. His performance as Pvt. ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence is impossible to look away from. R. Lee Ermey takes his turn as the best Drill Sargent that I have ever seen on film-period. His in-your-face intensity was 100% authentic and was balanced perfectly by D'Onofrio's subtle, slow descent into madness. The dichotomy of Ermeys loudmouth bravado and D'Onofrio's subtle but seething intensity is what makes this film worth repeated viewings. The result of their interaction is explosive and leaves a permanent impression though it occurs fairly early in the film. It's a tribute to Kubrick that the film maintains it's high quality after such an emotional climax to a scene. He moves seamlessly from Basic Training to the reality of War itself. This is also a tribute to an underrated ensembles cast that includes the likes of Adam Baldwin and Dorian Harewood. Stanley Kubrick has given us a gritty, intense, funny and remarkably authentic war movie. 9/10"

","Kubrick has always been a genius, in my opinion, and Full Metal Jacket is no exception. Depicturing the duality of man; it's lust for peace, while idealizing killing, is simply superb. Kubrick shows a strong side of delivering a new perception on the genre, the war movie genre. Kubrick's focus on the mind of the soldiers, in particular Joker, has a depth that i have not seen before in the genre. It is worth noticing that Kubrick uses very little actual gunfights and very few people being killed. This leaves room to show the mental demise of the soldiers, in stead of the physical. This is why Full Metal Jacket is a totally new take on the war-movie genre. The movie also stands out in it's use of humor and strange choice of music, like ""Surfin' Bird"".<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece, and it remains one of the strongest war-movies of all time.

The Jungle. Maybe Kubrick wanted to set His Movie Apart from Apocalypse Now (1979) and Platoon (1986) that After All had done that so Well. But Whatever the Methodology, the ""In Country"" Part feels Dislocated because there is Very Little Foliage and the Battle Scenes are Shot in a ""Concrete"" Jungle.<br/><br/>The Opening, almost Half of the Movie, is what gets all the Rap, at least the Positive Rap, because it is so Realistic. It was a Hard Act to Follow in the Second Part, and the Viet Nam Portion gets the most Gripes. As a Whole, the Film Ranks Behind Apocalypse and Platoon but has Enough Cinematic Mastery that makes up for a Somewhat Disappointing, but Nevertheless Engaging End. It's not a Satisfying Conclusion to a Story about a War that did not have a Satisfying Conclusion."
"Red-Barracuda","8","0","1","3 February 2014"," The bravura opening section is enough reason to watch this
","Stanley Kubrick anti-war film Full Metal Jacket was one of a cycle of 80's movies that focused on the war in Vietnam. As is typical of the director it has a meticulous attention to detail. It's a film in two acts, the first is set in a training boot-camp in America and the second part is set in Vietnam proper. In both scenarios we follow a group of young marines. The movie has an unusual dynamic in that the first section is by far the stronger. It's a harrowing account of the way that young recruits are dehumanized as part of a training programme designed to turn them into merciless killers. This section is primarily about two people – Sergeant Hartman the drill instructor and Private Pyle the simple-minded recruit who suffers a nightmare trying to conform. R. Lee Ermey - an actual ex drill instructor – is unforgettable as Hartman. He is equally terrifying and hilarious. Scary because he is so convincing and his heavy tactics are so harsh but funny in that the inventively profane dialogue he constantly barks out is often pretty amusing in a black comedy sense. The way that Kubrick handles this section is perfection and events progress to an unforgettable climax.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie can only suffer by comparison. It's far more conventional and closer to other standard war films. I think one issue is that Matthew Modine's Private Joker is simply no match to the Hartman/Pyle dramatic axis that underpins the first half. Joker comes across as a smart aleck and not particularly interesting, although in truth none of the marines from the second half of the movie really feel very likable or easy to empathise with and this does effect the dynamic a little. But the story also loses overall focus in the latter half and sort of peters out to a certain extent. This is not to say that there isn't anything good about this part of the film because it's still very well made with several good set-pieces but its flaws ensure that the film as a whole falls short of the masterpiece it could have been given the excellence of the opening act."
"rsabnis1","8","0","1","29 January 2014"," One of the finest war films I have ever seen...Shapeless but pragmatic enough.
","I never saw a Stanley Kubrick film even though boasting about my utter penchant for films goes in sheer vain. But I heard about them a heck lot. The horror genre in Hollywood can surely be exemplified by Kubrick's 'The Shining'. He even had furnished his mastery when he gave the dream of eye-popping sci-fi effects a refined shape in his '2001: A Space Odyssey '. But I started by watching the first Kubrick film by giving his war film 'Full Metal Jacket' a worthwhile try. Why Full Metal jacket? Maybe it is because war films have a strong flavour of despair, horror and plethoric human drama and I love it all.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket consists of two distinct parts. A soft tone of 'Kiss me goodbye and write me when I am gone' marks the beginning the movie where the group of grunts are sitting in saloon getting their heads shaved off. That is the drill; the one to get them trained on Paris Island so that they can find themselves capable to be recruited in Marine Corps. The Island is a place where a straight poker face and nods to the senior drill instructor's commands becomes their only fate of life.<br/><br/>However, the drill instructor sergeant Hartman is not the one worth belying with. He is arrogant, aggressive, regards the privates as lowest form of life on the earth & shows rapid impulses to petty mistakes by the privates. His favourite barb-target is Private Gomer Pyle (so renamed from Leonard Lawrence by the instructor himself), an obese klutz who is often taunted and contradicted for his obese body and his utter inability to participate in workouts & is meant to be quite obtuse.<br/><br/>The rigorous physical training sessions, continuous streak of taunts by the instructor & predestined antipathy which his associate privates have for him puts Pyle's innocence & endurance to a test; The test which concludes with a Pyle transforming into an antagonist shooting up the sergeant and himself.<br/><br/>The latter half in majority is based in Vietnam and showcases war scenes and bloodbath. Private Joker (Mathew Modine), the one who used to bunk with Pyle and the sheer witness of his antagonism is recruited as a war correspondent in Stars and Stripes which publishes military newspaper in Vietnam. Following incoming enemy attacks all over South Vietnam, Joker is briefed and sent to Phu Bai along with his cameraman Rafterman to interview the platoon and record their experiences regarding the war. He meets his Paris Island associate Private Cowboy in Lusthog Squad as the entire party gradually gets drawn into a booby trap.<br/><br/>Even though the film is pragmatic, it is completely shapeless and fails to deal within realms of realism. The second half invites a fruitful comparison to other war films like 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. As it progresses, culminates into a horrendous picture of war and horror.<br/><br/>It is comfortably understandable and has no easy catharsis. Kubrick has enhanced the visuals quite fantastically by his daunting angles at the scene of carnage. He manages to create a marvellous visual epiphany on the trembling prisoner at the end. As compared to 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Platoon', Full Metal Jacket appears naive but can hold a tight grip on the viewer's attention for the complete duration. Cheers for Stanley Kubrick<br/><br/>8 on 10 stars"

","Unfortunately, Metal Jacket shows the brilliant Kubrick in decline, and a long way from his anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory (1958). All in all, and despite some telling episodes, this 2-hours adds up to a rather pointless exercise in wartime experience. Certainly, the first half is undeniable in its powerful expose of Marine Basic Training and the dehumanizing effect. At the same time, contrasting its honest depiction of combat training with the heavily sanitized depictions from such 1950's counterparts as Take the High Ground (1953) or Battle Cry (1955) shows how much truth-telling in the movie industry movie had improved in 30-years. Still and all, the movie halves do not match up well. <br/><br/>I see the problem as lying with a script, and its inability to etch its characters strongly enough (excepting the ill-fated Ermey and Pyle) to bridge the gap and pull us into their battlefield predicament. At the same time, we only get a sporadic picture of the one continuing character, Private Joker (Modine). Perhaps, the best Vietnam part is listening to how the head of Stars and Stripes skews journalistic coverage in a propagandistic direction. So, it wasn't just folks at home being misled by their media, but troops in the field by theirs, as well. Anyway, the visuals are hellish in their fiery depiction of the battle for Hue. Then too, it comes as a real surprise that the sniper is a woman, the embodiment, I guess, of what the North meant by their motto ""People's War"". Looks to me, also, that Kubrick and co. had little idea of how to end the 2-hours. So we get a strident male chorus of a children's song, no less, as the platoon stumbles through a twilight world. Whatever else, that imagery does manage to symbolize the war in general.<br/><br/>All in all, however, the movie suffers in comparison to such other Vietnam flicks as Platoon (1986) or Apocalypse Now (1979). Too bad Kubrick wasn't 20-years younger when he made this two films in one."

","In many ways, it's the last of the many War movies to come out based upon Vietnam such as ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978), ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) & ""Platoon"" (1986). Stanley Kubrick, the great innovator known for spending years on his craft had been surpassed by many award winning movies. Still like many of Stanley's movies that are initially despised upon release, are years later lauded as masterpieces beyond the scope of a mere camera lens. ""Full Metal Jacket"", I feel represents Stanley working at his most un-prohibited in terms of humanities greatest flaw. After seeing through the bitter eyes of General Kirk Douglas in ""Paths Of Glory"" (1957), and the Superpowers of ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964) we finally get to see what really matters. The soldiers coming to terms: ""In a world of sh*t"".<br/><br/>The first act shows our cast of heroes begin their vigorous training into dehumanised killers, led by the ""cruel, but fair"" leader Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (Real life drill instructor Lee Ermy). Training goes well for all, except one Private definitely lacking in any physical advantages and whose shortcomings begin to cost the squad dearly. Eventually our lead character ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine), is eventually dispatched into Vietnam. From then on there are reunions with former comrades, sadistic peers and total disregard for human life on both sides. <br/><br/>Tense and unnerving, the performances are worth the reasons of viewing alone. Whilst not the most quotable and recognised of the Vietnam depictions, Kubrick's camera-work is as sublime as ever, and it's hard not to be totally engrossed on how London's Beckton Gas Works got turned into Vietnamese soil.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Essential Kubrick. If that isn't reason enough, I don't know what is. 8/10."

True, all his later films I have found to be at least good, if not more, and the one in question is definitely a good movie.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket consists of two rather different parts, with only two connecting characters - ""Joker"" and ""Cowboy"". The first part is more intensive and versatile, and many elements have been later used both in other ""serious"" movies and in parodies. R. Lee Ermey (as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman) fills in the screen in total, the roles by Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio could have been more psychological, too much focus on field training and barrack environment. Part 2 - already in Vietnam - is more arid, with many shootings and wrecked buildings resemble battles in Stalingrad, with the exception of climate... The actors are not catchy and scenes depicting one idea or event are too long. The ending could have been more sophisticated as well.<br/><br/>Not a bad war movie, but I still like some later ones more, e.g. Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Stalingrad."

This one I've seen several times before, and I can't deny that this is a good film, especially the first part. That first part focuses on order and discipline, while second part descends (more) into chaos and debauchery, but both parts represent a certain kind of hell, facing their own conundrums.<br/><br/>Kubrick is an important filmmaker, I won't deny it, but here his craftsmanship is mainly limited to a very neat registration of what is going on. Kubrick observes, or better yet, he lets the viewer observe - no more, no less. But in the first part the acting of D'Onofrio and Ermey is so superb that it's almost impossible to top. Personally, I think that in the second part only the sniper girl in the end really matches their intensity, though Modine especially plays well, too.<br/><br/>A small 8 out of 10."

","What can be said about Stanley Kubrick's already terrific film? I guess i'll first start by saying that when it came out, America was in a charging period of sorts (the whole Iran-Contra thing didn't help much, massive debt and a Republican President much like Nixon hell bent on doing things his way). So as far as the feel of the film I think (from talking to marines that went through Paris Island) that it's spot on. <br/><br/>R. Lee Emry is one S.O.B. you don't mess with, but on that same hand you want him beside you when stuff starts going down. I Didn't like some of the action scenes however as they seemed contrived and could have been done much better (Hamburger Hill anyone??). My biggest complaint is at the end of the film when you find out the sniper was a woman, i know the V.C. used women in their military but not in that manner. They were more load bearers and nurses, etc. But i guess it's Hollywood ""license"" to do as you see fit to make your film interesting (read different). <br/><br/>I still give it 10 out of 10 stars, because it has a strong cast and has moments that make you laugh, cry, and think of the horrors our military men (and women) go through daily."

Matthew Modine is in one of his best role, presenting a steadfast young man with the rare quality necessary to get through marine training with all his head.

","Obviously a very highly regarded movie directed by the great Stanley Kubrick and one I'm long overdue watching, my problem being this I'm not struck on war movies and Vietnam films in particular.<br/><br/>That said no-one could gainsay the power of the film and its bloody realism has had a direct influence on subsequent films down the years like ""Blackhawk Down"" and ""The Hurt Locker"" to name but two. <br/><br/>Shot in two distinct sections, the new marine recruits boot camp training under the Training Director from hell and the active tour of duty in Vietnam, both have shocking violently shocking outcomes which impact vividly on the memory. Arguably nothing is more eye-opening than the ritual humiliation the new young crop suffer as the desensitising process of turning them into thoughtless, unfeeling killing machines sees them go through unimaginably relentless mental torture and physical hardship, before one sensitive conscript is pushed too far.<br/><br/>No sooner have you got over the shock sequence that culminates the training than the action is switched to Vietnam as we now see the same conscripts in real-life action, where for all their battle-hardened instillation, their inexperience causes them to make blundering errors with tragic consequences.<br/><br/>Although I was impressed by Kubrick's direction with his famed roving, subjective camera- shots, in the end, I felt as if my senses had been assaulted for two hours, no doubt, partially his aim in the first place. There's no real structure to the film either, just before and after combat and I failed to see the young men bond together into a fighting unit, which again may have been intentional.<br/><br/>I got the obvious message about thrusting completely unprepared young men into the white heat of battle but the constant violence, profanity and induced stress ultimately wasn't to my taste even as I accept the strength of the message it was putting across."

","I clearly remember when this movie came out, and I avoided it because of the title, the mental image of the title, seeing someone wear a full metal jacket. Now that I am a gunman I understand the reference, ammunition with a soft metal core, commonly lead, jacketed with a harder metal, like brass. Interesting title, it was extracted from a line spoken in the script.<br/><br/>The story is split roughly into two almost equal parts. The first takes a rag-tag band of new Marine recruits and follows them through basic training where they become skilled killing machines. Matthew Modine is Pvt. J.T. 'Joker' Davis, gaining his nickname for his tendency to look for humor in almost any situation. Vincent D'Onofrio is overweight and out of shape Pvt. Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence , given his nickname for his general ineptness. R. Lee Ermey, who also happens to be an ex-Marine Sgt. is Gny. Sgt. Hartman. He had originally been hired as a consultant but was so good he was hired in the role.<br/><br/>The second half of the story has the men in Vietnam in the 1960s. Joker ends up as a reporter, while the others are infantry. There they meet up with bad-ass Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother . He ends up being instrumental in a rescue and flushing out a sniper.<br/><br/>Some critics have complained that the story isn't cohesive, but that didn't bother me. It seemed to offer a very realistic view of basic training, and some idea what the American soldiers experienced ""In Country."" A bit of battle, a bit of street prostitutes, a bit of interviewing for views on the war. I could have been there, I was drafted in 1968, but ended up staying in the USA. A good friend of mine was on the front lines, shooting and being shot at. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Each half of the movie ended with very dramatic events. 'Gomer Pyle' had been humiliated and pushed so hard that in the end of basic went a bit crazy, at night in the latrine area, right before graduation, he shot and killed the drill Sgt. then put the gun in his own mouth and killed himself. Then the climax of the second half was an encounter with an unseen sniper who killed two of the soldiers. When they finally surrounded the building it turned out to be a young Vietnamese woman, probably a teenager. She is shot, and lying on the floor strewn with rubble, is in obvious pain and saying over and over, 'shoot me, shoot me.' Joker puts her out of her pain and the movie ends with the Marines marching and singing the 'M-I-C-K-E-Y, M-O-U-S-E' song."

The military factory that turns out killing machines aka the Marines is projected in great detail, with snappy dialogue, instantly lovable characters, great plot and background score. This movie is a classic. The drill sergeant immediately grabs the attention of the viewer by his testicles and doesn't let go until his death. the easy and carefree joker is exotic and astonishing in his natural portrayal of a mischievous marine recruit. Gomer Pyle arouses our sympathy and compassion and his transformation from a happy go lucky slightly idiotic kid to a homicidal lunatic is a testament to all the wrong things done in the Marine Corps. <br/><br/>The style is classic Kubrick and the way he snap cuts into characters that portray exactly the stereotypes of soldiers in the Vietnam War better than any other movie except maybe Platoon.

","The film was incredibly violent at times and the dialogue, especially by Sergeant Hartman, was not appropriate. Many of the things that Sergeant Hartman said to Private Pyle were vile and disgusting in anticipation of improving his athleticism and motivating him to try harder. Ultimately, it doesn't work when Private Pyle breaks at the last day due to amount of pressure and expectation piled up on him and he kills Hartman and himself. The film also has many suspenseful moments, among them the death of Private Pyle and Sergeant Hartman and the patrol in which Joker kills the Vietnamese female sniper. The director constantly chooses to film these scenes in dark rooms or at night, only lit up by a flashlight/moonlight or fires. The music that accompany the scenes provide an eerie atmosphere that really makes the viewer sit at the edge of his seat constantly. The movie shows the two sides of the war, the violent and brutal side of the war that most people think about when they think of Vietnam and also the oppressive and psychological style, where many Marines were pressured to get into the system of following commands and preparing for the war, which led to many Marines losing their mind. Several army terminologies that I learnt from the film were the Rifleman's Creed and the Thousand-yard Stare. A term that I connected with one of the stories in Tim O'Brien was the term ""sh*t"", which was used constantly in this film. The two major parts in this film where the word ""sh*t"" was used was before Private Pyle killed himself, claiming he was in a world of sh*t because of all the pressure he faced and the torment he faced from the verbal and physical abuse he faced in camp and Sergeant Joker, who said that even though he was in a world of sh*t, he was glad to be still alive and he was no longer afraid. In the Tim O'Brien book, the term ""sh*t field"" is used when Kiowa sinks into a mud-filled bog and the soldiers use it often as there is no other word to describe such a place. In conclusion, I believe that this movie effectively showed the two sides of the Vietnam War that the soldiers faced and with the intense shots and appropriate music choices, it created a suspense-filled movie that really engaged me and creeped me out many times."
"kurosawakira","7","0","1","7 February 2013"," Difficult to Explain Why
","While this is as witty, visually stunning and well-crafted film as might be expected from Mr Kubrick, it does not rank that high in my books among other films from his filmography. This, of course, is highly suspect, and requires some explaining.<br/><br/>And it is difficult to explain why. The film shuffles between different moods (farce, tragedy, psychological horror, destruction) and forms (fluid tracking shots, Tarkovskian wandering, documentary, hand-held chaos) so expertly it's a sign of great craftsmanship that it all holds together. Hartman is at the center of the farce, which then explodes at our face in the darkest scenes of the film, also the most heartbreaking (save for that one tracking shot of the mass grave). Then the film shifts gear again. The shot from above of the two dead soldiers is among the most accomplished I've found from Kubrick, the emblem of this film for me.<br/><br/>Perhaps the reason why this doesn't enlarge itself with each viewing as ""Barry Lyndon"" (1975) does lies in the confines it has set for itself. Hugely influential within the genre, it still largely operates within it, and in some ways enforces a certain Vietnam film archetype. My favourite ""war"" films aren't war films in themselves, the war is there, but we are there for other reasons. <br/><br/>Another reason might be its centrifugally moving narrative, yet I admit this lack of a nucleus might have been Kubrick's whole intention, since it leaves me wanting, quite disturbed, even. You are free to disagree, and I might agree this is rather oblique reasoning. On the other hand, my argument deals not why this film is bad, which it most certainly is not. Perhaps this is the one film I have been explicitly saturated with, in ways concealing its narrative and visual power. Maybe in due time when I revisit it again I'll be able to appreciate it more."
"classicsoncall","9","0","1","31 January 2013"," ""It's your hard heart that kills.""
","Kubrick's scathing anti-war message begins immediately with a harrowing twenty minute indoctrination into Marine boot camp training that leaves little to the imagination. The acclaimed director hammers the viewer with the relentless battering of young recruit Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant (R. Lee Ermey), and effectively captures the dehumanizing aspect of preparing killers for the defense of their country. However I'm not convinced that Matthew Modine was the best choice to demonstrate the duality that Kubrick was going for with his 'Born to Kill' helmet juxtaposed with that peace button on his lapel. He wasn't a colorful enough character and didn't demonstrate a set of core values that one could relate to, as his own anti-war sentiment seemed to surface only when the picture shifted to 'in country' as Viet vets used to call it. In fact, none of the soldiers here are particularly memorable, not in the way Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willem Defoe are remembered for their portrayals in ""Platoon"". The picture is at it's wicked best during the early boot camp sequence, but loses some focus during the battle at Hue City. The identity of the sniper was a clever twist, and I think this is where Kubrick most effectively demonstrated the duality he was going for, by showing us that it wasn't Joker's hard heart that made him pull the trigger, but his compassion for another human being. He then brings the absurdity of all war home by having the soldiers return to base camp while singing the Mickey Mouse Club theme song. The post-Viet Nam decade brought forth a significant number of critically acclaimed films, and it's tough to choose a 'best' when you have such offerings as ""Platoon"", ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" in the mix, all of which have strong statements to make about the inherent inhumanity of all war."

As a movie, it's really boring and hard to sympathize or care about the Marines (but maybe Kubrick wanted that). R. Lee Ermey was fantastic and completely in form, while none of the recruits were interesting enough to pay attention to. (Including Pyle, who was not cut out for the Marines anyway.) The movie had two halves which seemed connected like the bread of a PB&J, but without the enjoyability of a sandwich. But I was a huge fan of the opening scene.

","Typical Stanley Kubrick - shock & awe. Mr.Kubrick has this typical style to portray extremities of the human behavior when under pressure or showcasing the delusional side of the human mind. He did it in ""The Shining"", The clockwork orange and now again in FMJ.<br/><br/>Many war movies have been made that take the viewer through how and why American wars were futile and without purpose. FMJ takes the same topic and shows it in typical Kubrick style - extreme side of human behavior which is sometimes delusional, background sets in line with the mood of the movie, script which shocks the viewer. FMJ does not really have a plot, but a good script. The script builds up the confusion which war has created in the minds of these so-called men. They do not know what they are fighting for - some are patriots without reason, some love guns, some are trigger happy cowboys who just want to shoot NVA (north Vietnamese army). The initial training drills on the island described the brainwash that marines are made to go through to make them brain-dead killing-on-order zombies. Even if some of them realize the futility of it all, they continue to do it so that they confirm to the larger madness. Joker had realized that but he still punished Pyle Lawrence, which eventually led Lawrence to shoot the sergeant and commit suicide.<br/><br/>The script then shows how these ""Trained Marines"" act in the field. During the sniper scene, there was no plan which the marines were following - they were randomly moving around which got 3 of them killed, acting on pure motion, defying direct orders from platoon leader and looking for payback when the third soldier is killed. Stanley Kubrick shows brilliantly what war does to young men - it turns marines into brainless mercenaries thirsty for blood. These marines thoughtlessly sing the mickey mouse song once they have killed their targets.<br/><br/>Camera-work was typical Stanley Kubrick style adapting as per the scene's requirements- hand-held camera when the marines are moving made the viewer feel as if he is present there and moving along with the marines, camera showing what the NVA sniper sees making the viewer skip a heartbeat and adding to the thrill factor.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a different and typical Kubrick style of cinema. Though I still felt that maybe this was an incomplete movie, but then again, wars are pointless. This could have been dragged the same way as shown in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"", but guess it conveyed the same point in half the time. 7.5 out of 10 for me."

","Like for real most Vietnam films are dark and demeaning, Platoon, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now etc. Now it's Kubrick's turn, director of Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut and The Shining. Even though it's not really a comedy, this is the lightest Vietnam film iv'e seen, and it came from Kubrick, WTF.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes of the film actually start off where you wouldn't expect, boot camp. The first 45 minutes shows R. Lee Ermey, a drill sergeant, train a very unlucky group of trainees into preparation for the Vietnam war, with his tough as nails brute force. Although it takes the perspective of pretty much everybody, the main focus is Private Pyle, who's overweight body causes much dismay and trouble for him, angering the drill sergeant to no end. It greatly shows how much hell boot camp, as well as the war can put someone through.<br/><br/>Afterwards, it jumps into the actual war, which follows a couple of the soldiers from the first half, and introduces some new ones. The characters are very colorful and memorable, and perfectly display the reality of attitude for the war.<br/><br/>Kubrick's vision, in my opinion was to give an ironic twist comparison to boot camp and the war. In the film, it seems as if the boot camp is 10x worse than the war, because a lot of the war is just them hanging out and drinking. There are lots of battle scenes, but still. As I said before, Kubrick's vision wasn't what I thought it was. I guess since everybody else all ready had dark and gloomy Vietnam war films, he figured he'd go another route and knock us off guard with a lighter film. Although it's not necessarily a comedy, it has moments of goofiness that I couldn't believe he added in there.<br/><br/>A lot of people say the first 45 minutes are the only parts worth watching, because they're the rarest ones that we haven't seen before, and I used to agree. Although I do like the first half better, I do appreciate the work with the other half as well, which has some very intense parts that do manage to differ from other battle scenes in other films.<br/><br/>Even though not the heaviest Vietnam war film, it still manages to catch the eye of interest. Out of all the directors of Vietnam films, how did Kubrick's vision become the lightest one? That being said, this is probably the rarest one, with the most unique features in it, which I do appreciate. Definitely worth checking out, even though the first 45 minutes are better, the rest still remains decent, for a decent film."

While the rest is not as spectacularly staged and grabbing as elsewhere, the mentioned moments leave their mark, also thanks to Kubrick's fast pacing and his effective juxtaposing of war-time brutality and carefree music from the Sixties and Seventies. The contrast of Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots are made for Walking'"" against a shocking full stop in the middle of the film alone makes this movie worth the price of admission."

","What a cast, what a story, what a director. This two-part antiwar saga follows Marine recruits through basic training and then takes some of them to Vietnam in 1968, the year of the Tet Offensive. Matthew Modine narrates this gripping tale as a recruit who becomes a war correspondent journalist for the military. There' isn't anything here we haven't seen before, but Kubrick puts his own unique spin on things. I have always preferred the training portion of the movie to the combat portion, but that's me. I have seen equally good if not better war scenes in a dozen other war movies. The highlight of the training segment is the interaction between drill sergeant Lee Ermey and fumbling recruit Vincent D'Onofrio, which ends in unspeakable tragedy.

"bigjc33","9","0","2","7 March 2012"," Full Metal Jacket= LEE ERMY!!!!!!!!
","Full Metal Jacket is honestly Kubrick's best film since 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now, I am very new to Kubrick's work and have never gotten the style (same to Quenten Tarentino). When directors have very distinct styles, its either very compelling to watch or fall apart into disaster. But, thank god Kubrick is not the latter since his style was very creative and innovative and just unique. But, enough of the director how about the movie itself? All I have to say is one word: LEE ERMY!!! Lee Ermy simply played the perfect drill instructor I have ever seen in a movie!! He had the perfect dialouge in this movie and heres the thing: HE IMPROVED ALL HIS LINES!!! Now, if thats not perfect acting. I don't know what is! But, the rest of the cast are fantastic with Pvt. Pyle as a fat blob turned into a psychopath later in the film. In fact, in the first half Pvt. Pyle is focused on more than anybody! Actually, its pretty much the entire part of boot camp thats focused on! This movie depicts boot camp perfectly as privates are given inspections, they run through basic training to become stone cold killers. Im sure many Marines will feel at home when they see this movie. This film had pretty much the greatest dialogue I have ever heard in a war movie! Especially from Sgt. Hartman!!! I could remember all the sinister but true quotes he says!!! ""Pvt. Pyle, Why is your foot locker unlocked?!"" The best part of this movie is that its not your ordinary movie since it pretty much has dark humor all over the place! Now, some people say that the first part starts with a bang while the second part starts to fizzle out. I don't think it killed the movie as I think the second part was as good as the first since it delved into the war. This movie doesn't really have much of a story rather it is conceptual than story-driven. It talks about the de-humanizing effects of war. How humans change from innocent citizens to loyal mean machine killers in the military. ""It was mostly propaganda!"" many people say. I would kinda have to agree on that statement since it does have some anti-war messages in it but the best thing is it is never held in front of your face. It merely implies anti-war scene after scene. Now, the cinematography. WOW! Kubrick has some sense of style when it comes to setting the mood. The color palette he uses to depict a war zone is genius! So do yourself a favor and go see Kubrick's masterpiece maggot!!! P.S. LEE ERMY IS AWESOME!!!!!"

"The-Sarkologist","8","0","1","16 February 2012"," One of the best war films ever made
","This movie is quoted as the best war movie ever made. I am not really so sure about that, but then this movie is, at the time of this writing, thirteen years old, so superior films can (and have) been written in the meantime. Personally, I think Thin Red Line is by far the best war film, but Full Metal Jacket still is a good movie and it does address some interesting points.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket has been divided into two sections: one during training and one during the Vietnam War. It follows a marine named Joker through his basic training and into his experiences at war. It is not psychological to the extent of Thin Red Line, nor does is show the horrors of war, but rather is seems to be far more stabbing towards the attitude of the American military.<br/><br/>There are a few points that need to be raised. Firstly nobody is ever called by their real name. At the beginning, during the introductions, everybody in the platoon is given a name. In fact, we know absolutely nothing about the soldier's prior lives. Everything we know about them is what we see when they are in the army. We are not permitted to see who they really are but rather only allowed to see them as killers. In fact, the whole purpose of training is to turn them into killers and the whole process, as we see, seems to slowly strip the soldiers of their humanity.<br/><br/>The first thing we are allowed to see is the soldiers having their hair shaved. This symbolises their removal from their old lives and entrance into their new lives. They are then babies and as such are put through a naming ceremony, through which their last identifying feature, their name, is destroyed and are now the property of the Marine Corps. The ability to give somebody a name shows superiority over the person, thus by giving them names the Marine Corps becomes their father.<br/><br/>Then we have a look at Private Pile. He is the one character that is picked on the most during the movie. The drill sergeant seems to take an instant disliking to him, and turns the entire platoon onto him. We see the vestiges of humanity vanishing mostly in Pile and the way the platoon treats Pile. By the end of training, Pile has lost all sense of who he is, yet he has not become a cold efficient killer. In fact, he has reached a point where the only way to fulfil his life is to destroy that which has been tormenting him - the Drill Sergeant. It is interesting that Kubrick used this here because we see this more in prison type movies, such as Missing in Action II. Yet by linking Pile's final actions with movies like Missing in Action II, we come to see that the Marine Corps is more than just a job, it is a prison.<br/><br/>The Vietnam scenes basically take what has been developed in training and puts it into the field. We basically see characters that are little more than bloodthirsty animals. Joker still seems to hold onto his humanity, yet he is a trained killer and does not flinch at the sight. In one scene we have a helicopter gunner shooting at something and talking. From our view we think he is simply shooting to waste ammo, until we look out of the window and see unarmed peasants running for cover. When ask how he can kill women and children, his reply is that they take less time to die.<br/><br/>Joker shows this dichotomy, and in fact mentions it to a colonel, by wearing a peace symbol and having the words ""Born to Kill"" inscribed on his helmet. The peace symbol symbolises his humanity, while the words symbolise the beast that he has become by joining the marines.<br/><br/>The final scene is set in a ruined Vietnamese city where the patrol has been pinned down by a sniper. There is only one sniper present, but he is holding back all of the marines. The born killers do not seem to be able to stand up to this one person sitting somewhere in the building. To add further insult, we later discover that the sniper is actually a woman. A woman, who to a marine is little more that a piece of flesh designed to give them pleasure. Through out the movie, the women are practically non-existent, and those that are, are prostitutes. So when the sniper scene arrives, we expect the sniper to be male, and thus it surprises us that the sniper is a woman and has put the fear of God into the hearts of some of the ""toughest"" fighters around. This is another dichotomy of the movie.<br/><br/>In fact, Full Metal Jacket seems to be a movie about dichotomy's. Fighting a war to protect the peace, killing for the sake of peace, and the man being bested by a woman. This is a very intelligent film, and is far more than a simple redneck violence feast."
"RMcDonal440","7","0","2","15 January 2012"," Not Kubrick's best film, the character's were rather complex and hard to understand.
","The film starts with men in a training camp, the Drill Sergeant is hilarious. He just abuses them verbally, very funny. However, you get the kind of idea of the fear these guys had from him. One of the most disturbing scenes, is the one in which a soldier is beaten with bars of soap wrapped in towels by the other trainees.<br/><br/>Not Kubrick's best work, however a very emotional film and has a great meaning. The movie didn't have a lot of battle sequences, even for a war film. Maybe three or four, but that's about it. It's quite a let down to be completely honest, I had such high expectations for this film and I was rather disappointed. For people who like a good sense of story and not a lot of action, this is a movie for you."

"efalba","9","0","1","28 November 2011"," Great Vietnam based movie.
","Stanley Kubricks' take on the lives of those sent to fight in Vietnam is a refreshing one, compared to the usual very serious tone of most war films set during the time. Full Metal Jacket (1987) is a work built on duality's, and conflicting ideas. The film itself is literally separated into two distinct ""halves"" , that cannot help but be compared for their content, something which Kubrick seems to want. Although this may make the film seem disjointed it seems that it is up to us as viewers to connect both halves using the accepted linkage that elapsed time gives us. This allows viewers to create their own version of what happened during the in-between of the two halves of the movie, creating a very immersive atmosphere.<br/><br/>As mentioned the film is based on conflicting ideas, and even loss of identity. We are introduced to Private Joker very early on, and his helmet which has both a peace sign and ""Born to Kill"" on it expresses the concept of dueling ideas so prevalent in the film. The boot camp sequence set in the beginning of the film shows in detail and with great skill the dehumanization and loss of individuality that recruits went through before entering combat. Scenes like the shaving of the heads of the recruits express an air of lost identity, and the constant belittling of emotions done by Sgt. Hartman really work well to drive home how dehumanized recruits needed to be to enter such a senseless war.<br/><br/>The persistence of the human spirit is also something that is dealt with in the film, and in a film about war this helps to give a sense of hope , rather than a sense of pure despair that most war films deal with. Even with the scolding and erasing of personality during boot camp, Private Joker is still true to his name and manages to keep a sense of humor even while in the heart of Vietnam. Near the end of the film, we are shown the still alive body of a young Vietcong girl, shot by the people in Jokers squad after she took down some of the men it. Throughout the scene she is still moving, displaying the physical strength of the human spirit, as apposed to Jokers mental strength concerning his human spirit. Both facets of the undying human element are shown, and very well at that. To a lesser extent, the loss of innocence is also shown in the scene with the Vietcong girl, the brutality of war being reflected as well.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket (1987) does a very good job at clearly expressing ideas concerning social statements. The use of such a powerful setting and situation as the Vietnam War is used well to really make several ideas easily grasped by all viewers. This is why I personally enjoyed the movie, its action sequences being only a plus added on to a great storyline. War is used as a catalyst for films very often, but this common use makes films prone to using the same themes and emotions used in previous films of war, making for uneventful films. Full Metal Jacket (1987) tries its best to use some common themes of war, but spliced with ideas regarding the Un-war side of war, as is the case with the boot camp sequence and the shots of life in Vietnam while off-duty. This spotlight on different aspects of conflict, along with the usual focus on universal elements of war combine to create an all around great movie."
"commiesmasher","Null","0","1","30 August 2011"," Almost Nonexistent narrative, beautifully executed mood
","Like most people, I was impressed with the boot camp portion of the film and love the performances of R Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio, the latter of which creates a character that I think ranks among Buffalo Bill and Norman Bates in terms of being disturbing, and among Bambi and Hellen Keller in terms of being sympathetic. Kubrick uses a sparse amount of dialog in these scenes that isn't Ermey barking orders and insults to his recruits, creating an unnerving, almost lonely and inhuman feeling that is only amplified by the bootcamp sequences disturbing finale. <br/><br/>The second half of the film, taking place in Vietnam, is much less a story than it is a few scenes concerning the same men, highlighting various aspects of the Vietnam War. The meaning and execution of this part of the film has been questioned by many, who criticize it as being disjointed and without any real clear premise, aspects that I view as part of the films strength. After all, wasn't the Vietnam War fought under dubious pretenses, with no clear end in sight and without anybody really knowing what was going on? By giving us these random episodes, Kubrick is giving us a taste of what it must have felt like to fight in the Vietnam War, questionable meaning and all. This is best shown in a scene were members of a platoon are questioned about the war, and none can seem to come to a consensus, much less stay on topic. Nobody has any idea whats going on, why it is happening, and what might happen next. <br/><br/>Overall, those looking for a excellent example of deft direction and superb sets (particularly in the climactic scene) will be pleased, those looking for another Platoon will not."

"ajs-10","10","0","2","18 June 2011"," A classic!!...
","This film was on the TV in a pub I was frequenting last week. Being one of my all time favourites I was hopeful there was going to be a repeat showing. Fortunately the same channel obliged and I was able to record it for a viewing today. For me it is one of the three iconic films about the Vietnam War; the others being Apocalypse Now (1979) and Platoon (1986). I'm sure others will be mentioned in dispatches, but these are the three that have served me best. It is a film of two parts.<br/><br/>The first part deals with the training of a group of U.S. Marine recruits under the watchful eye of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. Among the platoon are characters Hartman calls Private Joker, Private Cowboy and, the focus of much of his scorn, Private Pyle. Unfortunately Private Pyle isn't really cut out to be a Marine and keeps making mistakes. It gets so bad that Hartman begins to take it out on the platoon whenever he screws up. This has a rather disastrous effect on Pyle and it doesn't end well for more than one of them.<br/><br/>With training over the focus now switches to the theatre of action in Vietnam. We follow Private Joker who has become a journalist working for 'Stars and Stripes' magazine as a combat correspondent. He is sent into the combat zone with his photographer, Rafterman, where he joins up with a platoon that contains his old friend Private Cowboy. They are sent into a built up area to clear out any enemy combatants hiding inside. Having been pinned down by a sniper, it's up to Private Cowboy to figure a way out of the situation. I'll leave you hanging there, if you have seen the film, you'll know what happens, if you haven't well, it's just a little incentive for you to give it a look.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick had a great eye for detail and looking at this film you can see that every little detail is perfect. I love the look and the feel of it, even though it is of two very distinct and very different parts. Great performances all round; in particular Matthew Modine as Pvt. Joker, Vincent D'Onofrio (who some of you may know from TV's Law and Order: Criminal Intent) as Pvt. Pyle and R. Lee Ermey as Gny. Sgt. Hartman. Also worthy of note were; Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother, Dorian Harewood as Eightball, Kevyn Major Howard as Rafterman and Arliss Howard as Pvt. Cowboy.<br/><br/>I will admit that I, like most people I know, enjoyed the first part slightly more than the second. I think it's because it has many more memorable, even iconic, scenes in it. But in defence of the second part, it was a hard act to follow! Having said that, the second part does deal with the gritty realities of war and goes some way towards satirising it. I should note there is an excellent soundtrack and the use of various songs throughout is well balanced against the visuals. Over all, a near-perfect war film (IMO) and one which comes very highly recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 9.6/10"
"Red_Identity","Null","0","2","4 June 2011"," Great film...
","Full Metal Jacket is the 5th film from Kubrick that I have seen. It probably ranks in the middle. It is definitely a great film, never once boring, and each of it's halves contrast each other well. The first half is more comedic, but as it goes on it ends in a disturbing and shocking scene. The second half is more combat, but while it has a different tone it is to be noted how amazingly Kubrick is still able to give his trademark signature in different types of films. <br/><br/>There is something hypnotizing about this film, just like every other Kubrick film. What I really love though is that this film sort of stands apart because as style goes it probably is more distinctive than 2001, The Shining, or even Clockwork Orange. Still, great film."

In the military camp, the soldiers prepare themselves for a big big joke, and try to disarm their brain in order to be ready for its sinister absurdity.<br/><br/>Anyone who are interested in knowing how humans can do horrible things to defend a small idea they don't believe in, all that in a sort of bittersweet unconsciousness, should like this movie (Kubrick's majesty on top of that)"
"Leofwine_draca","6","0","3","21 February 2011"," The war from hell and the demon drill sergeant
","Kubrick's dark and unflinching take on the Vietnam War is as hard to stomach as the nature of America's doomed conflict. It's a film split into two halves, with the first undoubtedly the stronger, depicting the dehumanisation of green recruits as they come under the command of a drill sergeant from hell – a perfectly cast R. Lee Ermey, who dined out on his performance here for many years to come (and deservedly so). The second and longer half of the film follows the troops as they engage in a bloody and brutal conflict which culminates in a show-stopping climax.<br/><br/>The film boasts strong performances, particularly Vincent D'Onofrio as the chubby recruit whose good nature is eroded by his brutal treatment at the hands of both Ermey and his fellow conscripts. Kubrick's style is almost unnoticeable as he delivers a documentary-style movie that focuses on intense dialogue and harsh situations rather than pyrotechnics and explosive battle scenes. While this doesn't add much to the war that we didn't already know about (the '80s was crowded with films like this, PLATOON and HAMBURGER HILL) it proves a strong addition to the director's filmography."

","An ultra-violent homage to an era where racism and horrid American ideals are the norm. The age of Vietnam and the fear and pressure on the American psyche. The film focuses on dual acts--both starring the main character who is a deadpan joker named Sgt. Joker. Stanley Kubrick has created an instant classic taking familiar cues from Clockwork Orange and Pulp to create a working satire of the dark age of the American military. Most cannot see the connections between each ""act"" but I can explain it shortly without going through every nuance. The main idea for the film's entirety is that, and I quote; ""though we live in a world of s**t, we are happy to be alive. Because it is better to be alive in s**t than dead in hell(though repeatedly stated that war in fact is hell)."" Act one establishes the brainwashing of the marines and (Pyle) whom eventually kill his commanding officer and himself.This sets up for the Full Metal Jacket symbolism that training is all about being ready to kill as if a gun and NOT going back; something Joker has to realize when he is ""in the s**t"". By the end of the film Joker sees the horrid world for what it is but unlike Pyle, chooses to live in it rather than die for he is not afraid."

","Spoiler<br/><br/>I know it is certainly a big call to call this the best Vietnam movie of all time, but this is probably the most realistic account of it. It is also a great example of Director Kubrick's ability to show humans objectively, not trying to make out whether one is evil or not. Essentially the movie is divided into two parts. The first revolves around the training of marines, and shows the brutality of becoming a soldier. The second part then focuses on the actual battlefield. What is interesting about this film is that it isn't particularly violent, but still extremely powerful. This is about the psychology of War, about how various soldiers deal with a mad- mad situation, and it does a great job of depicting this. Everything about this film is great. The acting is top notch from a cast of mostly unknowns, and the score is used to haunting effect. Camera shots also brilliantly portray the scenes, often from the point of view of the person shooting, to great effect. And if anything can be said to recommend this film, it is that there are many great scenes that you will definitely never forget."
"brando647","9","0","1","8 February 2011"," One of the Greatest Vietnam War Films
","The Vietnam War is one of my favorite topics to see in film, as each director seems to have a different vision on the horrors and mental scarring encountered by the soldiers. Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW will forever by my favorite, but Stanley Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET is a close second. Kubrick's focus in this film appears to be the soldiers themselves, as they're transformed from your average all-American youth into cold-blooded killers gunning for the enemy. The film is divided into two portions. The first introduces us to a group of fresh recruits who are assigned to a volatile drill sergeant determined to turn these maggots into the hardest of Marines. The bulk of his ire falls on a hapless recruit he dubs Gomer Pyle, who's mind is slowly warped by his hostile training environment until it reaches it's limit. The second half of the film follows another of the recruits, Joker, who has become a reporter for Stars & Stripes embedded in Vietnam. Joker is assigned to follow the ""Lusthog Squad"" to Phu Bai and experiences his first real encounter under fire when the squad is pinned down by a sniper.<br/><br/>The first half of this film is fantastic and I became so enthralled with the story of these boot camp recruits that I was shaken when the story suddenly shifted to Vietnam for the final half. The first time I'd seen the film, I was confused. I honestly thought the movie was ending with the conclusion of the Parris Island segment. Instead, the audience is whisked halfway around the world for further exploration into the dehumanization of the soldiers when Joker and his photographer Rafterman are sent into the field where they encounter their first major combat experiences. From the start, Joker's retained his sarcastic cynicism throughout the trials of boot camp until his arrival in Vietnam, but we watch as that naivety is ripped away when he sees the violent horrors of his fellow soldiers are gunned down and he comes face to face with a Vietnamese sniper. Kubrick's movie is about, from what I can gather, the dehumanization required for war and slaps us in the face with the effects it has on a man. It's a powerful film and a glimpse into what soldiers experience in their time serving their nation.<br/><br/>Some of the dialogue doesn't quite sit well (the one instance that stands out in my mind is the banter between Joker and Animal Mother in their first meeting) but a great deal of it is saved by the actors. There is some great talent here on display early in their careers including Matthew Modine (Joker), Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother), Arliss Howard (Cowboy), and a great performance by Vincent D'Onofrio in his first major role as Gomer Pyle. Strangely enough, the best performance in the entire film isn't even from an actor. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor, Hartman, is the most memorable character in the film. He brings his real military experience to the character and explodes in every scene. His obscene motivation has become so embedded in public consciousness that it has been spoofed and referenced everywhere. Ermey and FULL METAL JACKET single-handedly turned me off of ever considering military service as a career, and it's a great film to bring the viewer into the world of a a grunt."

","How could anyone not like this film? Surely they do not know art, for this film is a masterpiece! It had a perfect balance between everything. Most war movies just have some horrible plot (mostly get from point A to point B and do this and that), horrible actors, a crapload of guns that would have never been used in such a situation, and way too much swearing. But no, this film has the PERFECT balance. Amazing effects, accurate weapons, awesome plot. If I could only watch 5 movies for the rest of my live, this would be one of them. The only reason I did not give this a 9/10 or 10/10 is because of the ending. It sort of just ""stopped"". There really was no objective. I mean, they go to training (or whatever you want to call it), head out to war, go through one intense scene, and that's it. But I liked it, it was different. Perfect. Probably one of my most favorite few hours out of my life."

","While this film is quite good it certainly isn't the masterpiece its made out to be while the training camp scenes are funny and well directed the rest isn't engaging or exciting. From the scene when the recruit goes ape and kills himself in the latrine the movie becomes slow-paced and not really that interesting. The only real combat shown in the movie is the sniper who turns out to be a little girl who makes irritating prayers for death after being shot. Besides the main protagonist and the drill instructor the acting is fairly wooden and dry delivering a somewhat weary and tired tone to their lines. I probably was disappointed because i was expecting a masterpiece so don't go into this film hoping for the Citizen Kane of war films."
"Bolesroor","10","0","1","11 June 2009"," Best War Film In Movie History
","Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" is the greatest war film in movie history. The message that ""war is Hell"" is an easy one to convey, from the sprawling ego-driven mess of ""Apocalypse Now"" to the morally-tortured soldiers of ""Platoon."" <br/><br/>But in FMJ Kubrick goes beyond the ""war is hell"" message... he takes us THROUGH that hell, all the way down... And in summing up the Vietnam War he manages to sum up all wars- America itself as a war machine- and reveals in the film's final battle that we've really been fighting ourselves all along.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie is basic training on Parris Island for the Marine recruits... familiar characters emerge: the hard-as-nails drill instructor, the wiseguy, the screw-up... and we watch the sadistic Sgt. Hartman uses a variety of weapons to recondition the men into bloodthirsty drones, awaiting impatiently the order to kill, which according to the Sgt. is their only mission as soldiers. In a telling piece of dialogue that foreshadows the film's final battle, Sgt. Hartman asks what a famous serial killer and Lee Harvey Oswald have in common.<br/><br/>They were both former Marines.<br/><br/>With that in mind we watch Gomer Pyle, broken by Hartman's unrelenting attacks and physical abuse, confronting his ""parents"" in the bathroom, or ""head."" He spares his Mother Pvt. Joker but kills his Father Sgt. Hartman, immediately after Hartman's ominous line: ""Didn't your Mother & Father give you enough attention?!?"" Then Pvt. Pyle kills himself... or does he? <br/><br/>Pyle is ""re-born hard"" as Animal Mother in the second half of the film, the suicide being a bad dream or Animal simply a version of Pyle that managed to complete his basic training; Animal is his ghost, his opposite side of the coin. In the Vietnam sequences we get looks at American soldiers performing for ""Vietnam: The Movie,"" and we meet men completely unrecognizable from their non-war personae, looking only to kill and appear macho in front of their fellow soldiers. The mother, or feminine side, to Pvt. Joker prevents him from becoming the same Neanderthal... his helmet may bear the slogan ""Born To Kill,"" but he wears a peace symbol on his vest.<br/><br/>Finally we come to the end battle, a scene as brilliantly illogical as it is revealing. We have never seen the faces of the soldiers the American troops are fighting... they are only shadows, faceless opposites of the Americans... we are fighting ourselves. As the platoon is drawn in and gunned down by sniper fire a strange coincidence emerges: the troops are caught in a triangular plaza being fired on by a lone gunman from a second story building. If it sounds similar to the JFK assassination, it should... this is Kubrick's re-staging of the key American historical event of the 2oth Century. Just as Oswald was himself a Marine, the troops are being fired on by themselves for all intents and purposes. This is where Kubrick's film works on multiple levels and conveys dual narratives seamlessly.<br/><br/>The sniper turns out to be not a Marine but a lone Vietnamese FEMALE, her hair in bows, similar to the style of a Native American. Is this a message on Kubrick's part about ghosts of enemies slain and victims of America's past? She is finally destroyed, in an intimately cruel act by Pvt. Joker himself who, with the firing of one bullet, both rapes and kills the girl, simultaneously killing the ""female"" side of himself and becoming a true Marine, a true soldier with no identity or independent thought.<br/><br/>The movie ends with the soldiers marching through the burning wreckage of Vietnam, broken men in a ravaged country, singing the theme to ""The Mickey Mouse Club,"" gleefully damned and joined as brothers in arms. Kubrick presents the concept of war as total destruction: of land, culture, life, soul... I wish I had more time to get into my interpretations here. Remember, these are just my impressions... watch the movie and judge for yourself.<br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" is a great film because no other before or since has had the courage to declare war as bloody insanity in which ""winning"" is always impossible. You owe it to yourself to see this.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"
"jzappa","10","0","1","9 June 2009"," More a Showcase of Kubrick's Powerful Instincts Than a Dramatic Narrative of the War
","Standing alone, Full Metal Jacket is yet another showcase of Stanley Kubrick's powerful instincts with gritty compositions, drawing out disturbing qualities in his actors and creating an atmosphere in which each of your senses are not so much drawn in as intensely experienced when applied to it. As one among the group of films in the 1970s and '80s about the Vietnam War, it is about the subject matter, yet the subject is not even close to being as deeply felt by the filmmaker. Oliver Stone brought his own front-line experiences to Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and even Heaven and Earth, all of which engage an audience in emotional hurricanes. Francis Ford Coppola achieved the nightmarish effect of war in Apocalypse Now because he subjected himself to such hurricanes in his own nightmarish experience of making the film; he made ruthless, often amoral decisions which largely impacted many of that movie's most affecting images. It's a great film that does not want you to like it. Full Metal Jacket suffers at the hand of what makes most of Kubrick's work great, which is his reasonable detachment from, his automatic response to the material.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket has by many young men been memorialized as a favorite, on account of its vividly foremost performances by R. Lee Ermey, as the drill commander who barks more catchy one-liners than one would imagine truly incites fear, and Vincent D'Onofrio, who with serene innocence reacts understandably to such laughable quips, which makes him a target from day one, a benign, overweight airhead whose metamorphosis is a masterpiece of horror.<br/><br/>There are many scenes in the latter half of this chillingly dry film that seem more theatrical than cinematic, or documentary-like. The first act, easily the most popular among the movie's myriad fans, is promising because it intimately follows a select few faces in a ruthlessly strict boot camp. We are seeing an aspect not much before seen, to markedly memorable, not to mention extensively quotable, effect. What comes later, in the combat zones leading toward and during the 1967 Tet Offensive, sees the boot camp segment as a tough first act to follow. Scenes of the focal platoon's reflections on their casualties, sadly ignorant views on the war, lounging banter, are at times robotically scripted, stiffly physicalized.<br/><br/>The movie's final arrangement, in which our platoon is trapped in a desolate zone with an unseen sniper, is brilliant, however. They are projecting every American fear generated by the upending preoccupation with not knowing what against which they must defend themselves. When they finally discover the shooter, point blank, the augmentation and diminishment of the characters who've made it thus far depend on whether or not they realize how little they truly did know before that moment. Even the central character, if one could call him that, does not seem to know just how many volumes it speaks."

","This film is really 2 films. The first is a depiction of Marines Basic Training at Paris Island. The second is a depiction of Vietnam. The only real connection is Joker between the 2 parts. Otherwise this is really 2 separate films.<br/><br/>Basic training creates 4 strong characters and then kills two of them at the end of it. The second half keeps Joker & sets up a couple of strong leads. When you compare this film to what other film makers were making in 1987, it is a good film. When you compare it to other Stanley Kubrick films, it is a weaker film. Even Kubicks weaker films are better than most.<br/><br/>If your a military person looking for accuracy, this is Kubick. Kubrick is a story teller, not into reality. If you don't think so, don't forget his best films like Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, and The Shining are all fiction or Science Fiction films. Considering their brilliance, why would you expect accuracy here. What this film does is tell two good stories and entertain the audience.<br/><br/>Kudos to the choices of rock songs for the sound track. The music choices are outstanding. As far as the story, the first half ending is rather predictable. The reason that this film does not measure up to Kubricks best is that it goes from the first half to the second with no real connection.<br/><br/>A warning, this is not for younger children as the language in the first half really is salty. A weaker Kubrick film but this film does have some brilliant flashes."

","A look at a few months in the life of a group of marines from boot camp to the battle front in Vietnam. Kubrick's depiction of basic training is riveting, perhaps the best ever put on film, as the tension builds slowly but surely. In fact, these camp scenes are so good that once the action shifts to the war zone, it is somewhat of a letdown, as the film flounders aimlessly for a while. However, it then finishes with a bang. Kubrick's presentation of platoon life is far more interesting than what Oliver Stone offered in ""Platoon"" the previous year. Modine heads a good cast of young actors. Ermey is excellent as the drill instructor."

The first half runs a lot more like a normal movie does, showing a bit of character development (although in the case of private pyle, for the worse).<br/><br/>Anyway, the real statement that the film wants to make is in the second half. It's not a new message, in fact it's quite overdone, but I think FMJ does it the best of any film I've seen so far. The ending intentionally is totally anticlimactic, which I love.

I am absolutely blown away by this amazing piece of cinema.<br/><br/>The story starts off comedic and heads in that direction for a little while but then gets dramatic almost immediately. There is plenty of action and suspense. This movie, like most great films is a deep character study. The great acting adds so much to this. There is honestly virtually nothing wrong with this movie and it is a new favorite of mine. Stanley Kubrick was the man! <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick fans will definitely enjoy this movie but I think everyone else will also.

","I have long loved Kubrick's works, whether it's the post-apocalyptic Dr. Strangelove or the wondrously bewildering A Clockwork Orange, and I have always liked war films. What better than Full Metal Jacket than for me? Answer: nothing. Full Metal Jacket follows the journey of Private Joker and other fellow soldiers as they survive PT (physical training) and then the big one: 'Nam itself. Every character is unique and has been masterfully crafted emotionally by Kubrick. None of the characters ever felt emotionally detached or cliché', with the exception of Animal Mother, who was your typical tough-as-nails soldier who carries around a machine gun meant to be used as an emplaced turret, but even he feels like he's simply trying to act tough in front of his fellow soldiers. The story is very good as well, and doesn't feel like a cliché' 'Nam movie, as it constantly throws tiny surprises and plot twists that mix it up and keep it from feeling old and tired. So, despite loving every aspect of the movie, you must be scratching your head wondering, ""Why didn't he give it a 10 if he loved every aspect than?"" Here's why: why the film is artistically a masterpiece and deserves to be watched by anybody and everybody, it doesn't bring anything truly new or revolutionary to the table. So, if your looking for a war movie, this should DEFINITELY be your next pick. I would also recommend picking this movie up along with Across the Universe, so you get a great point of view of both sides of the war, civilian and military. Oh, and while Across the Universe would be alright for any teen to watch, I wouldn't recommend letting the kiddies see Full Metal Jacket, as it has gratuitous language and sexual references. Why are you still reading this? Go watch FMJ!!!!!"
"evanston_dad","Null","0","5","20 June 2008"," Kubrick Takes Us Through Boot Camp
","Stanley Kubrick jumped on the Vietnam band wagon that was raging in the mid-1980s and delivered this schizophrenic movie. The first half is about the brainwashing of a platoon of draftees during boot camp led by perhaps the most memorable screen drill sergeant in history; the second half follows this platoon as they head off into the war. The first half is fascinating and feels distinctly like a Kubrick film; the second half feels like a hundred other combat films.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with ""Full Metal Jacket"" is that it was made too late. By the time Kubrick got around to this, Francis Ford Coppola had long since given us ""Apocalypse Now"" and Michael Cimino ""The Deer Hunter."" Those two movies alone contain so much iconic imagery about Vietnam (Coppola's especially), that no Vietnam film since has shown us something we haven't seen before. That's why the first half of Kubrick's film is so good -- it portrays a part of the war that frequently gets left out, the deliberate dehumanization that begins while recruits are still safely on American soil. The film deflates after the boot camp sequences and never totally recovers.<br/><br/>But still, this IS a Kubrick film after all, and it's still very good, despite its flaws. It's certainly way better than the Vietnam film from the 80s that everyone remembers most, Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"".<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","Now that we can make much more detailed and informed reflections of the regrettable and controversial American involvement in the Vietnam war. The conspiracy theories now wear thin and the Communist regime has brought economic misery but stability to contemporary Vietnam. This film opens with the brutality involved in training marines for this war from the view of Private Joker (Mathew Modine) especially on the unfortunate obese Pvt Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) whose countenance has what appears to be a permanent grin. Pvt Pyle suffers a total breakdown and shoots his training Sergeant. These events brought focus on the brutal and dehumanising training on young unfortunate men who were drafted rather than enlisting.<br/><br/>The second part of the film takes us to the streets of war torn Vietnam where the brutality of of some American soldiers is highlighted first on a tiny Vietnamese prostitute and then a tiny Female Viet Cong sniper who is finally gunned down after cutting down some troops. The plight of Vietnamese women is highlighted in these two scenes.<br/><br/>There have been many clichés made about contemporary war films and its now stupid and boring to get caught up in these eloquent phrases about the duality of man and futility of war. Historical perspectives of war are usually made with a political stance in mind and this film tends to reinforce the darker aspects of this tragic conflict.<br/><br/>This film does not glorify American soldiers and their courage as does World war 2 films but examines the moral dilemma's involved in serving your country.<br/><br/>Kubrick's masterful production values make this a very confronting film and has left America with an important reminder that foreign military intervention is thwart with moral danger.<br/><br/>Truly one of the great Vietnam war films along with ""Deer Hunter"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"", ""Heaven and Earth"", ""Escape Dawn"" and ""Born on the 4th July"".<br/><br/>A great example if the film mastery of the greatest of them all STANLEY KUBRICK."

","Full Metal Jacket is a staggering study of war, and what war can do to such a simple, and what seems-to-be normal man. It is an absolute masterpiece, and deserves nothing less than a 10/10.<br/><br/>The bootcamp (AKA: First Part) part of Full Metal Jacket is nothing less than masterful. Ronald Lee Ermey's performance as Gunnery sgt. Hartman is absolutely jaw dropping. I have no more words to explain how great of a job he did. It's funny that originally hired as a technical adviser, and ended up in one of the greatest roles ever performed by a human being.<br/><br/>Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt. ""Gomer Pyle"" displays a wonder of a performance as well. Pvt. Pyle, who throughout the film is picked on and pushed to his emotional limits, is eventually turned into a madman. The looks on his face during the movie just send chills down your back. His performance was just absolutely phenomenal. This movie, easily when it comes to acting is one of the 10 greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>Overall, Full Metal Jacket is an amazing look into the horrors of war.

"slokes","6","0","2","14 May 2008"," Hardball World
","The great thing about Stanley Kubrick is that there is no mistaking a movie of his, however diverse they are from one another, as a movie by any other director.<br/><br/>The problem with his films, oftentimes, is the same thing. Case in point: ""Full Metal Jacket"".<br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" is the last movie Kubrick made that wasn't ""Eyes Wide Shut"", one big reason I think it has such a strong cheering section on this board. Yes, it's intense, singular, and full of great quotes. It's also threadbare plot-wise and structurally unbalanced, full of one-dimensional performances and an overabundance of Kubrick's trademark shots.<br/><br/>Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine) is the central character, who we follow on his journey from Parris Island to Hue City, Vietnam, where during the Tet Offensive he becomes ""born-again hard"" and acquires the much-storied quality known as ""the 1,000-yard stare.""<br/><br/>I like this film, just not a lot. It's what I'd call a Kubrick problem picture much like his ""Barry Lyndon"", a good movie of entirely different character that carries much of the same pedantic weight. I can't really get into ""Full Metal Jacket"", neither Modine nor anyone else garners my sympathy or lasting interest, but its exciting and arresting in its refusal to play by the rules of a Vietnam war film. In ""The Deer Hunter"" or ""Platoon"", for example, the loss of innocence is a central theme. Here it's clear innocence was lost long before these guys arrived in 'Nam.<br/><br/>For many people, it's the first 45 minutes that make this film great, the boot camp section with the bullying drill instructor Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey) and his rounding on fragile conscript Pvt. Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), a.k.a. Gomer Pyle. ""My orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps,"" Hartmann explains at the outset, but his treatment of Pyle suggests a darker motive.<br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" is a dark film all the way, and for me, the middle section is the part worth watching, in which we discover the war in Joker's eyes, in a series of short, pungent vignettes taken from Michael Herr's twisted and brilliant war memoir ""Dispatches"": ""The dead have been covered with lime. The dead know only one thing - it is better to be alive.""<br/><br/>Kubrick's camera ODs on carnage, emotional and physical, making us feel as deep in that world of excrement as poor Private Pyle. The unrelenting heaviness of tone brings one to the point where you expect a bigger payoff in the end than you actually get. Joker loses some comrades, gets his stare, and marches on to the tune of the Mickey Mouse Club, a scene that strives for more irony than it actually delivers.<br/><br/>But Kubrick's movie is hard where it needs to be, aided much by the vicious comic stylings of Ermey, the subdued inventiveness of set designer Anton Furst (you try dressing England into a jungly war zone), and a terrific musical score of sardonically placed AM pop. It's a film worth having, but I think if Kubrick had bestowed his talent and vision on a couple of other projects in the last 20 years of his life, this movie wouldn't enjoy the somewhat bloated reputation it has today."

","This movie is living proof that the now-dead Stanley Kubrick left the earth too soon. Full Metal Jacket is the greatest army movie of all time and actors like R. Lee Ermey, Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio are the perfect additions. What makes this so perfect is that the movie looks at the basic training component of the army life and then produces a pretty good segway into the actual wartime situation. I don't know of any other director that did it that way (it also had its risks because Kubrick had to ensure some kind of transfer to the war scenes). He executed it perfectly but what I like most about it was Modine and his character. He's obviously built for the army life, yet is military occupation is journalist. Gomer Pyle proved his worth with a loaded rifle but he took things a little too far. The other thing about Kubrick's direction is that everything was somewhere between good and perfect. Ermey's character was hilarious in the opening scenes where he's yelling at the recruits and I couldn't think of any other way to open up. But the most interesting part was how he was able to use a little less than half the movie to show what the recruits' life was like on the training base in South Carolina then make the transformation to Vietnam. The only strange thing here is that when the recruits are in Vietnam, Joker moves up to the rank of Sergeant, which is not possible immediately after basic."

","In my opinion, the best war film ever made, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jackets brilliantly captures the horrors, ferocity, chaos and most essentially the realism of the Vietnam War. What makes it so great is not just the brilliant, quotable dialogue containing some of the best, most insulting lines in film history or the great characters and acting but the direction and mise-en- scene. Kubrick shows what a perfectionist he is by filling his wide angle-frame with every possible detail.The camera hardly remains still, as we pan and track continuously between incident. The scenes are long and interspersed with cross-cutting and sudden bursts of reaction shots. It is what highlights Kubrick as possibly the greatest American director of all-time and his eye for composition and character development is stunning.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Full Metal Jacket has been an underrated film at times, but its good that its in the top 250 movies. Full Metal Jacket is an Anti-War, as well as an Anti-Vietnam film and shows Kubrick talent and politics.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is a movie in two halves, first on boot-camp and the dehumanising of recruits and the second in Vietnam, looking at Private/Sergeant Joker's (Michael Modine) career as a military journalist, the Tet Offensive and the Battle of Hue. The first half looks at how recruits were trained, and how Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) was bullied by his Drill Sergeant (R. Lee Ermey) and other recruit to point he is driven to looking his mind, murders and before committing suicide. The second half shows that the US army was fairly hopeless during the war, destroying Vietnamese towns and killing and exploiting or killing the locals. A few women were prostituting themselves to American soldiers. At the end of the film it is shown that a 12-year-old girl was a sniper and ends up getting killed. Some people have argued that Full Metal Jacket was a neutral film: however it is obvious that its an Anti-War film.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is the best, but the second half is still very good compared to other films. The opening scene was a classic bit of cinema and R. Lee Ermey does steal the show with his performance. A little be of trivia is that Ermey was hired to be an adviser to the person who would play the Drill Sergeant. However Kubrick saw a video of him shouting 15 minutes worth of insults without stopping or repeating himself, so Kubrick casted him in the role. The Drill Sergeant is shown to be a religious and sadist, but a stereotype. During this part of the film shows how the human soul is destroyed by the training and how recruits become heartless beings. The second half shows how the war was fought and that soldiers were at times heartless. Full Metal Jacket takes a different approach to other Vietnam films by showing a urban battle, and how brutal an affair it was.<br/><br/>The film has some great dark comedy in it, a trait of Kubrick, shown in Dr. Strangelove, Lolita and A Clockwork Orange. The Drill Sergeant was the best at it and comes up with some classic film quotes. Joker was also a good comedic character and other characters do come up with witty comments. Kubrick's anti-war politics is show and Full Metal Jacket shows how destructive the Vietnam war was on the country. Kubrick's other anti-war films were Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove.<br/><br/>The film is excellent, the only two problems what the second half being a little weaker and that it was filmed in England, and therefore doesn't have quite the same feel to other Vietnam films.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is Kubrick classic and a must see for film lovers."

","I absolutely love this movie! Having been in the military, the basic training scenes really spoke to me. I think everyone who's ever been through basic training knew that one guy in their barracks who was just like Private Pyle. And from the many times I've watched this movie, I absolutely love laughing at Pyle's antics while getting chewed out by the D.I.<br/><br/>But aside from my personal feelings for this movie, it is a deep, insightful and oftentimes frightening look into the characters going through 1960's Marine basic training & being sent off to Vietnam. The characters, while you never really learn a lot about them, are by no means two-dimensional. You get all the emotion from them and they come off as real people.<br/><br/>I could have lived with the movie just dealing with Private Joker going through boot camp, but the second half of the movie portraying his stint in Vietnam is just another window into his character.<br/><br/>If you love Vietnam war movies, this is definitely a must see.

","It's one of the best war movies ever made, and the best one I had ever seen. The movie is divided in two parts. In the first one, a young man with alias Joker is taken to the army. With a group of other youngsters, he suffers tortures from general Hartman. Hartman gives stigmatizing alias for would-be marines. There is one fat and weak man, Private Pyle, in group, so Hartman terrorizes him. When he founds additional food in Pyle's bag, he decides that from that time Pyle won't be punished, but all members of the group will suffer instead of him. His friends of fate are angry with Pyle, so they beat up him. Pyle goes mad, kills general Hartman and himself. <br/><br/>In the second part of the movie, we can see the events in Vietnam. This part tells us the story from two sides: humanity's and soldiers. Everywhere around the battles there are a lot of cameramen and journalists. They take interviews with soldiers. We can see hard fighting man, going for the victory. But it's humanity's side of the story. Through soldiers' eyes, the war is brutal, full of violence. We can see Vietnamese prostitutes, who prostitute for a few cents. We can see soldiers' fear, too. In the beginning they want to fight, but when the war proceeds, they start fearing. <br/><br/>General Hartman wants to dehumanize youngsters, this shows Joker's character. When the movie proceeds, we can observe the changing of it. Truly, it shows the main idea of the movie, too. At the beginning of the training, Joker is a simple youngster. He helps for Pyle, or at least he isn't angry of a fat man. But because of Hartman's dehumanizing 'training', Joker becomes cruel. When all group members beat up Pyle, Joker joins them. When we see this character at war, we can be shocked by his brass talks and cruel actions. But this isn't all. At the end of the movie, because of the fear, he becomes wiser.

","War is hell, but Stanley Kubrick let us know that boot camp wasn't much better either. Following marine Private Joker (Matthew Modie) through boot camp and then to the Vietnam war itself, Jacket looks at the humiliating dehumanisation of good American boys who learn a terrifyingly cold mantra, kill, kill and kill. Released along with a string of Vietnam movies in the 1980s, Full Metal Jacket stands out as one of the most disturbing and powerful simply because it shows troops who actually enjoy fighting the war. The performances, particularly those of Vincent D'Onofrio as Gomer Pyle and R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor from hell, are brilliant, the action sequences are breathtakingly realistic, and we can always rely on Stan to deliver some superb direction. The film also deserves good credit for its great and brilliantly juxtaposed soundtrack, and for being daringly truthful as to why so many men wanted to risk their lives in Vietnam. While the final act may drag on for a bit, and if you are an impatient viewer than their is always a chance of getting unnerved by Kubricks films, these faults can be forgiven for such a brilliant film otherwise. Easily on of the greatest war movies ever made."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","10","0","2","23 February 2008"," Kubrick returns to war
","Upon viewing Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" for the third time, and first time with a more critical approach, I found that this isn't a movie about war as much as it is about soldiers and the military mind. The war in pretty much incidental. It is just there because a movie about soldiers without some mention of war would be incomplete: it is was soldiers are meant for. It is what they are prepared and trained for. Then when the time comes and war starts, the soldiers go to work for better or worse.<br/><br/>This film doesn't glorify war nor does it really vilify it. War is horrible, no question about it. Many good people die, though many end up living. Many bad people die, though many end up living. Many friendships are broken due to loss, though many are formed through camaraderie. As I said before, the film is about the soldiers and upon viewing this film you can see what soldiers have to do as a part of their job. Thus, it is no mistake that the ever perfectionist director Stanley Kubrick chose Vietnam as his film's war-zone. It was an enormously complex era in the US military with many people for the war and many against. It was also a time when military training was different then it is now and the Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is an embodiment of that past. He cannot be vilified since he does what he was trained to do and does it out of necessity. Same with all the other soldiers, thus it is not the soldiers who should be blamed. It's the upper brass who deserve blame and Kubrick leaves them out of the film probably since he wasn't trying to point fingers at anyone or anything. Even with films like 'A Clockwark Orange' it is apparent that Kubrick would rather present the problem from many sides and then let his own audience engage in the analysis. He was director who engaged his audience and he did it very well.<br/><br/>What he was trying to say was an anti-war message, but only in part. The bulk of the matter at hand is that you give credit where credit is due and credit is due when work has been done. And who does the work, the real tough and dirty work in a war? The soldiers, and they go through hell doing it. Some don't make it even out of basic training let alone war. Thus, it is a good idea to support your troops, but question the war. --- 9/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence and profanity. Ages 13+"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","2","13 February 2008"," War film achieves high art with ""Jacket""
","You wouldn't expect someone with Kubrick's vision to tackle something as gritty and human as war, but Kubrick does and the result is a brilliantly written and carefully crafted Vietnam War film that captures better than any war film the true nature of dehumanization of both enemy and soldier.<br/><br/>In its basic form, ""Full Metal Jacket"" has a two-part structure, one in basic training and one abroad during the Tet Offensive, with the through line being Matthew Modine's character Private Joker as he wrestles with the true nature of what it is he has gotten himself into. In the beginning he establishes himself as ""Joker"" and says he was ""born to kill"" a message with truly meaningful irony as he wears that statement on his helmet in the film's second half. This is truly Joker's story and it is through him we understand Kubrick's message.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, however, is where the plot tends to revolve, specifically in the beginning. Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) gives a truly unforgettable performance as he simply drills the recruits for the bulk of this section. You start to feel like he's giving you orders and screaming profanities at you because of how much he dominates the beginning of the film. The conflict arises when recruit nicknamed Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) simply can't keep up, failing at everything and Hartman never eases off until Pyle conforms to the idea of being a killing machine. This antagonistic relationship speaks to war on the most basic level and Kubrick does an incredible job portraying that.<br/><br/>The screenplay is out of this world, especially the lines written for Sgt. Hartman, and the directing is incredibly solid. Kubrick has made a war film in which full out action sequences are immaterial and yet we are still entertained and intrigued. There are times where the film gets a bit slow and redundant, but it's definitely done to focus on the psychological part of war, not the action part."

","Stanley Kubrick's works can be a little heavy at times and that is mainly due to his focus on dehumanisation. So if you are a more sensitive and purist type, you may be end up sitting through films like this.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is basically divided into two parts. The training and the war itself. The Paris Island section of the film is deeply visceral, well paced, well plotted and capped off with supreme acting.<br/><br/>However, the second section almost seems to be a different film altogether. The action again is terrific, plotting is strong as is the tension and sorrow of the war itself. However, after the powerhouse first section, the second section tends to lag. I think that ultimately, the first section was simply too strong rather than the second section being too weak and the change of atmosphere ever so slightly lets it down and costs it a star."
"tomimt","8","0","2","17 December 2007"," War. Ain't it hell?
","I was thinking of naming my review as ""Morality of man"" or something else pseudo intellectual like that, but then again the movie itself has a perfect line to describe itself, right on the scene when a helicopter gunner is shooting running women in the rice field and Joker (Matthew Modine) asks if how can he kill women and children. Then man answers something in line ""You just gotta aim lower. War, ain't it hell?"".<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is clearly an antiwar statement. It doesn't portray war as noble, nor does it do that to the soldiers either. There's no sugarcoating in the portraying of what the soldiers do: they kill. War is something, that brings out the worst in each man, no matter how good you think you are, you will change for the rest of your life. After all, the soldiers really don't win, they loose no matter which side wins.<br/><br/>FMJ is clearly divided in two parts, in three if you count in the part, in which Joker goes to the field to do his war reporting. The first part shows how the boys are turned into killing machines, who feel no pity. This first part is the battle between Gunnery sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Eremy) and private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), who is a bit slow man, who keeps ending in trouble because of that and his obesity. This boils down to the disciplinary action taken by the rest of the privates, who are fed up being punished of his doings. There is no mercy. But it will get more merciless, just in a bigger scale.<br/><br/>The second part is the Vietnam. Joker is assigned to war press and soon he is sent to do reports from the field. This is the turning point for him, as he finally realises what it all is about. Hardcore, as his team mates say, when he fires a bullet in the head of a wounded sniper. Killing someone up close is harder than doing that from a chopper, where you don't see they fearful eyes of the one you are going to kill.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket is basically two movies in one. Lesser director than Kubrick would have done only one half and ended there, but Kubrick shows what happens after the graduation. It's not just hardcore training done by sergeant Hartman, it's the end results of that training as well. But in the end, no matter how hardcore you are, no matter how you were trained, you will be scared when looking in the barrel. You are scared and you just want to get away.<br/><br/>Even though FMJ is one of the best war movies I've seen, there still is a couple of segments and couple of things I don't like about it. But those things are just personal things, nothing that will change the fact, that this is a good movie. For instance I didn't like the way Modine delivered his narrative lines, but in the end it doesn't take away a thing of the solidity of the movie. The other problem is, that I don't feel the Vietnam part is tight enough. When compared to the training part, Vietnam is full of air, but then again Kubrick was trying to portray how it wasn't all action, there was serenity as well, be it that came from between the thighs of a Vietnamese hooker.<br/><br/>For a summary Full Metal Jacket is a great war movie. It is the one people should really see."
"zpzjones","9","0","2","26 September 2007"," comments the first 1/2 of the film. the best DI film to date but nevertheless has small flaws
","the first part of the movie is very well done and for the most part accurate as to the induction of raw recruits to the U.S. Marine Corps Depot Parris Island South Carolina. My only discrepancy with the boot camp part of the film is that we didn't see nearly any interaction of the assisstant DIs' to Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann(played by the great Lee Ermey) or to the GIs themselves. We got brief glimpses of the two assisstant DIs' to Hartmann. Once when Hartmann first appears on the screen and introduces himself to the recruits in the barracks. And next during lights-on reveille at the beginning of the ""...do you believe in the Virgin Mary"" sequence. We didn't even see them during the great scenes shot on the Obstacle Course. duh!! Those assisstant DIs are there for a reason. To assist Hartmann in the day-to-day training of the recruits. To take over when Hartmann has to be away on say family business(it's not stated in the film whether Hartmann has wife & family). The primary DI cannot do everything, that's why he has assistant DIs to aid and abet him. And the company commander, what of him? I went through Army boot camp in the mid 1980s. Hartmann in the film calls himself the senior DI. In the Army the senior DI is the top most DI of the Company which usually consists of four platoons. He, along with the Company commander, administers to all the primary & assisstant DIs' and has hands-on or limited interaction with the recruits. I don't know if this is a goof up on Kubricks part or that the Marines order of command is different and was different during the Vietnam era. Aside from the assisstant DI business, the basic training sequences are very authentic as I can say having been in the service and even though I went through in the 1980s and this film takes place at Parris Island in 1968, the general atmosphere depicted in this film would've been similar in both eras.<br/><br/>R Lee Ermey, Matthew Modine, Vincent D'onofrio, Arliss Howard and the rest of the cast really present to that section of the film going audience who've never worn the uniform of their country, a realistic peek into the initiation process of being in the U.S. Marines. Not everything could possibly be shown in a two hour movie but make no mistake the general gist of what you're going to encounter if you decide to join the Marines or even the Army is depicted very well here. 9 out of 10."

","Who is the enemy in war? What if it's somebody completely unexpected? What if it's us?<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrik's incomparable, eye glazing, and sometimes too funny for its subject matter movie entitled ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) expands on the theme of the enemy in war. Co-written by Michael Herr, author of ""Dispatches"" (a memoir of a combat correspondent), the film watches like a war novel. Composed of choppy scenes that pick up like rounds of fire and usually end with a message hidden beneath a seemingly meaningless line such as, ""You know there's not a single horse in the entire country of Vietnam? There's definitely something wrong with that,"" the movie connects with even the biggest fanatics of classic war literature, putting you in the action through its cinematography just as a writer would with his voice or style. <br/><br/>Like the protagonist, Private Joker (Matthew Modine), who wears a peace button on his flak jacket and a helmet inscribed with the phrase, ""Born to kill,"" claiming that it ""suggest something about the duality of man,"" the movie is also divided into two parts. The first half takes place in an American boot camp where Private Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), an overweight and clearly misplaced product of the draft, takes verbal and physical beatings from Gny. Sgt. Hartman (Lee Ermey) and his bunkmates. Although Joker tries to help Pyle, the constant harassment is too much too bear. <br/><br/>The movie then shifts to Vietnam where Joker, now a combat correspondent (like Herr) reports on the war with a rifle in one hand and a pen in the other. Sitting on the remains of a concrete building with a squad of marines, Joker is confronted by an action figural GI. ""This is his party,"" he says, removing a cover from the face of the person sitting next to him only to reveal a dead seventeen year- old North Vietnamese corporal. ""He is the guest of honor,"" he continues. ""Today is his birthday."" <br/><br/>It hurts to laugh. <br/><br/>The movie examines the way we dehumanize the enemy in war. We call them ""Dinks"" or ""Charlie"" so that we can convince ourselves that we are fighting anything but a human being. But as depicted in the end of the movie (don't worry, I won't spoil it), the enemy could truly be anybody. And that includes us. We are trained to deface the enemy so that we can kill them without remorse. We strip them of all their humanity while trying to maintain our own. Like Joker we are divided human beings. We are divided between wanting to help Pvt. Pyle load his gun so that he avoids more ridicule and wanting to beat the living s*** out of him with a towel. <br/><br/>""Full Metal Jacket"" examines the issue of creating our enemies, doing so in a way that is unprecedented by any other war movie. By putting us, the viewer, through boot camp and then dropping us into combat, we experience dehumanization. But that can only last so long. And indeed, in the movie, it lasts only until the end. <br/><br/>What ""Full Metal Jacket"" lacks in plot, it makes up for in its script. Its realistic representation of war as long periods of boredom interspersed with moments of horrific excitement is enough to make you fearful of another draft. The images of the glazed over look of soldiers attack your insides like a piece of shrapnel to the gut. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a remarkable movie that examines humanity during a brutally inhumane time."

","A young man (Private Joker) joins the military as a journalist. He follows the other men through basic training, which is brutal and degrading. After being sent to Vietnam, things seem to only get worse, if such a thing is possible.<br/><br/>This is a break-out films for Vincent D'Onofrio, who plays the plump Pvt. Pyle. He's almost unrecognizable as such a slobby character, who plays a crucial role in here. And, of course, this is the role that made R. Lee Ermey famous, as Gny. Sgt. Hartman. Who can picture Ermey without seeing him yelling at new recruits, telling them how worthless they are? <br/><br/>I have always had mixed feelings on this film. On one hand, I have tried to watch it a few times in the past and failed to finish it because it seems to lose a lot of momentum after the basic training part. But being older and watching it again, I get a much fuller sense of this film's beauty. It's a visual wonder (what else from Kubrick?), but more importantly a great exposition of the war, and the dehumanizing effects of war in general.<br/><br/>I did not realize the film was released in 1987. I had always figured it was a late 1970s or early 1980s film due to the way they captured the time period so well. So I commend them on that. And there's no pulling punches: dead Vietnamese, prostitution, suicide. This film tells the gritty details. Other films about Vietnam are good: ""Casualties of War"" is alright and ""Platoon"" is still classic, but I think it's more or less undisputed that ""Full Metal Jacket"" is the clincher. (I've never been a fan of ""Apocalypse Now"", but maybe it's time for me to revisit that one, too.) <br/><br/>I title this review one of Kubrick's most celebrated rather than one of his best, simply because of personal preference. I've always been drawn more to ""A Clockwork Orange"", and I love ""Lolita"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"". ""Full Metal Jacket"" just never carried the same weight with me, though I won't deny it has its place in his long list of achievements.<br/><br/>Basically, if you haven't seen this film, it's a must-see. It routinely makes it on ""top 100"" lists for films, and with good reason. If you really hate war films, maybe you should steer clear, but the fact remains it's a beautiful piece regardless of the focus. It's inspiration alone (in other films, television and even music) make it something any consumer of modern culture should experience."

","Well, there is only one movie that can rival that of ""Full Metal Jacket."" That is ""The Green Berets"". But ""Full Metal Jacket"" is better than the former because ""The Green Berets"" was a little bit too grainy in depicting the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>Well, the example of the deception of the Vietnamese in the Tet cease-fire scene in ""Full Metal Jacket"" was just only one of the famous stories in the so-called ugly war America had with Vietnam. As the Vietnamese fireworks started to go off outside the U.S. Marines base at Da Nang in honor of Tet New Year, the Marine soldiers had thought that it would be a relief that the only sounds of war were pyrotechnics and that's all. But it was only short-lived.<br/><br/>Then the Marines recognized that there was two very big booms. What saved their lives was that the booms would have been from the largest firecracker or fireworks device but when the lights flickered on and off in the barracks, the marines knew that the cease-fire on Tet was a ugly deception. The soldiers ran out of the barracks, heavily armed, and ran into the gun holes as two more explosions hit the base (probably the explosions are from Saiper rockets). Then they see an enemy truck trying to ram into the main gate of base. The truck does hit the gate and blows up (because it was loaded with explosives)...and then a platoon of Vietnamese soldiers (I think this was about 100 soldiers) followed. The Marine soldiers were able to gun them all down before the enemy could do further damage.<br/><br/>No wonder the Tet cease-fire caused the Vietnam War to be even uglier than the U.S. involvement in the Korean War.<br/><br/>There was one little scene that I liked that reminded me of what was happening in Iraq. In one area of war-torn Vietnam, a Marine named Craze was finding, across damaged buildings. a toy doll on top of a heap of debris. Craze thinks that the doll could be his token of hope in an war that America would never win. He touches the hand of the doll and then... BOOM! Craze is pushed back hard and falls to the ground, getting the full brunt of the explosive blast at point-blank range. The other Marines try to help Craze but it is too late. Then the other Marine says ""Craze has been hit....booby-trap."" Such an explosion reminds me of the roadside bombs and explosively-formed projectiles that are currently happening in Iraq.<br/><br/>But the sniper shooting, where a lady Vietnamese soldier sprayed deadly bullets on two of the over 10 people of the U.S. platoon out of Parris Island, reminds me quickly of the 1966 shooting in the University of Texas, where the Parris Island USMC drill sergeant mentions over about 200 Parris Island ""maggots"", as the sergeant calls them. The sniper shooting dwarfs the booby-trap killing of Craze.<br/><br/>The sniper then manages to kill one of the platoon's radio man before the rest of the platoon realize that there is only one thing to do...neutralize the sniper. As day turned into night, they throw smoke grenades and head inside one of the dilapidated buildings, and then, the sniper comes out, with her automatic weapon. The first Marine sees the sniper and gets ready to shoot but it will be all for not as a second Marine shoots the lady soldier down to the ground, wounding her.<br/><br/>The platoon leader and the rest of the squad see that they accomplished the mission, saying ""We've got the sniper!"". But then, a conflict emerges---should the platoon kill the soldier that was already wounded and disarmed, or should she be shot because of the carnage, risking a date with the court-martial for violating the rules of engagement. A platoon member who was for peace is picked to do the unimaginable--shoot the sniper dead, which, after several hesitations, does. Now, the one who killed the sniper realizes that if the war mongers can kill, the same goes for those who are for peace."

","Here we have Stanley Kubrick's contribution to the big complex of Vietnam war movies. The war film genre has always been one that Kubrick was very interested in as his earlier work proves and even some of his unfinished projects dealt with it. The first quarter of an hour in ""Full Metal Jacket"" consists of the infamous military training camp with the drill instructor, played by Lee Ermey. This first part of the movie is certainly responsible for ""Full Metal Jacket"" being one of the really big entries in the war genre. Rarely (or never?) was dehumanization put to screen so merciless. The second part plays in Vietnam and it shortly falls behind the beginning. Still, this part is showing very effectively the result of the soldiers' training. In the end they aren't even able to learn from their actions, they're just ""glad to be alive."" A very fitting image for the whole war.

Kubrick put the characters of the film under the microscope lens as he was a mad scientist studying insects; then observes them reacting to the maddest possible situation: the one in which men must kill other men with no reason why. The movie is divided in two parts having each one its own life as they were movements of a symphony that needs different speeds and different rhythms to express all that must be expressed.

Yes, its supposed to showcase both the horrors and the boredom of Vietnam, but it was still s***, sorry, it was that awful. It was saved by the Sniper incident, that saved it for me, it was good, but until then it had become shocking. And then, just as it starts getting good again.....its over. Bit of a limp over the finish line. Sorry, but this movie is overrated due to the end and beginning, the middle is awful, and if it wasn't for the middle, I would have liked it. Maybe some time in the future I will appreciate it, but it still bored the c*** out of me. Disappointed."
"nived84","10","0","1","25 January 2006"," A Masterpiece? No, but it has it's moments
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is, to many people, regarded as being a ""masterpiece"" or a ""classic"". What I believe is that it's overrated. It's an okay film overall, but it shows us nothing new about the Vietnam war that we haven't already seen in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now or Oliver Stone's Platoon. The only thing new or memorable about Full Metal Jacket is R. Lee Ermey's unforgettable performance as a foul-mouthed, tough-as-nails drill sergeant. That's the one thing people will always remember about Full Metal Jacket. The opening scenes in boot camp are pretty interesting, but once the film actually gets to the war it isn't as memorable, or as great as other films have certainly captured the Vietnam war. It has a few moments where it touches greatness, but as a whole the film suffers quite a bit.<br/><br/>Another problem with Full Metal Jacket is the lack of interesting or decent characters. I didn't particularly like any of the soldiers in this film, which is a first. None of them are really worth cheering for. And when we get towards the end and they're getting killed off it's hard to have any real sympathy for them. The desired emotion Kubrick wants is for us to care, and to feel sad for them dying and getting shot up, but I sit there, emotionless, not caring. This is to war films, what a comedy is that doesn't make you laugh pretty much pointless. The good war films, the memorable war films allow you to sympathize with the soldiers getting killed, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down and even the recent Jarhead can accomplish this, but sadly Kubrick's film does not. Then again maybe that's what Kubrick intended for all along, but if so why?<br/><br/>I think Full Metal Jacket, as a war film is okay, but I don't see what many people hail as being brilliant about it. It follows a pretty familiar path that many Vietnam films have followed before, and doesn't show us much that we haven't already seen. The stuff in the beginning with Leonard(played by Vincent D'Onofrio), a private whose tormented and driven psychotic is still quite haunting and memorable, but again, the beginning are the only truly captivating moments of this film. Full Metal Jacket adds to the war genre, but doesn't improve upon it, at least that's what I think."

","This has to be the most accurate depiction of an experience in the marines as you could find in a Hollywood movie. You have the drill instructor, whose job is to strip the recruits of their dignity to create them anew as soldiers. Sure, some will break under stress, but most will go on. Then there's the shockingly accurate depiction of combat. <br/><br/>All throughout, you see the reasons for the soldiers joining in the first place, and how they are moulded mentally into killing machines.<br/><br/>There is humour amongst the drama.

","Full Metal Jacket is Stanley Kubrick's vision of the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>It starts with boot camp for marines. A tough, rugged training facility run by a harsh Drill Instructor.

From Private Joker a brave man born to kill to Private Pyle a fat oafish dimwit under constant insult from the DI who believes he is worthless - to be honest he may have a point.<br/><br/>By the end of boot camp however Pyle and the DI's demise is quite inevitable - A sinister ending to the training, with the ultimate last test... I can't honestly say if it was a pass or fail???<br/><br/>With boot camp over, comes the war.<br/><br/>Joker and his men are sent to Vietnam, and after a few rendevouses with bullets, Vietnamese prostitutes and a cavalry of gung-ho characters, the final mission, and final test comes. To secure Hue City, and kill the sniper in the buildings before they die first---<br/><br/>""You will hesitate at the moment of truth. You will not kill. You will become dead marines, and then you're in a world of sh*t, because marines are not allowed to die without permission.""<br/><br/>---The whole idea of being trained to kill, and to kill when you're trained seems almost to be like test for the men. And as I said before, I can't honestly say that in the final outcome whether it is pass or fail...

I find that's quite cool. Sorry to deviate...<br/><br/>Anywho, I recommend this to you highly. It may not be the best Vietnam war movie - Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter??? - But it is certainly memorable, and worthy of much acclaim."
"puccino55","7","0","1","29 August 2005"," Some bits of dialog bothered me.
","Kubrick is one of my favorite movie makers, and I agree with most people that, yes, the first part of this movie is great--great dialog and great characters. But, for me, this part and certainly the rest of the movie lacked a personal style--something one definitely looks for and, most of the time, gets from a Kubrick movie. I don't know about you, but I usually come away from his movies realizing I've just experienced things in a new and different way.<br/><br/>Something else: in the second part of the movie, it seemed to me that one could ""hear the writers writing"", that is, it sounded like the writers were trying to top one another to see who could come up with best military-style trash talk, catch phrase, or figure of speech. It just seemed to me like they were trying to create characters from dialog, instead of the other way round.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the two things that, at lease momentarily, drew my attention away from the story. First, I was born in 1950 and had never heard the phrase ""tear you a new asshole"" in the States until the middle 1980s. Maybe it's been around forever, and I've just lead sheltered life. But I don't remember it being a part of Vietnam-era American guy slang. Second, when I heard Eight Ball (Dorian Harewood) say ""she could suck the chrome off a trailer hitch"" it seemed to me careless writing/editing because this was Willy Nelson's very funny simile in ""Electric Cowboy"". If I had been an editor on this script, I think I would have tossed out this kind of memorable line--certainly if the audience might remember it from another movie.<br/><br/>To wrap it up, there were some other things that bothered me about this movie, mostly small but some major. But this is only because it was a Kubrick movie, and I expected a seamless experience. But that's all I have to say here."
"the-jerk","7","0","1","9 June 2005"," Split personality
","I know I'm in the minority here, but for me, ""Full Metal Jacket"" was a disappointment. I guess the biggest problem I have is that it's split into two completely different movies: the first half, with R. Lee. Ermey (who's incredible in this) as a drill sergeant at boot camp imposing his will on the young cadets, particularly poor Vincent D'Onofrio, who ends up going insane because of the abuse he has to put up with. It's a chilling and sometimes even funny 45 minutes (or so) of film, and the ending is shocking and pure. I loved this opening.<br/><br/>But after that, with Matthew Modine going out to war, is when it starts getting disappointing for me. There were some good bits (like the encounter with the Vietnamese prostitute, a scene that is justifiably famous) but on the whole, I felt left out in the cold. The tone changes completely for the switch from basic training to actual fighting, and while I'd never second-guess a master like Stanley Kubrick, it just didn't do anything for me. Even the ending with the big battle and jumpy camera-work was a bit cloying to me... it was supposed to be gritty and shocking, but instead, I actually found myself bored and wishing the movie would just end. For me, ""Full Metal Jacket"" will always be two movies, with the first getting a 10, and the second getting a 5 at best. I definitely think it's worth watching, especially since the movie has so many fans, but in my opinion, Kubrick could have done better."
"Danny_G13","7","0","3","30 December 2004"," Certainly entertaining and polished, but no Apocalypse Now
","A film by the legendary Stanley Kubrick is always going to be worth viewing, but by his own standards, this is just nothing more than good.<br/><br/>Matthew Modine is Joker, a new recruit in the US marine core. War has broken out in Vietnam and new soldiers are being taken on with more velocity than before. However, rather than just immediately taking us on a trip through the battlefields, Full Metal Jacket starts at the very beginning where new blood is trained and abused, and readied for the harsh realities of war by their gunnary sergeant Hartman. Wickedly played by Lee Ermey, Hartman's dialogue is nothing short of fantastic, almost legendary, and while there's a touch of the overblown drill sergeant stereotype about him, his sheer entertainment value more than compensates.<br/><br/>His job is to sort these young men out and train them for battle. Modine's Joker is the one to show a touch of 'spunk' and as such earns his name, not to mention Hartman's respect.<br/><br/>Anyway, events take us to Vietnam and where Joker's stationed after induction. As part of a war newspaper, he along with his photographer colleague Rafterman go out to where the action's hotting up. Before too long, war truly breaks out and he finds himself in the thick of it all.<br/><br/>That's as much as I can say without entirely ruining the plot, so I'll halt there.<br/><br/>The one thing which stands out here is the sheer feel of Kubrick. His movies all have the hallmark of his touch, and it's in absolute evidence here. From the dynamic moving cameras, to the slightly surreal ambiance at times, it has all his trademarks.<br/><br/>However, one thing which perhaps is lacking is powerful acting. Modine is pretty staple, and the rest of the players are merely 'there'. Only the gunnary sergeant and Pile are truly impressive and genuinely strong characters.<br/><br/>There is also a lack of soundtrack to aid the flow of the story. Perhaps Kubrick felt music wasn't totally suited to this but somehow the empty score detracts slightly.<br/><br/>The direction is obviously top class, with some stunning cinematography and amazing shots. Many of the scenes are truly involving such is the clarity and intimacy of how the movie is captured. You really feel part of this one.<br/><br/>Furthermore the plot and script is really strong, with an extremely well constructed picture in evidence - it's completely believable and never expects you to suspend your disbelief at all.<br/><br/>However, for all its technical mastery and strong narrative, there's an overall lack of genuine punch. Apocalypse Now, for example, leaves you reeling and Full Metal Jacket doesn't really smart like it.<br/><br/>While it is a good film, a good war film, it's perhaps not quite the engaging and thought provoking piece of cinema that Kubrick's other efforts were."
"dndcullens","9","0","2","29 December 2004"," What ever happened to the actors??
","I am a Kubrick fan. I love his movies, despite the flaws in some but one thing keeps bothering me. Aside from his early movies with Kirk Douglas, Peter Sellars and Sterling Hayden, the actors he uses generally don't have much of a career afterwards. In using Full Metal Jacket as an example, I just wonder what became of the actors after working with the great man? Now there are those of you who would point to Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman and even Leelee Whatever as examples of a career ever growing but, in general, the actors he uses tend to disappear from the mainstream. Matthew Modine was brilliant as Joker in FMJ but has never progressed beyond that. The same goes for Vincent D'Offorino (forgive all the spelling errors) who was not only superb in FMJ but was outstanding in the poor Men In Black and as the killer in that J Lo movie which I watch last night. Cowboy's actor appeared in Jurassic Park and a TV movie about a kidnapping of a boy but I am trying to get my head around this conundrum. If Stanley K was a picky director as people say he was (but a lot of actors disagree with this) and if this pickiness included the actors who would actually play the roles in his films then why have they not become superstars? In FMJ there are some great actors but of the unknown quantity. Joker has nicked out a career for himself but not of the superstar quality. Gunnery Sgt. Hartmann has played the same role over and over. Pile has gone to TV as has Eight Ball. Cowboy has disappeared so has most of the rest of the cast in line with other Kubrick projects. So what is it about the Kubrick movies that kills a promising career?"

By the way Platoon is a better vision of being in-country in wartime and Apocalypse Now is a great piece of film art as well as a much richer depiction of the Vietnam gestalt.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this bad movie is how it brutalizes you for watching it. The boot camp sequence makes you want to kill yourself, too, just to make it end. So does the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>Kubrick has this problem with wanting his cake and wanting to eat it too. He hates the whole war/military aspect of American life, so he makes a visciously accurate depiction of it, perfect in every brutal detail. Is that admiration or contempt? He's schizo that way, wanting it both/ either. That's not a clear vision or commentary - that's confusion. The audience has to suffer, and for what? We already knew it was bad, no thanks Stanley."

","What can you say about this film apart from it being very entertaining. Well for the first 45 minutes.   I came home one when I was young and my dad was watching it and my dad never had a problem with me watching films that were not for my age group as he always said it was own decision to watch tertaining.  whatever I wanted to and I sat down to watch the continuing story of Full Metal Jacket.   It started off like no other film I had ever seen before and it kept me glued to the screen.  But Full Metal Jacket could have been a short film about the marines and it would still be talked about as much as it is today.   I have nothing wrong with the rest of the film it's just that first three quarters of an hour stick with me.   Kurbrick was obviously looking for an angle to use for this to be a bit different to other Vietnam films.  I've noticed that there are a huge range of Vietnam films  and when I think about it I have never seen a bad one.  My all time favourite is Apocalypse Now followed by The Deer Hunter and Full Metal Jacket is somewhere in my top ten.   But I do think after the story after the marine training goes a bit sour and just tries it's best to come up with a story.   It's like a TV film split into two parts where the first one starts strong but the second not so much.  I wouldn't even go that far to say that this has much good acting.  If I was to say two characters that stand out to all the rest then it would be Cowboy who at first is very creepy and you don't know what he is going to be like, for example when he is in the marines he doesn't say much and when the camera zooms in him it's a face of hate towards Gomer Pile who is the next character who stands out, actually how can I forget R.Lee Ermey, can't forget that bad ass.   The chemistry of hate and forgiveness between the drill sergeant and Pile are hilariously funny and very dark.  It's a great build up of tension between these two characters when the end of their training nears.  I don't like the voice over of Matthew Modine in this either, I think what he says isn't really relevant to the story and I think it would have given a more sombre mood to what it already had.  At the end when the soldiers are marching towards there point and singing Picky mouse I hated that Modine's voice over clouded that moment where it was a background of tragedy and fire but they still try and keep up moral despite their losses.  Just no need for the voiceover.  Let's be grateful Scorsese didn't direct it, voiceovers all over the place which is not a bad thing but the only voice over that works and will ever work in a Vietnam film to feel the mood is Apocalypse Now.  I do love Full Metal Jacket, I just wished it was all about the marines and not about the inventory."

"FilmOtaku","9","0","1","22 September 2003"," Best. War film. Ever.
","When Stanley Kubrick directs a war film, you know not to expect the normal elements that make up the classic war film genre.  Full Metal Jacket takes us from Marine boot camp to assignment in Vietnam while exposing the raw nerves and emotions that most war films do not explore. <br/><br/>
There really is no typical Kubrick genre  his films span forbidden desire, (Lolita) horror, (The Shining) and farce (Dr. Strangelove) but his films can never be mistaken for anyone else's.  It's hard to put a finger on what that style is, but it is clearly present in Full Metal Jacket:  The brilliant use of lighting in battle scenes to make what would normally be a horrific scene almost beautiful.  The point of view shots of actors addressing the camera directly, not as an aside to the audience, but as more of an intimate gesture to draw the viewer in.  The wide range of characters involved  you see the `fighting machines', the conflicted soldiers  both terrified and excited to be involved in the fight.  <br/><br/>The most important element to this film is the straight forward method of storytelling and the reality that is brought to the table.  While the Drill Sergeant is probably one of the most quoted characters in film history (at least among some of my friends) the reality is that this actor was indeed a drill sergeant and many of his lines were improvised and drawn from his own experience in the marines.  The main character of the film (Modine) is a complex and conflicted character, one whom I would imagine was more typical in spirit to some real soldiers in Vietnam than a lot of other roles we have seen in the war genre.  <br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket remains my favorite war film because it is one of the few combat films to not only make me cry, but to shock me with images and situations that have nothing to do with actual typical combat.  Just one example is the hazing of Pvt. Pyle, which is often construed as funny; it is also incredibly gut wrenching below the surface.  While there are war/fighting scenes, this is not a war film that relies solely on battle to tell its story, which is perhaps the best exemplification of its excellence.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

""War is hell"" - well hold the front page!<br/><br/>(The most amazing thing is that the scenes of carnage and wrecked buildings was actually filmed in central London. Indeed boat trippers going down the Thames could glimpse the movie being made and the sets were simply left after they were blown apart, making them a tourist attraction by themselves. They have since being demolished to make way for new apartment blocks.)<br/><br/>If only Kubrick had made this film shortly after (or even during) Vietnam. What an impact it would have had. Despite this, it is a brilliant film in parts and pretty good in overall impact, but he loses touch with what other directors have always known, ""to care with have to know."" Here we barely know anybody beyond basic name recognition and no character actor can (or is allowed) to steal the picture other than Ermey who only has a limited first half role. <br/><br/>It could, and should, have been a whole lot  better, but at the time of production Kubrick was clearly a man not listening to voices outside his own head and clearly not aware of how dated much of his technique now is: Simply running around with hand-held cameras doesn't, by itself, create great drama and tension. Not even when you more-or-less invented the technique yourself."
"Angry_Arguer","9","0","1","19 May 2003"," Kubrick at home, but not at his best
","Full Metal Jacket is Stanley Kubrick's way of hopping on the Hollywood bandwagon of mass-produced Vietnam movies inspired by Platoon.  While ""Platoon"" went into the great ethical questions of war, ""Full Metal Jacket"" aims for plain vulgarity.  Every character is a dehumanized sociopath in one form or another.  Whether this was intentional or not is unknown.<br/><br/>Kubrick's movies tend to feature men at war.  That is one of his most common motifs, but it is rarely exploited to its fullest measure.  Here he tries too hard and the scenes in Vietnam lack the precision of his earlier work. While the film certainly is a leap compared to ""The Shining"", and Kubrick tries to be inventive and different, it boils down to blowing things up and profanity.<br/><br/>The Parris Island opening, of course, is what this movie is all about. Eremy earned every penny of his paycheck as the almost psychotic Senior Drill Instructor with plenty of 'advice' and who could pummel the tobacco juice out of you at a whim.  Thankfully, the dehumanizing point is made clear here thanks to him.  Kudos.<br/><br/>Overall, worth a look once, but maybe not twice.  See ""Hamburger Hill"" instead for a better look inside the VietNam War.  3.5 out of 5 stars."

","Hello everyone. I chose this day to write my comments on ""Full Metal Jacket"" even though I've seen it over 100 times. You see, this morning, my brother, a very proud US Marine died. He didn't have fanfare, he wasn't well known. But one thing he did love was this film. I'm younger than he was, and when this film came out, this was all he talked about. How realistic it was, how well done it was. I didn't see it until two years after its release as it made its way into Select Cable.<br/><br/>To be honest, I am not the ""War"" films type although there are a select few that go beyond the ""War"" theme and get right to the heart of the matter. Full Metal Jacket is one of them. (Spoilers?) To me the film is in two halves: first half is the drafting of these men from all over the USA to be de-humanized, de-sensitized, de-void of all emotions and rained only to kill. It didn't matter what you thought you'd become, you were a killing machine. This was told though a group of recruits in the US Marine Corps on their way to Vietnam. This shows it was not a smooth road for all of them and it shows what happens when a human is pushed beyond...to be trained to kill. The second half of the film follows those who survive and actually go to Vietnam and that isn't a cake walk either. These men had to encounter the enemy that came in many forms and fashions and also had to confront whatever was left in their human sides as well.<br/><br/>This is NOT a film for everyone. It is rough. Some parts will be unbelievable to many people out there for they will ask: ""How could we let these young men be treated this way?"" We did. We do. We always will. There are superb films out there about the coming home experience and I am glad this film didn't go into that and just did the two halves. The Direction is wonderful. The actors were wonderful, I believed them. It came together nicely.<br/><br/>Upon my first viewing of this film, I was shocked. I called my brother, the Marine, and talked with him about this. Many of the things I wrote in this review came from those conversations over the years to put this film into a perspective for me, as someone who was too young to remember the Vietnam war, the draft, but who have had those in her family that had. Talking to my brother, who said, there was much in this film that hit the right tone, the ""inside"" of how Sergeants are and how many recruits aren't equip to stand through this, and how their bunkmates react, when I reviewed this film from that moment on I saw it in a whole different and even more upsetting light.<br/><br/>An excellent film, one of the top 50 of the 20th Century, on of Stanley Krubeck's best. I must repeat, not for everyone's taste for it is gritty, violent..but maybe if everyone saw this just once, they'd really think about what it really means to send our men and women out to battle and what for."

The great films of Stanley Kubrick are amongst my favourite - but I have to admit that this film didn't feel like I was watching a Kubrick film. Only parts of the soundtrack and certain solitary shots gave me that impression. I don't think it's one of Kubrick's best films, but it's deffenetly worth checking out for the fantastic first part (where they are in training) As soon as I turned it on I was laughing at the antics of the Sergent. The impact of his dialogue is amazing. However, never has a movie shut up my laughter as much as this one did - as soon as the 'soap hitting' scene was played out the movie took on a new level.

"Blade_Le_Flambeur","10","0","1","29 January 2003"," One of the best War films ever
","Full Metal Jacket is the first Stanley Kubrick film I've ever seen, and boy was it good. It managed to withhold realism during the entire film but not the kind of Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down realism. This movie was more about the physcological effects on the soldiers  more then the war itself (i.e. Boot Camp sequence). I found it to be greatly entertaining with no flaws at all. Acting wise you get good stuff from Vincent D, Matthew Moddine, and most of all the Drill Instructor. Plot wise it was good, it wasn't some annoying so called tribute to the men that died there (i.e. We Were Soldiers) it was more of the way they had to fight the war and how you never knew what was around the corner. There was always the sense of duty to your fellow men (i.e. Sniper scene). The film got violent and bloody at times but I felt it wasn't too bad, but it still deserved the R rating. There was some sexual situations in this flick (Vietnamese Prostitute) but it never really showed anything which I'm kind of glad for. There was also some humor in this movie, I laughed occasionally at the drill instructor about how so over the top he was to his trainees it was funny. My favorite line is, ""We are here because there is an American in every Vietnamese waiting to come out!"" I also enjoyed it how Private Joker had ""born to kill"" on his helmet and the peace symbol on his shirt. Overall, a good movie in general that I'd say is one of the best war movies or movies in general (Apocalypse Now Redux was a bit better). I give it a 10/10"
"tfrizzell","Null","0","1","12 December 2002"," Starts to Run on Empty.
","Stanley Kubrick's ode to Vietnam splits in two with the first half focusing on intense basic training within the Army and the last half providing insight on actual combat. The idealistic Matthew Modine is followed from his induction to the bloody battles on foreign soil. Early on Modine meets crazed drill sergeant R. Lee Ermey (in an unforgettable performance) and learns real fast that military life is unlike anything else. Chubby recruit Vincent D'Onofrio gets the brunt of Ermey's wrath and also becomes an outcast among his peers. He heads down a dark, winding path of destruction that will effect not only himself, but also Modine and Ermey. When in Vietnam, Modine reunites with another fellow recruit (Arliss Howard) and more chaos strikes. Kubrick's direction unfortunately becomes a bit prodding and the climax of the production comes way too fast. The end of the film's first half will leave you shaken and nothing in the second half can match the dominance of the first hour of play. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is one of those ambitious productions that ends up eventually losing its way as the clock continues to tick. Still a good film, but way down the list of great war films and great Kubrick productions. 4 stars out of 5."
"cocaine_rodeo","Null","0","1","1 November 2002"," One of the best movies ever, until the second half
","This was one of the best movies I've ever seen about the war, except the war parts. The first half was brutal, powerful, sometimes painful to watch (like the blanket party scene), and actually pretty funny at times (the stuff that the drill sergeant say is hard not to laugh at); but as the fresh Marines are sent off to Hell, the movie seems to go with it.<br/><br/>
When I first saw my thoughts were ""if the first half was that good, than the second will be unbelievable"", but it lost its edge and its intensity. The sniper scene was the best part of the second half, but still falls short.<br/><br/>
Now that I look back, though, it would be pretty damn hard to top the boot camp parts, i mean, those scenes were insane in the best way. Vincent D'Onfrio made the whole movie. He was completely believable with his decent into madness, much like Bobby D in ""Taxi Driver"". The drill sergeant also made this movie, because he was very funny, but at the same time horrifying.<br/><br/>
Normally when the second half of a movie fails, i don't like it, because that is more significant that the first part, but in this case, i am willing to give it a good rating, just because the scenes with D'Onofrio were so incredible. This is a very gritty, disturbing, and great movie, like all of Kubrick's films, so be advised for profuse (but at time comical) swearing and bloody, gooey and sometimes exploding violence. Not great, but still very good. I also think that ""Paint it Black"" was a great way to stop this movie, because it didn't end, it just stopped (which was one of the things I DID like about the end). 8/10"

","This is truly a strange movie. Split in two parts it is somewhat hard to judge it as one movie. The first half focuses on the recruit training on ""The Island"". This is the movies best part. The lack of music, the long dwelling scenes and the actors makes this a painful view on how to make a soldier and what happens in the recruits mind. The second half (The Vietnam part) is not that good, but it absolutely has its moments. What makes the Vietnam part good is the reality that is shown. If someone saves another guys butt, there is no hugging ""thank you, I owe you big time"" kind of s**t, they act as soldiers are trained to behave. But after all, the second part of this movie lacks the intensity of part 1. But the film is probably worth watching. Kubrick, however, have made better movies.

","Before seeing Full Metal Jacket, my ideas of Stanley Kubrick were a bit mixed.  His films always spark thought, and always include numerous elements of imagination.  This film is excellent.  I can barely speak higher of any other movie that I have ever seen.  This ranks to me as my favorite war film of all time, for its brilliant usage of contrasting sides.  The first piece of the film, with Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Pyle, gives a great background to the character of Private Joker.  Overall, the films shows how useless war preparation really is.  Even when it comes from the US Marine Corps, you cannot truly be ready for war until you are behind the trigger on the field."
"Dark Eye","Null","0","1","3 December 1999"," A disappointing and flawed film
","Stanley Kubrick, one of my favorite directors, has made many masterpieces, but this one is really a letdown.  The first half of the movie is great, focusing on the demoralization of the soldiers-in-training that has a tragic ending.  The immensely entertaining Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey) and his barrages of derigatory lines designed to wear out the new recruits adds to the sheer brilliance of the movie's first part.<br/><br/>In the second part though, I grew more and more bored.  There weren't enough character development.  I felt nothing for the two soldiers who got slaughtered in an ambush, and at the end when the soldiers shot the girl, as gruesome it may looked, I felt no pain whatsoever.  Also, part two of the movie seemed like a sloppy job on cutting and pasting scenes, and the plot made the soldiers wander around aimlessly.<br/><br/>Kubrick may have tried to let the audience feel the no-remorseness and aimlessness that some of the soldiers must have felt in Vietnam war, but this is too cerebral and have left me unengaged emotionally.  Worst of all, the scene where the soldiers were being interviewed by journalists became disgustingly artificial as one by one, the soldiers started to say their one-liners in a perfectly-timed sequence.  The ending where the soldiers march singing the Mickey Mouse Club tune is somewhat a redeeming scene.<br/><br/>My advice is, watch the first part of this movie only, turn it off, and watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" as the substitute for part two of Full metal Jacket.  I know no one is perfect, it's just that I expected a lot more from Kubrick."

A few vague references to ""the duality of man"" are made but never explored, the characters are shallow and cardboard. The movie was taken from a short story, ""The Short Timers"", but if that story had a message it's completely lost in the movie.

Lee Hermey, as GySgt. Hartman is the devil. The training is like torture. The environment is torturing. Poor marine recruits. If Kubrick had filmed just this half of the movie, it would have been one of the greatest anti-war movies ever made. In Brazil, 18-years boys are obliged to present to the army to serve for one year. After watching Full Metal Jacket, one can't admit this passively.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie could be another movie. A much worse one. It shows some of the former recruits in battle at Vietnam. It's a bit like Save Private Ryan, a bit like Thin Red Line. But if you want to watch a good war movie showing a battle field go to Apocalypse Now. The only scene really worthy are the one with the Vietcong female soldier hidden in a building try to kill a full bunch of soldier, one at a time and Private Joker with the 'Born to Kill' message in his helmet and a pacifist button attached to his cloth.<br/><br/>It's pretty unfair to say that Kubrick hasn't done a great work.

Both times, I thought that the first half was good, the second half wasn't very good, and that it was disappointing overall. I also found it derivative...<br/><br/>I've read through a fair number of the comments here, many of which make comparisons to other war films, and I am somewhat surprised that I haven't seen anyone mention either ""Officer and a Gentleman"" (1982) or ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978), both of which significantly pre-date FMJ.<br/><br/>Why? Officer and a Gentleman featured a ""brutal"" boot camp sergeant (played by the Oscar winning Louis Gossett Jr) that FMJ is quite reminiscent of, including the steers and queers joke. I haven't seen Officer and a Gentleman for a long time, so I wouldn't like to comment on how good that film is as a whole, but it did get there first. From what I remember, Kubric's version is better, but it isn't original.<br/><br/>The Deer Hunter was split into ""before"" and ""during"" Vietnam sections. If this before/after style of making a film is supposed to show the horror of war and its effects on those involved, then FMJ contrasts very badly to Deer Hunter in achieving this goal.<br/><br/>My final thought whilst watching it was ""Oh dear, another Vietnam film using sixties music in its soundtrack"". I couldn't say if it was already a cliche when FMJ was made, but it is an area where time has been unkind to FMJ.<br/><br/>Final info that you may want to know: apart from most of 2001 (excluding the ending), I haven't been impressed by a Kubric film."
"tripper0","6","0","2","9 September 2001"," a prime example of why Kubrick is over rated....
","'Full Metal Jacket', like every other Kubrick film, is full of great imagery and fine performances, most notably here from the always fantastic D'Onofrio.  What is also the case with every Kubrick film is the uneven pace with which the movie progresses.  There are always great scenes, and then long droughts that are sluggishly paced.  This movie has a few great scenes, most of which are in the first half of the movie, all in the bootcamp. <br/><br/>
The first forty five minutes or so, which do take place in the bootcamp, are brutal to watch.  D'Onofrio is fantastic as the tortured Pyle.  The rest of his ""brothers"" are good as well.  The bootcamp scenes are probably the most realistic and brutal ones ever shot of such events.  The cruelty exerted upon everyone by the drill sergeant is shown without softening anything up. It shows how people are trained to be killers and how the army(or marines)take ordinary people and systematically break them down.  It is very well acted, shot, directed and executed.  The first forty five minutes were great, and the last scene in the bootcamp is extremely powerful.  After that it is all downhill.<br/><br/>The last hour or so is just a basic Vietnam movie.  Its really nothing that you wouldn't see in movies such as 'Platoon', or the great 'Apocalypse Now'. There is much devestation, and issues of morality.  Almost all of the scenery is on fire and engulfed in a thick black smoke.  No originality at all, and the pace slows down to a crawl.  It becomes another pretentious Kubrick vehicle that is self serving, and to be honest, bland and rather boring.  On top of that, I thought that the musical choices at the end of the movie were rather horrible and out of place as well.  However, if you do sit through the rather boring and standard hour, you will get the only good scene in the section, which also happens to be pretty much the last scene in the movie.  But it was a really good scene.<br/><br/>Had the movie been more bootcamp, or only forty five minutes long, I would highly recommend it.  As it stands, I feel Kubrick is highly over rated and generally ruins his films with his own pretention.  If you want a good vietnam movie, watch 'Apocalypse Now', as they don't get any better than that.  It has the same issues, but its absolutely a great movie, and 'Full Metal Jacket' is not.  I will give it 6 out of 10, but that is mostly for the bootcamp section of the movie."
