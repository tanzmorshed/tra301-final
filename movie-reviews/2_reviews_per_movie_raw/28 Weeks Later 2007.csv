"klchu","3","28","34","15 December 2007"," Could have been good but ruined by some poor choices
","A great premise and setup are ruined by some very poor choices. The makers of this movie hate the audience and their own characters. Nothing that made 28 Days Later a really good movie is in this movie.<br/><br/>Let's start with plot. None of the ""this could happen"" realism from the first movie is here. I can forgive a few plot conveniences but they just started to stack up. I'm going to list them here so SPOILER WARNING:<br/><br/><ul><li>Mom is immune to Rage virus.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dad is lone survivor.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dad (UK civilian) gets job where his security badge gets him past the highest US military security points.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There are zero guards between the entrance and the quarantine area.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Not to be outdone, his two kids can sneak past military check points.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>One of those kids can also escape all zombies, snipers and find his sister, all in a few minutes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dad becomes the super zombie who can take out squads of trained soldiers (trained to kill zombies, BTW) and who can evade all mass extermination attempts.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Super zombie Dad can also find his kids, not once, but twice.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Even though zombie blood if contagious, no one ever bothers to wash, or even wipe it off.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>On the other hand, no one ever gets infected this way either.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After 28 days, 28 months, and another 28 days no one bothered to close the Chunnel?</li></ul><br/><br/>Anyway, with the plot ruined, the next to go was the acting. It's a mixed bag here. Some was good but some was *really* bad. The screaming zombies acted better than some of the regulars when they were screaming.<br/><br/>That bring me to the deaths. You never expect many, if any, of the main characters to survive in a zombie/horror movie. You also expect those deaths to be somewhat spectacular. However, the cruel and callous manner in which some people died crossed many lines for me. If the rest of the movie were any good then perhaps these deaths would have worked. However, I don't think these deaths were given any more thought than ""how can we f*ck with people the most?"" The ""night scope"" death was also poorly directed. It's bad enough to kill off a likable character, but to do it poorly? You fail.<br/><br/>That brings us to the gore. If you want gore then you're in luck. This is probably the best part of the movie, but that's not saying much. Some of it is over the top, and some of it even funny (in a black humor way), but some of it was just cheap. The quick editing and fast panning shots seemed to be hiding flaws rather than being a creative choice.<br/><br/>Finally, the ""ending."" Once again, if the film makers had shown any sort of deep understanding of the movie then I might overlook this lack of a real ending. As it stands I can only assume that the writers just got tired and said ""let's end it here."" There was no message or anything deep unless you consider futility to be deep. The ending was just a cheesy, seen-it-before cliché.<br/><br/>To conclude: skip it. 3/10"
"rowman2222","2","345","501","17 May 2007"," I can't be scared because I can't get past how preposterous it was.
","I really enjoyed the first film. The characters were real, they made understandable decisions in stressful situations. It was a fresh take on a very cliché genera; zombie films.<br/><br/>The second film, unfortunately, has none of that. Unrealistic characters making the same irrational, unintelligent choices that people in terrible slasher films make. Maybe taken on its own it would not have been that bad, but it has a much stronger film to live up to so it amplifies all of the weaknesses.<br/><br/>I am sorry if I am giving some things away so stop reading now if you have not seen the film and want to ""try"" and be surprised. I say try because there was nothing, absolutely nothing, unpredictable about this film.<br/><br/>The thing I found most absurd was that after only four months of failing to find an infected person, they already want to try to repopulate the island. Preposterous!!!! The greatest plague in the history of world and they are going back all cavalier? No. It would take years, maybe even decades before any re-population attempt would be made, and even then it would be a military only operation composed of troops and scientists. There would have to be global wide panels of experts and diplomats involved as the entire world would stand to be infected if something went wrong. Anthrax can live in moist soil for years so why not the rage virus? Maybe if the title was 28 months later, or more realistic, 28 years later.<br/><br/>And then again, who would want to come back? There would have to be fantastic incentives to get people to move back. Such as no taxes for life, free property, hereditary titles, etc. But the filmmakers make no effort to explain why the people who moved back were motivated to do so.<br/><br/>Then there is Robert Carlisle's character who is ultimately the person responsible for the re-emergence of the virus. He accomplished this because he has a magnetic pass key that gives him unfettered access to the entire complex, even top secret areas. He walks into a quarantine room of an individual, who turns out to be his wife, that is a carrier of the rage virus but is asymptomatic. He supposedly is some sort of civilian contractor or maintenance worker in the facility, but that wouldn't give him unrestricted access, he isn't even military. Come on!!! Then when the virus finally breaks back out (Too far into the movie to allow for much action in a 90 minute flick) the emergency protocols are so amateurish to be laughable. It is obvious right away that they have never given any or the re-patriots emergency drills because as they are being shuffled into quarantine chambers, they are all confused as to what is happening. You have to go through emergency drills your first day on a cruise ship and they are telling us that after repopulating Brittan after the most deadly plague of mankind, they are not even going to do some drills???? So when this inevitably fails (the zombies break into the quarantine zones, of course) in the ensuing panic, the soldiers cannot tell who is infected and who isn't. After not too much time, the general gives the order to shoot everyone just to be sure. Again, I was sitting in my seat fuming, all they would have had to broadcast on the PA was ""Put up your right hand if you are not infected."" Presumably zombies don't follow directions. But no, the soldiers start shooting everyone. I wonder if a Nuremburg defense would work in this instance? And of all the other soldiers shooting civilians, only one has moral qualms. Pathetic.<br/><br/>From here, the movie devolves into the typical horror film. The surviving characters of the initial carnage band together and are slowly picked off by circumstance and the results of terrible decision making (Should I go into the Tube where it is dark and has no lights, or should I stay above ground where I can see where I am going?) Oh, and while in the tube, they navigate with a lone night vision scope on an assault rifle that the character doesn't point at the way ahead, but instead at the surviving characters heads, did she forget that the scope is attached to a gun? Who points a gun at peoples heads they are not intending to shoot. BTW this is the same character who earlier in the film corrected the word usage of a person and then made the same mistake herself. (What kind of writer didn't pick that up???) Oh, and Robert Carlisle just happens to appear in nearly every scene even though he is only supposed to be a zombie. It got really irritating to keep seeing him pop up all the time. Was someone directing his location????? Again, no explanation of why this particular zombie was so adept at finding the few survivors."
"capcanuk","1","578","890","14 May 2007"," This is a dreadful film, and the reasons why are...
","28 Weeks Later has to be the most disappointing sequel I've ever seen. This review will contain spoilers, however, it's nothing that the filmmakers themselves haven't spoiled to start with. Let's start with the most fundamental element of film-making: camera work. 28 Weeks Later is one of those pretentious films with the epileptic, hand-held camera that seems so popular with filmmakers who have nothing to actually say or show in their films. There are precious few scenes where the camera isn't both hand-held and in constant frenetic motion. It brings nothing to the film, creates no tension, and brings nothing new to the art of film-making. There are lengthy scenes that compound the camera work problem by also being filmed in simulated night vision. For those of you with a propensity to headaches or vision problems, this alone makes 28 Weeks Later a film to avoid.<br/><br/>On to the story. This is, sadly, one of those films where stupid people do stupid things as the only means the filmmakers could think of to advance a pointless story. **spoilers start** These two kids have just arrived in the ""secure zone"" and yet are able to sneak out, past heavily armed guards, pas various security measures, and run off into an area they have been repeatedly told is not safe. Armed guards surround the city. Soldiers are everywhere. Everyone has a machine-gun, a pistol, night vision goggles and yet, the discovery of an infected person, brought into the ""secure zone"", and absolutely NO precautions are taken? There are no extra guards; there are no extra security measures. To make matters even more ""logical"", it seems that all the soldiers in the area where this infected person is being kept are all either idiots, unarmed, or conscientious objectors. There is not one useful weapon to be found when it would be most useful. A soldier with a helicopter wants to rescue his buddy, yet the only thing he can think to do is have them crawl throughout the city to a distant spot to pick them up? Are there absolutely NO areas closer? This is just a completely useless gimmick to have the heroes of the story trek across town. I could go on listing plot holes large enough to float the entire U.K through, but I trust my warning will be enough to ward off those who are on the fence about seeing this film or not. Somehow, the kids' father has survived all the way through these events, despite all logic. Like the lone zombie in Day of the Dead who has learned to use a gun and appears to have regained some of his sentience, here we have an infected who defies all logic, including the internal logic of 28 Days Later, to follow his children and pop up at convenient moments for cheap scares and bad melodramatic moments. The filmmakers have created situations that defy logic and normalcy to advance a completely pointless story. Characters perform actions that defy logic. Events happen that defy logic. There is blood everywhere, yet no one seems worried about infection. And I can assure you, if blood is what you feel like seeing, this movie's carnage is on the heavy side. I'm not squeamish, and I actually enjoy a good gory film every once in a while. The problem with 28 Weeks Later is not the gore. It's the pointlessness of it all.<br/><br/>I've seen some really bad films in my day. I've actually enjoyed some of those bad films. The problem with 28 Weeks Later is that it WANTS to be a great film. It WANTS to be a big budget gore-fest. With completely unsympathetic characters, it fails to create any bond with the audience. Even if the epileptic camera work gave us an instant of respite to actually relate to those characters. We are kept at a distance by terrible plot devices, terrible character development, and completely silly events."
"katalinajime","1","135","205","14 May 2007"," Stupid upon Stupid... the stupidity exhibited was incredible
","I'm open to believe the U.S. Army is stupid- but THAT stupid? How do 2 kids get out of the ""safe"" zone and manage to steal a moped, ride through London, hang out at their house, and meet their mother before the Army can catch up with them? The purpose of putting the safe zone on an island in London was for containment (I assume) and yet, the survivors AND the zombies are able to walk across a bridge to get off the island AFTER it's been fire bombed? I am able to guess the mother's genetic eye-color trait is linked to the genetic anomaly that makes her and her kid immune- how does the idiot doctor not figure it out? Is the medical director really so stupid as to not guess these kids could be current hosts- is she really so stupid as to whisk the two kids away without checking their blood- and wouldn't doing a full work up on both kids be required when they were first caught? Is she so stupid as to risk her life to get these two kids out of Britain who can be carriers, like their mother was a carrier? And really... the father's reaction when he finds out his wife is alive... this is a man who should have severe PTSD (the entire survival population should have PTSD)... and he saw his entire nation succumb to this virus and yet he is ready to believe that his wife comes out of an attack unscathed? And then he sneaks through security to see her???!! Really??! And again back to the stupid U.S. Army-- you'd think security in that place would have been better...I get that he had ""all access"" pass, I just think the Army would have guards around too.<br/><br/>Come on... the movie was so stupid upon stupid. Sorry to all the fans, I really liked the first one."
"jillyannesmith","3","140","215","13 May 2007"," Illogical plot and flat characters plague this disappointing sequel
","The movie begins in the dead center of the original outbreak of the epidemic in England. We are introduced to a handful of people hiding out from the rage-infected including Robert Carlyle's character and his wife. After a short time, the house is attacked and most of the group killed by the zombie-like masses. The husband and wife are separated and he flees to water, barely escaping with his life.<br/><br/>Here is my first of many complaints of this film. The separation of the couple is used as a cheap emotional ploy to discredit Carlyle. Standing across the room from his wife, whom he had desperately been pleading that she flee with him, he is outnumbered by rage-infected and weaponless. He makes the only choice he possibly can as a realistic character and takes the way out which is available to him. Only the invincible action-hero archetype could be expected any other course of action.<br/><br/>The opening scene itself is the high-point of the film. From here we jump to what the title promises as months later. NATO, led by, guess who.. the US, moves in to begin re-population of the country. Unfortunately the country is still littered with bodies of victims and is, in general, exceptionally unsafe. Still out military decides to set up a ""safe zone"" (glaringly pointing to our Iraq ""green zone"" folly), right outside of the city with ridiculously lousy security. Carlyle's 2 children, who had been in Spain during the outbreak, return home and are reunited with their father. In a hopelessly coincidental turn of events, Carlyle just happens to have complete access to everything about the compound.<br/><br/>Their first day back in Mother England, these 2 young characters easily escape the compound even though they are spotted by the military, and return home to get ""some stuff"". Even viewing the desolation first hand and discovering a decomposed corpse isn't enough to open these morons' eyes to the horror of events and stop them from trotting home for some clothes and misc. riff-raff.<br/><br/>Upon returning home, the children discover that their mother some how (which is never revealed) survived the attack and has been living in the house for the past few months. The military finally arrive and take the children and their mother back to the ""green zone"".<br/><br/>The mother, who is a carrier of the disease but shows no symptoms due to a genetic abnormality, is a precious commodity as she may contain the secrets to a cure. So since she is so very special, the military straps her to a table and leaves her by herself and unguarded in an area her husband can conveniently access. How we are supposed to believe the military would give SUCH complete access to a civilian is beyond me. The children, who are in trouble for sneaking out, are given a guard. I guess they didn't have another to spare for the woman that might save humanity.<br/><br/>Predictably, the mother infects Carlyle who flies into the usual ""rage"", kills her, and escapes into the compound starting the infection all over again.<br/><br/>The compound is insanely unprepared for this event and attempts to ""lock down"" civilians in a room with a back door...<br/><br/>Panic and mayhem ensue as the infection begins to spread and the military begins its indiscriminate slaughter of the citizens. Another thumb of the nose to military.<br/><br/>From here the film just spirals into your basic ""zombie chase"" movie losing red-shirts left and right. We are introduced to, then lose, a few characters, giving us no richness of character along the way. Carlyle occasionally pops up in the vain of a long-haired Japanese ghost. There is no logical reason for his appearances, but at this point, the movie is no longer at home to Mr. Logic.<br/><br/>Ultimately, we are given the beyond predictable ""twist"" setting up the inevitable 28 Months Later. Between the illogical plot and idiotic characters, the director burns vast amounts of film on sweeping shots of the abandoned countryside and close-up views of the characters faces as they ""react"".. or fail to react, to the horror around them.<br/><br/>Having hailed 28 Days Later as possibly my favorite modern horror film, I was disappointed."
"Andy4444","8","377","611","19 May 2007"," Well-done: Gripping and scary
","Having seen 28 Days Later I thought I was prepared for this, but I was not. Somewhere near the beginning of the film is a scene that goes from zero to psycho in about 2 seconds flat. The beginning of 2004's Dawn of the Dead also had a wildly chaotic kick-off scene, but unlike that film, which was a great film to laugh through while chomping your popcorn, this film is no laughing matter. <br/><br/>When there's no violence, there's fear and tension. <br/><br/>When there is on-screen violence, there is absolute shock and horror. Scene after scene shows ordinary people placed in impossible situations from which they cannot escape. This time, of course, there now two implacable predators out there hunting them down: the rage virus from the first film, and the military which is attempting to maintain control of any outbreak, but is willing to visit unspeakable horrors upon innocent people if they cannot keep that control. The horror and scale of the virus is so severe, that the plans the military implements are completely plausible.<br/><br/>The actions scenes are masterfully done, effectively placing the viewer in the points of view of both the victims and the crazed, but still scarily human, zombies. The portrayal of the violence pulls no punches; people of all age groups and walks of life are destroyed without remorse. No attempt is made to soft-pedal it. The fragility of human life on Earth and its vulnerability to just the right nasty virus are thoughts that stay with you after you've left the theater, and add a nice ""after taste"" of fear. The soundtrack, as with the first film, is amazing in conveying the tension and dread and sadness of the scenes. The story is fairly tight, as well. My only complaints might be with the acting of some of the soldiers, which just didn't feel authentic to me for some reason.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say this is one of the best zombie films I've ever seen, in fact, one of the most effective thrillers I've seen, as well."
"pjyielder","2","188","302","19 May 2007"," Note to America: Don't make sequels to foreign films
","28 Days Later was one of the smartest ""horror"" films I had ever seen when it came out, but its sequel pales in comparison. Someone has paralleled the comparison between Alien and Aliens, but I think it's even worse than that. This film will definitely find its audience, much like Aliens did. But whereas Alien and 28 Days Later are scary yet smart, Aliens and 28 Weeks Later are given the Hollywood face-lift with the help of lots of machine guns and overacting. Oh, and a worthless plot.<br/><br/>To be fair, the opening sequence of the film truly had me squirming in my seat and I feared the worst for my sleep that night. One of the most terrifying aspects of the original film was the idea of escaping to the countryside and boarding up for safety, only to eventually be helplessly attacked by the roaming infected. Therefore, anyone who has seen the original will quickly deduce what is about to happen as soon as the young boy knocks on the door seeking shelter. Things are looking good by the end of the first sequence; a reasonable plot conflict has been developed and the director has scared the viewer just enough to remind them that yes, this is a horror film. After this, it all goes downhill.<br/><br/>The American presence in the film is not my beef with it, despite my subject line. At first it seems anti-U.S. in the way it portrays military occupation, but Sgt. Doyle's character, stereotypical though his name may be, serves as a counter to this. The soldiers are doing the best they can, and their decision to go to ""code red"" and kill everyone rather than just the infected is not out of the question. If anything, the ""safe zone"" created by the U.S. presence is entirely implausible, much like the fact that Robert Carlyle's character has full access to all of it as a civilian employee. Given the nature of the virus, one would think that maximum (and I mean MAXIMUM) security would be priority number one. And this is exactly where the film fails: completely implausible events are used to push a weak plot forward. After Carlyle's character has been infected by the wife he thought he left for dead, you can officially start laughing instead of wincing. I wish I had been in the laugh-friendly comfort of home rather than a theater, because my friends and I would have had a field day with the latter half of this movie. At one point, Carlyle's zombie is seen looking at a picture of his family while growling and gnashing his teeth like the rest of his zombie brethren. Are we to believe that certain zombies whom once had families are able to put aside their unquenchable blood lust for some sentimental memories via pictures of home? I had to fight the urge to do my best Don LaFontaine impression during that scene. Simply terrible, trite film-making. Also, since it was a U.S.-produced horror film, you can expect characters to do really stupid things while your brain begs for mercy. Once a lull in action comes along, someone investigates a rapidly banging door or initiates any one of a number of cheap scare clichés to keep the sheep filling their gullets with popcorn. Don's (Carlyle) son is the token innocent but stupid kid of the film who initiates most of said clichés, while his daughter is the token looker without a brain who overacts every line she is fed. The only truly rewarding scene for me was the helicopter massacre, and that is a disgrace considering how intelligent the first film was.<br/><br/>Technically, the film looks and feels extremely rushed, especially in the cinematography. Attack sequences (and otherwise) are spliced with mindless hand-held camera-shaking, adding a dose of nausea to an already visually jarring film. I'm not against hand-held camera work, but I think a more direct and effective film might have been produced had it not looked like the director let his kids play around with the camera. The film looks acceptable when it's not dizzying, but it's nothing worth noting. The soundtrack is almost exactly the same as the first, minus the Eno track.<br/><br/>Basically, if you're looking for a mindless gore-fest, this is your ticket. If you're a fan of how scary the original film was on a much deeper, darker, and smarter level, this is not your ticket. I was extremely disappointed with this one."
"mbg147","1","85","132","30 May 2007"," Why did people think this was good? Here's why it sucked.
","My biggest problem with this movie is the total lapse of logic. Here's a list of the things I thought were absolutely stupid about this movie.<br/><br/>1. In the rare event of a new case of the disease, why would the military's containment plan be to round up all of the citizens and lock them in a parking garage? What sense does it make to stick hundreds of people packed in tight quarters when you're dealing with an infectious virus? Wouldn't it make more sense to have them all stay in their homes. Everyone lived in high rise apartment buildings. The buildings themselves could have been put on lock down, and everyone locked in their apartment. That way if someone gets infected, it is limited to their room, or possibly just that floor. Instead one person gets bitten in the parking garage and suddenly hundreds of people are infected in a matter or seconds.<br/><br/>2. How come they lock all these citizens in the parking garage, the panicked citizens can't get out, but oh wait, there's a completely unguarded fire exit near the back of garage that the military completely overlooked when coming up with this lame plan<br/><br/>3. Why did they kill the power to the entire city as part of the containment plan? Hey zombies are on the loose! How bout we . . . .kill the lights and make it harder for us to see them? <br/><br/>4. Why was the dad such a smart zombie? Aren't all the zombies just raging lunatics running around growling looking for people to eat? When the dad first gets infected he just starts raging out and can get out of the glass room he's locked himself in. But all the sudden once he's full out zombie. . .he suddenly gains the ability to use his key card to swipe himself in and out of the various restricted areas of the facility. If super smart zombie dad can do things like use his key card, why don't the zombies learn how to use guns, and open doors instead of smashing through them. . .its just stupid. All the other zombies just like grab, spray, and bite their victims, pretty straightforward stuff. But zombie dad for some reason does the eye gouge move to mom . . .and other times in the movie tackles victims and then like ponders for a moment what to do before proceeding with the killing. Another example of zombie dad not following the pattern of other zombies. He also sees the son in one scene, but rather than run straight at him and attack like all zombies do when they see a human, zombie dad decides to hide and reveal himself at a more appropriate moment. Lame!<br/><br/>5. The whole mom being a carrier of the disease but not turning into a zombie was stupid as well. When the zombies bust in and attack her. . .the fact that she lived without a being mauled and escapes with only a single bite mark means one thing. . .that once the zombies bit her and she contracted the disease, that they then stopped attacking her because she was one of them. So by that logic, the zombies don't attack and kill each other. But then when the dad turns into a zombie the first thing he does is kill the mom. So how the hell did that fit in? This made me question the entire zombies existence in the first place. They eat humans. . .but as soon as you're bitten you turn into a zombie within seconds, and then what they stop eating you? so ill reference the point where the two zombies somehow find their way onto the roof (entirely too quickly and easily I might add) and start attacking the sniper, so the other sniper shoots his friend to spare him the misery of being attacked by zombies. And if I remember correct the zombies just run away from his dead body. Aren't they hungry? Why wouldn't they eat his body<br/><br/>6. The military is just made to look so stupid in this film. Their plans are retarded and ill advised. The infection should have never gotten so out of hand as it did. They definitely had the fire power to kill everyone in the city. The place is crawling with armed soldiers. . .the dad should have been able to maybe bite a person or two before someone saw him and shot him. Also as soon as they realized the children might have a vaccine in their blood or something, they would have broadcast that info all over the radio and, not just ignored the fact and easily lose track of them. They show you an Apache helicopter they use to chase humans in the movie, but they never brought this Apache out when they actually needed to suppress the zombies. Instead the main characters get helped by some chopper pilot flying some weak, unarmed helicopter. <br/><br/>7. Considering how horrible the disease is, and how easily it is contracted through blood and fluids, nobody in the movie seems to care about cleanliness. If I had blood splattered on my face after shooting up zombies I would definitely wipe it off my face in case it got in my eyes or mouth. But nope, even the chief medical officer isn't worried about the highly infectious fluids on everyone. <br/><br/>8. Then they don't even really explain the end. What was with the scene of the inside of the helicopter at the end? And Paris are you serious. . .how the **** are they going to explain how it got off the island? <br/><br/>If 28 days later hadn't been so good I wouldn't have expected more than this lame effort for the sequel. It's like 3rd graders wrote the script or something."
"satanenterprises","1","86","135","27 May 2007"," A movie about zombies, made for zombies
","Horror movies are about scaring people. There are basically two ways to do this physically and psychologically.<br/><br/>Physically is extremely easy, you just lower music, make the character look around a dark corner, through a hole, behind a door and... Bang! Out comes the antagonist. Then the antagonist can start cutting strips off the character, digesting organs and squirting bodily fluids everywhere. Sure when done well it's scary, but my little brother could do this with a big enough budget.<br/><br/>Now the other side of a horror is the psychological scare. This is by far more superior and much harder to do. This is when you watch a horror and get swept into the movie. You start to think things like ""I would of done that"", ""That could actually happen"" or ""They don't deserve to die"". The movie makes you think about the problems the people faced, you can relate to them and may even feel sorry for the clever characters who die.<br/><br/>This movie is a classic example of a movie that has all the first and none of the second. Gaping plot holes aside basically every character can only be described as mentally retarded (Refer to all the other 1 star reviews for evidence). I'm sick of watching stupid people being used as plot devices in horror movies, it just shows that the creators of the movie aren't very clever.<br/><br/>This is to horror what slapstick is to comedy. Not very intelligent, good for a few thrills that are equivalent to getting a member of my house to jump out at me a couple of times during the day. Isn't it time that horror moved on, we've been at this level for the last 30 years with far too few exceptions. If mouth breathers would stop rating these films so well with comments like ""It's got some good scares"" and ""It's just a horror movie"" then we might see some changes.<br/><br/>I'm not scared Juan, I'm just really bored!"

","SPOILER _ _SPOILER _ _ SPOILER I am surprised to see so many positive reviews for 28 weeks later, as in my opinion it bares little comparison to its excellent predecessor.<br/><br/>It is not completely without merit, the film does succeed is in recreating the style and feel of the first film. The best elements of the cinematography, camera work and score from 28 Days are again present here.<br/><br/>Unfortunately what are lacking are a cohesive plot, plausible characterisation and quality acting.<br/><br/>Most annoying of all is Robert Carlisle's zombie, he really should have had the words 'plot device' tattooed on his forehead.<br/><br/>Until half way through the second film we had been led to believe that all those infected with the virus become mindless psychos only intent on murdering the nearest person to them.<br/><br/>However luckily for us and the film, Carlisle's zombie has the dubious ability to teleport himself directly into the any scene as and where the plot dictates. This is the kind of focus group thinking that ruins the majority of US made films and I am disappointed to see this here.<br/><br/>Bringing me on to the acting. Imogen Poots as Tammy was particularly weak. Luckily her character manages to maintain an indestructible layer of eye liner during the film, thank god, I really wouldn't have been able to believe her performance otherwise.<br/><br/>I imagine this film will be well received in the US as its contrived plot and tenuous happenstance will be forgiven in the face of its increased action and gore.<br/><br/>Overall it's a very poor effort."

","...Not this time.<br/><br/>I believe 28 Weeks Later did appreciate as a sequel (with only a couple very minor depreciative concepts), and that was a surprise.<br/><br/>I'm admittedly a zombie film fan (especially the serious, non A-Team variety). And although the Rage virus in these two films does not produce an 'undead' zombie, the 'infected' nevertheless present a similarly formidable and threatening antagonist. If you haven't seen either film, Boyle's 'infected' are far less like the traditional lumbering Romero zombies, and closer to the Zack Snyder zombies of 2004's Dawn of the Dead. Note that if you were able to get away with seeing 28 Days Later as a date movie, you may not pull it off with 28 Weeks. There is very little breathing room, and some of it is more disturbing and far less bridled than you might be expecting, especially if you are used to the character-based 'safety' of most films.<br/><br/>Unlike 28 Days, a flashpan start to 28 Weeks Later sets the tone for the entire film... Which although short in running time (at just over 1:30) with quite a fast pace, still seemed very much long enough to be perfectly enjoyable, especially for any fan of the genre. Other than a brief, but informative back-story conversation near the beginning, there is almost no down time spent (wasted?) on emerging relationships or overly granular side-stories. Overall the most powerful element of the film isn't really character based, but rather the theme of a terrible pandemic that, besides a small twist, isn't much changed from the first movie.<br/><br/>There is one facet of the film that I did not really appreciate, but can't really detail without a spoiler warning. Let's just say that London is a fairly large playground for certain (coincidental?) events to happen (and not just once). However, there's a possibility I may be missing some concept that made these events intentional--I hope it's some twist of the virus and isn't just star power.<br/><br/>I'll be purchasing the DVD, but probably won't offer to watch it with any of my family and couldn't recommend it as a party movie :) <br/><br/>Post Script: If you had ever wondered why the rest of the world was not affected by this virus, consider the geographically isolating nature of the British Isles and the extremely short incubation period of this virus. A truly viable pandemic must have a longer incubation period and optimally be airborne or at least infect multiple disparate species. So the Rage virus, while perfectly suited in close quarters would likely not travel much farther than a pair of human legs could travel."

","Does anyone remember the old TV series ""Threes Company"" with John Ritter? Each episode was essentially built upon a series of misunderstandings that were eventually resolved in thirty minutes. This film has a similar structure, except we are watching the containment of a lethal virus which threatens all of mankind. In one sequence after another the actions of the actors is unbelievably foolish. First the viewer is supposed to believe that anyone would want to return to London after such horrendous events occurred. Then, how may I ask, do two children sneak out of the safe ""green zone"" they are protected in, and travel miles out into the forbidden and potentially infected zone? This isn't equal to sneaking in or out of the theater you visited to see this film, it's on par with sneaking out of Gitmo (or at least it should be). OK so fine, the viewer might let this slide even though the whole time they watch this portion of the film you are filled with disgust because of the stupidity of the characters actions, as well as the improbability that such an escape could occur. Moving on to only minutes later in the film, the two children discover there mother, whom they assumed was dead, looking very infected in their former home. She is brought back to the quarantined medical facility along with the children and tests positive for the virus. Now the next frustrating and improbable leap. The children's father ""visits"" the restrained mother inside the ""secure"" medical facility, swiping a security card through door after door until he is able to speak with her, without anyone in the facility knowing or being alerted to his presence. We are asked to believe that the same card he used to get in and out of his living quarters can somehow grant him access to the most sensitive areas of the medical facility. Also we are expected to believe that there is NO security guarding this woman even though she has been confirmed to carry the virus. We all know what happens next as the father becomes infected and the new outbreak spreads. Onto the next unthinkable wrinkle in the plot. As the infected and uninfected alike run screaming from the facility out into the street the armed forces are asked to target and shoot ONLY the infected. The snipers are supposed to make instantaneous distinctions between those who are healthy and those infected in a fraction of a second? The truth is that everyone running from that facility would be cut down like weeds to prevent ANYONE from leaving the building (which the higher command eventually decides to do much later than was reasonable to do so) It is only through blindly accepting the stupidity of the characters as well as the utter improbability that these characters can go and do as they please, to places they are not supposed to be, that any enjoyment can be achieved. Let's face it, the film may enjoyable on some level, for various reasons, but if you have a hard time with these obvious stretches of reality it becomes difficult to fully enjoy the rest of the film. I enjoyed the first film immensely, and I am well aware that stretches of reality are not uncommon in the horror genre, but this movie just goes too far. I have omitted a continual string of ridiculous plot turns and unthinkable character behavior that follows the breach of the virus because I feel it compassionate to do so. Those who give this film high marks in my opinion are purely giving credit for the minimum. Of course Horror films are not always judged the same as their dramatic counterparts, but viewers have developed a more sophisticated and discerning view of horror films. 28 Days later is responsible for helping lift the expectations of horror fans, this film lowers the bar. I am now going to wander off by myself in the dark, towards the summer camp lake, knowing there is a madman on the loose killing my friends in an attempt to forget this sad sequel. Wish me luck. It might take me 28 months and dismemberment to do so."

","When I first heard there was to be a sequel to Danny Boyle's excellent 28 Days Later and that Boyle himself would not be directing it, I was less than excited.<br/><br/>Then the reviews began flooding in and I was surprised, shocked even, that the majority of them were positive.<br/><br/>It was then after the well respected film critic Mark Kermode said it was ""very good"" and ""better than we had any right to expect"" that I began to raise my expectations.<br/><br/>Im happy to report that they were exceeded by a sequel that surpasses the original in terms of tension and spectacle.<br/><br/>Boyle remained on board with the project, albeit as a producer, but also directed some second unit footage and never allows it to veer away from the look or feel of his original.<br/><br/>Not that he had cause to worry as the new director,Juan Carlos Fresnadillo obviously understood Boyle's vision and expands on it without getting too carried away.<br/><br/>The result is a faster paced, less reflective film, containing a very intelligent political subtext and some fantastic action set pieces that (and this is the most important part) delivers a large number of quality scares.<br/><br/>It also dwarfs 28 days later in terms of gore, meaning true horror fans have much more in the way of visceral glee to sink their teeth into (pun intended).<br/><br/>Bring on 28 months later..."
"arthurmauk","9","114","192","27 August 2007"," The end is once again extremely ****ing nigh
","I've never been a huge fan of the zombie horror genre, but I was very impressed by Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later Somehow it managed to create characters worth caring about as well as throwing mindless zombies at them. So when I heard that a sequel was in the making, I was excited but understandably cautious since the Disappointing Sequel Syndrome is all too common nowadays. I also disapproved of the director switch, fearing that yet another low-budget gem will be Americanised by Hollywood, made far too slick for its own good.<br/><br/>So to say 28 Weeks Later was a pleasant surprise would be an understatement. Fresnadillo managed to maintain everything that was good in the original and add his own flair. The rage virus, the zombies and the gore are all still here. But most importantly, what keeps the series shockingly vivid is the willingness to flaunt the naked truth: we humans are the real monsters. Under such extreme circumstances, mankind's self-preservation instincts kicks in and it is an ugly sight to see. It might be the necessary thing to do, but that still doesn't make it feel right.<br/><br/>The film starts off at an odd pace but soon settles into a familiar terror-stricken rush. The cast was well selected, nothing out of the ordinary but no obvious weak links either. The Americanisation was not as severe as I had previously dreaded, and I actually quite welcomed Rose Byrne and Jeremy Renner leading the plot. The shots of post-apocalyptic London may have been done already but they're still as effective as ever, and John Murphy's score is brilliant as always.<br/><br/>All in all, a worthy sequel to Days and very few fans will be disappointed, I hope."
"nuttercook_99","1","49","78","8 December 2007"," What an utter joke
","Where to start. The most ridiculous thing is the father character getting into a top security area (well you would think so) with his silly swipe card. Not one guard to be seen. I gave up on this junk then and there. He then kisses his wife, yuck. In reality she would have told him to sod off, he left her to die! Then he kills his wife, who is also a zombie. He must have had something against her eyes. Then he waltzes on out, and kills some heavily armed (you would imagine) soldiers. Surely, they would have blown his head off. Soldiers are trained to kill, end of story. The kids getting out of the security zone? Beggars belief, what a load of utter crap!!! This film is shite. Well it had good sound anyway, on my 5.1 digital sound system. The copter pilot only being able to pick them up from a park, at a certain time, a great distance away? The only reason for this is so there was plenty of space to fly in and do the giant lawnmower scene with his chopper. Yay!!! How this film is a 7.2 on the ratings scale defies belief. It shows you that the majority of earthlings are brain dead retards, who will accept any crap thrown at them. The Volvo out-maneuvering the attack helicopter? The U.S spends billions of dollars on attack helicopter research and development, yet a clapped out car can out-run and out-maneuver it. Why don't the military just put a rotor blade on the car roof, would save a bit of cash. Perhaps the crew could have fired arrows at the car, or maybe chased it on a horse. I want one of daddys miracle swipe cards, perhaps I could access other peoples bank accounts. This is what is wrong with the U.S military, their stuff don't work . Bombing didn't work, then the gas attack didn't work. What kind of gas was that anyway, zyklon B? Also, the inside of Wembley stadium is actually the Millennium stadium in Cardiff. What an atrocious lead up to another sequel (just what we need) Gee, lets take the kids to France. We no like those frogs. I think it was done on purpose. Why not fly them to Ireland, it is closer, and is also separated by a large body of water. What a bollocking, cluster, turgid, mindless, retarded piece of crap. Who is the screenwriter?

"Theo Robertson","9","62","103","12 May 2007"," A Truly Great Horror Film
","When I heard there was going to be a sequel to 28 DAYS LATER I slammed my cards on the table and proclaimed that this was going to be one of the biggest disasters in the history of recent cinema . Despite the flaws of 28 DL - And there was many - it was at least an attempt to make an intelligent post apocalyptic adventure in the vein of John Wyndham or John Christopher even though the end result was unsatisfactory but a sequel ! That's just a case of a film becoming a franchise isn't it ? It's made simply to make a profit for some film company and after hearing that the story revolves around those damn Americans saving limey butt once again I just knew I'd be watching OBJECTIVE BURMA crossbred with a generic zombie film . Give me some credit for putting my head on the block but I'm going to have to eat my words because I saw 28 WEEKS LATER earlier tonight and I was totally engrossed for the entire running time <br/><br/>It is not necessary to have seen the predecessor because the story starts with husband and wife Don and Alice cooking dinner in a barricaded house . Despite some obvious exposition this is a very well written scene because we think they're alone but then we're introduced to several other characters who have survived a hellish plague that seems to have swept across the world and it's only when a child starts banging at the door that the audience find out something else - It's day outside something we hadn't realised . What happens then caused myself and the rest of the audience to jump out of our seats and we see Don do something totally practical and unheroic but be honest what would you have done in the same situation ? And something like this adds vermislitude to a plot that may seem silly <br/><br/>As the story jumps forward 28 weeks later NATO has started to bring back refugees to Britain and rebuild the British state and having seen some of screenwriter's Rowan Joffe's output I was expecting some dire leftist agitprop something that appeals to me as much as pro American flag waving but no this is a plot that touches upon what is happening in Iraq where the road to hell is paved with very good intentions . Thankfully the audience aren't walloped over the head with the analogy but the more intelligent audience members will be able to notice the parallels while the horror and action fans will be very well catered for by the bloody set pieces . It should be pointed out that in atmosphere this tends to resemble James Herbert or George A Romero rather than Wyndham and Christopher but that's not a complaint <br/><br/>Mention should also go that this is a far better paced screenplay than Alex Garland's and has far less plot holes though there are one or two things that are totally brushed over like how on earth did Alice survive six months when Britain had turned to a murderous hell ? Oh she's a carrier of rage so maybe the infected didn't attack her because of this ? If that is the case then why does she get killed by someone she passes the infecion to ? And there's a scene towards the end in the underground which involves laughable coincidence , but there's nothing like the ridiculous lack of internal logic seen in the Boyle/Garland movie and best of all this sequel has a genuinely disturbing and pessimistic epilogue and that alone eclipses the original"

","This is the first movie review I have ever written as I have never been so compelled before to do one. This movie is beyond stupid. I'll admit I do fall for ""plague"" movies such as this one quite often and look past some of the privileges Hollywood has taken. However, I simply can't explain with words the extent of the stupidity that plagues this movie. If you can't see how dumb this movie is, then my review probably won't mean anything to you. And if you do see how intellectually vacant this movie is, then were already one the same page and I don't need to sum up all of the stupid stuff you've already suffered through. Honestly, the real killer in this movie isn't ""rage virus"", it's the stupidity of the people writing this movie. The characters, their decision, the scenes, all make no sense. Do not waste your time. Watch outbreak. At least the army is competent in that movie."

","Well, here we are again. The zombies are back after being quelled. It would have been terrific is the writers devised a clever way to revive the extinguished plague. Instead the absurd plot posits that two bratty idiot kids bring about the 2nd zombie outbreak; that their half-zombie mom is the vessel; and that their dad (her husband) who happens to be the guy running the safe zone is the first full-on zombie, with an alpha security clearance. It's nice that they could keep the entire plot in the family. It's like Dickens' lost zombie novel where everyone (again...) turns out to be related.<br/><br/>Rarely has the solution to a zombie invasion been this simple; target and kill this whole stupid family in the first few minutes of the movie; the stupid kids, the stupid father, even loving mom. That should do it. God how I came to hate this family. At one point the boy brat asks, ""Do you think Mom is alive?"" when he might better ask ""Do you think our genetically-inherited stupidity caused all of this?"" <br/><br/>Why have the people in zombie movies never heard of zombies? Why don't characters who freak out when a person appears and disappears over an edit, have the knowledge I do from ghost movies? Why do characters spend half a horror movie not acknowledging what they've seen? Why does the world of knowledge acquired from film not exist for characters in films? This idea would save audiences a lot of annoyance and crap movies. <br/><br/>I guess it's only fair that it doesn't start well because it also has no ending. It's nice to see London go up in flames though."

","This film was so awful it made me write this review to warn others.<br/><br/>As mentioned before in many reviews the film's plot has so many holes you can use it as a colander, but will not be left with much.<br/><br/>1) 6 Months after such a deadly virus and already the island is being populated 2) Poplulated by whom? The outbreak was so quick, who had time to leave? And who would want to come back? 3) How can the cottage that is boarded up for how ever long it had been, be so vulnerable so quickly. 4) How did the mother escape the 'zombies', how did she make it home, why wasn't her house boarded up? 5) How can 2 little brats sneak out from a maximum security camp without no one stopping them? 6) Why where the kids locked up with a guard, while the mother who has the virus left alone in a examining room? 7) How can the magnetic card of a maintenance guard open restricted military doors? And without no one spotting him enter! 8) Why couldn't the soldiers stop him on his way back out after being infected. 9) Why wasn't the civilian hold checked before evacuating the civilians in there with a 'zombie' waiting for them. 10) How did the 'zombies' survive the fire bombs and the gas bombs 11) Why did the 'zombies' keep turning up where the survivors were heading? 12) Why would you go down in to the tube where it's dark? 13) How did the father keep popping up in the middle of all the action, yet never killed? 14) After seeing your brother get bitten, why would you throw away the gun and run to him? 15) After the whole of the UK was infected, somehow the infection never left the island, but after 15000 people get reinfected under US military supervision it gets across the channel to France. 16) Who read this plot and thought it was a good one?<br/><br/>Nothing spoils a film more, than a plot with so many holes! Also in the first movie the 'zombies' kept to the dark and didn't come out in the day. In the second movie this weakness has been thrown out as they seem quite partial to the day light.<br/><br/>By the end of the film we were hoping the survivors would all die for being so stupid."

I don't know how anyone could say this is a good movie or even holds a candle to the first one. Not true. Yes, there was tension in 28 Weeks Later but that is all! And that is not enough to keep watchers involved. <br/><br/>(SPOILER!!!)It was like 1/2 the way through they decided to wing it and rush through to start filming part 3 as in the end when we see the infected swarming around the Eiffel Tower.

"Catastrophe666","10","386","737","11 May 2007"," The best damn horror movie I've seen in a long time.
","This I can honestly say is not an overstatement. The movie contained everything it needed to be become a classic horror movie. It had gore, emotion,a few jumps,and action all the way through. The movie starts off well with the jumps and the pulse pounding action. Then all calms for a second, only to pick up again and faster.<br/><br/>First off the gore was not as bad as some movies, which are overly gory for no reason. Don't get me wrong there was gore and lots of it, but for some reason it seemed to fit within the movie so well that your not really bothered by it. I'm no gore hound but I honestly couldn't turn away from the screen.<br/><br/>The emotion is excellent for a horror film. Normally you get one dimensional characters, that do things that would never make sense whether panic stricken or not. In this film the emotions were well placed and not cheesy at all. There may have been one scene that went a little overboard but it didn't ruin a thing.<br/><br/>The jumps were slight, and if your not a jumpy person you may not jump at all. But with all the action you'll still be on the edge of your seat, and the jumps to tell you truth are an added incentive.<br/><br/>Finally the action was full on pulse pounding. It was incredible for a horror film. Think of the beginning scene of the Dawn of the Dead remake, but put it in the whole film, with a few chill spots with well placed acting. Honestly this movie deserves a 10 and has restored my faith in horror movies. I will be getting it on DVD and any directors cuts that may come out as well."

"TheSwordofValthrakian","7","11","15","30 May 2007"," Equal Parts Entertaining and Annoying
","Despite some of its glaring flaws, I actually liked 28 Weeks Later better than 28 Days Later. The movie starts off with some survivors hiding out in a cottage in the English countryside who get attacked by the ""Rage"" infected zombies when they reluctantly let in a kid on the run. This act will prove to be something of a foreshadowing of things to come. Also, ""rage"" for the uninitiated,is the name of the man-made virus that turns people into red-eyed blood-crazed homicidal maniacs within seconds after exposure to infected blood or saliva entering the mouth, bloodstream, or the eyes. It's like rabiezilla if you will. Only one person survives and makes his way to safety via motorboat. The movie fast forwards ahead 28 Weeks Later (hence the title) and the English citizens under the watch of NATO deployed US troops are being brought back in to live in heavily guarded safety zones as the troops continue to eradicate any possible remaining infected since many of them have died off from starvation. Trouble erupts when Don's (the supposed sole survivor of the cottage attack) children Tammy a teen and her whiny bitchboy of a brother Andy sneak out to go pick up some items of sentimental value from their old home outside the safety zone and they happen across their mom! It turns out she also survived and their dad had failed to mention that he had left her to die to save his own ass. It turns out that his wife is infected but she's immune...she's a carrier and so when Don sneaks in to visit her and beg for her forgiveness for being a coward, he kisses her and the whole horrible thing begins all over again! He becomes infected with rage and gets the snowball rolling into a huge avalanche. So far, the movie is off to a nice start, but there were some things plot-wise and film wise that got on my nerves. For starters, as the numbers of infected continue to grow, the protocol for containment becomes simply kill everyone. Okay, that's understandable but Don's kids may have their mother's immunity to the virus which could be used for a cure and this information NEVER gets passed up the chain of command! NEVER! The kids are being protected by an army biologist and a sniper who are also being targeted y'know, just to play it safe, but the whole time I was watching these events unfold, I was thinking to myself ""shouldn't one of these numb-skulls get on a walkie talkie and tell the army of their potentially precious cargo? Surely if there's a chance of a cure, the military would hold their fire and provide an airlift to safety for these kids!"" That struck me as stupid and the result was a pointlessly bleak ending, in essence an exercise in nihilism that didn't have to be. Dumb decisions were made and nothing gets accomplished. This movie could have still applied good ol' common sense and still have been good. By the way , by the time the movie's over, you'll want to kill Tammy and Andy your damn self. Especially Andy! Another thing that worked my last nerve was the f--king camera work! There was so much jostle cam in the movie during zombie attacks, that it became a total distraction. Normally, I like zombie movies and this one didn't hold back on the gore like ...Days, but I was starting to dread the zombie scenes because oh god, no! Not another jostle-cam sequence! Some other titles they should have considered are ""The Whiny Brit-Brats That Destroyed the F--king World"" or ""Attack of the Overcaffeinated Cameramen""."

And I mean before he was infected he had to know that his wife had the infection so why the heck does he kiss her. The level of intelligence within this film is just awful. The kids were no better.. hmm lets just leave this protected city and go out to where all the infection could be, then the military doesn't take any swift action to stop them.

","I'm not going to tell you about the super zombie dad or the super carrier mom or the super stupid soldiers, cos the other comments were pretty clear and thorough on that point. What surprises me though, is that no one seems to mention the unbearable demagogic storyline.<br/><br/>Sooooo... according to the filmmakers, children are just brilliant and always worth saving. Even if their IQ is lower than a retard, if they manage to re-infect an entire city just thanks to their incredibly huge brainlessness and, at the end of the movie, selfishly contaminate the rest of the world, you must like them and love them and take care of them, even if that means dying for them. These two kids were just plain idiots and I swear I wanted to shoot them from the moments they entered the screen. But hey, THEY ARE CHILDREN YOU IDIOT SO OF COURSE THEY'RE MARVELOUS AND LOVELY AND CUTE AND NOTHING IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN TO THEM HAHAHAHA!!!<br/><br/>As for the shaky cam, don't be wronged: there are also very long and pointless scenes where the camera is just not moving at all. Like, for ages.<br/><br/>About the plot holes, some are more annoying than others. OK, we all know Dad is Super Zombie without a cape, so he could have been seen flying or having laser eyes it wouldn't have been much troubling. But what about the mom? Not only didn't she become a zombie herself (immuuuuuune, just a carrier, there, it's so clear!), but she also manages to escape the zombies who attacked her, walked for we-don't-know-how-many-hundreds-of-miles to get to her house in London, AND manages to survives in that same house without any food whatsoever for weeks (months?) - neither proper food (infested with worms and stuff) nor human (deserted area, that's right).<br/><br/>And every time something happen, it's either because people are purely dumb or because it's a huge coincidence.

","I thought this might be a decent horror movie, even though the first 10 minutes had the most egregious use of shaky-cam ever. So much so that it gave me a headache.<br/><br/>I've read some of the other negative reviews and they have picked out most of the giant plot holes and idiocies in this movie. This one just piled them on until I was literally angry by the end.<br/><br/>A couple little things I'll add. I find it highly doubtful that the Chief Medical Officer for the containment of the worst danger to humanity ever would be a 28-year-old woman. Not that she was female, but at that age would barely have been out of medical school. You don't put a noob in charge of the most important medical investigation in the history of humanity. I believe she was so cast so that her superior officer could question her judgment and easily ignore her advice. Obviously a super-heroine as well, since they only had 4 minutes to run what seemed like several blocks to the park and she did it after being shot in the leg! And with all the opportunities to explain why the kid was so valuable to evacuate, no one ever once shouted ""He's IMMUNE!"", which should be the main concern of every living being on the planet, even suspicious helicopter pilots.<br/><br/>Not just a bad movie, but actively bad. Throwing the camera into a crowd of people and having them bump it around is not cinematography. I will say that some of the scenes were lit interestingly, though. That is, when the lights were on. Geez, they never heard of batteries, or flashlights?"

","I must immediately stress that critics who made the interpretation that this was a statement on the Iraq War seem to know as little about it as they do allegory. I'll write more on this later.<br/><br/>To put it succinctly, this movie has all that modern zombie movies are supposed to have. Incredible gore? Check. Virus zombies? Check. Biting zombies? Check. Soldiers shooting zombies? Check. A horror plot that has people falling to their own weaknesses? Check.<br/><br/>The shocks are there, the plot is excellent, and the acting is very, very good. My only issue with the movie, actually, was its use of some recognizable actors- casting semi-unknowns makes the movie more visceral, instead of having fans think, 'Oh, I saw that guy in...'.<br/><br/>Thankfully, fans of the first movie will notice that it doesn't try to ret-con anything, and the same action-focused, grainy camera work makes a welcome return. The movie moves along at a nice pace, never leaving you room to get bored.<br/><br/>Carina Chocano in the Los Angeles Times commented, ""The director's message is less overtly political than it is allegorical -- that chaos breeds chaos and that force only serves to amplify it."" Given that from the very first moment, without getting too specific, people abandoning their duties defines the movie (as it does virtually all zombie films), I would have to completely disagree. I even set upon another viewing of this movie simply for the purpose of finding an Iraq metaphor- and it's not really there; at this point, they would find a war metaphor in Disney's 'Dumbo'. Unfortunately, I'd have to say that this time, the critics are pretentiously political; so don't worry about getting preached to, as I did. If you're looking for military/force/war metaphors, look to the first film, 28 Days Later. If you're looking for an excellent, fun, gore-infested romp, watch this right afterwards."
"DICK STEEL","10","65","119","10 May 2007"," A Nutshell Review: 28 Weeks Later
","Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo takes over from Englishman Danny Boyle in the followup movie to the latter's excellent 28 Days Later, and has come up with something worthy. Should a third movie be made and doesn't screw up the good work already done, it should make a pretty neat trilogy. I enjoy the legendary George A Romero's zombies in his movies, though I have to confess I prefer those in the 28-later series, as their constant running pace provides a shot of adrenaline when our helpless victims try in futile to escape, and somehow in that reckless speed, make them truly terrifying (ok, cos I can't run, and if caught in that kind of situation, I'll be dead meat).<br/><br/>But the movie doesn't hit the ground running. In fact, it plays like the memorable soundtrack composed by John Murphy who also did the predecessor movie, and allows for the calm to ring through, before the madness of a storm begins. The horrific opening scene would have to be one of the best in the movie, before we're fast forwarded to 28 weeks later, where Robert Carlyle's Don awaits his children Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imoen Poots, a dead ringer for Cate Blanchett!). We revisit the quiet streets of London again, like in 28 Days Later, with recognizable landmarks void of people, and the city having been ravaged, now undergoes repopulation by those who managed to leave the initial onslaught of the Rage virus.<br/><br/>Before you scream ""Resident Evil!"" because of the similarities, be rest assured that this movie beats those in the Milla Juvovich vehicle anytime. What I thought if I read too deep into it, is the showcase of the US military being yet the armed forces occupying a land that is not theirs, imposing a safe, and highly secured ""green zone"" for the incoming residents to reside in, while everything outside that zone is deemed the wild west, reeked with rotting bodies and the potential of a deadly virus rearing its ugly head, ready to spark a pandemic. Probably cuts a little close to the real world, but what the heck, leave those thoughts aside and enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>It's no surprise too that while it's nice to see a crisis plan kick in when things go awry, there are enough moments which make you think twice about collateral damage in the name of greater good, and how one thing leads to another, and finally to extermination. And self- sacrifice is often a common element in zombie movies, and I thought this was handled extremely well, especially in the Carlyle's character. It's one thing to pay lip service, and another when there's a call to action.<br/><br/>I've said it before, the running zombies are a sight to behold. They're stealthy and waste no time, with the tenacity of mad rabid dogs pouncing on you with their thick bloody drool. And what makes it horrific is if you were to put yourself running away from these folks, you'll wonder exactly how long you can outlast them before they finally get to you, from all directions. Making it more difficult this time round, is the escape from the weapons of mass destruction (sorry, couldn't resist that one) that the US forces unleash, and with the snazzy CG effects, these scenes become a sight to behold, without going over the top with the effects.<br/><br/>I like many scenes in the movie, which I will not describe lest to spoil them for you. But indeed, there is great potential towards developing a cult following. For those in need of geography lessons, yes, those are the white cliffs of Dover. If there's a gripe, it'll again be the local distributor's decision to release this movie censored for its gory scenes. I noted at least 2 jarring cuts during scenes of blood lust. But let not those minor irritations get to your enjoyment."
"bob the moo","Null","19","30","1 December 2007"," Effective horror movie with pace and gore but, surprisingly, not enough in the way of desperation and fear (SPOILERS)
","I'm not ashamed to admit that I avoided this in cinemas because I genuinely find zombie movies terrifying (and yes I appreciate that they are not zombies but infected people here), mostly due to the simple desire to kill and the way that everything we take for granted collapses in regards society, morals etc. It also doesn't help that I'm not a big gore fan either and that I had heard this film was pretty bad for that too. However, as much as it scared me I did ""enjoy"" 28 Days Later and did want to see this. So on a windless sunny Saturday morning I finally got round to watching it. The opening sequence is why I both love and hate this genre  it is the utter fear and relentlessness of the infected. I was gripped by the simplicity and desperation of the situation and it very much reminded me of the first half of the original film not only in this regards but also in the way that the basic elements of society are stripped away (in this case self-preservation taking precedence over everything else).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, not unlike the first film, a plot is required to move forward with and when this arrives in earnest, so do the problems. The first signs are good as we find ourselves in a scenario that is well constructed around Iraq  with the ""safe"" zones etc. Superficially this is very clever and does allow for veiled digs at the US approach out there but wisely it doesn't force this point too much. The film somehow has to get the infection into this safe zone and as many have already said, it does it by making massive leaps of coincidence and absences of logic. The hope would be that these are overlooked because we do quickly get to the outbreak after a comparatively quiet first 40 minutes. However by keeping Don in it, the film actually continually reminds us that, even within the internal logic of the film itself, it doesn't actually make a lot of sense.<br/><br/>Keeping him and his family as a thread no matter what is also a problem because the unlikely action takes away from the sense of hopelessness and survival that this genre thrives on. Instead, as we are with the main two characters, I felt a bit remote from this, almost safe  not something I thought I would feel with this film. I don't want to sound too negative though because there are plenty of individual moments are aspects that are very good. Those who have seen Fresnadillo's Intacto will already be aware that while effective story-structuring is clearly not his thing, he is able to direct stylish and slick action. He does it at the start and he does it throughout the majority of the film, even if it is not as good as I would have liked. In ""28 Days"" we hear about an infected in a crowd and it is a chilling description. ""28 Weeks"" attempts to show us this but sadly fudges it even if it does try. The outbreak and the loss of control is well done because again it does have that desperate air of fear about it but after this it becomes more variable again. At times we get ""narrow escape"" action with ""red shirts"" in the group being sacrificed  again keeping the fear a little remote. However at other times we do lose main characters in gripping moments. The design of some scenes is brilliant as well  the night vision journey underground for example.<br/><br/>Mostly the horror comes down to being about gore more than fear and I understand why some will appreciate this. For me it just made the film feel a little bit like hard work and gore doesn't draw an emotion from me other than revulsion. You can see the increased budget here because the bloody special effects are impressive throughout. More impressively (for me) are the scenes of a deserted London  which are challenging no matter how much money you have access to. The cast are good but suffer due to the material. You can see why Carlyle was attracted; he delivers the guilt well and it is not his fault that the script keeps him around long after he should have been written out. Renner and Byrne are given more heroic characters and thus take away from this aspect but do manage to carry the basic narrative with solid performances. The two child actors avoid being cute and are reasonably good. I was quite surprised to find Elba and Perrineau (from HBO's The Wire and Oz respectively) involved and, although they have minor characters, they are convincing and have presence. As before, Murphy's score is appropriate and well used.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong by what I am saying  this is gory and quite exciting stuff that has potential in the Iraq parallels to be pretty smart. It is a success but it is a limited one partly due to the inability of the story to overcome some devices of convenience and some downright bad ideas. However for me the thing that was hardest to get away from that the absence of fear as a consistent emotion and, as much as I enjoyed the pace and the ideas, I wanted to be more involved and less of an observer."

I cannot stand films that have the ""stupid people"" in, there is always one that will open a door that they're not supposed to, etc, this film takes it to the extreme, The two kids decide they want to go back to their house, not even thinking about the ""zone"" that they're supposed to be in, jees i've never ever seen soldiers as blind as that in my life, some parts are pretty bad but there are two that finish it off, 1) They're meant to be guarding the zone, yet two children (who are now like Sam fisher by the way) manage to escape :S OK, one saw them, but the response time was terrible, they could've been infected as soon as they stepped out the containment zone.<br/><br/>2) The room where all of the people are being held to stop the rage virus from spreading. shouldn't they be guarding all doors?, especially a flimsy fire escape, (which by the way ""super zombie"" appears at) Yes, Robert Carlisle the super zombie, there is no object that can stop it!, it can magic through doors and walls, withstand biological weapons, it can even teleport into whatever scene it sees fit, why is this one zombie intent on finding these survivors anyway? I wouldn't be surprised if it resurrected after the subway incident and teleported to Paris to make the final scene! I wouldn't necessarily call this film a zombie movie, just a cliché filled ""horror"" zombies in my opinion are slow moving, walking corpses that groan a bit, not psycho Olympic sprinting bloodied men and women, that cough up blood on everything they cannot kill or destroy.<br/><br/>This was also just an excuse to blow up London (poorly i might add) they must have thought, ""this film sucks lets blow up the city to make it better"" if you wanted dramatic, they could have used a nuke, or a hydrogen fuel bomb =D I'll probably never see this or 28 days later again."

","28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the Danny Boyle art-house horror cult smash, was at the bottom of the list of movies one would look forward to. The first film was, in my opinion, an overlooked classic, it was raw, realistic and the performances from Cillian Murphy and troop where tour-DE-force. The thought of American's invading a British horror film made many worried, and it was quite distracting throughout the film, but it doesn't suffer much from it, and the film-makers wisely don't take it too far. Very much like Aliens (the action packed sequel to Alien) 28 Weeks Later is much more action orientated, and elevates the mythology of the first film to a whole new level. There are some truly thrilling moments in the film, some of the highlights being the napalm detonations, and night vision sequence in the subway, the night vision sequence is easily one of the most terrifying moments in cinema this year. The script is of high caliber, but is does have some frustrating moments, particularly the fact that most of the problems the characters face, are due to lack of communication between the characters. But these quibs are minor. Other impressive mensionables is the two young leads, who have the almighty task of carrying the film, they do a fantastic job. The film also smartly re-uses God Speed You Black Emperor and John Murphy's superb rock score, and the all round style of the first film is maintained, the only difference being the first film was shot on DV, this one on film. If your a fan of the first film, you'll go ga ga over 28 Week's, it's the quintessential blood soaked adrenaline rush, and one of the best sequels i've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Verdict: Bring a seat to hide under."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","1","35","61","13 May 2007"," Awful rehash of the first film.
","28 Weeks Later is everything we fear about sequels, it's pretty much the same film done with a bigger budget and different actors. I hated the original since it had a decent concept but strayed off into some ludicrous tangent about bad soldiers and lost any real survivalist story or focus.<br/><br/>The sequel has mainland Britain (one country apparently, not 3) repopulated with an indefinite amount of civilians under the guide of the US Military (why so, is never explained). Survivalist Robert Carlyle (an underused and brilliant actor) meets his kids, creepily androgynous son and whining daughter, as they come back from mainland Europe and introduces them to the new, empty London. But, being a simple-minded movie with no other goal other than that of killing people and offering gory deaths, this stability obviously doesn't last long and soon enough the Rage virus comes back.<br/><br/>So, as you've probably seen a million times before, the authority are incompetent, the lesser characters are stupid and jeopardise everyone by nothing thinking clearly or using common sense and everyone we are introduced to is obviously just there to eventually be killed, unceremoniously and flippantly.<br/><br/>Several plot strings are set up, but all of them meet quick dead ends (pun intended) and, like before, the film just goes in a random direction with no clear objective or way out. None of the characters are likable, so why should we care about them? And the token kid is a poor actor with a very annoying boy band hairdo.<br/><br/>The overwhelming pessimism and apathy through-out 28 Weeks Later is so alienating and shallow. We've seen a hundred movies that make the point of cheapening human life in the past few years (especially since the start of the conflict in Iraq) that it's becoming quite distasteful. Do we really need any more of these societal commentaries in horror films? Is it relevant anymore? I don't believe it is. 28 Weeks Later just seems to be jumping on the bandwagon of opportunity regarding this and as an exploitation sequel to a puzzlingly over-praised cult hit.<br/><br/>The problem doesn't just lie with the non-existent plot. The film is so horribly over-cut and under-lit you cannot really make anything out. And please don't defend this claiming it to resemble the panic on screen. Films simulated (and stimulated) panic long before this kind of editing became commonplace. It also features an obnoxiously loud sound design to compensate for the fact that film just isn't visually or kinetically engaging.<br/><br/>I wasn't impressed and I was so wishing for this film to be something special. It's boring, forgetful and has nothing new to say despite how loudly it tries to scream. Save your cash and time for something else.<br/><br/>And they're NOT zombies."

","Movie franchises are an alternately compelling and trifling study. They can be attempts to contain an entire universe (the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter stuff), to establish disparate visions from one picture to the next (the Batman and Alien pictures), or to invest the dynamics of the imagined world in the characters instead of an external cosmology, and maintain a passing continuity through self-contained films (the Spider-Man series). But whatever the goal, generating money is paramount.<br/><br/>I liked ""28 Days Later,"" but with it, Danny Boyle introduced something people hadn't seen before in zombie films, a kinetic movement in the zombies that superseded the George Romero shuffle-shuffle movements of the past three decades and translated into a fierce, fresh energy.<br/><br/>I had seen the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake from a few years ago (where that newfound kinetic motion was immediately duplicated) before getting around to ""28 Days Later,"" so it wasn't that aspect of the film that caught me, but the long final act in which the military compound is introduced. We saw it first in the guise of a safe haven, then as the sinister trap it was bound to be. Anybody could recognize the metaphors about our society's paranoia over the military establishment functioning in those scenes, and it must come across even more pointedly now than during the film's debut back in 2003. Which is one reason we now have this.<br/><br/>The other reason (besides money) is murky and troublesome. That first film was about motion, not about creating a contained universe. It wasn't about the characters or the acting, either, so now we have a new group of faces. The fabric is kept pretty much consistent with what we've already seen, right down to recycling of the original score, so even though we also get a new (hispanic) director, a reinvented vision is not realized as with the Batman and Alien movies. What does that leave us with? Why, amplifying the motion, of course.<br/><br/>In this case, you know to just forget about plot. It's simply the last forty minutes of the first film played out in a larger context with a heightening of the Military As Your Best Friend/Executioner metaphor, working towards a logical end result. What we're looking for here is the escalation of the threat conveyed in a cinematic way. The best this director musters is a sequence that stands out as a mini masterpiece, in which the anticipated reprisal of the outbreak reaches a delirious crescendo, infected and uninfected alike rush into the streets, soldiers in rooftop sniper positions eventually lose track of everything, and are ordered to fire indiscriminately on the crowd. This is so simple, the attention-deficit video game crowd it indicts could catch the symbolism. Of course, they'll ignore it. Occupying American force cuts down the local populace to the same effect as though it were a video game. Exceedingly simple. Yet well done. Yet the bottom line is that we can't do anything with it and really don't need it. Oh, and, uh, the helicopter flying low to chop up a field of zombies is a neat bit of grossness I hadn't seen before.<br/><br/>That's it. The rest is nothing to write home about. You may be mesmerized by that momentary increase in the already-established kinetics, as I was, but I'd say ""28 Months Later"" is bound to be very, very dull.<br/><br/>Blake's rating: 2 (out of 4)"

But 28 Weeks Later looked interesting, I was curious how they could do a sequel when it seemed to be a promising ending to the first, but the story here really worked! It was so disturbing and had a frightening apocalypse feeling that sent chills down my spin. The movie starts strong and ends strong and doesn't let you get a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>It starts off where in England there is a group of people who are all survivors from the Rage Virus, but they are attacked, including a married couple, it looks like all hope is lost for the wife, but the husband makes a clear escape. 28 weeks later, the US troops are sent to Britain to help destroy the virus and restore the country back. They gather all the survivors that are clean and have put them in a small part of England that is clear of the virus, but still there is so much to be done since a huge part of the country still has corpses and possible killers with the virus. The husband is reunited with his children and tells them that their mother is dead, but they want their old stuff from their old house in the unclean part of England, but they go and end up finding their surviving mom, but it seems like she may have the virus and ends up spreading it, causing total chaos! <br/><br/>This movie does not stop with the horror and never lets go, this wasn't even a matter of the jump scares in my case, I think what was so scary was the fact that this movie captured human emotions so well. What people act like in chaos, wither it's bad or good, pulling one to safety, pushing one in the way of danger to save themselves, or the simple love a family and the ultimate feeling of betrayal, fear, and helplessness. 28 Weeks Later is a terrific movie that I highly recommend, it's scary as heck and will keep you thinking for days.<br/><br/>9/10"

Once the new outbreak kicks off, when a large number of civilians are placed in a secured area for their own protection, shouldn't someone within the US military have perhaps first checked that the area actually was secure i.e. that the back door was locked? Given that those infected with the rage become blood thirsty, raging zombies with not too much intelligence, how come one of the key infected characters is waiting for our teenage heroes in a pitch dark underground station on the other side of town from the initial new outbreak? Given that the corpse inside the pizza parlour is in an advanced state of decay, how come the pizza in the box on the back of the moped looks pretty fresh?

","European horror movies used to be theatrical, low-budget and suffering from it, and badly edited. Like its predecessor, 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later is nothing like that. I must say this is one of the best horror movies I have seen (and I have seen hundreds), for a number of reasons. Although the movie does juggle many clichés, it does so kind of skillfully, so that you can really expect to be surprised. Most importantly, however, the sequel is as good as the original, which is the greatest surprise of all in the horror genre.<br/><br/>The main gimmick here, like in the original, is a mix of the zombie theme and the killer virus theme. The zombies here are extremely hyped-up, not doped, and instead of being bent on eating the flesh of the living, they behave like rage-driven human beings stripped completely of their superego and ego, and left with the instinct to fight (and yes, as it's the result of a scientific experiment gone bad, the movie can be considered sci-fi). Perhaps due to the fact that this is an European movie, we get something markedly different from the Resident Evil franchise - here, in placed of Resident Evil's focus on showcasing pretty actresses and made-up high-tech, we are treated to a foreboding feeling of isolation and powerlessness in face of helplessness and doom. We get to see normal, everyday people and faces struggling to survive, when practically everyone around them can quickly become the embodiment of evil and destruction. 28 Weeks Later focuses a little more on some action elements than, say, on the question of how long people can uphold their morality and respect for their fellow woman in such peril, but still, this movie stands proudly as a horror flick. And, like I said, it is different - with its crisp visuals (unlike the music-video lushness of a lot of Hollywood film scare), haunting and memorable music and unaffected performances. There are some loopholes in the plot, of course (e.g. really not enough few safety precautions on the part of the military for such a dangerous epidemic potential), but the movie runs smoothly throughout, and even the child actors deliver.<br/><br/>There are better movies with a similar feel (such as Children of Men), but as a sequel to a decent horror movie, 28 Weeks Later certainly stands out. By the way, I think that watching 28 Weeks Later will be an especially scary experience for Londoners, as most of it is set in London. Londoners, beware."

"jessisparkman","2","6","8","11 January 2017"," Watching this movie is like having explosive diarrhea continuously.
","If you love 28 Days Later, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. This film completely proves that even if you spend 100 minutes polishing a turd, it's still a turd. It is one terrible pile of steaming hot mess that just proves that sequels directed by a different person are more than likely just a huge waste of time. I would LOVE to have 100 minutes of my life back, but even if I did, I'd still lose out on some major dignity knowing that I have watched this movie start to finish. <br/><br/>All of the forethought, planning, effort, and budget went into the first 15 minutes of the movie, then all funding went into the CG helicopter chopping the rage zombies to bits. After those two things, they just threw in a weak story-line and Super Rage Zombie Dad to attempt to keep the story going. <br/><br/>Apparently physics is super special in England, where the fire bombing will enter through an entire building, down several flights of stairs and barricaded doorways, but won't go down an alley with Super Rage Dad. And the Volvo they were driving had the BEST ventilation system on the market to not let ANY outside air/gas in to kill the survivors. <br/><br/>And apparently Super Rage Dad has telepathic powers to know where EXACTLY his kids will be MILES away, and can somehow beat them to their locations, UNDERGROUND in a SUBWAY. If you feel like your IQ has just dropped by 15 points, you are not alone. <br/><br/>28 Days Later was fabulous, it was scary as hell and it was as realistic as it could be for the original idea that it was. The sequel??? Awful, terrible, smelly, rotten piece of crap film. The only reason it didn't get a 1 star is because Harold Perrineau is in it, and he classes up most everything he's in. <br/><br/>If you want to join the club of people who regret watching this movie, I recommend you just watch 28 Days Later instead, and pretend there's no sequel."

"andrewjerome","1","6","8","5 May 2011"," Painful to watch
","""28 Weeks Later,"" is a major disappointment. I liked the first film. This sequel is depressing, repetitive and pointless, and not scary at all. Rather than take the time to create compelling characters or a compelling story, this film just tries to run on fear. And with excessively jerky hand-held camera-work and fast editing you frequently lose track of the action and what's happening. Near misses, last-second saves, and people dying in distinctly ugly ways, is about all that can be considered story-wise. Every time the raging Londoners encounter their future victims, the soundtrack gets kicked up to eleven, not just with loud music and screaming, but with ear-shattering sounds like scraping metal, feedback, and anything else the sound team could find to startle you into submission. It is a thoroughly unpleasant, depressing, pointless, irritating and non-entertaining movie. Most post-apocalyptic thrillers make you wonder if humanity will survive before the film ends. This one makes you wonder how much of your own humanity will be lost before then."

","In the country nearby London, Don (Robert Carlyle), his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) and a few survivors live hidden in a farmhouse. When infected people break in the house, Dan panics and does not help his wife to escape, running away and leaving Alice trapped inside the room. Twenty eight weeks after the outbreak that annihilated the population of Great Britain, London is considered safe and the British survivors return under the coordination of the American Army, that keeps the city under permanent surveillance. The teenager Tammy (Imogen Poots) and her young son Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) travel back from Spain to live with their father Don in London. They miss their mother and decide to escape to their old house to retrieve pictures and some other personal belongings. However, they find Alice surprisingly alive and the Army brings her to the base. After some blood test, the biologist Scarlet (Rose Byrne) discovers that Alice is a carrier of the lethal virus and somehow has immunity to it. Meanwhile, Don sneaks through the facility to say how sorry he is to Alice, who forgives him. When he kisses her, he is immediately contaminated, spreading a new epidemic.<br/><br/>I usually do not like sequels, but ""28 Weeks Later"" is a good complement of ""28 Days Later"". The story follows the tragic epidemic in Great Britain basically from where the original movie ended, and in spite of having some flaws, it works. The frantic edition of the action scenes is confused, too close, with many cuts, in a pace of video-clip and does not offer the necessary continuity of the action to give the big picture of what is happening; actually it is terrible. The story is predictable, but entertains. The conclusion indicates the possibility of another sequel in Paris, which I hope does not come true. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Extermínio 2"" (""Extermination 2"")"
"paul-banks","9","54","110","11 May 2007"," Best sequel since 'Aliens'.
","I can easily call this the best sequel since 'Aliens'. And just like Aliens, it has a new Writer/Director behind it that keeps the quality of it's predecessor, but gives it more, ups the scale of the action, and naturally, they chuck in a lot of Yanks. And just like its predecessor, it does have a lot to say. Danny Boyle created a rather terrifying horror film. Though most of the horror isn't so much the 'zombies' violently killing everyone, but more-so the horror of infectious disease, the end of the world, as well as the role of the military in a crisis like this. Here Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has kept Boyle's essence and style, without stealing any ideas. Even just in the opening sequence, it really packs a punch, more than '28DL' did as a whole, not to mention scary and suspenseful as hell, as well as leaving you with disgust (because of the action a certain person takes, you'll know once you see it). But it only gets better. The action sequences are brilliant. One scene in particular involving helicopter blades, and severed heads come to mind that could easily put 'Planet Terror' to shame. Plus, with this film, you actually give a toss about the characters, which is very rare these days. The death of a particular one towards the end really did bother me (don't worry, i won't give a name). So if you liked 28 Days Later, or your sick to death of the teen Hollywood horrors and the 'pointless gore' horror, give this a go!"
"Quinoa1984","9","29","56","11 May 2007"," terrific as a balls-to-the-wall act of scary, nihilistic horror/action
","Juan Carlos Fresnadillo may not be Danny Boyle as far as re-inventors of a sub-genre- the plagued civilization horror movie- but considering it's only his second feature it's pretty damn impressive. He's carved out a sequel that doesn't skimp on heavy moral, and even political, implications on the subject matter, and has a hell of a time getting his masses of crowds and main characters running for their lives. 28 Weeks Later is stylized in some similar ways to its predecessor- even if, as mentioned, Boyle and his crew still has the upper hand at being a master at crafting a perpetually doomed atmosphere through production design, music, editing and cinematography- and provides some chilling scenarios to be played out in claustrophobic environments, wide-open spaces, and decaying streets. As the title suggests, we see that now London has been cleared of the infected, who've starved off, and now re-population will soon begin; soon, because there is still a process to bring people back into the fold.<br/><br/>Enter Robert Carlyle's character, who at the beginning of the film escaped from a horde of infected- leaving his wife behind in a farmhouse- who now has much security now (this is never explained, not the only unnecessary ambiguity or fault in story logic)- and is reunited with his kids. The kids, however, go out into the emptied London city, find their house, and lo and behold, their mother, who they were told by their father was gone, is there. But this leads to something much worse, leading to the three steps of ""code red"" enacted. Meaning, basically, all bets are off, by the way of the military's 'shoot to kill' scenario enacted for infected *and* uninfected, leaving the two kids on their own, almost. Fresnadillo sets up the characters well enough, and like the Romero zombie movies (maybe not quite as much as the predecessor but close) sets up a personal edge to the movie; the audience can imagine themselves in a situation like this, to the extent that morality would have to be 100% compromised. How this is also dealt with in an intriguing way- which may open up some room for exploration in the sequel- is the factor of a ""carrier"", who can be bitten but not completely absorbed by the virus. This ambiguity works much better, and the open-ended ending adds a good dosage of irony that won't be lost on much viewers even as the last big national monument comes into view.<br/><br/>Fresnadillo as director, meanwhile, does something that I usually dislike in movies, which is that ultra-frantic, hyper-active use of the camera and editing machine where everything is rapid fire in action scenes. It comes about a hair's edge at being the trashy side of Tony Scott, but somehow the filmmakers keep it very tight in execution, making things always on the verge of danger and dread for the characters. Only sometimes are there fully engrossing angles or set-ups like in the original, but nevertheless a sequence like the breakout of the quarantine- where all of the lights are off except for lighters and flashlights as infected swarm over a hundred people trapped in a basement- and the sequence that follows with the extermination out in the court via snipers, are staggering displays of tension and ture, fist-clenching horror. The many scenes of running, and more running, as chases go on and more infected spread, and bodies become torn in pieces, are still engrossing, but it's when Fresnadillo and company get in the close-confined areas, the dark tunnel with green sniper-vision as example, that are reminiscent of not just the best parts of 28 Days Later, but are some of the scariest scenes of the decade.<br/><br/>So why not a masterpiece? It may be for some, especially die-hard genre fans. The characters, being children, do edge off into the conventions that become irksome, though that will have to be a given in order to continue onward. The kids, however, are pretty good at their parts, and as the script hurdles them through one big cluster-f*** after another they stay firm in what is in the subtext quite the wretched coming-of-age story for them. Overall, 28 Weeks Later is a rough but rewarding large-scale plague movie with keen craftsmanship and is better than most of what's called 'horror' today."
"steffmcmullan","4","23","43","10 May 2007"," A bit of a let down
","Having seen this as part of a free preview i have to say I'm glad i never paid to see it. While its not a terrible film, its just not a good one either, and definitely not as good as the original in the end. Don't get me wrong, the opening 45 - 50 minutes (up until things start to go wrong) but it just goes downhill from there.<br/><br/>There are a few small plot holes in the beginning, and they just get bigger as it goes on. The smallest plot hole being when the US colonel mentions that the Virus doesn't seem to cross species, when anyone who has seen the original will know thats how it all started. But thats forgivable, as they are a foreign force that could be misinformed about the outbreak.<br/><br/>I felt the start of the film had the same atmosphere and intensity of 28 Days, but then just turned into a run of the mill violent horror we are used to seeing churned out of Hollywood.<br/><br/>I had a big problem with the way the 'safe zone' was protected with one security fence that the infected easily breached. Robert Carlisle's character seems to get limitless access to sensitive areas of the district despite being just a survivor of the original outbreak. Some people might like to believe the US military is run by some country bumpkins, but that was just a stupid piece of writing.<br/><br/>Worth going to see if you are curious. But ultimately a let down in the end."

","This is not just another bland sequel to a great movie! This film actually holds its own until the final frame, never letting up. 28 weeks later single-handedly restored my faith in horror, taking its audience to new levels of violence, mayhem, gore, and dread. The music was perfect,no whiny pop crap, just throbbing instrumentals carrying the scenes of chaos. Gore-hounds will not be disappointed, the blood runs in the streets of a deserted London and beyond. True horror buffs will recognize a possible nod to Lucio Fulci in one scene, see if you can spot it. This is not a film for the faint of heart or of stomach. It's rated R for a reason, so leave the kids at home! At the showing I went to, some twit had brought their 4 year-old to this movie! The poor kid was terrified, and had to be constantly comforted by the parents, nearly ruining the movie for everyone else.

I felt it isn't as good a the first one although it clearly had a much larger budget.<br/><br/>The good. It has a great cast and the first ten minutes which set up the rest of the movie are great. Idris Elba is excellent and it seems is now the voice of common sense in everything he appears in. The Americans are well cast and well written and acted as decent but disinterested observers. Jeremy Renner was understated and excellent.<br/><br/>The bad The key problem I have with this movie is some general plot weakness, the reliance on the standard horror ""do scary things in dark rooms with flickering lights"" and annoying kids.<br/><br/>The survivors should have been the tiny minority who through a combination of strength,bravery, cowardice, luckiness, sneakiness and meanness made it when everyone else didn't. This was pretty well represented by the core survivors in the first movie 28 Days later and by Robert Carlyle's behavior in this movie. The behavior of the rest of survivors in this movie made it seem like they all should be been wiped out in day 1 of the first one. <br/><br/>The whole code red thing seemed silly. We have two options , wait 50 days again and everyone bad dies or put everyone in the same room turn all the lights off and blow everything up.<br/><br/>The kids actually had the survivor spirit even though they weren't survivors however I wanted them shot early in the movie. Imogen Poots seems to be a decent actor but her only role here seemed to be scream ""Andy Andy Andy"" in a grating and unpleasant way as often as possible. They offered no empathy or apology for their role in what occurs. Offing or at least slapping one or both of them early on in the movie would have had the triple benefit of cheering me up, adding to the grittiness of the plot and perhaps made 28 months later a possibility. <br/><br/>Worth watching but if they do make a third movie get Danny Boyle back to direct or Alex Garland to write."

","28 days later (not a typo) stood apart from other horror movies because of its real life survival of the fittest theme.

The first 28 minutes of 28 weeks later are Awesome (I vote them 10 out of 10 easily)! In fact it's worth seeing/renting just for that. The first sequence is strictly survival of the fittest (fastest), hesitate and you die. Charles Darwin would be proud. There's none of that horror film ""romance"" that we are all tired of seeing.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie involves stupid kids doing stupid things and the whole conflict could have been prevented if one soldier was guarding one door to one very important room. Pretty much like every other movie in this highly clichéd genre. The fact that the writers are not the originals shows; they pretty much produced an inferior copy of the original. However cinematography is great throughout and I absolutely love the sound track.<br/><br/>The ending sets the story up for a third movie, I believe for no other reason than the fact that everything else is coming in trilogies these days and the writers followed suit because that's what all the cool kids are doing."
"jdesando","Null","38","80","9 May 2007"," Not a bad thing.
","28 Weeks Later, the sequel to 28 Days Later, gamely carries on the tradition of intelligent zombie movies. The rage virus is back, and two kids may carry the antibody in their blood. Get them the hell out of a London that in its griminess rivals the stunning cinematography and dark set design of Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men.<br/><br/>Tough for me to advise anyone to leave the greatest town on earth, but the heroes need to go across the sea, getting there bloodier than ever. Although the new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is more interested in special effects and quick cutting than the original's Danny Boyle, he does spare the outright revulsion should we ever see what cannibalism looks like up close, personal, and slow.<br/><br/>The dark passages and twisting camera, coupled with machine-gun rapid shots, make the movie frequently inscrutable, not a big deal to horror fans but a frustration to us commoners who think the premise has promise of showing human nature at its Darwinian worst if we can only figure out what's happening. That mysterious mise en scene keeps us from connecting with the principals as we did with Cillian Murphy's and Naomie Harris's characters in 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>But gore is to the fore, and that's just fine with those who first screamed at zombies in George Romero's Night of the Living Dead and laughed at them in Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead. What I said about 28 Days Later shows what's missing in its sequel: ""The eerie set design is appropriate without being overdone (Rod Serling would have approved its restraint), the characters are real without being overwrought (especially the women, who are usually sacrificed to too much emoting), and the subtexts about contemporary crises are clear without distracting from the science fiction genre itself."" Correlations with HIV and Iraq are not as easy as they were with the original.<br/><br/>It's a nail biter and organ orgy, with just enough scary false starts and stupid people. I was engaged the whole time, except when an attractive film critic gave me her zombie embrace out of sheer fright. That's not a bad thing."
"logan434","10","25","50","10 September 2007"," This is the way a sequel must be filmed...
","The first ''28 days later'', was a surprise for the horror-genre fans, (especially the zombie-fans) in the 2002, directed by Danny Boyle (Transpoitting) and introducing Cillian Murphy to the commercial cinema. The movie presented the Rage Virus, an experiment capable of infect a human being in few secs, turning the host into an aggressive and blood vomiting individual that went out of the hands of the British Government and cause the extermination of all its population. <br/><br/>The contagion risks where highest than in other Zombie/films, especially in the George A. Romero ones: <br/><br/>1.- Even the minimum drop of blood, or even a scratch could cause an infection; and: <br/><br/>2.- As a plus to all this films, this creatures had the capability of run as fast as you can. And it is also worth of writing that the score: ''In the House, in a heartbeat'' by John Murphy, give the movie an special pace at the ending. <br/><br/>Considered by many a cult classic, now, 4 years later, it comes a sequel to the original, directed by the Prodigious Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, and staring Robert Carlyle (who declined a role for the first one) this movie knows how to keep the same rules of the infection, and does it with unexpected drama and lots of tension.<br/><br/>Early in the movie, just with the opening sequence you know that Fresnadillo it's everything but a dumb director, unlike P.W. Anderson, or Alexander Witt, he knows how to make a simple action sequence into a suffocating, nerves of steel one.<br/><br/>Also, John Murphy's ''In the House, in a Heartbeat'' is back, and is better than ever, with 3 inclusions through the feature.<br/><br/>With the help of the fast editing and the handy cam,(elements that fuel this sequel with images of cruelty and realism) it's delivered to us a movie that, if it fails in deliver something, is in a optimistic point of view of the humanity, where our relations decay and our children are the ones who inherit the violence and fear of our age.<br/><br/>The plot, if you don't know it yet, is the re-population of London after 28 weeks later the first movie, and it focus in the life of Don (Carlyle) and his children, the Harris, whose mother disappeared in the holocaust. But like any horror movies, everything goes bad, as we found out there is still traces of the virus in London. Soon the infection spreads through its new population and now the Harris must find a way out of this mess.<br/><br/>It doesn't surpass the original, but it's nearly as great as the first one, specially in the suspense, it's a high tension horror movie, and i widely recommend it to you."

"Coventry","8","16","30","7 October 2007"," No heroes ... Only agony.
","Unlike most of the people with whom I discuss horror movies, I wasn't too impressed with this movies predecessor, the acclaimed ""28 Days Later"" directed by Danny Boyle. It was an intense and hugely atmospheric genre-reviver, but definitely not the horror masterpiece many fans claimed it to be. These same people were equally enthusiast and wild raving about the sequel ""28 Weeks Later"" and, despite my initial skepticism, I wholeheartedly have to agree this time! Though still not perfect and inevitably suffering from the same shortcomings as the original, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's movie is a superior achievement in every department and easily one of the most disturbing and effectively petrifying stories that got unleashed upon cinema audiences throughout the past few decades. The atmosphere in ""28 Weeks Later"" is continuously grisly and ominous, the on screen carnage is relentless and sickening, the London settings (or what remains of them) are depressing and the frequently repeated theme song 'In a House, in a Heartbeat' immensely contributes to the overall ambiance of pure damnation & hopelessness. ""28 Weeks Later"" represents pure and genuine terror, but unfortunately that definition also covers some implausible situations and plot twists.<br/><br/>The story is rudimentary simple but a logical follow-up to the events of the first film. In the aftermath of the disastrous epidemic that exterminated nearly the entire British population, US army forces have taken control of the London area and slowly begin to repopulate the save regions with survivors. Among them is Donald Harris (Robert Carlyle in another mesmerizing performance), who was forced to abandon his wife Alice following an attack by infected people in the countryside. His children return from abroad as well and promptly escape from the quarantined zone to recover souvenirs of their mother from the parental house. This series of events causes the second outbreak of the feared virus but also raises hope to develop a vaccine, as the Harris' kids apparently are immune to the effects of the infection. I honestly admired how this film, even more than the original, doesn't feature any heroic characters or daredevils. All the characters are real and identifiable people, living in dreadful fear and responding to dangerous ordeals reasonably. Even the few rational Americans that disobey orders to rescue the Harris' children remain vulnerable and just as mortal as the people running from the gunfire.<br/><br/>Admittedly, you sometimes deliberately have to ignore some major plot holes and downright impossible story elements. It's highly unusual, for example, that the children could (or even wanted to) leave the safety zone unauthorized and explore the wastelands, especially for something as banal as a photograph. Also, I understand Donald's job as a caretaker in the safety zone granted him access to most of the buildings there, but does that really include the secluded military laboratories and top secret evidence rooms? The hardest aspect to acknowledge is the unexplained behavior of Carlyle's character once he turned into one of the infected. He alone seems to have developed a quite impressive portion of intellect, orientation and reasoning skills suddenly, because he slyly escapes the military's drastic extermination measures and successfully follows the trail of his fleeing offspring through the destroyed city. All these, and a couple more, are obvious errors in the script that threaten to bring down the impression that ""28 Weeks Later"" had on you, but the good news is that they won't necessarily bother you during the actual viewing; only afterwards. During the film itself, particularly when you watch it on a big cinema screen, you're most likely to be overwhelmed by the virulent action, large-scaled annihilation attacks and nauseating massacres. Perhaps another slight demerit involves the chaotic digital camera-work. Again, just as in its predecessor, the wild attacks of the infected are too often unclear and overly hectic and some of the pivot sequences are difficult to follow. The editing is roughly handled at times, but it fits the overall barbaric tone on the film. ""28 Weeks Later"" was one of the first movies in a long time that actually managed to scare and disturb me. Numerous sequences are extremely powerful and irreversibly burnt in my memory as genuinely unsettling, like the bombing footage, the night vision perspective in the London underground and Robert Carlyle chased by dozens of ravenous ex-people during the intro. Fresnadillo's directing is magnificent and surefooted, which is quite an accomplishment as well, considering it's only his second long-feature movie; following ""Intacto"" in 2001."

Overall, it was an awful experience watching this movie, nothing could be consider as ""stand out"" the entire time.

","Zombie movies always have been around, from as early on as the 30's. In 1968 George A. Romero changed the genre for ever with ""Night of the Living Dead"" and he perfected the genre with his movie ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 1978. From that moment on, lots and lots of film-makers tried to have a go at the genre, with often some bad formulaic B-horror movies as an end result. ""28 Weeks Later"" and the previous movie ""28 Days Later..."" are basically the first, non George A. Romero involved zombie-flicks, made in the same horror style as those earlier mentioned Romero movies.<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"" chooses a realistic approach, so don't expect a movie with heroic character, blowing zombie's heads off. The movie is possibly even better as a study of human behavior instead.<br/><br/>It's realism is being strengthened by its visual look. The camera-work puts you right into the middle of things and the movie never exaggerated with its action of gore.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that ""28 Weeks Later"" isn't a gory movie to watch though. As far as zombie movies go, this is actually one very gory movie to watch, with lots of blood and guts and body pieces flying around, so you have been warned.<br/><br/>It's a direct sequel to ""28 Days Later..."" but its also a sequel that is using different characters and story lines. Therefor this movie remains perfectly good to watch even for those that have never seen ""28 Days Later..."". Not only the actors are different but there also is a different director at the helm this time. Danny Boyle passed on the honers to Spanish film-maker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. Danny Boyle still remained closely involved though and his hand is still clearly visible throughout the movie. He even directed some of the second unit work for the movie.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's influence is also notable in the movie its cast. Robert Carlyle already almost got a role in ""28 Days Later..."" and Rose Byrne had already appeared in the Boyle movie ""Sunshine"".

","The movie is lousy with plot holes, logical inconsistencies and lazily cut out characters.<br/><br/>Probably the first major WTF moment came when 2 children breech a military 'green zone' perimeter within hours of seeing it and with no apparent plan beyond 'sneak'.<br/><br/>The next; was that a random dude who is now the superintendent of one of the residential buildings has access to the absolutely most secure areas of a military quarantine facility for no conceivable reason, furthermore there are apparently no doctors, nurses or guards monitoring quarantined people.<br/><br/>From then on; things just snow ball and the only way to enjoy the movie is to switch off your brain off and let your eyes glaze over.<br/><br/>I have noticed that there is quite an anti-military theme running through both of the ""28.."" movies -with the kidnapping, murder, sexual slavery (possible war crime) in the first and the mass murder of civilians (war crime), using of chemical weapons on a civilian population center (war crime) in the second.<br/><br/>Probably the best indication of this movies poor plot is the massive and frankly unbelievable levels of ongoing incompetence that is required to keep the story stumbling forward."

","forget anything that happened in the original film because it won't be relevant to this one.<br/><br/>Robert Carlisle is rubbish in this. But he's not to blame for the awful script and filming.<br/><br/>this film suffers from all the problems the original did.<br/><br/>far too much filming in the dark or in low light where you can't see anything happening.<br/><br/>far too many fast cuts from shot to shot.<br/><br/>the fact that we're dropped into an attack right at the start and then shown the progress of the disease dying out in Britain, people being introduced back by American forces.<br/><br/>1st goof is the plane that lands at London Airport but disembarks at Heathrow, miles away.<br/><br/>Bob Carlise's kids are brought back to live with him and they stupidly decide to go to their old house to find a picture of their mother despite the fact they have been warned how dangerous this is.<br/><br/>I was surprised they weren't shot and killed as they were detected on the bridge (oh, and the person who thought that tourist boat was a goof? It could have quite easily been a NATO Patrol Boat).<br/><br/>Ignore the fact that their mother survived the attack at the cottage AND made it back to their own home in London.<br/><br/>It's obvious someone's going to get infected when we find out the wife is a carrier (her room wasn't constantly guarded from the outside, I think thats a pretty huge goof right there) and poor old Bob is that person.<br/><br/>One of the best goofs is the radio message authorising the use of Non-Lethal Force. So they can't kill anyone there then.<br/><br/>I'm sure he got blood on his sons face in the underground car park and the son definitely did get blood on him from another infected when they were all getting shot.<br/><br/>I still can't work out exactly how the son escaped that either. The fact that he ""manages"" to find his sister and the friendly Doctor in all that confusion was a bit too much to believe.<br/><br/>Most of this film is too dark to actually see what's going on, adding to the confusion of what little awful plot is still left. Especially the sequences where they run from the sniper whilst trying to meet the chopper in Regents Park.<br/><br/>The fact that the area gets bombed and then there's the really pointless and stupid radio message authorising the use of Chemical weapons really kicks hard at the American Military and their love of overkill.<br/><br/>The chopper pilot saying he's going to be with them in 60 seconds, well, i'm sorry but that's utter tripe as they'd already be able to hear him coming towards them.<br/><br/>A huge point is don't the infected ever get tired? Or are unaffected by lactic acid build-up in the muscles that occurs when you run? Not even world class sprinters can run that fast for extended periods. They'd get tired, get muscle fatigue.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure what the white smoke was supposed to be but they wouldn't have been much safer inside that car they took shelter in as it wouldn't be airtight. Possibly it was some sort of chemical agent as they had authorised the use of chemical weapons earlier on in the movie.<br/><br/>The delta force guy saying he'll meet them at the stadium. Er, which stadium? Did we miss a whole scene or something? he'd asked for an extract but never did anyone say where that next extract actually was.<br/><br/>It was pretty laughable that they expected us to believe a Volvo estate could outrun a military helicopter shooting at it. And then annoying us even more by going into the underground to have yet another excuse to film somewhere dark and meaning we can't watch the film again.<br/><br/>I don't understand why the woman with the night-sight wasn't leading the way (which would have been the most sensible thing) instead of trying to guide the 2 kids.<br/><br/>Once the infected guy attacked them after they had fallen over in the dark and lost each other they may as well have ended the film right there because he was going to have killed all 3 of them anyway.<br/><br/>It was too hard to believe the boy would have managed to wander off so far away from the girl and the Doctor (he didn't hear them shouting his name, he didn't hear the doctor screaming as she was being attacked, he didn't think to start shouting their names the second he lost contact with them both?).<br/><br/>To suddenly show infected Bob Carlise still alive (unlikely, he'd have been killed in the bombing) and then equally as suddenly introduce a gun to kill him (if the doctor had a gun why didn't SHE use it to defend herself a few scenes earlier?) made the film really really stupid.<br/><br/>By this time, anyone with even 1 braincell wouldn't be willing to suspend belief any further. You now have to wonder if the people who made this actually set out to insult the viewers intelligence on purpose.<br/><br/>When he asks ""am I one of them"" she blatantly lies to him and even as a 12 year old he's got to know she's lying and he's infected.<br/><br/>Another good goof is them getting Wembley Stadium wrong, and using the new one and not trying to digitally insert the old stadium. Clearly the pilot saw the blood on both the kids but took them anyway (I think he'd have shot them).<br/><br/>The predictable ending of them infecting France and leaving it opening for another sequel shows how pointless this whole film was.<br/><br/>Best Avoided like the plague."

","As the name suggests, months have passed since the catastrophic events of the first film. But now the infected, the Ragers, have died of starvation and the British Isles are slowly being re-inhabited. But, of course it's not that simple.<br/><br/>I thought the first film was okay. Not great, but okay. It had some really good action and the zombies - or the Ragers, because none of these movies dare use the Z-word - were an actual, legitimate threat. It had some social commentary, some good acting and a decent ending.<br/><br/>I also like the idea of this film franchise on paper. Examining the same zombie outbreak in its different stages. First some days later, then weeks, and then presumably months or even years. 28 Years Later could be something we've never seen before in this genre.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's unclear whether this sequel is strong enough to warrant a third movie. Because while it keeps some of the strengths of the original - the scary zombies and the social commentary - it just isn't that strong of a movie by itself. The action especially takes a heavy nosedive. The film seems to think that the way to shoot action is to have the whole screen pitch black and then flash the lights every couple of seconds while people grunt and moan in the dark. As you can probably imagine, this makes all the action scenes nigh impossible to follow or appreciate.<br/><br/>The whole film also has this cold, clinical look to it. I remember the first film looking much warmer, like a real civilization in ruins. This looks like an IKEA catalog with some zombies added.<br/><br/>Not a terrible film by any means, and if you liked the first one, then this might be worth a watch.

Enough to send shivers down one's spine. Which is what for me helps make this film really sing out as a great example of the genre, a film one can identify with it so much more. It's not impossible to imagine London decimated by a fast moving virus (look at aids in Africa), though it is for me harder to imagine that the Americans could actually get anything 'controlled' with in six months. So I did find the first half of the film to be a bit too pro-American, muscle flexing propaganda. However it was interesting to watch events unfold.<br/><br/>Though I felt I was always a step ahead of the narrative this did not distract from the power of the characterisation and the empathy one feels for the characters as you watch the world fall apart around them.<br/><br/>The one powerful lesson I think chaps everywhere can take from this is that they must be very careful when and where they abandon their wives.

","I don't get why some films lack so much in story telling. Why spend millions on actors and special effects, when the story has ridiculous amounts of holes in it? I know that 28 weeks later was never supposed to be an ultra realistic film (it's a zombie flick after all!), but come on... When I'm sitting there trying to convince myself that 'this could have happened for that reason, or that could have happened for this reason', it really takes away from the enjoyment.<br/><br/>Everything seemed to be going great at the start of the film. The setup was really good, the opening scene had a lot of tension and the story was well introduced with the father making his selfish decision.<br/><br/>Everything turned sour when the kids left the secure zone.<br/><br/>I thought there was guards all along the gate, guns all over the place. They were seen leaving and reported immediately, yet it took about 2 hours for them to be regathered?! The mother was discovered to be a carrier, yet there wasn't one guard watching over her, and the father could access her holding room with his caretaker swipe card?! All the civilians were locked into a big room for safety and containment, yet the back door was fairly easily opened up by zombie-dad. Was that his skeleton swipe card (do zombies know what swipe cards are?) again or just dumb luck? I could go on, but I wont. The point is, it's really not that hard to tell a story that makes logical sense. 28 days later was brilliant, and one of the things I most liked about it was that it seemed like that is how real people would react and they are the very real situations they would find themselves in. 28 weeks later took a high-tension unsettling film and delivered a mindless, boring, formulaic action sequel."

The action is fast-paced, accompanied by a musical score that intensifies the growing sense of doom as attempts to contain and eradicate a lethal disease unravel with catastrophic results. The scope of this movie is reminiscent of The Body Snatchers and The Day of the Triffids, the latter an excellent, and now all-but-forgotten, sci-fi story.

","Let me preface this, 28 Weeks Later is just one big allegory. One Big, Dumb allegory.<br/><br/>The first movie, ""28 days later"", featured subtle undertones of racial, sexual tension. But alas, ""Weeks"" features nothing less than the blatant, bigoted opinions of a politically charged Spanish director: The U.S. takes control of a territory with the intention of liberating, or ""purifying"" the British Isles only to have matters careen and blow vastly out of proportion. Much like the current state of Iraq, nay? <br/><br/>The premise is reminiscent of the first, but the tact is gone, as subtlety is cast aside in favor of the Hollywood-esquire appeal of ultra-violent imagery. Which, again, may be just a metaphor for our American bloodlust, but wow is this poorly executed. There is simply no need for this much political commentary in anything short of a michael moore film. Some of the already sparse audience did leave during a particularly long, bloody scene, illustrating my alleged claim of tasteless violence.<br/><br/>But what of the characters? What about them? They feature treacherous dads, an obnoxious kid, his particularly fine sister, an altruistic and morally just soldier, and a military physician out to reveal her higher nature. None of them can anyone develop a particular attachment towards, and the dodgy plot haphazardly follows them through an illogical sequence in London. The movie frusterates, disgusts, frusterates, disgusts, and lastly ends in disgrace. The Kids just complicate and perpetuate problems, but without them, the series would have concluded with ""28 Days Later"".<br/><br/>Does this film do anything right? That adrenaline-fueled camera from the first movie is back. It does right in the opening scenes to convey panic and portrays the confusion well in a manner that almost inserts the audience in the movie. But that about does it. The remaining 100 minutes blow and conclude in a manner that.. well.. sucks. Tries too hard is all.<br/><br/>This movie is not worthy of a rating of 2 out of 10, but my partiality to zombie movies musters this one more point."

What followed was an hour and a half of a dire, formulaic drivel, which left the audience wondering when something that was reminiscent of a script, would begin.<br/><br/>The character development was absolutely zero, just a series of clichéd lines; the funniest of all was ""Its OK, it's just a flesh wound"".

"couching_tiger_eatin_popcorn","1","9","17","25 November 2007"," Irritating waste of time
","Where do I start. It fails as a horror film, as a drama, and as a sequel. This sequel basically took the first movie, 28 Days Later, and stripped it free of anything positive. Then they added some military firepower. That's it in a nutshell. The first movie had a bad script, but good cinematography, excellent music, likable characters, fun direction, and at least a coherent premise and story. This one has a worse script, headache-inducing cinematography, bad music, main characters you wouldn't give a damn about, boring direction, and no semblance of a story--they actually detract from an important premise from the first movie.<br/><br/>As a horror film, there is absolutely no tension. This just inundates the audience with a bunch of shaky shot amongst the running infected, and shots of the US army gassing and firebombing everyone in London. It doesn't even attempt to draw fear, nor any anticipation--it just lays out some blood (not even a lot), some far away shots of the dead, and some shots of skeletons. ""Here, be scared. It's not scary? Too bad."" <br/><br/>It fails as a drama because of a bad story and terrible characters. It manages some jumbled story about a family that not only makes no sense, it draws no empathy nor any sympathy. The main characters, the kids, are the most irritating couple of kids I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It fails as a sequel because of the liberties they took with the original premise. My biggest gripe is that they just completely abandoned the premise that the infected will not be active during daytime, probably for the sake of making it easier and cheaper to shoot. Great way to alienate fans of the first film.<br/><br/>Although the comparison is somewhat asymmetrical, I think this movie's more of a war/survival film than anything else. Any real threat of death does not come from the infected; it comes from several different military attack strategies. I don't think that's what the producers were shooting for, but that's what they ended up with. On a side note, the film makers obviously had nothing positive to say about the competence and morality of the US army. I welcome political discussions in films, but these guys are waaaayyy in over their heads <br/><br/>I truly wanted to just stop watching in the middle. It's boring and painfully long. I cared for none of the characters, wanted them to just die off as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Terrible."
"L. Lion","2","9","17","6 June 2007"," 28 Weeks Later sucks
","28 Days Later, the precursor to 28 Weeks Later, is one of the best zombie movies ever made. Admittedly this isn't saying much, but it develops its story intelligently, builds character, and is suspenseful and incredibly frightening. Although the third act, with the mad soldiers, was something of a let-down, the overall movie-going experience was one that created shivers down the spine.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later starts out rather promisingly - a confusing, if frightening, attack by the infected on a house of hold-outs in the British countryside (and Robert Carlyle abandoning his wife to the infected) before it switches to what happens six months later when, under the auspices of the US Army, London is being reclaimed.<br/><br/>Carlyle's character, Don, welcomes his children back from a refugee camp in Spain. They are the first children allowed back into the country. All of the infected have been dead several months due to starvation. The children break quarantine to visit their old house, and wonder of wonders, they find their mother still alive. Although she is infected, she seems to have some inborn, genetic resistance to the infection, although she still carries the infection. Carlyle gets in to see her, they kiss - and surprise! Carlyle is now one of the infected. Since the first 40 minutes of the film is spent developing Carlyle as a character, now that he is one of the infected, he is gone as a hero. Who does this leave the audience to root for? His children? Rose Byrne as the heroic doctor? These are characters we barely know, and their plight is handled so badly by the director, I couldn't find myself building any sympathy as they fled the coming chaos.<br/><br/>From this point forward the rest of the film is a waste of celluloid. The actions of the American military make no sense in the face of a new outbreak - they herd all the uninfected civilians into one enclosed area without any weapons and then leave them there - this is possibly the WORST WAY to try to prevent spread of the infection, since if one infected gets into this area it virtually guarantees that everyone there will become infected.<br/><br/>After that happens, the American military again does something remarkably stupid - a blank-check order to kill everything moving. At this point the ""protagonists"" - and the remaining characters are so thin that it is hard to imagine anyone answering to that description - are now on the run from the infected and also from the US military, which is fire-bombing London. Added to this fact is that the director's idea of shooting action scenes is to turn down the lights and shake the camera during the entire scene, creating a confusing, barfatonic effect to his action while providing no information to the audience as to what is going on and thus destroying suspense. People die, and we have no idea who they are or what they mean. We have to wait for the characters to reach a room with lights to determine who is still alive.<br/><br/>The entire second half of this film is shot in a confusing manner, provides no sense of suspense for the audience, and is emotionally empty. This is one of the worst films I have seen this year. 28 Weeks Later sucks."

Military wanting to kill their possibly only hope of a cure? Check! Military then leaving that cure undefended? Check! Zombies instantaneously overrunning super-prepared compound? check! Military immediately gunning down people they went to great lengths of trouble to protect? The list goes on and on, and none of it makes any kind of sense, it's all just an excuse to go on to the next scene in which some zombies supposedly infect or kill some more people; what they do exactly is impossible to make out due to the aforementioned horrible editing.<br/><br/>Also, this movie left me utterly cold. They few characters there are in the movie are not developed at all, they hardly say a thing.

","There is a lot of questionable editing in this movie. Whenever there's action, screen is littered with a lot of random shots which job is to portray the carnage which is going on, but it looks out of place and is not necessary. Romero's zombie movies are a perfect example of that, though zombies in this movie are much more fast, so it can be explained that way, but it still feels hard to watch. Movie redeems itself with a few cool dreadful scenes and with a lot of tension throughout the movie, which replaces the scares of the first one. All in all, it's a decent movie, just don't expect something on an art level. It's just a movie to watch for fun ( because characters don't really succeed in making you care for them that much ) ."

"dominicpearson","7","3","4","31 December 2009"," An enjoyable sequel that doesn't quite get it right...
","Being a huge fan of 28 Days Later and knowing the impact that this has had on UK cinema I was looking forward to 28 Weeks Later but with an air of concern. Surely the follow up cannot be as iconic and hard hitting as the original? When I found out that it had little involvement by Danny Boyle I was even more wary.<br/><br/>How wrong I was. What we have here is a fast paced, stylish, brutal in places but never boring sequel. It cannot live up to the impact of Days but it doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The premise is simple: It is 28 Weeks after the outbreak of the Rage virus. Britain is completely empty and the infected have starved to death. In come the US Army to oversee the re-population of the country starting with a small section of London. We are told that 15,000 people have been repatriated already.<br/><br/>The opening scenes of the film take off almost directly where the last finished, albeit with a different set of survivors. Robert Carlyle's character is faced with a decision the impact of which resonates through the entire film and provides a platform for the film to strike its own identity from Days. In my opinion, this decision is a rational one and as tough as it must be for the character it makes perfect sense - why throw yourself into inevitable death when there is a chance of escape, regardless of who you are trying to save!! The film moves on pretty fast paced from here. <br/><br/>The characters are brought together in London, we find out that the wife/mother is not dead and, indeed, whilst being infected may hold a cure to the virus. Likewise her children may also carry the same genetic code that could save the world. From here it is only a matter of time before the virus re-awakens and it does so in shocking circumstances.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyles transformation into an infected shocked me. The shock and the gore served a purpose, however, and drove the film forward. His infection is different to those seen in Days, it is as if he has retained a degree of his humanity and this mixed with the Rage virus makes him even more dangerous. His poor, poor wife - what a way to go!! Up to this point I cannot fault the film. <br/><br/>It starts to lose marks when the focus of the story turns onto the escape of the children. I just felt there was something lacking here. I fully understood and accepted the actions that the army had to take and felt the dilemma that those shooters faced. The firebombing was unexpected (and a beautifully shot scene) but I cannot see how the children could have escaped in 4 minutes or how the fire did not reach the one street that Robert Carlyle's infected was standing on.<br/><br/>I felt that the rest of the film was an exercise of style over substance, that there was too much of an effort to recapture the iconic scenery of Days (I for one still get scared whenever I travel through an underground section of the motorway and Im 31!!). After setting up the story so strongly in the opening half it fell by the wayside to some extent. Thats not to say that the thrill of the chase was not enjoyable, just that the focus seemed to be too much on the children escaping the army rather than escaping the infected.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my main problem wit the film: I can believe that Doyle would turn his back because what he was being asked to do was tantamount to murder. The helicopter pilot, however, is another issue. I do not see there being any reason for him to break protocol, to enter into an act of desertion and to risk taking people who have been in direct contact with the infected outside of the quarantine area.<br/><br/>But these are the small gripes of an over pedantic film lover who has to try and find some fault!! Overall this is a very decent sequel but does not fall into that rarest of categories of sequels better than the original. It keeps you watching and is brilliantly shot but at the end of the 2 hours I was left feeling a little flat. I would recommend it to fans of the first film but would also suggest not going in with overly high expectations."
"cchase","9","3","4","5 December 2008"," Home Is Where The HELL Is...
","When approaching sequels, especially in these dark, writers' strike-filled times, I always feel a sense of nausea, fear and intense loathing. And I'm sure I'm not alone in this...especially after some horrendous cinematic turds like the AVP sequel, (the last one, not the most recent) which looked awesome and played like it had been rewritten by that mentally crippled kid on THE SIMPSONS. <br/><br/>Well, I got the same feeling with 28 WEEKS LATER, only more so, because Danny Boyle in his wonderfully insidious way, had taken the ""zombie"" genre and stood it on its head, literally, giving us a harrowing, horrifying and downright traumatizing experience not soon to be forgotten. How in the hell is some director you've never heard of with a virtually no-name cast going to hope to equal THAT?<br/><br/>Well, as it turned out, director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (ENTACTO) did one hell of a job, putting his own stamp on an ever-deepening, nightmarish glimpse into a man-made Hell that has no foreseeable exits - no happy endings around the corner here! And in his own, sneaky way, working with co-writers Rowan Joffe, Jesus Olmo and Enrique Lopez Lavigne, Fresnadillo trumps Boyle's insidious gambit by adding just a little something extra...presenting this next chapter in the series in the context of a domestic family/survival drama. <br/><br/>It is exactly 28 weeks after the mind-numbing events of 28 DAYS. London is a ghost town. The last of the infected victims of the rage virus have finally died, most probably from starvation. And working in tandem with the Brits, here we come, the big, bad Yanks to save the day and help clean up and repopulate the eerily quiet streets with Londoners who are anxious to get back to lives that are as normal as possible, under the circumstances. <br/><br/>One of those people is Don (the always-dependable Robert ""RAVENOUS"" Carlyle), who can't wait to be reunited with his kids, daughter Tammy (Imogen Poots) and young son Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), both of whom were going to school abroad in the U.S. when everything across the pond went 'tits up', and who have been living as refugees since before the ""repopulation"" effort began. Their reunion is a happy one, but not without a few dark spots. One of them being that their mother, Alice (Catherine McCormack) is not there with Don, having fallen victim to ""the infected"" during a horrifying attack that opens up the movie. <br/><br/>Alas, but there's much more to the tragic story than that, and what it is, I'm not at liberty to say. Just know that the movie's main plot hangs on what this family has been through, and their story is a real knee-slapper...especially since it serves as the catalyst to reopen ""Pandora's box,"" in a manner of speaking. So I'll just shut the hell up now, except to add that the only thing more shocking than the twists this movie takes is the ultra-bleak ending, somewhat hinted at in the first movie.<br/><br/>Fresnadillo cannily doesn't try to reinvent the remarkably rancid recipe that Boyle established in DAYS, which is a good thing. Mixing virtually unknown actors with vaguely recognizable faces (like Cillian Murphy and Brendan Gleeson in DAYS, and Carlyle, Harold Perrineau and Idris Elba here) lends the sequel that same spooky air of ""you-are-there"" realism, and he relies more heavily than Boyle did on a very documentary-like look and feel, relying cleverly on several types of visual media that are natural to the story, as well as aiding in driving it forward, (a terrifying sequence in a subway station will stay with you for days.)<br/><br/>The acting, as always, is top-notch, and Carlyle shows again why he seems so much more at home in genre movies than in ""veddy, veddy serious"" British dramas or indie comedies, (although he's most well known for THE FULL MONTY.)<br/><br/>Technically, what's always made the '28' series a little more disturbing than your average zombie munch-fest is that the monsters in this series are people infected by a virus and not 'really' zombies, which removes that layer of 'fantasy detachment' that comes ready-made with other horror movies. What happens here is a little more feasible and therefore much more unsettling, so you may want to skip this one if you are easily nightmare-prone. <br/><br/>It's unfortunate that Fox Atomic has put plans for 28 YEARS LATER on the back burner, based on the recent non-performance of some other major horror releases, (most of which SUCKED armadillo ass to begin with, but I guess the suits in the front office missed THAT memo.)<br/><br/>In any case, cuddle up on the couch with your loved one for 28 WEEKS LATER in the meantime, and make sure you keep your carbine loaded and at the ready. You know - just in case..."

","After the enraged from 28 Days Later have died, the OTAN steps in to repopulate London. From the beginning scenes you start to visually get a similar feeling to the first movie, the grays and plain tones that were so appreciated in the first part make a subtle return for the most part of the sequel. Some of the most memorable and original music also remains.<br/><br/>It adds new scares, new situations never before saw in zombie movies, like walking trhu completely dark tunnels infested with enraged (but parallel to the driving trhu the tunnel in 28 Days).<br/><br/>But despite its artistic or technical features the film's story really has no substance, which turns all of the violence and gore not into assets in a good story, but the main focus and only outstanding feature in the film. Thats is what we would usually call mindless violence.<br/><br/>In 28 Days Later, we have a main character who wakes up in a hostile environment he does not understand, so he has to grow in order to do so. Such a transition is masterfully done in his failed execution. Afterwards the character changes.<br/><br/>In 28 Weeks no such feat is accomplished... the characters are plain, foolish, unbelievable and uncharismatic.<br/><br/>Let me put it in simpler words: In 28 Days the villains are the authoritarian soldiers.

"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","7","3","4","17 June 2008"," Good sequel
","As an exercise in pure, unadulterated terror, 28 Weeks Later is a worthy follow-up to its acclaimed predecessor, 28 Days Later. In this ultra violent sequel from Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (hired on the strength of his 2001 thriller Intacto), over six months have passed since the first film's apocalyptic vision of London overrun by infectious, plague-ridden zombies. Just when it seems the ""rage virus"" has been fully contained, and London is in the process of slowly recovering, an extremely unfortunate couple (Robert Carlyle, Catherine McCormack) is attacked by a small band of rampaging ""ragers,"" and the cowardly husband escapes while his wife is attacked and presumably infected. Their surviving children (Imogen Poots, Mackintosh Muggleton) fall under the protection of a U.S. Army sharpshooter (Jeremy Renner), but nobody's safe for long as 28 Weeks Later goes into action-packed overdrive, with scene after blood-gushing scene of carnage and decimation. The film's visuals follow the look established in 28 Days Later, this time with bigger and better scenes of a nearly abandoned London on the brink of utter destruction. The military subplot gets a bold assist from Harold Perrineau (as a daring helicopter pilot) and Idris Elba (in a too-brief role as the military commander), and their firepower--not to mention the efficient lethality of helicopter blades--turns 28 Weeks Later into a nonstop bloodbath that's way too intense for younger viewers and guaranteed to leave hardcore horror fans gruesomely satisfied. That's all there is to it--this film is almost plot less and dialog is minimal throughout--but as a truly terrifying vision of survival amidst chaos, 28 Weeks Later honors its origins and qualifies as a solid double-feature with Children of Men. Could there be another sequel? Thanks to the ""chunnel,"" the answer in this case is definitely our."

","The epidemic started in Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later - a virus turning people into rabid, zombie-like creatures - is seemingly quiescent. However, when a carrier reaches London, the infection spreads quickly with disastrous results; we follow the events through Don (Robert Carlyle), his children Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots), sniper Doyle (James Renner) and medic Scarlet (Rose Byrne).<br/><br/>The prologue is exceptional. It's such an effective sequence that it sort of hurts the movie in retrospect, as none of the following scenes reach that level of tension. Quality-wise, 28 Weeks Later peaks in the first ten minutes.<br/><br/>Performances are solid, even those by young actors. Visually, the movie offers some impressive scenes, like the apocalyptic climax with the bombing of London. The soundtrack by John Murphy is wonderfully creepy.<br/><br/>There are a few missteps, like a fleeting but stupid scene where the blades of a helicopter become a weapon, in a moment which belongs to a lesser zombie movie. Also, the way Carlyle keeps popping up in the second half is excessive; I applaud the script for making a brave choice (turning the protagonist into a villain halfway through), but the way he chases his children through the ravaged city is too much - he becomes like a zombie Energizer Bunny.<br/><br/>7,5/10"
"SnoopyStyle","6","4","6","13 September 2014"," misses Robert Carlyle in the second half
","It's 28 weeks after the release of the virus and about 6 months after the first movie. The US Army is occupying London after the zombies have all supposedly died of starvation. Don (Robert Carlyle) narrowly escaped the zombies by abandoning his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) and others. Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and Flynn (Harold Perrineau) are a couple of the military personnel under the command of General Stone (Idris Elba). Scarlet (Rose Byrne) is an Army doctor. Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) are Don's kids who return from Spain after missing the initial outbreak. The kids escape the zone to find their semi-zombified mother at home. She's infected but isn't turning.<br/><br/>The first one has a simple powerful originality. The originality could never be repeated. I do like Don's duplicity and personal demons from his escape. I wish the movie stayed with him as he struggles with his inner demons and possibly finds redemption. The bigger ideas are lost when he turns. It becomes a simple zombie action movie. I just miss Robert Carlyle as the main character in the second half. When time is invested in him being the main survivor character, the movie needs to follow his story. The action is bigger and more confused. It loses the cleanliness of the original horror. The simplicity of the original lends itself to be a great horror. There is probably a political statement being made about American occupation but it doesn't really dig that deep."
"javacrucian420","5","4","6","31 October 2007"," Remains more likable the less you think about it
","28 Weeks Later has such an interesting and dramatic premise that it should be able to carry itself despite many flaws, and it does - almost. There is a lot to like about this movie, and if you liked the first one you ought to see this one too. Don't get your hopes too high, though.<br/><br/>Most of the problems with this movie (like the complete lack of effective security measures in the repopulated zone) have already been covered by other reviewers, so I'll stick to the thing that troubled me the most.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with this movie are the two main characters; a preteen boy and his teenage sister. They are likable kids and you feel sympathy for them throughout the movie, which is really ironic because insofar as the story goes, they, the British Isles, and indeed the entire planet would have been better off if somebody had put bullets into their heads in the very first scene. Seriously, you spend the whole movie caring about these kids, then after the show you stop and think more deeply about the fact that it was because of these two kids that the Rage virus re-emerges in England, and then, through a separate action by the same kids, it spreads to the rest of the world. That's right, the little buggers not only release it once, but twice. *BAM* *BAM*, two casings hit the floor followed by two bodies, end of problem, life can go on now. That would make for too short a movie though, I suppose. So there you have it - we could have contained the virus and saved the world if it wasn't for those meddling kids. Ruh roh."

","""28 Days Later"" were excellent horror movie to me mostly because it was differently made from all other horror movies of that type. OK, I admit. It was also because of brilliance of Danny Boyle, who had a vision to make a very good horror movie; and sadly good horrors today are rare.<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"" is a sequel and this movie wasn't disappointing in my eyes. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo replaced Danny Boyle and he brought something new in the movie. This sequel isn't better then the original but still represent good fun. What I liked about his way of directing is when zombies (couldn't think of another word) are attacking, his camera is all over the place. That is very interesting because everything happens so fast and the camera is shaking just like we're in the middle of action. Like we're running with them. I liked that and also I liked that helicopter-chopping scene. Very cool but nothing new. What is also special about this movie are characters. Did you notice that main characters doesn't save the day? They are far from doing that and this is something that is good and out of ordinary horror movie. There are no heroes, just victims. The entire story isn't realistic all the way long but the whole plot managed to hold my attention until the end. <br/><br/>The ending was solid and it is obvious that third part is going to be made. Maybe ""28 Months Later"" (or some other name) will come closer to the original then ""Weeks"" did."

"chodkoel","6","4","6","15 May 2007"," Not awful, but lacked in story development.... (Contains SPOILERS)
","I don't know - it's just that the first one was so ... GOOD!! I was not entirely disappointed by the second installment (and I guarantee there will be a 28 MONTHS LATER, or a 28 DAYS AFTER THE FIRST 28 WEEKS LATER - or something like that) but I feel that there were certain cop-outs in story progression and also a certain number of non-engaging scenes that made me rate this one a 6/10. <br/><br/>First the obvious difference between DAYS and WEEKS: Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is apparently no Danny Boyle. It seems that in comparing the two end products, Boyle had a more complete artistic vision than Fresnadillo. I did not feel as much of a sense of dread or foreboding in WEEKS whereas I remember becoming fairly tense during much of DAYS. I must admit however, that the realization that all 15,000 re-inhabitants (infected or not) were to be mowed down by the military was pretty distressing. <br/><br/>Something in the atmosphere was lacking however. Maybe it's that the outbreak was so contained in this movie while so little was known about the state of the world in the first installment. Unfortunately there is little exciting camera work done in WEEKS - no particularly well-realized shots that stand out in my mind.<br/><br/>Was anyone else bothered by the constant reappearance of the ""Bigby""/Father character after he became one of the Infected? I couldn't help but feel that the writers, Rowan Joffe and Fresnadillo, contaminated the purity of the Infected by making this particular one seem to have the human qualities of remembrance, cunning, and a singular intelligence. This was WAY too reminiscent of the African-American ?Janitor? Zombie in Romero's (THE KING!) LAND OF THE DEAD - which was also disappointing in its own way. <br/><br/>People looking for gore.....you will find it here, but it won't be as shocking as the gore in DAYS. There are even two - yes, TWO - eye gouging scenes, but neither of them holds an LED to the climactic eye-gouging in DAYS. The gore is fairly tame in WEEKS, with little attention being paid or effort being made to add much realism to it. However, I definitely found myself saying quietly out loud, ""cool."" - when the ""Bigby""/Father guy becomes infected through the kiss (Now, that was freaking brilliant!) and savagely turns on his helpless wife, and, ""awesome *snort*, YES! *chuckle*."" during the chopper turned lawnmower scene. There is a fair amount of gore - but it is somehow unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The most annoying thing about WEEKS is that the beginning is so great yet the end is so blah and poorly edited?/executed?/planned? After sifting through the choppy last few minutes I was perplexed. Why the hell did it end so abruptly, with basically no story being given to us at the end? And why was so much time wasted on the whole infected father/son/daughter scenes when more could have been done with the ending after the escape? Did they get killed? Well, it didn't appear as if the chopper was wrecked and we weren't shown any blood inside of it. Maybe they ran out of fuel and landed and then continued on foot? I mean, why give us so little at the end. <br/><br/>But I guess this one was all about the bucks and setting the stage for part 3, which will hopefully be the greatest and LAST episode."
"johnmec2003","10","13","28","10 September 2007"," Excellent gripping zombie movie
","The movie is a worthwhile sequel to the original 28 Days Later. Never mind the logic of why the military or anybody would want to come back to infected London or UK. There can be logical explanations, but the fact that the director does not take the time to show that, does not make this less of a masterpiece. A good explanation might be the sense of lost of many of those who left families behind. They would be eager to return as soon as they were allowed (having lost all of their loved ones plus all earthy possessions). The movie explicitly mentions that the military has proof that all the infected died of starvation, 5 weeks after the outbreak.<br/><br/>Zombies in this movie are ruthless and sick human meat scavengers. The movie portraits like no other zombie movie the fear of the victims and their desperation. The action in this movie is more believable than in its predecessor, since there is not a single all-mighty hero that comes to save them all. Both, military and ""good guys"" decisions are not infallible and because of that the film short range shots gain immensely in credibility. When things can go wrong they go wrong, Murphy's Law style. This is not a violent and gory movie, like many other zombie movies. I would say is nothing suitable for your children. Unlike other zombie movies the violence is not laughable, but gruesome and unpleasant like a news report from Iraq.. Also non-violent scenes are loaded with a tension that will make you remember this movie for a while after you are done with it."

","I love horror movies. I really do. I like action movies. Unfortunately, 28 Weeks Later wasn't successful at being either one.<br/><br/>I thought 28 Days Later was a really good movie. I thought the story was intriguing, the acting was great and the effects were well done. Although the original was considered a smaller, limited release movie here in the US, everything about it was conveyed as a wonderful, big budget, smart film.<br/><br/>This sequel was just ridiculous.<br/><br/>Despite the time lapse between the filming of the original and the sequel, the plot seemed as though it was rushed into production. It was as though everyone related with the film hoped that the audience was either too dumb or too distracted by the ineffective, gratuitous violence to realize what a lemon this film is.<br/><br/>Although I can't really complain about the acting, as I am sure that everyone did the best they could with the materials given, it was really difficult to care about any of the unsympathetic, unlikable characters. I understand that every film needs some kind of event or catalyst to move the film along and propel the plot, but in this instance, it was just too unrealistic given the events that were occurring.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about the film has to be in the way it was filmed. I thought that The Blair Witch Project had better camera work. The film was too choppy and the camera work too shaky. Instead of drawing me into the action, I spent all of my time being frustrated and squinting at the screen to attempt to decipher what I was seeing.<br/><br/>I had heard rumors that Cillian Murphy turned down a cameo in this film despite being offered a big check for his appearance. Perhaps he read the script.<br/><br/>My final opinion, skip this one and save your money.<br/><br/>To the team for the inevitable third installment: Please spend some time on the plot and on character development. Don't just rely on blood and gore to get you through. Give us characters that we can sympathize and empathize with; ones that we want to see make it through to the end, even if they don't. Oh, and please invest in some better camera equipment. Fox Atomic should be able to afford it by now."

"polinga","3","7","13","12 May 2007"," Technically well executed but about as realistic as Planet Terror
","Typical zombie movie except that all of the zombies are now virus patients on crack. However, the movie contains major realism issues.<br/><br/>First of all, if the military went in there, all of the infected would be dead within minutes - not hours. Every sector would be well isolated, and protected not by half a dozen snipers, but by claymores, mines, chemical weapons, napalm weapons, and maybe automated turrets. All access points would be either bricked off or mined, and to top it all off a couple of brigades would be sitting around the sector with at least a .50 cal on every street. Bradleys (or at least humvees) would be used to patrol the streets. People would not be able to get out of the safety zones without heavy machinery - and if they did, they would be cut down in seconds. The code red situation would involve five times as much napalm, followed by a much more thorough and quick chemical attack - not just in the sector, but of the surrounding area. Followed perhaps by a small tactical nuke or a neutron bomb.<br/><br/>Second, the procedures of the military were pathetic. They have a confirmed carrier - and it is not under constant surveillance? It is brought into the green zone without any intermediate stages? The green zone is not isolated into sectors which would ensure that the disease & infected can't cross from sector to sector during lock-down? The safe areas in the sectors can be broken out of by normal people without much trouble? The list keeps going. Any one of these procedures would have ensured that there either would be no contamination, or that it wouldn't take down more than a single sector. Can you say ""clusterf@#k""? Third, viruses DO NOT spread that fast! 5 seconds from saliva to the brain? Are you kidding? The virus would have to infect some cells, and reprogram them to replicate it. That would have to happen for several generations - IE at best hours. Furthermore, you can't see a virus under a microscope. Finally, if this was a bacteria, there is the blood-brain barrier to consider, which filters out all bacteria - and once again the replication speed is a huge hole."

","I finally got around to watching this and I think it was built up too much in my head before I went to see it because I couldn't help but be disappointed. The movie is a contrivance and relies on fairly intelligent, career minded people doing really dumb and career ending things. In the real world, people are mostly cogs in the machine and keep their personal welfare and career in mind before taking an action that could end the first and certainly end the second. The kids I can understand as kids are ultimately selfish, adventurous and often don't recognize danger to themselves.<br/><br/>I won't even go into all the military goofs as they are well documented on IMDb. But don't for one second expect me to believe the US military is repopulating Great Britain without a civilian administrative overwatch, most likely composed of members of the British government (they have emergency contingencies for government officials just like the US does) and US bureaucrats. It's also certain that British troops would be in command and only augmented by NATO troops. Even if every soldier on the island was killed (unlikely), Britain doesn't keep all of it's military at home. There would still be the Royal Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines abroad that would be recalled and put in charge of the homeland. The military aren't really made out to be the bad guys but it's certainly an easy conclusion and many people have made it. The military executes political decisions, they wouldn't have decided to repopulate the island, wouldn't have decided to allow children, wouldn't have been the ones to create a Code Red solution and wouldn't be the ones to make the decision to execute Code Red unless no civilian authorization was possible. All in all, while the movie didn't make the military the villains, it didn't exactly paint a nice picture of them.<br/><br/>Speaking of Code Red... all contagious diseases spread quickest when people are in confined spaces. Emergency plans for small pox outbreaks, and whatnot, do not crowd everyone into a single building, they rely on keeping people at home. The civilians all lived in condos, the best, best possible thing you could do would be to send them to their apartments and have them lock the door. Those buildings could essentially be fortresses. Then the entrance could be defended and the military would have time to hunt down and exterminate the infected which would only number a few because people wouldn't be out roaming in masses. If an infected got inside the building, the number of victims would be very small and again the military could patrol the hallways and shoot down any infected."

","This was a complete waste of time. It felt like watching Dawn of the Dead, only much more stupid. At least with that movie, the Dead were after the flesh of the living, so there's a certain sense to that. With 28 Weeks, the infected people are already living and they chase after everyone who is not infected. Aren't they suppose to be insane with rage? Why aren't they attacking and killing each other instead of chasing after the uninfected like an organized pack of wolves? And why does the effect, once bitten, happen instantaneously? I don't remember any of this in the first movie (which I only saw once, years ago). The Rage virus felt like a lame vehicle for showcasing what the director (or whoever) really wanted to show: the gory destruction of innocent human beings in all its gruesome graphic detail. Gee, isn't it cool to lock everyone up in a pitch-black confined space and then have a bloody insane monster get in to infect everyone. Isn't is cool to have military rooftop snipers picking off terrified civilians as they flee down the streets from the bloody monsters? Isn't it cool to see the streets of London go up in flame and engulf everyone in its path? Isn't is cool to see all that bloody puke gushing out of the monster's mouth from the other side of the window. Oh, and that monster is Daddy. Tugs on the heartstrings, doesn't it? If you like this sort of thing than I guess this is for you.<br/><br/>And speaking of Daddy, he just waltzes past all security to see his infected wife who is strapped to a gurney, wearing hospital jammies, in quarantined isolation. And then he kisses her. Hello?!? This same guy was traumatized for weeks after escaping from the bloody monsters and had left his wife to die by their hands. I'm sorry, but you'd think he would have been at least slightly clued in? Or how about the kid's sneaking out of the safe zone into unprotected London after the whole country has been decimated my this plague, and there are dead bodies everywhere? I will admit I'm not a big fan of horror movies (a la Halloween), mostly because they require you to suspend all disbelief and swallow their stupid premises. This movie does exactly that. Enough said."

","The only reason Hitler didn't invade England during World War II is because he couldn't , England being an Island, and with the sea's as barrier he just couldn't take his prize. It is in this paradox that a deadly rage virus that has contaminated the British Isles has been contained from reaching the outside world. It is in this theme that we now find in this extended movie of Danny Boyle's 2002 movie 28 Days Later the virus gone and a slow repatriation of its people back to the British Isles.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later stars one of the most charismatic actors to come from the Scottish Highlands; Robert Carlyle, whose works range from Once Upon a Time in the Midlands (2002), The Full Monty (1997) and Trainspotting (1996) and the beautiful Angela's Ashes from 1999. With this man in tow, what possibly can go wrong? In usual form 28 Weeks Later is a very good shock fest, with its more than capable blood, gore and death. With an interesting and imaginative use of camera and editing techniques that really does this to its best advantage, all very exciting, captivating and enthralling, particularly the opening sequence, one of Cinemas finest. Of course we have the same music that is used in the first movie, and this does the second no harm indeed.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later is a delivery of great horror cinema, this genre, this newly developed genre, is taking us to new fright levels, great visuals, great atmosphere and that gives even greater heart rate levels to pulverise the nervous system. Exactly what a good horror movie should be.<br/><br/>But, where we have a horror genre made good, we have a horrific story line that is, unfortunately, letting this movie down. With an over simple narrative and a very negligent use for its main lead that is in itself shocking and somewhat disturbing. When we have such a strong lead, a strong personality of good stock and calibre then why oh why have him trussed up and spiting blood at the world in anger? This seems very much a wasted opportunity and a shame of not utilising your best asset. We can all blend in all too easily with the red-eyed madness, but there is only an individual before the transition, and this individual is sadly missed for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Also, there is the use of the Stateside's (NATO Peaceforce) protectors, fair enough, but where does 28 Weeks Later explain the whereabouts of England's own protectors? It doesn't, they had all fled, as too did everyone else, but why had none returned? This is more bizarre and perplexing. A country, any country, would not leave itself open without seeing to its own concerns too? A Stateside sale and collaboration to drip-feed itself to a wider audience. This is the peril of the sequel, which 28 Days Later has succumbed too also. A bigger budget, a bigger profile and a bigger target audience. While not a slur on the US' but more a comment on ""movie advancement"" in general. <br/><br/>Finally, the general narrative is weak, apart from the decoration of death, disaster and decay that accompanies the mayhem of madness throughout, the story is shallow. A very simple and mediocre score that unfolds all too easily for all concerned in 28 Weeks Later. A jig-saw puzzle whose pieces fall into place at the right time for the right reason. Uncomplicated and a little uninspiring, but the bloodbath, saliva and guts covers this all too well. An all too predicable conclusion to a very imaginative concept, perhaps we'll see a better third act some time later?"
"zillabob","10","11","24","19 May 2007"," What if....
","What was scary as Hell about 28 Days Later and it's excellent sequel 28 Weeks Later is that it shows us a virus-created from apparently(I read in some back-story literature) a splicing of the very real Ebola and Borna viruses. Ebola explains the violent hemorrhaging, Borna-a little know but real and scary disease-explains the rage. Souped up with some very fast incubation time. Borna was named after a town in the early 20th century in France, which was an unknown-origin virus that struck a horse farm with no warning. Apparently contagious, all the horses went into ""rage"" trying to kill each other until they all had to be put down and burned. No one knew where it came from-or where it went.All their brains were infected with this bug. But it has never thankfully appeared again. Borna was used in the 1985 virus film Warning Sign. What better way to spread a virus than by vomiting blood and bodily fluids all over people as you run into them? To sum up without spoilers, this film is a lot less disturbing on the human level as the previous film was which was truly disturbing at the last third. The characters here, this time, are warmer and this balances off the terror of the virus. A couple of people make some very stupid mistakes which re-activate the virus otherwise it may have been totally wiped out. The gore is there but the way it's filmed,staccato-like... your mind fills in more than is really seen. I like that, where violence is not lingered over but only flirted with. Also, in this film, it's apparent the virus is ready to mutate.<br/><br/>Also, to answer the Dawn of The Dead vs 28 Days/Weeks...""are they or aren't they zombies?"" No, they're very much alive and in the throes of an uncontrollable virus. So, this film is less in the category of ""Zombie"" film and more in the category of ""Virus"" film such as The Omega Man(1971) Virus(1980) Warning Sign(1985) and Outbreak(1995) A worthy sequel to 28 Days Later...."

","Now let me start by saying the directing here is really not the problem, as much as a terrible writing effort that destroyed my hope of appreciating the movie.<br/><br/>Here's what I saw.<br/><br/>Group rescues kid. Group gets attacked by infected. Mother decides to run after and protect the kid they met 5 minutes ago, rather than escape with her husband she loves *kid character jacking the movie #1*. Husband abandons her, thinking he would rather survive than die trying to save some random kid they don't know (three cheers for him). Husband barely manages to escape, and is the only survivor, as far as we know.<br/><br/>Time moves forward, the infected have died of starvation and refugees can return to London's ""green zone"" under heavy military supervision and protection.<br/><br/>Our husband's kids return from a refugee camp, find their dad and also find out their mother died, but little boy is sad because he thinks he will forget what she looks like. Older sister has the great idea of sneaking out of the green zone to go get pictures of her from their old house *kids jacking the movie #2*. Sniper guard sees them escaping but doesn't shoot, and the military proceeds to take about 20 minutes to catch them, in which time they manage to go to their house and find their surviving mother in the attic. It appears she is somewhat infected, but can still control herself.<br/><br/>Mom and kids are brought back to military complex, tests are run on her, we find out she is immune but still a carrier, but nobody sticks around to guard the one potential big threat to everyone. After coming down to the military compound to find his kids, husband casually manages to reach the room where his wife is contained, kisses her, hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is basically running around trying to protect the 2 stupid kids that start it all because they might have inherited the same immunity to the virus as their mother, while everyone else that did nothing to deserve it is getting killed. Which might be great if you remotely cared what happen to these 2 morons, when you don't just want to see them die first.<br/><br/>1 out of 10 for a good directing effort wasted on abysmal writing."
"Bunuel1976","7","7","14","15 July 2007"," 28 WEEKS LATER (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 2007) ***
","I was sufficiently impressed by the revamping of the zombie sub-genre that was 28 DAYS LATER (2002), though I wasn't particularly looking forward to seeing a sequel to it! That said, the second installment (the film's ending leaves one expecting a third is likely to appear somewhere down the road) exceeded all my expectations and is, possibly, even superior to its predecessor! <br/><br/>Anyway, the film is an intense and gore-drenched outing which manages to find new avenues to explore in a theme long since exhausted: the virus which exploded in the first film has apparently been contained; yet a woman surfaces who, though infected, is amazingly immune to the 'rage'. The scientists are eager to study her in order to find a possible antidote but, unwittingly, her husband (Robert Carlyle) gets in contact with her and, soon, there's a new outbreak of the zombie plague! This time, however, the military are taking no chances and issue an order for indiscriminate annihilation of the population – leading to a spectacular sequence as London is engulfed in flames. Carlyle, however, proves to be inordinately tenacious for a zombie – determined to catch up with his children (under constant military protection because they might be immune to the virus as well).<br/><br/>While the recurring hand-held cinematography is liable to give one a headache, the film is buoyed by John Murphy's disarming and tremendously effective score. Besides, the presence of the two children – one a boy, the other a teenage girl – gives the whole an unexpected emotional core, which elevates it above the blood-and-guts mentality of most of its ilk. Despite the fact that I've never heard of the director and that the creators of its predecessor – Danny Boyle and Alex Garland – are here relegated to the sidelines, the film is quite deftly staged, with a particularly intense pre-credits sequence and an awesome helicopter zombie massacre."
"dj_wang","7","5","9","15 February 2009"," Better Than The Original, but, I Want More Inspiration With My Horror
","My question is, why do characters in horror movies have to do the prerequisite ""dumb things"".<br/><br/>For me, a horror movie is an experiment, a mental exploration of ""what if"" such terrible things happened, how would people handle it? I would like to see a movie which is a ""serious"" exploration of what normal, intelligent, people would do when confronted with a horrible situation. <br/><br/>When the characters in horror movies behave in a manner which is simply ridiculous for any intelligent human being to be engaging in, the mental experiment is rendered uncredible and unrewarding.<br/><br/>With this thought in mind, why did the 2 kids have to cross the river? The simplistic plot device of getting a picture of their mother and some personal items from home is paper-thin. If England was really a Graveyard, how could any 2 normal kids be anything but terrified of the idea of wandering around?<br/><br/>Now, if the psychology of the kids had been explored a bit, like they have a hard time believing the adult's stories about the infected. They aren't shown the bodies. They aren't shown film footage. They aren't shown the poor animals being experimented on to find a cure. The adults don't open up and tell their stories (truthfully) of what really happened. Kids are used to being lied to by adults, and kids are full of energy and the desire for freedom. England is their home. All of England. Being caged in a small block of it is confining and insulting to their sense of tribalistic ownership. (ah...Nationalism...the sense of ""us"" and ""them""...source of all our problems...sigh...I hope we move beyond it soon to Humanism) Well. With this small bit of development, the audience would understand, even empathize with the kids behavior, and the spark they unwittingly lit for things to fall apart. <br/><br/>====<br/><br/>Another plot point which is uncredible is a civilian having unrestricted access to a military facility.<br/><br/>A better strategy for the husband's infection, would have been for the woman to be kept alive. The medical staff hopes to use her to find a cure. It is deemed acceptable for her to see her husband so long as he is accompanied by military personnel and monitored. It has been established throughout the movie that the American Military is apathetic to their duties in England and starting to show lack of interest and attention. During the interview things seem to be going well. The wife is warm and comforting and the husband feels relieved of his guilt. The escort leaves the room briefly to go find the children and bring them to see their mother. The wife then shows her true anger and contempt for her husband's fear and cowardice (both understandable I say, though, terrible and lamentable...i don't know how well i would have fared though...""let he who is without sin"") The psychological tension between the husband and wife confronting each other builds up to the point where she spits or bites her husband.<br/><br/>The husband covers up the wound or doesn't mention the spit, and leaves the compound apparently distraught and needing privacy.<br/><br/>This could have tied into the feeling of resentment the British have over having their home overrun by American military. The British don't trust the Americans, and so they don't communicate openly with them. This would of course relate directly to our own world, where we don't trust each other, because we are raised to believe that human beings are naturally selfish, hedonistic, egotistical creatures and you have to fight to carve out your niche in the world. Naturally this creates the underlying paranoia which infects all of our lives. The movie could play this out and show clearly what happens when a terrible crisis erupts and how the paper-thin ""order"" of our society has a paper-mache foundation. The only real way to build powerful connections between people is openness and honesty and the freedom to express feelings. Lies turn into Anger. Anger turns into Hate. Hate turns into Suffering.<br/><br/>The infection manifests itself slowly, because of the woman's immune system's ability to suppress the virus. Without her antibodies though, the virus soon awakens to its full potential. While wandering the streets, the husband becomes enraged, and begins to infect others.<br/><br/>====<br/><br/>This movie does demonstrate a very important point though.<br/><br/>What is it?<br/><br/>The need for Education.<br/><br/>Education leads to Empathy. Empathy leads to Understanding. Understanding leads to Humanity.<br/><br/>I'm getting rather tired of movies where there is 1 hero, and a world full of idiotic ""normal people"". Or, in this movie's case, a world full of idiotic ""normal people"" and not 1 truly visionary person. It's rather distressing to see character after character who is weak, pathetic and uninspiring.<br/><br/>Movies constantly show a world of sheep, who are weak, frightened and easily manipulated. It's pretty insulting. Unfortunately, it has the unpleasant taste of truth.<br/><br/>Movies are telling us all something. We as a species view ourselves as weak and easily controlled. The fact that it feels true is...daunting.<br/><br/>The solution?<br/><br/>We need to begin cultivating a species that is truly strong, loving, and noble. How? Simple. Exceptional education for everyone. The freedom to express emotions openly, taught to children from their earliest memory. Equitable distribution of resources to everyone, which is a subset of exceptional education. Exceptionally educated, emotionally unrepressed people are people who will settle for nothing less than an Egalitarian society. Check that against your heart and mind. It's true. And vital, because, ""Adults who do not heal a violent world, condemn their children to fighting in one.""<br/><br/>Movies like this portray all of us as cattle. I don't like that at all. I want to start seeing movies where everyone is extraordinary, based on a real world view. It's so easy to accomplish. I look forward to seeing ""those"" movies soon."

Why did the U.S. military try to repopulate Britain without making sure the ragers were all dead? Why did it bring only one virologist? Why did the commanders forget that London has a subway system that will allow the ragers to escape from a quarantined district? Why are all of the important doors either unlocked or bolted with a PlaySkool plastic chain? Why is everyone in this movie so careless? How does a Volvo manage to keep out poison gas? How does a t-shirt filter out poison gas?

","My only major problem with 28 Weeks Later is that there is nothing to separate it from the hundreds of other zombie movies, or in this case wannabe zombie movies, because the zombies really aren't zombies. Every single scene in this movie I've seen before. The virus-that-turns-people-into-zombies plot has been done more times than a dried-up hooker. And that is it. The movie doesn't try to take the sub-genre any further than it already was back in the 60s, and it doesn't attempt to add any intelligent twist to the formula. It does nothing that hasn't been copied and then copied again.<br/><br/>What I just mentioned is why, even with all the well-done action, I really just wanted to turn 28 Weeks Later off and go to bed. It bored me because it was predictable, unoriginal, and exactly like the other zombie movies that bored me to tears. Yes, 28 Weeks Later is far superior to bore-fests like the remake of Dawn of the Dead, which had less zombie action than god-forsaken Juno. But at the same time, 28 Weeks Later bored me just as much because it copied scenes from that remake, and copied scenes from every other zombie movieI, and most likely you as well, have seen every scene in this movie before. Every last one. Any supposed intensity is zapped out due to this fact, because you know who is going to live and who will diethe scenes are that predictable.<br/><br/>The other problem is the atmosphere. Or, more accurately, the problem is the fact the movie doesn't even attempt at creating a solid atmosphere, which would have helped it out a lot. The reason Cloverfeild and the original Alien were both so effective was because they understood how to create the perfect doom atmosphere. But while cliché movies like 28 Weeks Later will take up an hour of screen time to set up a drama behind the flat characters in order to give them characterization (which never works and didn't work here either), it never takes time to create atmosphere, which would be much more effective. There was no suspense. There was just the predictable: open with action, take an hour for drama, have the most action, then end with a cute, trite ending. So many directors/writers think that is the only way to develop a movie, but they're wrong. Let me repeat myself: they're wrong and cliché and pretensions and know nothing about good storytelling. I wish someone in the movie business would understand this.<br/><br/>Technical aspects are amazing. The flash-cutting isn't done as well as in Saw, but it's a lot better than I've seen. The movie has one of the best soundtracks, and best use of its soundtrack I've heard in a long time. The style is also pretty cool. And, I'm shocked to say, this movie had enough blood to actually earn its R-rating, which made me happy. There isn't a whole lot of violence/gore, but what is there is very nicely done and bloody. It's sad, however, to see all these nice aspects go into such a pointless movie.<br/><br/>Can no one take zombies and do something original with them? I can name several video games that have, but I guess movies are really just dying out.<br/><br/>So, I bought 28 Weeks Later for $3 in the bargain bin. Was it worth that? I guess. But I'd be lying if I didn't say I was bored enough to shoot my eyes out.<br/><br/>1/10"

","I went to see this movie with high expectations. The opening sequence was particularly impressive, visually stunning, and disturbing to say the least, at how easy the virus spread. But I knew after that opening scene that the style of action sequences was going to be a frenzy, just like the original. And I have to agree with the critics of the prequel that too much was happening to quickly. And this is how it was trough the rest of he film. You just couldn't make out what was going on. Upto the first outbreak, and the attempts to quell the infection the film is absorbing. But then the film deteriorates into a total unrealistic shambles. A group, our main protagonists cannot leave the quarantined section, but a rogue helicopter pilot from the us air force can fly around wherever he wants???? And also if you knew infected could be nearby, would you start screaming and shouting as loud as you can wherever you go? And finally. The whole world knows that mainland Britain is a no go quarantined area, from the rest of the world, but a helicopter can just fly straight into France. Come on!! In the real world that Helicopter or any other aircraft would be shot down immediately. I don't know maybe its me being over critical. At the end of the day it is just a movie. But then I say to myself, that I would not want to make a movie with such silly plot holes. The director must see this too, or do they think the average person is not going to notice? I only give this a 6 out of 10 because the fundamental idea is as scary as hell, the infected people are the scariest things I ever see, and the way the virus takes over the person is so brutal. Scary stuff! The film just could have been so much better. Let down again!"
"jaredmobarak","8","6","12","15 May 2007"," Code Red28 Weeks Later
","This was definitely a film that I didn't see any necessity for. 28 Days Later was a fantastic genre film whose main success was not really being the film people expected it to be. What worked there was that we were able to wake up into the world just as our main character did. We experience the disorientation and the horror right along with him, as well as the humanity still within him having missed the original outbreakunlike the disheartened and beaten comrades he meets along the way. When we enter the quarantined world of England, now seven months past infection, we see a country trying to rebuild, all the infected dead of starvation. It is inevitable that there will be some way in which the virus is released again, or else we would have no movie. The real question is, then, will the film work when we already know what will happen? I wasn't quite sure because we had exhausted the running for freedom motif with the first one, however, the filmmakers sure do surprise. What 28 Weeks Later may lack in originality and story depth, it more than makes up with suspense, emotion, and non-stop action.<br/><br/>The original film was new and different because it wasn't about fighting the undead, but about surviving against mankind's brutality. Its one flaw was that it got away from this a bit towards the end as Cillian Murphy went on a one man killing spree, yet it worked because he was killing men and not infected beings. I expected this film to be that ending for two hours, but instead, it actually stayed consistent with the running and surviving. Whereas the first needed that shift in order to get its storied point across, this one already had it as a backdrop. Our only story here is trying to get two kids, who may hold a cure to the virus, out of England in the midst of total extermination. Therefore, the story needs the chase, and the film delivers to its utmost.<br/><br/>Our opening scene, showing how Robert Carlyle loses his wife and stays alive to eventually reunite with his children sent away on a school trip, puts us right into the action. The jerky camera style remains, showing us the brutality without the graphic details. These people care for each other and there is as much fear on their faces as there is sorrow and helplessness in being unable to help. It is a great entry into a story that soon slows down a bit to catch us up with what has happened in the weeks since our last visit. Repopulation has begun and Carlyle's children have finally been allowed back in. Their reunion is short-lived on the happiness factor with him explaining how their mother died, and soon the children set off into forbidden territory to find a photo of her before the youngest forgets her face. To everyone's surprise, the children find their mother at the house, infected but not raging. The military take all back into District 1 and we soon have chaos back in action.<br/><br/>What occurs as a result of the re-infection of society is a mass extermination by the hands of the US army overseeing the reopening of England. They have failed and must cover their tracks so the virus can't leave the island for mainland. Caught inside, though, are the two children, played effectively by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton, an army doctor, (a favorite of mine, Rose Byrne), trying to keep them alive because a cure might be inside their blood, and a sniper who could no longer handle killing innocents, (Jeremy Renner doing a great job). It is their race to keep alive that drives the final three quarters of the film and it never gets tiring. With the infected and the military on their tails, attempting to do them in, only Harold Perrineau's pilot can get them off the island.<br/><br/>Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does an admirable job in keeping the same tone and aesthetic as his predecessor. I have to believe that Danny Boyle staying on as producer helped keep the two films as consistent as possible. 28 Weeks Later never falls back on jump out of your seat moments and never takes the easy way out. The utter destruction of England at the hands of those trying to salvage it is a sight to behold and the death count of characters that you would think were untouchable, is astounding. You cannot blink once because you really have no idea what may be coming, and the brilliant industrial score keeps tension high throughout. Unfortunately, though, the filmmakers didn't quite trust their audience as they spell out what happens at the end in a short epilogue, possibly trying to segue into a third part. What could have been an ominous final shot of our young hero gets subverted by the unnecessary showing of what transpires as the survivors leave the island for France.<br/><br/>Rarely do sequels live up to their predecessors, especially those that probably never need to be made. Much like Aliens and Underworld: Evolution live up to their originals, by upping the action and suspense in a story without the depth needed for a part one, 28 Weeks Later holds its own with Days. To sum it all up, if you enjoyed Boyle's vision of horror you will not be disappointed at how the story continues."

","28 WEEKS LATER (2007) ***1/2 Robert Carlyle, Catherine McCormack, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots, Mackintosh Muggleton, Harold Perrineau., Idris Elba.. Excellent sequel to ""28 DAYS LATER"" about a 'rage virus' pandemic that unleashes zombie-like symptoms upon the recovering British populace with a family attempting to outrun the plague with the assist of some sympathetic American soldiers embedded for the apocalyptic showdown. Infused with adrenaline pumping action sequences and more scary the terrifying silences created by newcomer director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo inheriting the mantle from executive producing filmmaker Danny Boyle, aided and abetted by the maddeningly herky- jerky yet affective cinematography by Enrique Chediak and the jarringly bombastic score by John Murphy sends a shock to the system and unnerves the gooseflesh from the core dread of the unexpected ready to pounce. Bloody good ongoing chapter in the ensuing franchise."

","Though I don't plan on revealing anything in this review, I'm still warning against (possible) spoilers for good measure.<br/><br/>I might probably be the last one to watch this film, all the way in 2015. But if I can warn others, my delayed efforts to enjoy this film would not have gone in vain.<br/><br/>It started out to be a good movie but deteriorated sooner than I expected.<br/><br/>I'm starting to have a huge problem with films that force co- incidents into a plot. ""Things coming together"" (for good or for bad) is a very powerful thing. When used in the right way, this one device alone can please the audience. When used in the wrong way, it makes one roll their eyes and blame themselves for choosing to sit through a movie. I suffered from this very same feeling.<br/><br/>Dear movie makers, at least try and make everything look seamless! Why force it in a way that suggests that you do not respect our intelligence?<br/><br/>Apart from a weak plot, the ever-moving, forced-closeups camera work was tiring to the eye. The movie does not manage to create any affinity for the characters. The important scenes - ones that influence the very direction the movie is taking - are executed poorly with flaws. <br/><br/>The movie makers found a way to involve Americans in what seemed like a British catastrophe. While I don't have much to say about why the rest of Europe had no part to play in this, I will say this much... The movie makes the US military look very very bad at their job. And anyone with a decent problem-solving capacity will be able see why."

","Usually they Ruin the sequel for every movie, and especially when it comes to zombie flicks, directors and producers have tried a millions of times to re-make a classic but all have failed miserably except for Dawn of the Dead (2004). When I saw the first part ""28 days Later"" I was really impressed, but when I heard that a sequel is coming up I got really disappointed as I had lost hope on sequels, but just 10 minutes into watching it I got hooked even more then the first one. Concept was brilliant, cast was great, direction was applaudable. The first part didn't focus much on the spread of the virus, it was more about the survivors instead of the zombies and kind of lost it's charisma towards the end, but this part both were balanced which is why we got to see so much more of the ""rage"" and the ending was much better. So far I have heard rumors of another sequel called ""28 months later"" and I really have high hopes for it. Being a very critical zombie movies fan I'll say this movie is amongst my top 3 favorite flicks of the dead."
"Arenarocker05","9","4","7","11 July 2008"," Wow! This Is A Good Sequel
","Wow! That was my reaction after I saw this film. You know, there aren't too many good horror sequels out there. In fact, most of them are just absolutely worthless. But this movie is really something. This is hands-down one of the best horror sequels I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I was skeptical at first when I found out Danny Boyle was not directing this, but new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo adds a lot of the same atmosphere from ""28 Days Later"" and blends it into his own chilling style which was very effective. The story focuses around the aftermath of the deadly virus known as ""The Rage"" virus as most of the infected human beings begin to die off from starvation. Weeks later, the American army takes control of England to help rebuild the city and bring back the populace to start a new life for everyone. But there is only one problem; something is still out there and the horror is unleashed once again.<br/><br/>The movie itself is full of pulse-pounding terror lurking around every corner. There are plenty to scenes that will make you jump and just simply horrify you. I was also glad that Robert Carlyle (Don) was in this film. I have considered him a talented actor and I'm a fan of some of his previous films like ""The Beach"", ""The World is Not Enough"", and ""Ravenous"". Also Jeremy Renner was another character I enjoyed very much, remembering him from films like ""North Country"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James."" The overall acting was good and everyone was very convincing. However, the ending, the very ending, was perfect. You would never expect it then all of a sudden BAM! It was the perfect ending to a horror movie such as this one. So attention all horror fans, check out this awesome sequel that will have you begging for more."
"theaustin","5","4","7","7 June 2007"," Plot Holes, Plot Holes, Plot Holes...
","Ughhh I was very disappointed with this film. I'm a huge 28 Days Later fan but this was just a horrible sequel. I'll give it a few positive points for some amazing cinematography (the night vision scope shot) and the opening sequence was one of my favorite scenes from the whole series, but overall, it was very disappointing.<br/><br/>The plot holes! Oh my gosh it was horrible. I mean seriously I couldn't believe some of the holes in the film.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS** Like I said before, the beginning was awesome. Everything was great up until Andy had the dream about his mom tearing her face off. What was that? What purpose did that serve except to show that he missed his mom? If it was to justify them leaving to visit home the next day, it didn't.<br/><br/>Next problem is when Andy and his sister Tammy go off into restricted areas to go back to their house. I'm sorry but I just can't suspend my disbelief that far. Security would be far more heavier than what was shown and two kids that know the destruction that the virus caused would be smart enough to stay in the safe zone. I mean they ride a moped all throughout London? Someone would have seen them before they reached their house. Didn't 28 Days Later make it very clear that its imperative to stay as far away from the virus as possible? Plus, the kids just found out that Mom was killed from the virus. I don't think the first thing they're going to do the next morning is leave the safe zone to visit their old house in a contaminated area.<br/><br/>Another hole: Once the virus starts to spread again, the military locks the civilians in an enclosed area. When Don (the infected father) finds the area, he breaks through the door in a matter of seconds. If that area was truly the shelter where they kept civilians in a situation where the virus broke out, I'm sure they would take every precaution necessary to keep the infected out and make it extremely safe. They would not leave a door unattended that could be opened that easily. As a matter of fact, they wouldn't even have a door like that as an entry to the area.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the problems with this film but I have one last gripe...<br/><br/>Danny Boyle should have directed this. I know he was producer, but it didn't feel anything like his films. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo totally went astray from the original 28 Days Later concept. The first film was about hope and human integrity. It challenged the issue of human life and made us ask ourselves what we would do in the situation of a fatal epidemic. It wasn't a typical gore-fest horror movie. 28 Weeks Later wasn't a gore-fest, but it definitely took into consideration the current horror movie genre qualities. There were many more unnecessary shots of ""zombie"" killings which the audience didn't really need to see. After all, most of us have seen 28 Days Later. We already know what it looks like when the infected attack someone. They used so many gory shots of people being attacked that the effect began to wear off. In 28 Days later, someone wasn't bit into every 5 minutes. It was suspenseful and deaths/attacks were more meaningful when they occurred.<br/><br/>It made me disconnect the two films from each other. 28 Weeks Later was just a big-budget action movie in the end."
"inquisitor_ode","10","4","7","27 May 2007"," 28 Weeks Later - One Hell of a Ride!
","28 Weeks Later is one hell of a ride. This film not only manages to top the first movie but propels it into one of the best horror/drama sequels yet to come out. The sets are amazing and alive, the characters kept me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen to them next, and the plot is excellent. Much more depth then the first. You think its going to be another over the top action/horror flick when the military shows up but all that changes. You may ask why I gave it a ten? I like to dissect movies and try to get a sense of some real life to them and 28 weeks later has just that.. It makes you feel sympathetic to the characters and you feel as if your a survivor following them through London's desolate streets.<br/><br/>When you go to see this keep it mind its in a league of its own. If your expecting a zombie flick and review it off other zombies movies you've seen, then this isn't for you. As for the cast each actor/actress does an excellent job and Robert Carlyle's character is just plain engrossing to watch. I see why now he was cast in 28 weeks later since in the movie Ravenous he played a crazy cannibal..perfect fit for this role. The end also sets it up for a sequel for an already great series. Definitely looking forward to this trilogy conclusion.<br/><br/>If your a fan of drama, horror, post-disaster movies or just a fan of the first, I highly recommend seeing 28 Weeks Later. Worth the admission price."
"jrschlegel","10","7","15","11 May 2007"," One of the few sequels that steps up...
","First off, I've read by critics that the shaky camera makes the movie suck and I have to say that sometimes it doesn't work but other times it's excellently made. The theme ran through most of the movie which gave it a fulfilling feel boldly stating that ""I am a sequel worth seeing because the studio didn't butcher me for a buck."" The direction overall was stylish and the acting was impressive from first time performers as well as a couple unknowns. The plot may seem silly at times as well as the dialogue, but it's surely better and more serious than most of the ""zombie genre."" I found it amazing that when the screen had no sound, not a person in the audience could be heard laughing, talking, or even grabbing popcorn. Only one thing could have been better: the character development. By the time the movie is over I wanted to know more about them. Other than that... thank you Fox, Fresnadillo, Danny Boyle, and all those that made this movie my favorite movie so far this year.<br/><br/>P.S. I hope the rage virus comes to New York and peels Spiderman off the wall because of his laughably bad 3rd movie."
"BA_Harrison","8","9","21","8 May 2007"," The return of 'The Rage'.
","Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's sequel to 28 Days Later is a scary, white-knuckle roller-coaster ride of a horror movie that is nightmarish, extremely nihilistic, gory and very grim. And to the director's credit, despite a few silly plot turns (which, with a little more thought could probably have been avoided) and the over-use of a cinéma vérité style which at times makes following the action very difficult, the film is still hugely enjoyable.<br/><br/>In the opening scenes, set during the original outbreak of 'The Rage', we meet Don (Robert Carlyle) who, along with his wife and a few other survivors, are barricaded inside a cottage. When the infected finally smash their way in, Don makes a break for it, abandoning his wife, believing her to be a goner.<br/><br/>28 weeks later, with all the victims of the virus now dead through starvation, Don (now in London) is reunited with his two children, who are back in the UK after being evacuated to Spain. However, his kids (in silly plot development number one) break out of a supposedly secure area in order to visit their old home to retrieve some belongings. Whilst there, they meet their mother, who (in silly plot development number two) has somehow not only survived multiple bites from the infected, but has also made it to London in one piece.<br/><br/>The kids and their mum are rounded up and returned to the 'safe' area, where a doctor, Scarlet (Rose Byrne), believes the mother to be carrying genes which make her immune to the virus. Unfortunately, although she is not a slavering killer lunatic, she is now a carrier for the virus; when she is reunited with her husband and (after forgiving him for bailing out on her) gives him a kiss...well, all hell breaks loose!<br/><br/>From here on in, the film is totally nerve-wracking stuff. With a new outbreak of 'the Rage' causing havoc, the military have orders to exterminate everyone in the area, including Don's son, Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), and daughter, Tammy (Imogen Poots). Together with Doyle (Jeremy Renner), a sniper who has abandoned his post, Scarlet (who realises that Andy may also have the immune gene), and a couple of other survivors, Andy and Tammy attempt to escape both the army and the 'zombies' (including, in silly plot development number three, an infected Don, who seems to be somehow tracking his kids) and plan to rendezvous with Doyle's pal Flynn (Lost's Harold Perrineau), a helicopter pilot.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later is cracking entertainment, with exciting car chases, scenes of excessive gore, and a genuine feeling of pathos (helped immensely by great use of the terrific score). Yes, it is let down somewhat by Fresnadillo's frantic, wobbly documentary style (which I appreciate was an attempt to fully immerse the viewer in the situation, but I would've liked to have seen it used a touch more sparingly) and the aforementioned 'silly' moments, but it is still a very effective shocker.<br/><br/>Even with its flaws, I give 28 Weeks Later a very admirable 7.5/10 (rounded up to 8 for IMDb) for being such a blast (and for having 'that' helicopter scene!)."
"herrnoel","1","10","24","13 May 2007"," What a travesty...
","Whereas 28 Days had subtlety, plausibility, real character development, and was only really circumstantially a horror film and actually a drama, 28 Weeks falls right into the tired, old horror movie clichés of ridiculously unbelievable events, inconsistent behavior based on established rules set up in 28 Days (referring here to behavior of certain infected), and exploitive 'gotcha' moments characteristic of every horror movie ever made.<br/><br/>I really REALLY wanted to enjoy this film, but it wasn't steeped in reality the way 28 Days was, and since I don't really care for the horror movie genre, I hated this film for being one of the biggest cinematic let downs since the Star Wars prequels."

","One star goes to the 4-note song that is repeated throughout this film during each of the many scenes of intense violence. Other than the score, this film is a pure waste of time. It lacks all the finesse and style of ""28 Days Later."" At two hours of almost non-stop slaughter, it has no character development and no plot. Granted, ""28 Days Later"" was slim on both, but this sequel has dispensed with *every* element of a good movie. And, because it's a sequel, it also lacks the novelty of the original film. The director subscribes to the ""scare the audience with sudden loud noises"" school of horror film-making. Unable to walk out (since I was with someone who, no matter how bad the film is, refuses to do so), I came out of this movie thoroughly disgusted I had to waste my time on it."

This film is no exception. I'll try and keep it succinct. <br/><br/>So: you take a BRILLIANT film with poignant and beautiful direction and a stellar cast and script about a story of the apocalypse and how derelict and alone the world is. And you takeaway the meaning behind it, destroy the lore of the film, nullify the impact and sense of the ending, change the director and script writer and Americanize the hell out of it.<br/><br/>The first film had no scope for a sequel, least of all one that makes absolutely no sense and opens a plethora of gaping plot holes.<br/><br/>The whole idea of the first one was that THE INFECTION WAS ONLY HAPPENING IN ENGLAND. The whole world was operating normally. It was just England, sitting there by itself. Left alone. And that's how it should have stayed. We can see in the end that there IS a cure to infection. Starvation. They AREN'T (although the sequel would have you think otherwise), zombies. They starve out in a matter of weeks.<br/><br/>So, in summation. If you like: big explosions, lots of gore, Americans, ridiculous and unrealistic scenes and a plot that makes no sense. . . this is the film for you.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of good cinematography, cohesion and general sense. . . watch 28 Days Later (and its stand-alone series THE RAGE - you can find it on YouTube), and give this pisspoor excuse for a film a miss.<br/><br/>Happy watching,<br/><br/>Labrat"

I can never sit through a movie enjoying any part of it, if there is a mistake in the storyline, which, if wasn't there, removes any possibility that the story could have or would have happened.<br/><br/>I know Americans aren't always known for being the most intelligent people on earth, but I don't believe even they, at their dumbest moment, would go back into England and create a colony in the middle of an infected country.<br/><br/>What would be the point in repopulating an extremely small part of England before the country is safe and free of disease? Why would you let non-military people live there? Are they going to start running Starbucks? Maybe they can re-open a Pizza Hut too.<br/><br/>Moving past this major flaw, when one of the main characters, a US sniper, radios in that two people have breached the quarantine zone, it took the US military what had to have been at least an hour to go and retrieve these people. By the time the 'escapees' are caught up with, they have discovered an infected person. Now I'm sorry, but when all of Britain has been wiped out by a disease, I can't imagine that anyone could be so laid back to take such a long time to collect people that breached the quarantine.<br/><br/>Only if you discount these, can you watch the movie and enjoy it, or can you....<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle's character 'Don', has an 'access all areas' card, including the research areas of the military base, further to that, access to a quarantine room where an infected person is being held, I can't wait to move to America, where the military lets civilians into their facilities, even the facilities where horrific diseases are studied.<br/><br/>Who would have thunk this is how the outbreak occurs.<br/><br/>As I said, I was unable to enjoy any part of this movie as there were MAJOR flaws in the story.

"zardoz-13","2","5","10","14 June 2007"," Dead On Arrival . . .
","Zombie movies are a dime a dozen nowadays, and the latest zombie movie ""28 Weeks Later"" isn't worth a dime. Technically, ""28 Weeks Later"" qualifies as a sequel of sorts to British director Danny Boyle's 2002 zombie chiller ""28 Days Later."" In ""28 Days Later,"" a botched laboratory experiment on animals unleashed a deadly virus that mutated humans into frenzied flesh-feasting maniacs on the rampage in the United Kingdom. None of the original cast survives to reprise their roles in Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's follow-up epic that he penned with three other scenarists Rowan Joffe, Enrique Lopez Lavigne, and Jesus Olmo. Original writer Alex Garland and Boyle serve only as producers, but apparently they felt confident enough about Fresnadillo to give the Spaniard a free hand. Indeed, the situation has changed dramatically from the first film. If movies were rated strictly on production values, ""28 Weeks Later"" would be a top-notch spine-tingler, but the monolithic plot and the dire lack of originality cripple this giddy chiller. The first scene that introduces us to the predicament of leading man Robert Carlyle promises more than the rest of the film can deliver. The exception to the rule is one scene where a U.S. Army helicopter flies low enough with its rotor blades acting as scythes to devastate a horde of zombies scrambling feverishly across an open field. This is about as fresh as this grisly yarn can get. The action degenerates into one hair-raising chase after another on foot, by car, by chopper, etc., with snarling zombies in hot pursuit with nothing to differentiate it from the countless other zombie movies out there. Worst, there's really nobody to either identify with and everybody pretty much gets bitten and turned into zombies.<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"" opens serenely enough in an isolated English farmhouse where a group of survivors hide out in relative peace. Husband Don Harris (Robert Carlyle of ""The World Is Not Enough"") and his wife Scarlet (Rose Byrne) are sharing the premises with another couple when somebody knocks at their door. They let the latest survivor--a child in--and set about feeding him when out of nowhere a horde of zombie burst to attack the house and literally rip it apart. During this melee, Don and Scarlet are separated, but Don can do nothing to save Scarlet. As the zombies charge after him, it is all Don can do to save his own skin and his escape is pretty narrow. After this explosive opener, ""28 Weeks Later"" goes about its business bringing audiences up to date on the latest events. You have to read several captions to grasp the current predicament. Fifteen days after the initial outbreak, the authorities quarantined mainland Britain. The rage virus decimated the population some 28 days later. Eleven weeks afterward, a U.S.-led NATO force arrived in London, and 18 weeks later, this force confirmed that the country was ""free"" of infection. NATO forces along with the returning civilian population began rebuilding twenty-four weeks later, and twenty-eight weeks later these citizens started their lives anew within the confines of a niche of the city. Snipers are stationed everywhere in case zombies reappear and helicopters with machine guns patrol the city.<br/><br/>At this point, Don is reunited with his two children, Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots), who had been earlier relocated to safety on the Spanish mainland. They inquire about their mother, and Don cringes with guilt as he tries to explain that he had to abandon her. Don's kids are curious, and they sneak off into the forbidden zone to check out their old home. Miraculously, they discover their mother, and the authorities lock up Rose to conduct tests on her because she appears unscathed from the ordeal. An Army medical expert believes that Rose may hold the solution to curing the plague since she hasn't mutated into a zombie. Meanwhile, the authorities have given Don special privileges to assist them. Incredibly, those special privileges extend to giving him a key that allows him access into any secure area. He visits Scarlet and kisses her and promptly contracts the plague. It's a little hard to believe that the authorities would have given Don such freedom, but it is also hard to believe that Rose could have escaped without a scratch.<br/><br/>Afterward, Don pursues his kids and an Army sniper who is trying to lead them to safety. ""28 Weeks Later"" turns into a mindless melodrama that tries to milk this predicament for all the adrenaline that it can, but it gets tiresome after the first chase and goes downhill. Predictably, ""28 Weeks Later"" ends with a set-up for a sequel which will hopefully not illuminate the big screen anytime soon."

When the movie finished, the only thing in my mind apart from a curse is: ""Who are the investors that are so stupid enough to pay these guys to produce such rubbish?"" This is the worst movie I have ever seen in recent years.<br/><br/>If anyone could write a comment about the movie that contains spoiler, I do really admire him. It is because it basically has no plot.<br/><br/>The whole movie is basically like this: A group of normal guys runs away from the other group of sort of zombie guys.<br/><br/>Those zombies trend to run faster than normal people and usually keep shouting and roaring for no reason. Their mouthes seem cannot be shut for some reason.<br/><br/>The storyline is the worst ever. Too many non-sense scenes. The acting is world class worst, especially the main character ""Andy"". He has basically no acting at all.<br/><br/>When we got out of cinema, I just asked, can I get my four pounds back? My friend said, I don't mind paying four pound but want to get my memory removed.<br/><br/>If you have a brain, try to avoid this non-sense."
"frankwhat","8","5","10","13 May 2007"," ""28 Weeks Later""  Not Late At All
","An intelligent horror film goes a long way in my book and ""28 Weeks Later"" did exactly that. I enjoyed the first one but thought it was only slightly above average. Although the extreme low budget utilized did add to the credibility of the impressive box office underdog that resulted. Usually when money is added to a sequel, havoc is wreaked and the franchise tends to get washed down the tubes. This was not the case here as the second installment proved to be just as intelligent, if not more so. While it was a zombie-type film, it contained everyday concerns that our world faces.<br/><br/>Technically those infected aren't zombies, so while it isn't a zombie movie per sethey do possess very similar characteristics to them. The way the virus can be transmitted has properties of HIV, but I don't think there was a social statement there as it was probably more coincidental. On the other hand, references to the war in Iraq were a little more poignant and while I don't think it was a direct blowthe director definitely wanted to point out how us Americans love our guns. Which is true. Chances are the U.S. soldiers here behaved exactly the same as they would in an actual confrontation such as this could it occur. They'd operate under the same short fuse and eagerness to bring out the big guns rather than sincerely try to rebuild a lost civilization.<br/><br/>As good as the story was, it wasn't without a fair share of errors. For starters there were huge gaps in the continuity between both movies. Rules that were set in ""28 Days Later"" went ignored in the sequel, and even some new ones were put into effect. Also the editing was so jumpy that any viewer who succumbs to motion sickness should steer clear, as the camera tends to bounce around mercilessly. I thought some of the action sequences were put together too messily as it was very hard to make out what was going on in some of them as well.<br/><br/>The acting itself was very appropriate for its genre and there were no extreme over-the-top theatrics that usually make me want to strangle some of the characters myself. My absolute favorite had to be Jeremy Renner though. I've been following him ever since his first underground film and while stardom has managed to elude him for quite some time, I think he is an excellent artist. Idris Elba I also adore ever since I've seen him on ""The Wire"", and he was great here, however his part seemed much too small for a gentleman of his caliber. Imogen Poots was visually stunning and I must say I was rather impressed with Rose Byrne who often tickles me as an annoying character. Robert Carlyle was good as usual in a creepy kind of role that he seems no stranger to. A lot of the audience seemed to pan him early on for a life changing decision he makes that is easy to find fault in. However in a survival viewpoint, he really did the right thing given the sure doom layout that was set before him and due to the fact that he only had a split second to determine what to do.<br/><br/>Now that the year is almost at the halfway mark, I must admit that I've been very impressed with what has been laid out so far. The cinema was getting so bad that I agreed with all the people that stopped going because of how outrageous the prices were getting. The costs have grown even worse in the meantime but they are almost worth it again and I wouldn't doubt it if the cycle reverses soon. ""28 Weeks Later"" is the best horror film I've seen in 2007 and I can't imagine what it'd take to beat it. This was an intellectual gore fest that combined great writing, excellent acting, and a break from formulaic slashers. I highly recommend this to just about anyone that can handle the jumps it dishes out and am willing to bet a third chapter will be on the way. Hopefully they can think of a better title than ""28 Months Later"" by then!"

","Actually, 28 Weeks Later was an awful attempt at a high budget special effects sequel that had none of the charm and intelligence of 28 Days Later. I cannot believe Danny Boyle and Alex Garland would put their stamp on this movie and even be involved as producers. There was not one single instance of CGI in the first movie and the jet that flies over at the end of the movie was actually more expensive then the whole rest of the movie cost to make, but the studio footed the bill for that. Without that, 28 Days Later, was the perfect example of a great independently made movie that was sold to a major studio who slopped out this sequel for us since they have the rights. In the original every character had a purpose, even the smaller ones, and the movie actually had a meaning. This sequel was just your run of the mill, horror fest, with characters and situations used as plot devices. Thanks for the fire bombing....big explosions, so new and innovative....what will they think of next? Zombies or not, this was a shame of a sequel. Almost akin to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's two sequels. The ones before the remake, people. What were they thinking? OH YEAH, AND THEY'RE NOT ZOMBIES!!!"
"bobbobwhite","3","9","22","11 May 2007"," Too many stupid story blunders
","Terrific potential unrealized here, as a possibly good apocalypse story was ruined by stupid storytelling/film-making. Like this.....an unbelievably dumb military mistake caused all the later problems for civilization after the virus problem had been totally contained. The rage virus had been contained, yes, but through its moronic mistake the military allowed the virus out to ravage the world again, this time probably for good. <br/><br/>Others have detailed the film story so I'm not going to; I am going to critique it hard as it sure deserves it.<br/><br/>The unrealistic story mistake that ruined everything was: why wasn't the infected wife guarded AT ALL BY ANYONE after she was diagnosed with the virus and strapped down on a gurney in a supposedly ""secure"" quarantine room. Her uninfected husband walked unseen right into her room, no guards anywhere, and was promptly infected by his wife's kiss.... The possible end of humanity if she escaped and NO GUARDS ANYWHERE GUARDING HER to prevent it? Have I made that goof entirely clear? <br/><br/>The newly-infected husband then ran right out of the entire building with no one at all seeing him, or anything! Incredible, and so stupid as to be beyond belief. But, I guess it had to happen to keep the filmmaker's senseless mayhem going but it should have been done much smarter, like have the husband sneak past guards going in or overpower and infect the guards coming out or at least something halfway smart! I lost all interest at that dumb point and knew it would be a stupid film. It was.<br/><br/>After the mistake that probably ended the world later, the military decides it would be real smart to lay total waste to the entire city to kill all the people infected by the husband AFTER he escaped due to the military's dumb mistake. It was made very clear that the military is good at killing lots of people(innocent and uninfected victims were also killed)afterward but it can't guard a single infected one properly. This showed what the military does best... kill, as it sure didn't use any brainpower(military intelligence?) to prevent lots of killing later.<br/><br/>More totally stupid things: the infected husband follows his kids around London as they run this way and that trying to escape the infected ones, but then he tries to infect them as soon as he gets a chance. What happened to the father's suggested paternal instinct(why would he follow ONLY them?) but that hope was cheaply sacrificed for the sake of infecting his son to ruin the world later, and then he got shot by his daughter as he tried to infect her. Another bad decision by the filmmaker was that the soldier leading the escape group to supposed safety couldn't shoot any more civilians due to moral problems with it, but he could readily kill his own soldier comrade without a problem to help the group escape? What happened to his morals there? This film story was so dumb, purely in order to move the horror along no matter how unreasonable it was...""just make it scary, don't worry if it's stone dumb, they'll never know the difference""! There were other mile wide holes in the story I could tell, but you get the picture of how bad it was.<br/><br/>This was a dumb movie made for and by dopes, with easily seen, gaping holes in its gaping holes, as it pushed the same gory sensationalism scene after scene with no attempt at good, intelligent and tight storytelling. Forget it, and quickly. Just awful. If this is what passes for smart entertainment with the youth of today, God help us."

","28 days later was good, 28 weeks later is garbage. There are so many plot holes that I do not feel like describing them all so here are just a few....Why are there no security guards surrounding the wife??

Then when they do, why does it take the army so long to find them??

"andell","2","6","13","13 May 2007"," One Screwed up Sequel!
","When it comes to the horror genre, all the 21st century typically has is the rip off, the re-make or the sequel. The difference is as follows: the rip off is ""inspired"" by the ideals in a film, but technically utilizes them in a 'different' way for the same effect; the re-make is pretty much self explanatory, and so too is the sequel.<br/><br/>Guess what money making venture is at work here?<br/><br/>Of course ""28 Weeks Later"" could've been good. Very good in fact...had it remained committed to the ideals of the original instead of inventing a new set of rules.<br/><br/>The story is as follows: 1- Couple is happy they sent their son and daughter abroad. They are then attacked by the infected, leaving the husband. 2- Several weeks after the infection has receded, the US Army takes control of re-settling the country. The 15,000 who haven't been killed and/or infected are placed in a quarantined zone of London. Father is reunited with his son and daughter. 3- Son realizes he doesn't have a photo of his Mom- persuades his sister to go out with him back to their home to recover a photo. While there, they find Mom. 4- Mom is the only person in the country who didn't become infected, but is a carrier. She also has different colored eyes...as has her son. Mom is taken into quarantine. 5- Kids confront Dad. Dad uses his all access key card (yeah, in a military lock down, a civilian who isn't US military has an all access key card...didn't make sense to me either) to get to his wife...kisses her, becomes infected, and it starts all over again. 6- Kids survive...but the other's who were with them aren't so lucky. And the son/brother does turn out to be a carrier, but not effected by the virus- so he's the key to solving the infection!<br/><br/>As for the flaws:<br/><br/>1- A civilian with all access to every place? This is military quarantine...they are prepared to exterminate everyone. So they don't even bother keeping the person who is shown to be infected with the virus in a secured area with armed guards and surveillance? It doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>2- Okay, I realize that its become very popular in this genre to have the audience guessing at what just happened: but enough is enough. C'mon...the shaking camera has to go. At several points in this film, when the infected were attacking, the camera work becomes so jittery that you can't even make out what is happening. One could suggest the director was trying to spare the audience from buckets of gore- of course that loses some of its effectiveness when exploding heads and infected vomiting blood all over a car windshield are brought into the mix. <br/><br/>3- This film missed the mark completely! The original contrasted the instinct driven rage driven infected with the sinister motives of the armed bullies who decide to succumb to another sort of madness. It did it in a way that was both unique and exciting. If this film wanted to make an interesting sequel, it should've employed the same sense of creativity! Maybe the issue for survivors of this kind of circumstance would be 'cabin fever.' Maybe its something different. Either way, this film just didn't work at all."
"cultfilmfan","9","7","16","12 May 2007"," 28 Weeks Later
","28 Weeks Later is a sequel to the film 28 Days Later and follows the previous film several weeks later (as the title suggests). The film takes place in Britain where the army has helped keep an area of town safe where the survivors can stay and everything seems fine until the virus that infected everyone from the first film is back infecting people and a young brother and sister along with a woman from the army are on the run from the infected and trying to make it to a place where they will be safe, but unfortunately for them the virus is spreading quickly and they don't have long to run and hide from the carriers of the disease. Back in 2003 before I saw 28 Days Later, I found the screenplay at my local bookstore, so I sat down and read it. This also lead to a fellow book enthusiast sitting beside me telling me for some reason that he believes that zombies actually exist, but that is another story. Anyways, I was quite impressed with the screenplay of 28 Days Later, so I saw it in theatres shortly after and was impressed by the film as well. When, I heard that a sequel was being made and the original writer and director were only involved as producers, I wasn't so sure if it would turn out well or not, but after having just seen the film I must conclude that this new director and writer pulled it off, and quite well I may add. The film took a little different approach then the first installment whereas this version has a lot more action and things happening where the first film had a more slow approach and built up the action and suspense as it went along, but this film started with non stop action right within the first ten minutes. This isn't to say that the first film's approach was bad in anyway because it wasn't, it was just kind of nice to see it done in a different kind of style and pace. The non stop action and the very fast editing worked for me and kept me quite entertained and the movie held it's own while remaining stylish and delivering thrills and gore as well. There were also more dramatic scenes in the film and times where there was no action and things were being explained and it got to show what was going on with the city and the characters a little bit, but those scenes were well done and worked as well. The manic energy and pace of this film captured my attention and interest right from the start and with it's stylish direction, good editing and just fast action and happenings I really had a good time with this film. The horror scenes worked well as did the action scenes and from a technical point the film was well made and as a rule any horror fan can tell you that most sequels do not work (and this does not just apply to the horror category either), but this film worked on every level from story to direction to just having a good time and like I mentioned earlier I liked how it had some of the same qualities I liked about the first film, but I also liked how it took some new approaches as well. This is one of the better horror films and sequels of recent years and if done properly I could see how a third installment in the series could work as well, but for now this one is better than okay and for a film of this kind it really is very good."
"emmanuelhenry","6","3","5","26 September 2015"," 28 Weeks later is a hollow and Forgettable sequel.
","First Off, I knew this one was not going to be as good as 28 Days Later.. that one was my favorite zombie/horror of all time cause I was not a big fan of the genre but that one really surprised me. I was a little sad That Director Danny Boyle and Writer Alex Garland did not come back. I was happy they would make introduce new characters because I thought the last film completed their story so well I would be mixed if they but them back in another bad situation and rehash like the Jurassic Park series. Now lets talk why I don't love this movie, I'm going to try not compare it to the original but thats going to be hard because my main issue why this movie does not work is the characters. What the reasons the original worked so well is that you cared about the characters and how they developed and you cared when something happened to them, it left you with a emotion. This one thought has some of the most stupid characters decisions on movie I ever seen not just they do stupid thing but they are completed hollow. It's like the script dictates the character so the movie could move along here is a example in the beginning of the movie this female character is depressed because her boyfriend left her with this survivors living in a house in the countryside and a kid is knocking on the locked door and let him in but then she decides it's a good idea go and break a piece of wood to look outside which is possibly filled with hungry zombies to look for her boyfriend and risk the lives of the survivor I mean come on but thats not the only part that like that. There is also a over use of shaking cam in this one it works when you use it carefully but here they just use it all the time. For a positives well the cinematography is nice and movie has a nice look and that they got the balls to kill big name stars like Jeremy Renner and Rose Byrne but besides that this one is forgettable just skip it 6.1/10"

","OK. This 2007, big-budget, zombie movie certainly did have its fair share of good points, as well as its share of bad points, too.<br/><br/>On the plus side - I thought that the ""run-for-your-life"" panic which prevailed (when the ""Rage-Virus"" zombies were literally biting everyone and anyone that they could during the all-out zombie attack) was handled very well. The heart-pounding terror (as it escalated into a frenzied ""Code Red"" situation) really progressed quite nicely and became a very satisfying adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>And, on top of that - The excellent, rapid-fire editing, along with the often-haunting soundtrack music, all added up to a number of very riveting horror-movie moments.<br/><br/>But, on the down side - Not only did I get pretty fed up with the entire combat unit (who were all just a bunch of predictable, garden-variety jocks) - But when Tammy and Andy Doyle deliberately sneaked away from ""District One"" and entered into the restricted zone (where all hell suddenly broke loose), I thought that this whole business weakened 28 Weeks Later's story-line considerably and lost it some significant points.<br/><br/>And, finally - The one thing that really puzzled me about ""Rage-Virus"" was - Why were the infected ones not biting other animals (and then these creatures, in turn, would become infected biters, as well)?"

","28 Weeks Later (2007): Dir: Juan Carlos Fresnadillo / Cast: Robert Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Catherine McCormack, Imogen Poots: Graphic film about the consistency of decay. Begins with promise as humans infected with the rage virus. 28 weeks pass and London is deemed safe. Robert Carlyle is reunited with his two children before it is learned that his wife is still alive but infected. It doesn't take a genius to figure out where this is leading. Watching a father mutilate his wife and son is not fun nor entertaining. Carlyle is involved in an effective opening where he flees his home in order to lead the infected away. He regrets leaving his wife but where the film goes from here is pure lunacy. Catherine McCormack plays his wife who remains at the cottage in order to protect a boy who suddenly sheltered there. The ending is hopeless although director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo plays off reality T.V. in his visual. Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner and Catherine McCormack are fine actors working with flat material, although there was certainly potential for growth had it not been for the screenwriter's desire to illustrates bloody carnage and mutilation. The first film was effective giving us zombies that advanced in movement, which somewhat ups the amp for suspense. This sequel, however is a total graphic mess that should have viewers vomiting long after 28 weeks. Score: 4 / 10"

","I'm a big Walking Dead fan. The show of course didn't exist when 28 Days Later or 28 Weeks Later came out.<br/><br/>I loved 28 Days Later so much that I bought the film, and dust it off every couple of years for a viewing.<br/><br/>But when I saw 28 Weeks Later at the theater, I remember being disappointed. It was a far cry from the original, and for some reason I was just turned off by it. Time has passed, and realizing that I had completely forgotten the plot, I recently decided to give it a second viewing.<br/><br/>Wow. This film gets intense immediately; truly gripping from the start. The zombies are much more terrifying than what you find in The Walking Dead. The characters are decent; not as strong as the first film, but good enough that the film is absolutely entertaining and fun throughout.<br/><br/>SPOILER (minor one) - the only scene that I dislike (and remember hating when I originally saw the film) was the scene where the helicopter flies so low that the zombies are ""mowed down."" I know this is a crazy zombie movie, but any sense of reality (or at least that long-shot ""this could happen"") went out the window for those few seconds, bringing the film from a 10 to a 9 (on my ""horror movie"" scale).<br/><br/>In summary, if you are looking for a fun zombie flick, give this one a shot; even if you have seen it, it might be worth a second watching."

","This follow-up to the Danny Boyle horror flick 28 DAYS LATER takes the premise from the first film and creates a fresh, pulse-pounding horror flick that stands up on its own right as well as being marginally better than the original. Although Boyle only returns here as executive producer (also shooting some second-unit stuff) and the original film's cast are nowhere to be seen, this retains the bleakness and horror of 28 DAYS LATER while adding to the experience. Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo – this is his first English film – calls the shots this time around and he does well.<br/><br/>My only complaint is with his excessive use of the 'shaky-cam', that annoying way of shooting action in which the camera jerks all over the place making it impossible to pick out anything more than vague shapes. Here it's taken to a nauseating, pointless extreme, although I'm pleased to say that it doesn't seem so bad after it's first used in the initial scene. The shoulder-cam on Robert Carlyle, in comparison, is both inventive and effective.<br/><br/>The film lets loose right from the word go with a brief, 5-minute reprise of the classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD zombie scenario. After that, we're treated to half an hour's build up, with plenty more spooky shots of the deserted London streets – these make for very powerful moments. Of course, the rage virus comes back to the fore, and once more the infected roam the streets. Zombies in all but name, these killers are super-fast and bloodthirsty, and quite terrifying. Fresnadillo tends to shoot around them or show them in quick blood-drenched glimpses which makes them all the more frightening. The film has some fun with the US army, drafted in with echoes of the Iraq occupation, and their heavy-handed way of dealing with the situation is perhaps even more frightening than the infected themselves.<br/><br/>Essentially the film is a series of scary set-pieces, each more outlandish and drama than the next. The filmmakers stress this is a family drama at heart, and certainly the actions and reactions of four family members are central to the movie. Catherine McCormack (BRAVEHEART) is disturbing and frightening as the mother, bitten by the infected, who becomes a carrier rather than an infected herself. I didn't recognise her from the Mel Gibson film; she seems to have changed completely in the 12 years since.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle carries the first half of the film on his shoulders and his performance is outstanding – probably the best I've seen him give. The film introduces two new young actors who play the brother and sister around whom the film is focused; Imogen Poots is a fragile blonde beauty, while Mackintosh Muggleton, despite his silly name, gives a performance that belies his youth in terms of maturity and delivery. The rest of the characters are little more than stereotypes, although TROY's Rose Byrne stands out as a sympathetic scientist, and Jeremy Renner steals his scenes as a genuinely heroic character, a US soldier who rebels against his orders and helps the protagonists to make their escape.<br/><br/>Looking back on the film, I find many scenes fresh in my mind. The rotted bodies in the Tube and in the deserted shops and homes set the horrific atmosphere well. The scenes of soldiers shooting civilians and later fire-bombing the city of London are disturbing in the extreme. I love the shots of the toxic gas clouds slowly moving through the deserted streets. The bit in the car is edge-of-the-seat and the chase through the streets at night is innovative and cleverly-done, no day-for-night shooting here. There's an interlude in Regent's Park in which the infected are dispatched with the blades of a helicopter which rivals Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD for splatter.<br/><br/>The infected make-up is outstanding, truly terrifying, with blood-red contact lenses and gallons of the red stuff all over their mouths and bodies. Fresnadillo makes a great use of London, with location shooting giving a real sense of the capital's character. The downbeat ending is a little hard to swallow, but I can live with that. Truly, this is a disturbing and effective horror film; the gore flows thick and fast, although the low-light is a gruesome eye-gouging that's hard to watch even in the days of HOSTEL and SAW III. 28 WEEKS LATER is a great film that surpasses the original in most ways, and I wouldn't mind seeing another in the series. 28 MONTHS LATER, anyone?"

","28 Weeks Later is the very promising and very terrific sequel to 28 Days Later. It starts off strong, and the film never lets go. It has great production values. The direction by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is really amazing. He directs with a fast-paced tone. The cinematography is spectacular, and the film has a sort of futuristic look to it. It has the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The writing is very strong. The characters are very well developed, so we care about them. The performances by everyone in the cast are top notch. The action is riveting, since this film is more of an action film than 28 Days Later. I also thought this was a very thought-provoking film. The way people have to kill each other because there is no other way is a truly deadly thought. It reminded me of the theme of The Mist, another great 2007 horror film. Overall, everything that made 28 Days Later work is present here as well. 28 Weeks Later might even be better than the original. I very much appreciate horror films like this, and am very glad they can still be made. Terrific film-making!"
"blackasp98","10","3","5","20 March 2009"," Incredible film
","From the first time i saw 28 days later i was so hoping to see this film when it was completed. For this reason was one of two things. First Robert Carlyle, this guy in on my top list of favorite actors. His no nonsense approaches to his characters is always flawless what ever he plays. I first saw Robert in a good film called formula 51, a kind of knock off guy who works for the local mafia in Liverpool. Seeing his abilities when acting reminds me of how players in films should act, with no barriers in the way. The second reason i wanted to see this film was because of the premise this story holds. The aftermath of the infection, where survivors are transported back to Britain where their lives can re-establish. But in this friendly chaos a lone survivor who was bitten became an infected, but with a immunity to its shortcomings. The survivors husband Robert Carlyle, makes a small reunion, and not knowing she is infected, kisses her with affection. And in that kiss becomes the nightmare all over again by becoming the rage virus, spreading through the citizens one by one until the army has no choice but to eliminate everybody, infected or not. I am really hoping again that another film to this successful genre can be made to offer a more broadened area of infectees to roam around, such as France and then the United states where i think all people should see Americans run around like madmen."

","28 Weeks Later is, as you might already know a follow on from Danny Boyle's British horror shocker from 2002. To achieve such a film like 28 Weeks Later is terrific and brilliant weather it be technically or narratively, 'Weeks' has it all. From it's riveting but highly terrifying opening attack through to the spine-chilling shot of the zombies sprinting to the Eiffal Tower, 'Weeks' escapes the some-times narrow mindlessness from the first film and brings a new depth and life to it.<br/><br/>To succeed over 'Days' is a mammoth task, but director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has conquered and even be-wildered all. The direction is searing and definitely nerve-shredding at times because of the heights of edge of you seat tension created. The action compared to 'Days' is 100 times gorier and blood-soaked than before and Fresnadillo doesn't hide this."

","28 Days Later stood out of its genre as a genuinely good film. 28 Weeks Later is one of those sequels (common in this genre) that trade on the buzz of the original to churn out a standard genre flick that doesn't have much inspiration of its own to work with. It's OK for what it is, but don't expect it to have the style or subtlety of the first 28. I think they tried to make up for it by making everything a lot louder. If you grind your teeth during horror films that are driven by a chain of people doing obviously stupid things that could have no other result than a horrific bloodbath, skip this one.

","I have never before written a movie review, but watching 28 weeks later has prompted me to bother registering here and writing this review, just so I can share my opinion with others, Like may others have said, the film gets off to a good start, but then goes downhill way fast.<br/><br/>I won't bother to go into the details - see comments of other reviewers who have rated this film low.. but basically, PLOT holes and stupid things and events happening... just so DUMB in parts ! My main grip though, is ... IT'S ALL SHOT IN THE BLOODY DARK ! Yes, I understand and appreciate that this adds a certain tension, but honestly, this film is virtually unwatchable because YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING FOR MOST OF THE TIME ! 28 Weeks Later was just a bigger-budget action movie shot with lots of that pretentious camera shake, quick cut scenes, and DARK lighting.<br/><br/>Rather than adding suspense, this just ruined it for me, because (call me old fashioned if you want), when I watch a movie, I like to be able to actually SEE what's going on !! See comments by other reviewers (dgci-net) and L. Lion (laughing_lion)...<br/><br/>As someone has already said, I think I would have liked watching this movie - if I could actually have SEEN it !!"

"Ike524","2","4","8","18 May 2007"," Too bad
","I was eagerly awaiting this sequel. In a summer drowning in them, I thought a follow up to the Boyle classic original could stand out as a second edition to a storyline worthy of more story.<br/><br/>I don't think I can say how disappointing '28 Weeks Later' was in only 1,000 words! The story was thin, even though the tag lines and trailer gave hope for much more. Having three credited screenwriters is always a bad sign for an action film.<br/><br/>I don't mind the use of hand-held cameras, but I have to say that it was completely distracting in this case. The action is choppy and nearly impossible to follow. Any scene that wasn't of a crowd was filmed in intense close-up, for no reason I could see other than maybe the operator didn't know how to adjust the depth. He couldn't hold the camera still, certainly. Most scenes were poorly lit, and I don't think it was all about setting a mood, either.<br/><br/>I won't give away any plot points, but there were a few story elements, meant to be poignant and touching, (I think), but so impossible, so horribly conceived and executed, that the audience I saw it with laughed at them. So bad they were funny, and not on purpose.<br/><br/>I saw and really liked 'Intacto', so I know that Fresnadillo can make good movies. If you liked '28 Days Later', just wait for the next sequel. It can't be worse than this one."
"chris_leinster","4","4","8","16 May 2007"," Awful
","When I heard that this film was in production, I knew it would be awful. Then I saw the trailers and thought that maybe there was a glimmer of hope. I was wrong. The plot has such gargantuan holes in it that even the most die-hard horror fan couldn't gloss over them. An example of this is when the first infected human shows up and the US Army decides that the best thing to do with the 1,000 or so civilians that they are protecting, is to herd them all into one room in the basement and then leave them there un-guarded. Brilliant.<br/><br/>The infected are not zombies, but in this film seem to have developed their characteristics. Some are seen chopped in half (in an admittedly awesome way) and lying on the ground, squirming around and looking angry. Problem is these never were zombies in terms of them being undead, so wounds like this should finish them off as they would a normal person. They also seem to spend a lot more time biting people than they did in the first film, again alluding that they are conventional zombies, which they are not.<br/><br/>This film lacks any of the charm or wit of it's predecessor and becomes just another poorly thought out horror/action film. The violence as well is pretty disgusting at some points. The eye-squashing move from the original returns, but this time is shown in a series of brutal close-ups, with blood oozing all over the place. Now I'm not squeamish, and I don't mind violence in films, but in this context I thought it was way over the top and unnecessarily grim.<br/><br/>One infected is focused on as the ""bad guy"" in this movie. The fact that he survives for he final encounter is another gaping plot hole, as he must have had to chase the heroes through London whilst it was being napalmed, nerve gassed, and with the heroes in a car at one point. Yet he still manages to follow them the whole way.<br/><br/>I give it 4/10, maybe bump it up to 5 for the scene where they escape being gunned down by a US Army helicopter in a Volvo."
"iso-kincses","9","4","8","14 May 2007"," My best ""horror"" so far.
","I didn't go to see '28 Days Later' just because I don't like zombie-flicks, and I thought it was one of them. Now, I may reconsider after seeing this one. Well, to tell the truth, I don't think about it as a zombie-movie, rather than an 'extinction-thriller' if such genre exists...<br/><br/>There are infected people whose brains click to the same trigger as the brain of a zombie would do so. But these people die more efficiently (and plainly, yet way much spectacularly) than the usual living dead. Thus, we're saved from the only-disgusting-but-embarrassingly-boring scenes of rotten corpses crawling towards the heroes with their bowels on a leash. That's a major improvement!<br/><br/>And what's also important: they don't take up more running time than it's really asked for! <br/><br/>So, it's England put back into nature's control for a really good kick-off.<br/><br/>Anyone who ever travelled by any means of public transport in a big city (bodies squeezed together, you can smell armpits, you actually feel the general annoyance of the creature-formed-by-the-mass) or stuck in a traffic jam, (so basically EVERYONE) had the fantasy about being one of the few survivors of a world wide pandemic, strolling the streets and hijacking abandoned vehicles to ride around king-of-the-city-style...<br/><br/>Two kids do so in the streets of London. Loved that!<br/><br/>The pacing is just perfect! A bit of nervous survivor's feast at the beginning, like we were on board of Morpheus' Ship. The tension is in the air, and soon enough we get to see the raging hordes of the infected. Than the vehicle is put back into second gear again, just to gather up the strength for a major boost. When it's Code-Red-Time, our muscles can't relax any more. I think I actually lived with the movie for a while, which is very rare. The SCORE, I'd say that's the main reason. Usually I don't pay much attention to the music, though I know how important it can be. Now, I guessed, it's gonna be like in the case of 'Sunshine'. Both trailers are awesome, with their developing music themes. And we couldn't even get the chance to hear it again in 'Sunshine', so I thought it was going to be another fishy trailer trick. (I had some really bad experiences with trailers lately, biggest was Spiderman 3.) But it wasn't! The score kept together the whole movie, made it tense as ever, made me pinned down to my seat with my fists clinched whenever they started to play it. And one more thing; we simply can't get enough of them Spanish and Mexican directors! Juan Carlos Fresnadillo just joined the league of extraordinary gentlemen formed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, Guillermo del Toro, and Alfonso Cuarón. Though you have the feeling watching this movie as it was a Vietnam Vet's recreation of a nightmare after reading Robert Merle's Malevil, so nothing particularly ""Latino"", but never mind, it is working like a well greased Spanish torture-machine..<br/><br/>Now, fingers crossed for this movie to be able to push Spiderman 3 off its undeserved throne. GO AND SEE IT FOLKS!"
"robertjgarcia4","4","4","8","12 May 2007"," Where are the zombies?! Oh, and the character development?
","Major disappointment. I think it is a testament to the popularity of the zombie film that so many users have given this film good marks, desperate as they are for anything new in the genre. However, this film suffers from a terrible script and absolutely no character development.<br/><br/>The zombie genre is comprised of basically three franchises, the Romero epics, Zak Snyder's remake, and Danny Boyle's new take on the zombie apocalypse. While the first film was a terrific example, the sequel falls short. VERY short.<br/><br/>Without giving out any spoilers, you will learn nothing about any of the characters, and therefore not really care when they die. The most menacing figures in the film are the military personnel, zombies seem to take a backseat. The plot, while exhibiting a few clever moments, makes no sense and leads up to a lame ending that is, frankly, a major cop-out.<br/><br/>As far as the direction, the shaky Blair Witch-like camera work is effective in the first harrowing scene. However, it gets old quick, and clearly becomes a method of skimping on effects when it comes to showing the zombies themselves. It seems as though the entire budget was spent on the CG sequences, which, while good looking, do not add anything to the film.<br/><br/>This movie could have been a terrific sequel with some serious script rewrites, some decent dialogue and character development, and, dare I say it....MORE ZOMBIES! Overall, it seemed rushed to capitalize on Hollywood's zombie craze, and as a result, proves a poor example of the genre."
"jhsanders-1","9","6","14","1 June 2007"," That wasn't what we expected....
","Heavens above, that was intense.<br/><br/>This isn't a 'zombie film'. This isn't even a 'horror film'. This is one of the single most disturbing films we've ever seen - and that's saying something.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time either of us, both seasoned horror fans, sat in the car on the way home blatantly trying not to burst into tears. There wasn't a single point where this 'let up' - the original has a great opening and then lost its way, but this never, ever loses it. There are a couple of moments of perhaps unnecessary gore, but the overall effect is so powerful that you will be unbelievably glad to be walking out of that cinema into broad daylight. Within the first ten minutes I was struggling not to weep, and that's really scared me. This was really scare you. See it at the cinema, on a big screen, before it's too late."
"David_Frames","7","6","14","12 May 2007"," Maybe its because I'm a Londoner...
","Those who live in it have always known it to be so, but now it's official, that is to say - enshrined on celluloid; London is a hard place to live. Still at least in the world of 28 weeks later you aren't forced to share a tiny space with millions of bad tempered, brain dead, herd minded lunatics, always in a hurry to get everywhere. You'd think a situation like that would be ripe for satire but...<br/><br/>Then there's the tube. Everyone knows its a dank, cattle transport system where people would step over you rather than give you room to move. A repository of the living dead. Bags of social comment there. But again...<br/><br/>With the war in Iraq now entering its 349th year with 3 trillion people dead and the landscape reduced to a bombed husk; murderous, blood thirsty insurgents bleeding out of every damaged building, public space and cranny, the presence of American solders attempting to police and reconstruct a decimated Britain would the perfect plot device to carpet bomb an audience with allegorical abstraction but no, not a bit of it.<br/><br/>All of which is as true as the notion you can contain a monkey-based zombie emulating virus. 28 weeks later starts 28 weeks ago with Robert Caryle, later just slightly less insane than he was as Begbie in Trainspotting, leaving wife Catherine McCormack to be ravaged by some human rape bombs. He's later reunited with his kids and interned in the Isle of Dogs, perhaps the only scenario which might make you long to be back amongst the infected, vomiting blood. Her kids want a picture of Mum though, bless 'em, and improbably escape the blockade, returning to their house where McCormack is discovered alive, infected but curiously not that angry. She alone it seems has partial immunity to the virus and is brought back to the Dogs with predictably horrific results.<br/><br/>Despite having much more money at his disposal, at least enough to put film in his camera, Juan Carlos Fernsadillo, taking over from Danny Boyle, still manages to retain the lo-fi grainy bleakness of the original film. He alternates between lavish aerial shots of a deserted London and frenetic, hand-held close up horror - upping the ante in terms of both gore and gun play - the introduction of the army providing much scope for the infected getting chunks blown out of them by trigger happy snipers. For all that, its a less human film than it's predecessor, perhaps because the one character with the most interesting moral conundrum - Caryle, is dispatched before he's had a chance to really face up to his actions (though getting a dose from the wife is pretty bad but does vindicate his decision to initially run for it). Following his descent into blood lust, Begbie - sorry, Don - improbably chases his children across most of London, bumping into them enough times to suggest that all the statistics about kids being most likely to be killed by their genetic forebears are spot on. If that wasn't enough, a line from Juan's own screenplay inadvertently undoes the entire first film, suggesting he may missed the first five minutes of it, when we learn that that the virus doesn't travel between species. I know we're close to apes and I'm no zoologist but they're still not quite humans are they? Still its good news for the Irish. <br/><br/>Still Juan makes good use of his locations and the momentum is with the film, driving it forward to its lip curling conclusion in which another nation looks to pay the price for its decision to elect a right wing charlatan with designs on dismantling the country's well preserved social model.<br/><br/>Yes, 28 jours plus tard should be a lot of fun."

BTW this comment is more of a list of class-A big NO-NO's OK some will say, it was necessary otherwise there would have been no movie, wrong, horror/slasher does not automatically mean retarded.<br/><br/>1. bringing people back bfr all the cleaning up was done, you just don't do that after u've had a nation-wide pandemic. 2. (accepting stupid act n.1) bringing people back without a psych assessment, 3. the kids got out? how did they do that? cameras everywhere, guards every ten feet... c'mon man. 4. snipers everywhere with a pretty clear mission, sniper sees them, doesn't shoot. 5. sniper calls in, kids get to roam the city for 30min+ bfr they get caught, unlikely considering modern day video/infra-red chopper surveillance. 6. where did the chopper pilot get all his fuel, how could he still be around, military SOP is very strict, u don't just fly around when-ever u like. 7. 1st survivor in months, left unguarded, with a disturbingly weird eye?? c'mon.... 8. that civie had full-access to a military base? the day that'll happen pigs will be flying. 9. this should have been number 1 actually, WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT TO GO OUT??? Does it even remotely seem logical that all the guards and quarantine are there just for fun? 10. u kill the zombie dad, but u don't kill the zombie brother? 11. the mysterious chopper pilot lets them get in? when they look all bloodied and weird and stuff, the kid has a red eye.... NOOOOT<br/><br/>So i really have to give this a max of 5points (and that's only cuz i like seeing zombies get splattered/burned/shot/etc)....28 days later was a smart horror/thriller, this sequel was just plain stupid...out there with the rest of the zombie movies... almost as stupid as land of the dead.. don't pay for this, it's not worth it and u'll just be annoyed by the moronic ending... rental, maybe... if you have nothing better to do."

"davideo-2","9","5","11","16 May 2007"," A great sequel, on a par with the original
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>The virus that was unleashed in the first film has now wiped out virtually all of London and NATO send in US troops to quarantine the deserted city, keeping the marauding zombies under control and ensuring calm and order amongst the people. Don (Robert Carlyle) has retreated from his hide-out in the country, cowardly leaving his wife behind to die, but returns to the capital city to be re-united with his children Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and break the news about their mother to them. But then to his terror, Don learns his wife has survived and is secured in the quarantine camp. Not only that, but she has a rare blood type that is fighting off the virus. When she infects Don with the virus, turning him into a zombie, his kids are left to make their own way to safety, aided by a humanistic American soldier named Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and Sally (Amanda Walker) a doctor who wants to protect Tammy above all else, believing she may hold the cure to the virus.<br/><br/>I must admit this sequel to the very enjoyable 2002 Brit chiller 28 Days Later caught me somewhat by surprise, as I had no idea of it being in production or even having been made until a few weeks before it came out. Nevertheless, making a sequel to that great homegrown film has been a surprisingly inspired idea, a film that manages to be just as tense and atmospheric as the original, getting right on a par with it in fact. The over-view of a deserted London is as eerie and unsettling as last time round, with a neat sense of claustrophobia creepily taking over the hustle and bustle usually associated with that city. Only this time round, there's more as an emphasis on the action element as well, a la Aliens, with the gung ho Americans being drafted in to restore order to the decaying city with their tough talk and big guns. Nevertheless, we have a likable character in Doyle, a man of reason and compassion when all his colleagues are pushing their military might around. There's a nice, believable edge to all the characters in fact, from the selfish and cowardly father, to the two kids who become orphans realizing they're all they have together now and so sticking together through thick and thin.<br/><br/>With Danny Boyle and a lot of the original production team tied up with the year's earlier Brit mega flick Sunshine, Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has taken over here. Although he retains a lot of Boyle's original vision, his camera use during the zombie attacks is a little too shaky and close-up, which is a bit of a hindrance. But what a minor complaint with a film that does what I was convinced it would not do, live right up to the standards of the original and, while not improving on it in any way, matching it's quality right up to a tee. ****"

","28 Weeks Later is a misnomer. The name of this movie should have been 28 IQ Points Later b/c that is the minimum number of IQ points you will lose by watching it. The entire movie is driven by characters displaying unbelievable stupidity and cowardice. Every bad thing that happens happens b/c one of the characters is scared or does something just, well, unbelievably stupid (sorry about the lack of variety in my word choice but my vocabulary has shrunk b/c I just spent 1.5 hours listening to British people/zombies scream bloody murder and nothing else...not to mention I lost approx. 34 IQ points). Despite the absolutely asinine nature of the story's development, the movie does boast some great production values, decent acting, and more red-dyed corn-syrup than you could find in a candy factory (not to mention one great helicopter scene that George Romero wishes he could have done). Unfortunately though, that's about all the good I can say for the movie. Like I said, the plot and story development relies solely on the unabashed stupidity, cowardice, and irrationality of the characters, not to mention that the music in the movie is so heavily and obviously used that describing it as predictable and baroque would be an insult to 17th century European parlor music.

"Gary-161","Null","5","11","12 May 2007"," NO ESCAPE? Try the door marked ""EXIT""
","The opening scene plays like the climax, as if they muddled the reels. It is so terrifying that you know they cannot possibly follow it. Unfortunately, it is also confusingly shot, which did not bode well for the rest. Like SUNSHINE, I had no clue what was happening most of the time. Why do filmmakers do this? <br/><br/>Another miscalculation is the characterization. The original saw the world through the eyes of one individual. The sequel begins with one individual who is not sympathetic then shifts to Jurassic park kids who are less relatable. These children are forced to witness such brutal scenes, not least an unnecessarily explicit torching, that it is a turn off. The original actually had only two really violent scenes. Danny Boyle wisely pulled his punches for the rest of the picture so as to let the human drama breathe. His film had a heart. The sequel parades its heart in a token way before plonking it on a blooded sideboard so as to get on with gratuitousness. Apparently, a sequel has to have more, more, more. I think less is always more. The producers think we want another eye-gouging, but that worked in the original because it was delivered to someone unsympathetic to the audience. The sequel is about nastiness for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The script has not an idea in its head, even resorting to a redundant lift from ""The Silence of the Lambs"". I presume the inclusion of so many Americans is due to the original's success in the States. I like the idea of America colonizing Britain but nothing is really done with the idea. Only the opening scene lingers uncomfortably in the memory. This really is a poor film.<br/><br/>If you see Dick Wittington outside the cinema, tell him: ""Turn back, Turn back!"""

You are hooked in the first 5 - 10 minutes, as it features an amazingly tense chase. Although its a bit different to the first, I still had a blast in the cinema. I saw this last night and I was amazed at what I saw. The special effects are great, the acting is really good (especially Robert Carlyle), emotional at times, has lots and LOTS of blood and infected and explosions (the streets of London get napalmed!)and there are more deserted shots of London.<br/><br/>I cant really say about the story because it would give away some little scares and plot twists. But the opening scene is one of the best openings to a movie I think (the chase). The ending is really nicely done as well, and without spoiling anything it involves France, Paris.<br/><br/>Overall it has a different feel to the first film, but maybe thats what makes it great as a sequel.

","Ah man, I remember when 28 Days Later came out...I wasn't old enough to see it, but I saw some clips of the opening sequence and I loved the abandoned London feel.<br/><br/>Needless to say, when I saw it it was...and still is...an incredibly good film. <br/><br/>So I came to check out 28 weeks later.<br/><br/>Basically the 'rage' virus has apparently died out and so people start to live in London again, which seems to have been taken over by the Americans.<br/><br/>Two kids are reunited with their father (Robert Carlyle) and all is happy in the rebuilt world for a day or so.<br/><br/>The kids proceed to sneak out and go to their old house, and in the panic that ensues, the zombie plague rises again. But there's something special about these two kids...and everyone around them is very keen to keep them alive.<br/><br/>First of all I loved the scenery in this - the landscape shots are brilliant, and it has this dark - quintessentially British - feel to it, the kind of channel 4 movie feel. Which works well and ramps up the creeping feel of dread at times.<br/><br/>It also has a lot of frantic shots - e.g scenes in very claustrophobic areas that are cut very quickly to build tension. A lot of the time this works, but as a viewer I like to know what's going on and this style of film-making took that away from me at times.<br/><br/>Was good to see Imogen Pootz in this, her career has since gone up and up - Carlyle is good value too, although doesn't get much screen time.<br/><br/>The opening quarter of the film is good, but sadly it fell apart from there - I didn't feel that involved in the two main children characters, and wasn't really rooting for them and I found the ending really disappointing. As I saw the final few shots I had to roll my eyes.<br/><br/>Call me cynical but if you liked the first one, don't bother. The zombies are the same - and yes, they are scary - violent, mindless fountains of speed and rage that you feel hopeless against - but other than that you're better off visiting the original again or going to see some classic Romero flicks."

Though there is no depth in their characters and their talents appear to be wasted. But they can do little to improve the film, as there are there are no surprises in this and its plot and ending are very predictable.

","So let me get this straight: Six months after the rage virus was inflicted on the population of Great Britain, the US Army helps to secure a small area of London for the survivors to repopulate and start again. But not everything goes to plan. Okay, got it. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the two main characters. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. A true gem. A gritty, hard movie about gritty, hard people, but it's also intelligent. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect."
"Uriah43","7","2","3","19 December 2012"," An Excellent Zombie Film
","Although a sequel to ""28 Days Later"", this film is as good as the original and can stand on its own merits. And that says a lot. Now I fully understand that technically this isn't a zombie movie. The dead aren't brought back to life and they don't feast on the organs of their victims. At least not that I am aware of. Likewise there are some controversial aspects which some zombie films depict while others do not. For example, the speed of the ""zombies"" are incredibly fast. And it definitely adds some good action to this film. Now, while some people might argue over technicalities of this nature, to me the zombie genre shouldn't be exclusive to new ideas or formats. After all, one of the chief complaints about zombie films is that everything has already been done and that there is no variety. So in that regard I consider this to be not only an excellent film but an excellent zombie film as well. It has good acting, well-developed characters, tremendous action and a very good plot. About the only flaw I saw was during the poison gas episode in which everyone in the car should have been killed. Everyone. That's just the nature of poison gas. But it made for a good action sequence so I won't complain too much. Also, the ending could have been drawn out a bit more. Even so, I thought this was a good zombie movie and I believe most zombie fans will probably agree."

People are returning to London, for its been secured from the virus, and is ready to return to its original life, although still under surveillance of the U.S. Army.<br/><br/>There's a deeper plot where a woman turns out to be a carrier of the Rage virus, and comes in contact with one other person, which spreads more and more until mostly everyone is infected. This leads the U.S. Army to have no choice but to kill off anybody they see, even civilians that aren't infected, for a precaution to make sure the virus doesn't spread again.<br/><br/>Thats one thing I thought was incredibly stupid. The army becomes the main enemy, not the virus, which makes it nowhere near as creepy or thrilling. Its a lot more gory, and has a lot more shaky camera, but it doesn't make it that scary, no matter what.<br/><br/>I did like the characters though, but when it comes to surviving from the virus and army, not much character development is available, though I did like Jeremy Renner's character.

","Danny Boyle's 28 Day Later came as an adrenaline rush to a flagging zombie corpse. Although technically and well argued not to be zombies the rage fuelled ""infected"" were as good as that.<br/><br/>Due to the success of that film it was no surprise it was given a sequel. Boyle, unable to direct due to filming Sunshine, passed the directing duties to Juan Carlos Fresnadillo who does well in capturing London in similar lights that his predecessor managed.<br/><br/>The film itself is perhaps best summed up as a selection of interesting scenes spread out over a conventional and in some ways unsurprising narrative.<br/><br/>The opening scene serves to remind you of the brutality of the choices people have to make in order to survive a UK of infected. It also is a precursor for a later key scene when the US military, in control of a safe zone weeks after the events of the first scene, lose control and flee for their own survival.<br/><br/>A US sniper then becomes the hero that the father was unable to be.<br/><br/>The obvious subtext of United States intervention and subsequent loss of control is not subtle but does add some depth to an otherwise straight forward movie, which becomes little more than a chase sequence in its second half.<br/><br/>Perhaps credit must go to the new director for creating a film that in terms of excitement does in many ways surpass the original if only losing out to it in terms of originality."

","I bought this on DVD a few weeks after its release onto DVD and was generally let down. It wasn't a bad film, and it did have its ups and downs like any film. The good deserves 5 stars, and the extra is due to the fact that Catherine McCormack is my God-Father's (Steve) sister. <br/><br/>Good: I was generally engrossed in it at points, namely the Apache chase (however short) the Sniper sequence (also short) and finally the ending (once again short, but understandably as it left us waiting for the next in the series). The majority of the camera-work was good, albeit rather too wobbly at times, but it did give a good feeling of being a member of the survivors after the 'Code Red' break down. The Characters were mostly well played - Doyle especially, but Harold Perrineau (the Helicopter pilot) also. Tammy and Andy were average, but in their defence, their roles are tough ones and they do try and create a link between them and the audience. The CGI is really rather good during the film - namely the firebombing and the rather ""butcher"" like scene with the helicopter rotors and the wave of infected - and it does show well. General Stone (Idris Elba) plays his role well, and he does a good job of effectively becoming the ""overseer"" of this little island refuge. His decision to order the soldiers to shoot everyone ""targets free"" and then his order to firebomb the area make us hate him, but at the same time, we can see why he'd do it. <br/><br/>However, that last statement links into the bad points - surely you would just order all the people to perform a task - I doubt the Infected can follow orders >.< Other bad points - The camera, although, as I said at some points its good, at certain times its just annoying. The shakiness gives you a headache and the constant moving doesn't allow us to focus on one character for any lengthy piece of time. Other then that, its has so many plot holes that it makes you think at points during that you could have performed a better story line and thus think of that instead of the actual film. E.G How the hell can one Infected defy not only a battalion strength army, avoid three dozen snipers, avoid being incinerated, gassed then avoid death at the hands of a reasonably well trained soldier (Scarlet) and then only to die at the hands of Tammy... I mean... What... However, if you can get past the grudging fact that he is a vital character it becomes an annoying but acceptable thorn in the side. <br/><br/>To summarise - Although annoying at times, it does have a generally good feel most of the way through. Worth a watch a least.<br/><br/>The ""Awwhh hell!"" you feel when seeing the Eiffel Tower and the Infected makes you want to see the next one, and the characters are generally pretty good. Like I said - Worth a watch at 6/10 :)"
"TomWarway","7","2","3","9 January 2009"," Decrescendo
","The first fifteen minutes of 28 Weeks Later are probably the best fifteen minutes in the history of cinema. The Russian Roulette scene in The Deer Hunter? Forget it. The final assassinations in The Godfather? Not a chance. Characterization is almost instantaneous. You immediately know who Don is, what he's like, and what situation he's in. You know his wife, Alice, is actually the rock in the relationship, and that her and Don are very close. You realise that the girl's starting to lose it, and that the young Asian guy is a bit selfish and egocentric. You can feel the calmness which emanates from the old couple -- they've been through a World War, huge unemployment, numerous terrorist attacks; they can make it through this, no problem. And then all their worlds explode; I won't go into details, but those of you who have watched it will know what I'm talking about. And then, about twenty minutes into the film, the jumbo jet of brilliance encounters technical difficulties, and nosedives. The story focuses on two obnoxious middle class kids, portrayed by two obnoxious lower class actors, Don dies and everyone legs it, screaming. The joke is, they're really running from the US soldiers. Yeah, sure, great parallels with Iraq, but who gives a crap about allegories? This is a post-apocalyptic zombie film. You don't even see any infected (apart from Don) in the latter half of the film. Out of the original group of seven, four are killed by soldiers, and two survive. That means only one is killed by infected -- what's all that about? Fortunately, the final '28 days later sequence' rescues the film from mediocrity, and, when combined with the incredible opening section, the film achieves 7/10."
"MaxBorg89","9","2","3","23 October 2008"," Frenetic, tragic and terrifying: a near-perfect horror sequel
","Horror sequels are almost by definition a cheap excuse to cash in on the originals. There are exceptions, like Wes Craven's meta-horror New Nightmare or George Romero's zombie saga, but they're a rarity. Thankfully, 28 Weeks Later, the follow-up few people expected to be made, retains its predecessor's sense of fear and desperation while adding its own dramatic elements, resulting in a film that fares a lot better next to other horror continuations of 2007 such as Hostel: Part II or Saw IV.<br/><br/>Stepping back as a director (he was busy doing Sunshine) but remaining on board as an executive producer with original writer Alex Garland, Danny Boyle found it wise to hand over 28 Weeks Later to Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, whose feature debut Intacto was deemed good enough to trust him to do his own thing and not just another sequel. And that's exactly what he does: whereas 28 Days Later was merely about survival (with a hint of Romero-like satire of the military's excessive power), the new installment has a stronger central theme - family. In fact, the scarily intense prologue (the film's best scene, and one of the most effective opening sequences of all time), set within the time frame of the first movie, shows how the Infected, still as merciless as ever, rip apart entire families, leaving Don (Robert Carlyle), one of the few survivors, desperate over the loss of his wife Alice.<br/><br/>28 weeks (seven moths) pass, and with the help of the US Army the Rgae virus has been completely wiped out. Britain is no longer quarantined, so Don can be reunited with his children. While they explore their new home, an American scientist (Rose Byrne) tries to determine whether there's any chance the virus might return, a possibility her military superior (Idris Elba) writes off as unlikely. Then all of a sudden Alice, seemingly immune to the disease, returns to everyone's surprise. An even worse surprise, though, is the fact that her not being infected doesn't mean she can't infect someone else. And so, before anyone can fully realize what's happened, London is once again under attack by the Infected, leaving it to Scarlet (Byrne) and a soldier named Doyle (Jeremy Renner) to save Alice and Don's children, who may have inherited their mother's resistance to the Rage virus.<br/><br/>The film is shot almost entirely with hand-held cameras, a stylistic choice that adds to the gritty realism Fresnadillo is seeking (this emerges most clearly in the aforementioned prologue). It's not really that different from what Boyle achieved in 28 Days Later, with the notable exception of the sequel being much more fast-paced, taking full advantage of the fact that the Infected, unlike your average zombie, are quite skilled runners. That, paired with a murky cinematography and most of the movie taking place in dark, closed spaces, instills a relentless sense of dread, meaning 28 Weeks Later manages to do what few others have done before: it's every bit as scary as the original.<br/><br/>Cast-wise, Fresnadillo has made choices as smart as those of his predecessor: Carlyle, a familiar face in Boyle's body of work, may not be as good-looking as Cillian Murphy, but what he lacks in physical appearance he makes up for in dramatic talent, giving a heartfelt portrayal that is miles away for his more famous roles (Begbie in Trainspotting above all). Byrne (who, coincidentally, also appears in Sunshine), after a few less fortunate career choices (minor roles in average stuff like Troy or Attack of the Clones), does a c ompetent job, as does Renner, with additional gravitas coming from US TV veterans Elba (The Wire) and Harold Perrineau (Oz and Lost).<br/><br/>Overall, in a genre that is usually doomed by crappy follow-ups, 28 Weeks Later stands out as one of the better exceptions to that rule. It's artful, it's moving, and most of all, it never lets go of the fear factor."

","Now this film could have been a complete washout, a quick low-budget cash-in. Luckily it wasn't.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later is a sequel to the successful zombie 28 Days Later. As the title suggests, the film takes place 28 weeks after the original out-break of the Rage virus in Britain. The film starts with Don (Robert Carlyle) with his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack), and a group of other survivors in a blackout out house just trying to survive. A young boy comes and begs to be let in and after that the infected start to attack the house. This is when Don leaves without his wife and suffers from surviver's guilt. The film then jumps into the future and the American military are in London helping with the reconstruction of Britain, and start to repopulate Britain from the Isle of Dogs (not a good place to start in my opinion). Within the returning civilians are Don's teenage daughter and 12-year-old son. After hearing his story they break out of the green zone and head towards where there old home was. It is there when they find their mum, who is a alive and not infected. Sciencfic studies showed that she had the virus but was immune to its affects. It was then when the virus is re-introduced to the capital.<br/><br/>This film could have been a poisoned chalice to anyone who took it on. However, I felt that the director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, did a very good job. He has a good reputation in Spain as a horror director when he did Intacto and this was his second major film. He has good potential in the Spanish and English speaking world. 28 Weeks Later is a bit more actioned packed then 28 Days Later, but I don't think thats a bad thing. It is a very good on a horror level as well, being subtle, and gory. There are a lot of good scenes in this film and shows that the British Industry can challenge Hollywood. The horror genre can be subject to bad effects and bad acting, but this film doesn't do that. There are some good actors which experienced backwards: no Z-listers or people just starting out, except for the child actors. There is also a political sub-context in this film, namely about the Iraq war and American foreign policy. There are things such the mission accomplished when the war is still is going on, the use of terms like Green-zone and reconstruction and some troops itching for action. The film is critical of American policy and some of the senior military leadership, but it also shows that some American characters in a positive light.<br/><br/>28 Days Later isn't as good as 28 Weeks Later, but it is still a worthy film and a good addiction to the horror genre. There is also plenty of room for a second sequel."

","'28 Weeks Later' is a well-executed horror flick. The opening sequence is a pulse-rating beginning, it is just very unfortunate that it proceeded with brawn (blood, and scary people) rather than brain to its eventual conclusion.<br/><br/>The problem for me is the fact that an individual although infected with the virus has the genetic mutation to thus be immune - this is rather far fetched. If I were to accept that a mutation would be possible I'm afraid '28 Weeks Later' would still disappoint. It is is further compounded by many frustrating and annoying events which take place, far beyond the boundaries of the realms of practicality, that makes this a fast and furious horror flick bereft of intellect.<br/><br/>Some of the shots, special effects must be applauded along with strong performances from Rose Byrne and Imogen Poots. There are a couple of unexpected twists but '28 Weeks Later' for me is a bitter sweet experience, which is much more bitter for its illogical events."
"Robert_duder","8","2","3","22 January 2008"," Hollywood nabs an indie horror that made the big bucks...and that's not a bad thing
","The original film came out of nowhere and became even more than a cult classic. Danny Boyle's original 28 Days Later redefined an ailing 'Zombie Horror' genre and put this intense, story driven spin to it and it worked and it was fantastic. It only made sense that they would hard to find a way to serialize the successful film and I think they did a great job but in all fairness they threw tons of money at it and made it a completely different type of film while still keeping the core idea in tact. I think it's terrifically ironic that the film is focused on the US Military coming in and taking over Great Britain following the Outbreak much like Hollywood took over Danny Boyle's small little indie film. Still the story is decently well written although toned down significantly and I would not call this sequel story driven as much as it is horror and action and somehow it doesn't surprise that the majority of people seem to think 28 Days Later was a superior and better film than the original and I would tend to agree with them. I suppose the thing is 28 Weeks Later is just fast paced, adrenaline charged and more entertaining as far as Horror/Action films are concerned. There are no returning characters from the first installment which always disappoints me but the returning characters is the infected beings that come around for another attack.<br/><br/>Strangely the lead male in the film is kind of split between two...one in the first half, and one in the second half of the film. Robert Carlyle takes on the role of devoted father who is living with the guilt of having left his wife (his kids' mother) behind in an abandoned farm house where they were hiding during the infection. Carlyle is very good and has some strong moments of emotion in the film. Then he gets to take a completely different turn as one of the infected, crazed zombies and gets the prestige of really being the first member of the infected that we, as movie goers, follow. He doesn't just get mowed down right away like the rest of them. Imogen Poots and newcomer Mackintosh Muggleton are the focus of the film as Carlyle's children who return to Great Britain after being overseas during the outbreak. They both do a great job together and are essentially the focus of the entire film. They carry the weight of the movie on their shoulders and do it without hesitation. Amanda Walker does a decent job as the American Doctor who discovers that the kids may have an immunity to the infection and does everything she can to protect them. She is good as kind of a supporting main character but they don't utilize her much. Jeremy Renner is also kind of the back seat star as the reluctant hero who finds himself determined to help these kids and the doctor escape before the military obliterates the infected area. He just isn't used as much as one would expect for a hero.<br/><br/>Very much unlike the original film this is far less of a character study and more about the actual infection and following one of the infected more closely and the fast re-spread over the area. What the means is you get more special effects, buckets more blood and gore but only a portion of the story. Technically in this case it does make it more of a mainstream horror and maybe more interesting for horror fans which is why some consider this superior. I think director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is a little green to be taking on a project like this and doesn't have quite the vision that perhaps Danny Boyle had behind the camera but nonetheless from a Horror Genre perspective it was very well done and very entertaining and you do still care about the characters. I don't oppose serializing this franchise, I just wish they brought back someone from the original film and maybe they will in the future. I think it could be a very lucrative franchise if Danny Boyle takes back the helm. 8/10"
"Spaceygirl","7","2","3","21 January 2008"," A decent sequel
","28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the Danny Boyle art-house horror cult smash, is decent enough. The first film was, in my opinion, an overlooked classic; it was raw, realistic with a great performance from the yummy Cillian Murphy.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later, starts 28 weeks after the end of the first story, with London having been obliterated by the Zombie infection. Repopulation is underway and two children are brought back to the city to meet their father, played admirably well by Boyle stalwart, Robert Carlyle.<br/><br/>Where the movie scores is the cast and the acting, Robert Carlyle is extremely effective in the male lead and Rose Byrne brings up the female lead, ably supported by the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The script is equally good, being more cerebral than the usual ""skop,skiet en donder"" than we're used to. The score, as in the first, is fantastic, John Murphy doing a wonderful job of evoking fear and tension There are some truly thrilling moments in the film, some of the highlights being the napalm detonations, and night vision sequence in the subway, the night vision sequence is easily one of the most terrifying moments on film. All in all, ""28 Weeks Later"" is an excellent follow-up. Bring on ""28 Month's later""!"

","I watched the two ""28s"", original and sequel, back to back in one go. I enjoyed them both, but I realized something I hadn't quite figured out when I first watched this movie in cinema theaters: this second one doesn't scare me half as much as the original. There was something unique in the first movie that made it so incredibly compelling even when nothing was happening and zombies were at rest. Here, except for the incredibly well shot beginning sequence, there's an overload of violence that is predominantly graphic but not quite able to hit you viscerally as the first one did. Even Robert Carlyle, usually an excellent actor, is unconvincing where Cillian Murphy was so effective in his portrait of the survivor. Too many special effects, too many unresolved characters on the side we are never quite sure whether we should get attached to or not, like the soldier. In the original, even characters who got terminated halfway like Brendan Gleeson's Frank became full functional to the story and its emotional angles. Overall, it would have been more interesting to follow up on Jim's predicament in the first one than tell the tale of a rather unbelievable repopulating program at such short distance from the outbreak. could have been a contender..."

","I've never been a big fan of the zombie and horror movies, but this one really takes the cake. Danny Boyle did an incredible job with his depiction of an abandoned London, fear stricken and virus plagued.<br/><br/>This picture goes miles further than Danny Boyle's original 28 Days Later, a rare feat for a sequel. The director, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did a wonderful job with the tone and consistency of the piece. <br/><br/>The sense of empty space is palpable and pervades the film. It was incredible to behold what Fresnadillo did with London, how he shaped and changed it. I know that he isn't a native Londoner, but living here myself I got the feeling that he knew the city well enough to understand how it might decay, and what the dynamics of its abandonment would look like. <br/><br/>The father played by Robert Carlyle starts as an incredibly flawed character and something about his mix of heart and error makes you understand and invest in him from the beginning. <br/><br/>The zombies are perhaps even more frightening here because unlike the original film, the atmosphere isn't a zombie plagued one but instead a city in renewal, which makes the outbursts of violence and gore that much more shocking and contrary to the general rebuilding that many of the characters are focused on. <br/><br/>It's amazing to watch a great genre heavy film that has the tension and depth of an art-house piece."
"temkauk-1","6","2","3","11 October 2007"," The meanings
","The main interesting aspects of the film are social, sociological and psychological. It creates (with a good degree of realism) situation where the whole of British society is divided and how it might behave in such a situation. A set of moral and ethical issues is being raised where the army is dealing with contaminated groups of people. The way in which the film raises those issues is very interesting and differs from other movie. (althoutgth some similarity in that respect can be drawn with the film ""Independance Day"").<br/><br/>Psychologically the film also manages to expose dilemmas and ethical survival choices and decisions. It shows that as other animals, humans act on self preservation instincts, but unlike animals humans are also capable of self-sacrifice; heroism for a greater good.<br/><br/>Visually the film is valuable as it acted out and staged directly in the environment that we live in and use every day, In fact - London is the main hero of the film. (especially in 28 Days Later) There are many shots of London as we do not normally see it - Panoramic shots, but also details that we all recognise such as tube signs and buses, that majorly helps to recreate the atmosphere of a mysterious catastrophe. As each londoner inevitably ""tries on"" the outlook of the film characters and their impression on seeing our habitat like that."

Apart from the obvious ""let's shake the camera to create some tension/horror"", which made me more often nauseous than really scared, quite frankly, the real let downs in this movie are the plot holes and the portrayal of the military. Now I'm not a military guy myself, but to portray them in a manner, that not only makes them look stupid -> SPOILERS: they let the kids get out of the military zone just like that ... oh and how convenient, that they find them exactly at the time when they themselves have found their mother!

Seriously, this does spoiler a lot of the fun, one can have with the movie ... or could have had, in that case. As for example the introduction in the movie. The guilt ridden father is a great theme, that runs throughout the movie. And the whole beginning is shot in a really great way. But as I said, it doesn't hold up to that unfortunately.<br/><br/>And yes the ending is quite clear ... although still some people try to make sense of it. It doesn't matter (SPOILER again, watch out, don't read if you haven't watched the movie, I'm going to talk about the ending), how the pilot got infected or how the helicopter crashed ... it's just a scheme to set-up a possible ""28 months later"" (or whatever it will be called)!

"mkm-hermanjnr","4","1","1","4 November 2019"," Idiot Character Syndrome severely dampens an otherwise good horror film
","My previous review for 28 Days Later, I gave the film 7/10, commenting that an extremely good first act is damaged by some increasingly wonky scriptwriting as the story goes on.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, 28 Weeks Later takes all the good things from the first film (the atmosphere, the setting, the Rage Virus) but also all the bad things (characters acting stupidly, an incredibly incompetent military, plot contrivances).<br/><br/>And then the movie amplifies both. The result is a visceral and occasionally effective horror film that also suffers from the same severe brain degeneration that the Infected seem to have.<br/><br/>Like it's predecessor, 28 Weeks opens with a *thumping* first act that is really great. We have people in the countryside sheltering themselves from the Infected onslaught, trying to keep a low profile and living a pretty bleak existence with a brave face. I could have watched another 30 minutes of this.<br/><br/>Then the Infected break in and Don (played really effectively by Robert Carlyle, a highlight of the movie) and his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) are thrown into a chaotic scramble for survival.<br/><br/>The imagery of Don running for his life in broad daylight, terror etched on his face as a swarm of contagious maniacs run after him, all surrounded by rolling green British hills...it's pretty breathtaking. I love this part of the film. It's genuinely disturbing and really unique at the same time.<br/><br/>This actually brings me onto the first thing I find irritating about the film; the ""semi-villainous"" characterisation of Don.<br/><br/>Don is a likeable family man for the most part and I empathised with him. The weird thing is, after he runs away in the opening, the movie heavily tries to insinuate that he's a dirty coward who was wrong for running away without his wife. I found this really weird.<br/><br/>It's already been established that fighting infected people hand to hand is practically suicidal (one drop of blood in your eye or mouth turns you into one, after all).<br/><br/>Don was completely outnumbered at the house and his wife was trapped in a room past a bunch of Infected, so realistically his only choice was run away or die a pointless agonising death. We even see him bravely fighting off the Infected with a crowbar before he drops it, so it's not like he wasn't trying his best to save everyone in the first place.<br/><br/>Yet the movie tries to sell that he's a selfish coward because he didn't want to get pointlessly mauled to death, which would have resulted in his wife dying afterwards anyway. Bit unfair?<br/><br/>Anyway, the biggest strength of the film from this point on is the ""28 Days"" formula, while the biggest weakness is the characterisation of the US Military and the bizarre choices the characters make. The sheer silliness of some of the plot contrivances leading to ""now there are zombies everywhere, lol"" really turned me off the film.<br/><br/>Unlike how the first film unrealistically depicted 90% of the Brit military as deranged psychopaths after a couple of weeks of social collapse, 28 Weeks unrealistically depicts 90% of the US military as completely incompetent cretins.<br/><br/>Some of the things the US army does in this film include:<br/><br/><ul><li>Locking an extremely dangerous Rage-infected carrier in a completely unguarded room, with keycard access to this room given to some random civilian guy who fixes boilers and stuff.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Insisting on killing this carrier even though she could permanently cure Rage if properly experimented on (though they're so inept they don't even manage to kill the person anyway).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Having a policy whereby if there is an outbreak of Rage again, they will forcibly herd all thousands of civilians into a tiny, cramped basement with many unsecured entrances and extremely poor lighting. Wow.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Having a policy whereby if a Rage outbreak goes full-blown (which it absolutely will due to said stupid basement plan), the soldiers are ordered to shoot absolutely everything, including each other. Even if it's blatantly obvious people aren't infected, or obvious that shooting them will cause the situation to clearly worsen even further.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The military also completely fails to actually contain the area they are re-settling in the first place with proper fencing or anything like that, allowing the virus to get to Europe and possibly the whole world. Again, wow.</li></ul><br/><br/>Finally, the characters are also subject to this brain-rot. Perhaps the most obvious example is Doyle.<br/><br/>He pointlessly sacrifices himself to some guys with short-range mini flamethrowers while pushing a car. He literally has an assault rifle on his back and knew they were there! Why on Earth did he not simply shoot them before pushing the car?<br/><br/>I'll stop there. I think the point's been made. If you want another helping of the good bits of 28 Days Later, this film can deliver, with a good performance by Carlyle to boot. It's just unfortunate that the film ups the bad stuff from the prequel to 11 as well."

","Trust no one who likes this movie. It is utter crap.<br/><br/>After a quick adrenaline rush at the film's intro it's another forty minute slog before you get any further decent action. I could hardly believe they reused an exact same fatality from the original film because apparently it was just that good? Plus they very conveniently skip ahead in time when there would have been no feasible way for the virus to spread otherwise. Then to top everything off we have one of the most annoying movie tropes ever, the dreaded children are the future. Yes, we have to put all of humanity at risk because, that's right, there are minors involved. God I hate kids as heroes.<br/><br/>The top absurdity had to be chopping up a pack of zombies, mid-flight, with a helicopter's rotor blades. And if that doesn't ruin the film for you there's the fact that zombie dad somehow survives firebombing and chemical attacks to find his kids and try to eat them one last time.<br/><br/>Best of all I think we can look forward to zombies in Paris. Hurrah!"

Brilliant medicine that Mum was a carrier of the Rage virus yet immune to its symptoms because of a genetic abnormality causing one green eye and one brown which she shared with Andy. Looked like Dad and Tammy weren't so lucky. The ferocity of the virus was definitely dialed up a notch. And despite the US Army's over the top attempt to eradicate the virus it was a dismal failure. The ending just showed the futility of it all....one of the best genre horror movies ever. Another one for the collection. Almost the perfect scary movie."

","I saw this years ago on telly, much to my mum's chagrin. This movie both captivated and frightened me! The story is so well developed, containing believable, understandable characters, while never shying away or neglecting to delve into scary zombie action!
I've heard people complain about not being able to get behind certain zombie films, especially if they're low budget, but this is no Kia, no; this is the zombie genre equivalent of a classy Land Rover.
This story takes it back to the greats of such horror, how Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, George A. Romero, Richard Matheson and Hammer intended it."

","'28 Weeks Later (2007)' expands on the first film in a surprisingly natural way, even if it answers a nicely ambiguous question which that superior picture purposely left hanging. It's a relatively consistent-feeling affair, even if it never captures the isolation or relentless fury of its predecessor. It does get a bit 'been there, done that' when the plot kicks in simply because of where it starts and where it ends up, though it does take a number of risks and isn't afraid to be pretty grisly, either. It's also a fairly distinct experience in its own right, one that's fairly enjoyable throughout. 6/10"
"mephotography2001","7","1","1","27 November 2013"," Entertaining Film - More Action than Horror
","This was a little more my style (than ""28 Days Later"") of not-zombie-cuz-zombies-don't-run movie in the way of pacing and sheer volume of not-zombies. Much more of an action film than a straight-out horror film picking up where the first movie left off +24 weeks. I was surprised when neither ""hero"" survived to the end but there's nothing wrong with surprises when they work. I did find the infected father hunting his children kind of hokey, considering the mindless savages the not-zombies appear to be in every other instance, but it didn't detract terribly from the overall story. I liked it, and surprisingly for a sequel, I found it to be better than the first."
"gigan-92","10","1","1","23 May 2012"," Not Bad at All
","For some time, I feared this movie would be a gun-ho, balls for brains horror sequel. The realm of horror sequels is populated by the great and terrible alike. Take 1978's ""Dawn of the Dead"" as opposed to ""Poltergeist II"". Both of these are sequels to great classics, but they couldn't be farther apart in terms of quality. I'm glad to say that this movie is no ""Poltergeist II"". First big help, a really strong cast starring the likes of Jeremy Renner and Rose Byrne. Other cast members, including Robert Carlyle, Harold Perrineau, Catherine McCormack, Imogen Poots (I have a thing for her, can't help it) and Mackintosh Muggleton, do quite well at creating some interesting characters.<br/><br/>The pacing in this film is different than the last film's, with less focus on the growth of the characters and more so on a race against time. To that end I'll say it's disappointedly not as nihilistic feeling as the first film, but it still maintains an atmosphere of dreaded realism. And I have to say this; this film sports one of the best horror opening s ever. Heart-pumping, well-choreographed, and a bad-ass way to start a movie. The score isn't as marvelous, but it has some marvelous usage of John Murphy's themes created for the first film. All in all, I highly recommend this sequel. Only thing that troubles me is the ending; did they make it or did they not? Guess that's part of the charm."
"anthony-wilson-326-887879","8","1","1","27 March 2012"," Very Impressed
","When I first heard about a sequel to 28 Days Later, my first thought was ""Oh boy. Here comes a mess"". Then I heard that Robert Carlyle was in it and he is usually pretty picky when it comes to scripts. So I thought it had a chance. The previews looked pretty good, so I figured I'd take a chance. If you get the chance to see 28 Weeks Later, see it. As far as sequels go, it's surprisingly good. Carlisle is quite good as always, but I was surprised at the quality of acting from those around him. The kids in this movie are great, especially Imogen Poots who eats up the camera. While the attack sequences felt a little choppy, the script, the cinematography, and the story more than made up for it. The possibility for a sequel is there, and if treated like this one was, would be worth a watch as well. But a tip of the cap to everyone involved with this one. Nicely done. You impressed a sceptic."

"KineticSeoul","8","1","1","24 February 2012"," A solid zombie sequel
","I really liked the theme song to the first one and actually enjoyed it constantly being played throughout this whole movie. Anyways this is a solid sequel to the first one. If you thought the first one lacked zombie action well you will get plenty of that in this one. The feeling of being alone and helpless isn't shown all that much in this one since there is more survivors and the people with guns are the good guys. But it sure is a entertaining zombie movie throughout. Although the intro to this movie is memorable and well done, what got a bit irritating is how the zombie chaos happens again. And this is after the start of the reconstruction of Britain after the first movie. When I first saw this movie in theater I just wanted to scream ""so are you happy now!"". Not just that the way the virus spreads is irritating and absurd. But your just going to have to go with it or it will irritate you throughout the whole movie. Especially since almost the first hour of this movie shows how the virus starts up again. I saw Jeremy Renner for the first time and liked the guy as an actor right of the bat when I saw this in theater. He plays a likable, courageous and charismatic soldier in this. Robert Carlyle and Idris Elba is good in this as well...Well the amount they are in it. The grainy and grimy camera-work returns and this time more shaky than ever. Which I would complain sometimes but it really works in this movie. Although I got noxious a few times and dizzy while watching this in theater. There is humanity in this but it also has believable emotions going for it as well. Sure there are some plot holes and stuff just obviously doesn't make any sense compared to the first movie. Sure the script could have been polished up a bit but overall as a whole it's forgivable and it's a very watchable and entertaining zombie flick that shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>8/10"
"the_og1","7","1","1","27 January 2012"," Good horror film
","The 2003 State-side release of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" was advertised as being a shockful scare-fest of a movie. I didn't get around to seeing it until a few days ago and I gotta feel like that was somewhat of an embellishment on the promoters' part.<br/><br/>When environmental terrorists attack a lab that contains diseased chimps who are infected with a ""Rage"" virus, they unwittingly let loose a plague that lays waste to England and(perhaps)the rest of society. The 28 Days later of the title cuts to a mostly abandoned London where a coma-tized bicycle courier named Jim(Cillian Murphy,effective) wakes from his stasis to find himself alone in a hospital. As he searches London for signs of life,he is rescued from raging zombies by a couple of survivalists(one of them,the lovely Naomie Harris)who he follows from place to place to keep alive. From there,he also meets a man and his daughter(Brendan Gleeson,terrific,and Megan Burns,good)and they try to find a refuge out of London-town. A recorded message of a ""paradise"" where ""salvation"" can be found is tracked by Frank(the man) on his shortwave radio.<br/><br/>This sequel feels more like a meditation on what happens to people when they are reduced to their lowest elements. A friend of mine told me that this movie's running zombies was what inspired the zombies in the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"",but where ""Dawn of..."" was pretty much a full-throttle action/horror hybrid from about start to finish,this film plays more like a ""What if..."" movie,with less emphasis on the creatures themselves and more on the (lucky?) survivors. There are also disturbing lessons on the nature OF survival,too.<br/><br/>An very interesting and disturbing flick that probably sold itself wrong."

This is more of a Hollywood type of movie; almost like a realist version of Resident Evil. And that is what i like most about this movie, I like that this movie is believable. I also repeat that this is a different movie. They didn't make the mistake of remaking the first movie or retelling it or getting lazy are re-re- redoing something.

","Like many before me, I've seen and enjoyed 28 Days Later. So i was quite thrilled to see this sequel, 28 Weeks Later. The first 5 minutes I thought we would get to see the same great and realistic kind of movie and 28 days. After those 5 minutes, things start to go down-hill... fast.<br/><br/>To begin with, the biggest disappointment for me was the fact that the story is so flat and predictable, it becomes annoying. Compared to 28 Days, which featured a realistic look on a dytopian state of panic, with people making real decisions, this film features illogical decisions and infected who somehow get a personality. The latter only works in zomcom's and not in this type of reality-horror film.<br/><br/>But even if you somehow manage to look past these points, the plot comes and kicks you when you're down. It is a chain-reaction of illogical and implausible actions, random stunts and the film has absolutely no direction where it wants to go.<br/><br/>Its really hard to review this film without giving away spoilers, because I really, REALLY, want to describe some of the ridiculous events that happen.<br/><br/>Summary: No plot, illogical and stupid actions by the main characters, its basically 1,5 hour of very weird Parkinson's-like shots of blood and limbs, held together by people doing random things that don't make sense."
"thesar-2","7","1","1","2 November 2009"," What Happens in London
","With another interesting concept for an ""infected person"" movie (over the typical ""zombie"" film) they certainly stuck with the usual platform for a sequel: 2x the gore, 2x the madness. '28 Weeks Later' takes an already wonderful movie and actually continues with originality: what happens next? How does society survive an outbreak? Well, if we were a smart race, we could certainly overcome this ""rage"" virus that spread roughly 7 months prior. And after a very scary introduction to those unfamiliar with the original '28 Days Later,' the movie continues with a ""good solution"" to rebuild humanity. Of course, the movie then dives into stupid people doing stupid stuff and the virus, supposedly eliminated by the infected starving to death (loved that over just having to shoot zombies in the head), actually resurfaces. This causes man to do even more stupid stuff to stop it once again. Watching it on a grand scale/Bird's Eye POV, it's hard to even imagine trying to contain such a brutal fast-spreading virus, especially with hordes of victims at its disposal. Though I really liked this movie, at times, it was hard to watch, due to the excessive gore (I take back what I previous said about it being 2x gorier – this was probably 10x more gorier than the now subdued '28 Days Later') and the one thing that irked me in the last third. Not to spoil it, but a certain ""infected"" person always seems to pop up always at the most opportune times, just when the script needs this person to, always finding the victims he/she wants when they are supposedly just running on instinct. Despite the gore (#1 didn't need that for a good story) and the Super-Infected-Phantom, it's a very good follow-up and I look forward to any more to follow."
"muditmonfils","6","1","1","30 August 2009"," Good horror flick, could've been a lot better !
","When I saw the first part of this movie, 28 Days Later, I never thought that the director would win an Oscar for a non-horror movie. For me he was a revolutionary horror movie director. But lo! He did won an Oscar and that too this year itself! And who would that guy be? Danny Boyle. Yes I am right. I had never thought Danny Boyle director of 28 Days Later could ever make a film like Slumdog Millionaire ever in the future. With 28 Days Later he had reinvented the art of scaring the audience. This whole series contains blood thirsty and surreal zombies spreading unrealistic terror and blood throughout Britain. This is not like any other run of the mill horror movie. It has a really interesting story line and a not-so-crazy screenplay unlike every other horror movie which are just made to scare your ass off without any story line, acting etc! 28 Weeks Later continues from where 28 Days Later had left, except for the fact that it has some more gore and intensity.<br/><br/>After the rage virus destroys the whole of mainland Britain, a US led troops take control of Britain. It begins reconstructing everything and try to make the things normal again. All the things are going as planned. The infected people have died of starvation. But still something goes wrong and the whole situation blows out of control. Left with no other ideas, the commander orders the execution of ""code-red"" which literary means killing every civilian in order to prevent the spreading of the virus at a larger scale. But how did the chaos begin? What happens next? Go, find out yourself!<br/><br/>If after watching the movie you were thinking why the hell didn't the virus wreak havoc in other parts of the world here's my take: Britain is surrounded by water on all 4 sides, infected human beings and animals can't reach mainland Europe from that way. Though I suspect whether migratory birds can carry the virus?<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later creates a whole new dimension, when the zombies travels across the English channel in the Channel Tunnel (Wow what brains!!) and reach France (Eiffel Tower can be seen clearly). With this we might be able to see the consequences of virus infecting people across the globe in the next installment 28 Months Later rumored to be directed by Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>What differentiates this flick with it's predecessor is that it is more violent and disturbing. The scenes of killing are painful to watch especially the massacre scene. The gore content in this movie surpasses that of Saving Private Ryan on my list. This movie is definitely not for people below the ages of 18 years (though they would be itching to watch!) and weak hearted adults.<br/><br/>Rose Byrne & Jeremy Renner were awesome. Robert Carlyle was quite good. But the child artiste's Mackintosh Muggleton & Imogen Poots as siblings were simply flawless and natural. The background score by John Murphy was as frightening & thrilling as the movie itself. I would give 5/5 to the sound department. A special mention must be given to the cinematography and the way the camera work was edited using the latest technology. The movie makes use of computer generated darkness at many scenes which were pretty cool. Another factor which makes this movie very realistic!<br/><br/>Watch this movie only if you are into horror stuff. This movie might ruin the day for serious movie watchers because of it's content. I would have given it a 4/5. But I was kinda frustrated by the over the top violent scenes."
"terren8556","2","1","1","19 July 2009"," Great Potential Ruined by Plot Absurdities
","The first scene of the film was very well done; it set up what I thought would be the makings of a very intelligent theme for exploration. In escaping the zombie attack on the farm house, the sole survivor, having left his wife behind, has to live with himself. Given the circumstances presented, many viewers would be torn between hating him and understanding his decision. It was clear that in staying behind and answering his wife's plea for help, he would have died. He later tearfully apologizes to his surviving kids in what I felt was a very effective scene. The daughter tells him that she and her brother are glad he survived. And that is exactly the point, isn't it? Had he answered his wife's call, he would have needlessly died, and the children would have had no parents at all. Nevertheless, his guilt was clear and consuming. What a great potential issue to explore in a horror movie, and what immense possibilities it could have led to.<br/><br/>I was disappointed that such was not on the filmmakers' agenda. What could have been an intelligent and unconventional approach to such a film was abandoned in short order. All the more disappointing in that the movie devolved into just another guts/guns/gore flick, with much sound and fury signifying nothing. <br/><br/>Apparently that was all that the makers of the film were really interested in producing, with little or no point to it. Especially in that, in terms of the ""plot"" they threw logic and common sense to the wind. Apparenlty the mission was to ensure that the outbreak recurred, ensure mayhem and holocaust and death, no matter what. Perhaps in the midst of the chaos, the viewer would forget about, or excuse, the absurd liberties they had taken with the storyline and character development and motivations. I could not do it.<br/><br/>The great potential set up in that first scenes was spectacularly and almost criminally repudiated by the film, when the wife that the viewer thought was dead is miraculously found alive. Then found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. Then, despite being of crucial importance as a source of a potential cure and a critical hazard in that she could readily infect someone, is left all alone and unguarded in a room for the husband/father to just waltz in with his access card, be infected, and then kill her. Huh?<br/><br/>It has also been noted by many here: 1) a military operation so lax and incompetent in terms of security and crisis response that one would be excused for thinking that the people in charge were actually yearning for, and actively trying to engineer, a provocation to give them an excuse to eventually blow everything up and kill everyone that they had been assigned to protect 2) the zombie dad who was apparently modeled after Forrest Gump, who appears everywhere, at the most ridiculously contrived times 3) two children who it is all but impossible to root for or care about, given that they, along with the mind-bogglingly incompetent military, were instrumental in reigniting the contagion 4) the million times before used plot device wherein the young medical officer (or scientist, cop, engineer-fill in the blank-) whose concerns are ignored or dismissed by superiors who are blind to what would have been obvious to any person with an IQ in the double digits.<br/><br/>A few plot holes can be explained or rationalized, but those in this film were so vast as to overwhelm everything. What started--I thought--as a thinking person's horror flick ended as just another mind numbing exercise in gore porn."

I can handle a story about a MAN who has to transport a kid (Children of Men), but this went a little too far paying attention to the kids. Unless it is oriented at kids, the children should be nothing more than a wiggling package to be dealt with in an action movie. Child/Teen mischief should not be a plot device (and it is in this one).<br/><br/>I didn't expect a great storyline and I didn't really get it, the movie is about constant frenetic escapes from the flesh-eating zombies as well as some escapes from an overzealous military thrown in to boot.<br/><br/>Somehow though, I still did enjoy it. They aren't afraid to kill off important characters and they do play with your expectations as a moviegoer. There are a couple of scenes where you are expecting shocks and they just laugh in your face. Also note the presence of a ""Dead Meat"" character. You halfway expect a particular monster to have a hesitation due to emotion while he is attacking certain victims. The movie makers almost use the typical tricks of a horror movie as red herrings to mislead you about where the plot is going to go.<br/><br/>Other things to look out for: multiple shots surreptitiously highlighting the chests of the leading ladies. humor is present, but at a different level than the obvious. you have to laugh at yourself and at the way they made the movie. I actually liked the slightly-sped-up effect, I felt it belonged here because it enhanced the way that an attack from a zombie would feel: quick, dirty, and to the point. a theme is that anyone with emotion tends to regret it, while the ""by the book"" military or the one-track-minded zombies survive and thrive. As soon as anyone stops having a rational reason for doing something and is working strictly from an emotion, then things go horribly wrong. The CG wasn't great, it was okay. Fire and smoke were a little unbelievable. I did enjoy seeing parts of London decimated. The movie does stand on its own, with or without the first one. A very ""safe"" sepia (filtered lens) scene at the beginning showing an attempt to return to normalcy followed by a gory bloody color as the attacks start. Tight hallways, scary medical facilities, tube tunnels. The swarmlike convergence of the infected zombies in multiple scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, I did really enjoy it and will be thinking about it long after the curtain has fallen, but found the ""children"" distracting. the thematic rising pitch detuned guitar motif."

","Another day another sequel, in this case a sequel to a brilliant film made by a brilliant director, i seriously questioned why a person like Danny Boyle would fall for the sequel bandwagon, but obviously everything has a price, or better still he really believed in this movie.<br/><br/>1 minute into this movie i was both disappointed and relieved, NO DANNY BOYLE Didn't DIRECT THIS FILM, so i knew i would get a lesser product and at the same time i was relieved that at least some person was willing to hold out from the exploitation sequels.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is as old as the mountains, obviously no infection ever stays controlled and there's always more guns, more running, and multiple enemies, not the mention the elusive miracle cure.OBVIOUSLY ORIGINALITY POINTS ARE ZERO.<br/><br/>The shots of an abandoned London which blew me away in ""28 days"", didn't quite have the impact here even though there were done on larger scale, THIS MOVIE HAS ALMOST NO NEW IDEAS TO OFFER.<br/><br/>But you still cannot take away the cinematic and entertainment value of this movie..<br/><br/>The movie starts of tense and never ever lets up, even in moments of supposed calm you know something is going to wrong and you never ever feel in the comfort zone, THIS MOVIE Doesn't HAVE THOSE JUMP AND LAUGH AFTERWARDS SCENE BUT IS PUMPED WITH TENSION AND DESPAIR.<br/><br/>A lot of the credit for the feel of this movie should go to the background score, its ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, simple tunes and instruments, are used to create a haunting effect, the music moves with the mood, and enhances every feeling that you feel.ONCE AGAIN A PROJECT INVOLVING DANNY BOYLE HAS FLAWLESS BACKGROUND SCORE.<br/><br/>The cinematography is superb, although there have been nothing new to offer but every scene is handled with panache you can feel the fear in the dark, or the expanse of abandoned London, or the haphazard scuffle between inexperienced fighters who are often fighting desperately for their life.HERE TOO EVEN THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE BUT YET OOZED OF QUALITY.<br/><br/>The acting too was superb no extra melodrama, IN A MOVIE THAT HAD A LOT OF DRAMA, i normally hate drama and even though i didn't go as far as enjoying the drama in this movie, i was really OK with it, IF ANYTHING THE SLIGHTLY WEAK SCRIPT CAN BE BLAMED FOR THE WEAK SCENES.<br/><br/>The 2 girls weren't bad looking either even though there is no semblance of sexuality its nice to see pretty girls instead of ugly ones.<br/><br/>Think of your favourite food, have you ever had a time when you've had it again and again and again and even though your FAR FROM FED UP WITH IT YOU FEEL IT TASTES A LITTLE LESS BETTER Every time???...<br/><br/>Well i love zombie flicks, i love the blood,the guns, the explosions, the tensions, AND YOU CAN NEVER NOT LIKE A FLAWLESS BACKGROUND SCORE LIKE THIS, but somehow after seeing so many zombie movies with variations of the same old stuff, the pleasure is decreasing.<br/><br/>Yet hats off to the director and his team for doing such a fine job despite the lack of originality in the script and plot.<br/><br/>Fans and first time watchers of the genre will definitely enjoy it, but be warned its much more of a tense thriller than it is a action flick unlike most zombie flicks.<br/><br/>-s NOTHING NEW OR ORIGINAL,slightly weak script,PLOT HOLES.<br/><br/>+/-s too much of the same good thing????..<br/><br/>+s FLAWLESS BACKGROUND SCORE, very good acting, lots of tension, some decent special effects, SUPERB CINEMATOGRAPHY.<br/><br/>total 7/10 (just too original to merit anything more, will not make tedious comparisons to the original but my favourite food syndrome was definitely at play here,do watch with correct expectations.)"
"cericsso","5","1","1","17 December 2007"," A bland copy of the original
","In 2002, the zombie genre was forever altered by the arrival of Danny Boyle's gritty and realistic ""28 Days Later"", which first and foremost introduced a new brand of zombies, the supercharged, red-eyed sprinters which made for a delightful change to the classic Romeroesque undead. Shot mostly on hand-held low-tech camera (which contributed greatly to the general feeling of the story), the movie followed a small group of survivors after a virus outbreak in London. The viewer was instantly dropped into the center of the steamrolling action and followed through to the end in a dramatic, very human story that most of all felt as if it could be happening right now outside your very window. And it was scary, as hell.<br/><br/>Now, 5 years later later, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directs the sequel piece, ""28 Weeks Later"", with a similar attitude and look as the original. The storyline, without divulging any crucial spoilers, centers around a small group of survivors living in a military-guarded security area during a rebuilding time of London, after what is believed to be the extermination of the virus infection. Not long into the film, we do however get to see a lot of people running around, chased by ""infected ones"", and like the original, some touching moments.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as good a copy as this new edition might be in it's feel, it does lack the spontaneity of the original. While Danny Boyle's movie kept far away from classic movie clichés and always kept the viewer on the edge, this one feels a bit to calculated. Almost as if it tried to much to be the original, but with failing result. Not to mention some really bad turns towards plain goofiness and absurdity (relating to the last 30 minutes). Also, I feel obliged to comment on some rather heavy usage of shaking cameras, which although may do well to convey a feeling of panic, feels a bit overdone after a while.<br/><br/>So, as a conclusion; as with most sequels, ""28 Weeks Later..."" does not live up to it's predecessor, which remains as the ultimate piece in new-genre zombie flicks. And we shall do well to hope that they don't decide to produce a ""28 Month/Years/Decades Later"". Not even if it's starring Clive Owen or Pierce Brosnan."
"JobyStephens","4","7","18","11 May 2007"," 28 Weeks Later? How about. Never.
","I went into this film expecting something very different to what I watched. That is to say, I expected to go in and watch a good film. 28 Weeks Later was anything but. It was a technical sham, and no matter how much people insist they enjoy it, the fundamental and rather dreadful film-making techniques showcased shouldn't be ignored. Loose focus on most close-ups, horrible fast paced and quite frankly 'crap' editing squeezed any life out of what could have been very well paced scenes. The script had more plot-holes and narrative errors than a Bush speech, quite why the one women who could possibly give an antidote was left unguarded for Mr 'janitor' to easily walk into her confined area is beyond me. Red Dwarf had better continuity and stronger writing. Quite why Robert Carlyle's character knowing that his wife had the deadly virus (the reveal eye shot) then decided to kiss her is again.. beyond me.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the dumb and the shameful will find this movie great in its areas of the genre, yet I feel after such a strong idea from the original film, this script, this sequel, was kicked to crap and any decency that remained in the original story has been destroyed by terrible. Terrible CG helicopters. I know young 17 year old at online film-fan sites that can digitally compose helicopters better than 28 Weeks... point made.<br/><br/>I bored my skull through it all, hoping that mixed around the moments of fantastic work and actually good acting there would be a good light at the end tunnel, alas it all seemed to go up in flames rather like one of the characters.<br/><br/>This film was badly made and delivered. Don't be fooled by the masses. It could have been so much more.<br/><br/>And director of this film, you dick. A tripod would have helped in MOST shots. I don't want to feel sick whilst actually trying to follow a one-shot conversation."

","This takes place 7 months after London had been ravaged by a virus that turned people into flesh-eating monsters. Now they're all believed to be dead and some new communities are being set up in certain sections of London. But things slowly go wrong and a new outbreak threatens to occur...<br/><br/>The plot may sound kind of vague but I don't want to give it away. If you liked the first one you'll like this. Like the first it's grim and (after a slow start) VERY graphic with extreme blood and gore. The acting is good all across the board and this film has no letup--there's no jokes to lessen the tension. No exactly a fun night at the movies but great for horror fans.<br/><br/>My only complaints--I got tired of the nonstop jumpy camera during the attacks (you don't know WHAT'S going on a few times) and the ending was sort of puzzling.<br/><br/>Still it's grim and graphic--powerful stuff. I give it an 8."
"ldoig","3","5","12","12 May 2007"," Good horror - very poor sequel.
","Like many people who were ""umming and ahhring"" when they heard this sequel was planned I along with many was worried. I'm left feeling that yet again, a very good film (along with Highlander/Matrix) will have its aura destroyed by ever more dodgy sequels. <br/><br/>I gather the filming was a little rushed in Canary Wharf, and that didn't bode well for me, though in fairness the film looks very good and is at times very well directed but, the plot, while not exactly ""holes"" and are to some extent explained, are nonetheless very annoying as they are frankly so bloody stupid! <br/><br/>I mean...the children getting out of the security zone and getting as far as they did; daft. Robert Carlisle being able to get to his wife (I know, I know, he had a ""pass"") but do me a favour; irritating. The fact that some soldier, suddenly gets a moral compass with no previous character building; a bit smelly, the fact that after napalming London a lone helicopter somehow is able to fly across the channel with out the pilot ever radioing in for hours, and being able to avoid radar is astonishing; i.e. read poor plot device for a nice looking ending but...another sequel. <br/><br/>Also, why napalm when they use chemical weapons anyhow? Surely they'd want to keep the buildings? And since when have Volvos been air tight? I mean, I know the Swede's make a nice motor...but chemical warfare proof!? Clever buggers those vikings...<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the virus was not supposed to be passed cross species...so how comes humans got it from chimps then? Grrrrrrrr!!!! And why were all the civilians locked in a dark underground room!? What rotters these Yanks are to do that to us! Why didn't they put us all at the top of a building with lots of soldiers with guns on the stairs or something. And since when has an infected been calm enough to use a swipe card!?!?<br/><br/>And two children, walking along the underground from Westminster to Wembley!!! In the dark with no maps!? <br/><br/>Boo! Poor!!! 3 out of 10, must do better!!<br/><br/>Alright...If you want crass horror, then OK its your bag, from helicopters slicing people up to scary stuff with night vision goggles and eyes being gouged out...but this really could have been so much better. It started very well, and had lots of potential, but why should I yet again be made to feel like a snob just because I expect a bit of intelligence? Especially as the reason the first was so popular was because it was exactly the right mixture of horror, effects, good directing and an intelligent plot?<br/><br/>Oh well, as they say ""Whatever"". <br/><br/>28 months later anyone?"
"sigiam2","9","5","12","10 May 2007"," If you're a fan of 28DL, you'll be a fan of 28WL
","Saw a media screening last night. 28WL has a lean script and the movie flies by. The suspense lingers throughout the film, and it doesn't slow down too much like the first one did (when everyone got to the military outpost). There are small variations in the storyline pertaining to the how/who the infection affects, and there is one really well done scene where a number of rampaging infected have to be well..dealt with..in a swift fashion. Robert Carlyle is excellent, and overall I think you might even like this one better than the first. Stylistically it's similar to the first, and the tone and mood are still quite eerie, since a large part of London has been quarantined and non infected humans are being brought back into re populate the city. Scenes involving characters going into the prohibited areas where infected may linger are quite eerie and well done."
"poolandrews","5","12","38","11 May 2007"," Disappointing sequel, I preferred the original to be honest.
","28 Weeks Later... is set in a decimated London & starts as all the infected created by the rage virus have died of starvation, a US led Nato group has set up an area in London to start the re-population of England. Don (Robert Carlyle) survived the virus & is reunited with his two children Tammy (Imogen Poots) & Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) whom he tells the bad news about their mother Alice (Catherine McCormack) being killed by one of the infected. Tammy & Andy break out of the quarantined living area & into a deserted London where they hope to go to their old house which they do, once there they find their supposedly dead mum hiding in a bedroom. They are all taken back & Alice is examined by a military scientist named Scarlet (Rose Byrne) who makes the shocking discovery that Alice is infected with the virus but somehow has an immunity to it, unfortunately since the virus is present in her blood Alice is also a carrier of the virus & it's not long before there's another outbreak...<br/><br/>This British production was co-written & directed Juan Carlos Fresnadillo & is a disappointing follow up to the original 28 Days Later... (2002) in my opinion. The script by Fresnadillo, Rowan Joffe, Jesus Olmo & E.L. Lavigne starts off a bit too slowly for my liking, in fact the first 30 odd minutes of 28 Weeks Later... is nothing more than exposition about the aftermath of the outbreak & bringing the viewer up speed on the situation as it stands at present, this actually feels almost semi-documentary & news report like. Then, eventually, the action kicks in & it's pretty uninspired stuff to be honest. There's the usual small group of survivors who have to combat an evil menace, in this case the infected & it all seems rather routine & a tad dull. 28 Weeks Later... reminds heavily of Aliens (1986), there's the initial threat which has supposedly been eradicated, there's the gung-ho American military, there's the annoying brat of a kid & a complete stranger who sudden thinks they're the most important thing in the world & all sorts of unlikely coincidences & a fair helping of bad luck & stupidity which sets a chain of unfortunate events going including rounding the entire public population in a single room & only locking one door & not guarding them so when the infected arrive they can just walk right on in & have plenty of victims to choose from... Then there's the awful character's, the only likable one gets cooked while the kids really are annoying & since they were the ones who pretty much caused the entire situation in the first place I had absolutely no sympathy with them & I actually wanted them to die, horribly. The ironic ending where the good hearted scientist & soldier sacrifice their lives to get Andy & Tammy to safety even though they too carry the infection but show no symptom's like their mum which then spreads the virus even further is probably the most effective thing about the entire film. Having said that it's watchable on a certain level, the second half of the film does pick up & it moves along at a reasonable pace, if your undemanding then you may enjoy it but I personally didn't think it was anything special at all.<br/><br/>Director Fresnadillo ruins the whole thing by filming it on grainy hand-held camcorders which shake about all over the place especially during the action scenes so it's sometimes difficult to see what's happening & that quickly becomes both annoying & frustrating. Then there's the quick fire 'blink and you'll miss it' editing which also makes it difficult to see what's happening, both the shaky camera & quick editing techniques have been used a fair bit recently in horror films & I personally hate both. Why can't people just make a proper film? The whole gritty, realistic documentary look irritates me & I don't know one single other person who likes this style. Forget about much gore, there's a fair amount of blood splatter, there's an eye gouging, some gory gunshot wounds & the films showstopper moment when a group of the infected are mowed down by helicopter blades but overall there's not much here if your looking for gore.<br/><br/>Techncially the film is fine, there are some impressive expansive aerial shots of London & some of it's landmarks. It was nice to see the new Wembley make an appearance at the end, ironically when the first film 28 days Later... was made it hadn't been built yet! The acting was alright, no one going to win any awards & that young kid with the long girly hair just got on my nerves throughout. The always dependable Robert Carlyle is as watchable as ever though.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later... is an OK time waster although I expected & had hoped for more than that, overall I was disappointed by a largely dull, forgettable & ordinary film."

"george-kakaletris","2","4","9","19 June 2007"," The Military portrayal totally destroys the movie
","Unlike the first ""28"" movie, this movie fails, and does so on a very important and substantial point; the portrayal of the Military culture.<br/><br/>It is an unfortunate reality that those who have a specific expertise within the military, or within the police, whether through study or experience, are able to identify discrepancies in movies that render aspects of a plot unbelievable and without credibility. ""28 Weeks Later"" falls into that phenomenon.<br/><br/>Ordinarily it would not be a big deal, however in this movie, the military aspect is what drives the plot, the action and various scenes, and sets up future scenes of the movie. I will not get into the specific details, as I do not want to ruin the movie for others, so I will just list some of the general principles.<br/><br/>1) There are a number of Snipers in the movie who never seem to sleep, nor are they relieved by other snipers, in order for them to get some much needed rest and sleep.In a high stress zone as this one, you would want your first line of security to be at their best. Wide awake and alert.<br/><br/>2) People who would not have the proper ""Secret,"" or ""Top Secret"" security clearance, have access to areas of a quarantined ward that would never be available to them. And yet, the movie only truly kicks off precisely due to such an event occurring. <br/><br/>3) The medical staff is run by personal of too low a rank for such a mission, and the Officer in Charge does not have any subordinates to run the operation for him. Such a High Level Mission would be run by a commanding officer with a staff of hundreds.<br/><br/>4) The security aspect for such a high-risk area is laughable, I have experienced more security in areas of Iraq that I have served in, and then I was only dealing with terrorists, not Rage infected people.<br/><br/>5) The military bases their success on being able to respond to the unexpected with contingency plans; the commander and the unit in charge in the movie have no contingency plans for the various scenarios that go wrong.<br/><br/>I could continue, but these few examples should suffice to make my point. Ordinarily such glaring mistakes could be tolerated, but in the case of ""28 Weeks"" so much of the plot hinges on the military aspect that it makes it an implausible movie. It is one thing to make mistakes, it is another thing to grossly misunderstand such issues and base the foundation of your action, plot and horror upon it. <br/><br/>I will also have to disagree with one of the other reviewers; I did not see any of the characters in this movie acting as though they were in a real Rage infested world. People who live in fear of their lives day in and day out, do not live and act as these characters do. There is no angst, stress or psychological and/or emotional burden upon them. This movie tries to build off the first one, but comes very short."
"joelparkes","1","4","9","28 May 2007"," Wretchedly, wretchedly bad!
","This is just a BAD movie on almost all levels, and does for ""28 Days Later"" (which I loved) what ""Aliens"" did for ""Alien"". In other words, it demystifies it, cheapens it, exploits it, and wastes it. While the first film had characters that you cared about (played by damned good actors), this film is immediately and obviously peopled by actors that have ""cannon-fodder"" (or in this case ""infected-fodder"") written all over them. The characters are so poorly developed that to call them two-dimensional is to give them the benefit of the doubt. Most of them are simply around to give the plot a half-hearted push and then die.<br/><br/>One of the hallmarks of a bad movie is that supposedly smart people do incredibly stupid things. That tradition is alive and well in this awful film. A high-security area along the lines of the Pentagon or the White House proves as porous as a sponge, and the holes in the film's logic are so big that a helicopter could fly through them. Which brings us to The Helicopter, the only one in the entire military that is flown by one guy, without a copilot or door gunners or anything. This proves important at the end, but I can say no more.<br/><br/>The violence is gratuitous and ineffective. As allegory to Iraq, the movie fails. This film should, and probably will, be studied in film schools as a bad example of a poor script poorly directed. It will also probably make a ton of money.<br/><br/>My last word - YUCK!"

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","9","4","9","12 May 2007"," One of the most complete films of the 2000's. A great sequel.
","28 Days Later was one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen, and 28 Weeks Later was no different. It is scary, thrilling, and more political than what you'd expect from a horror film. The acting is also very good, but what makes these 2 movies so good is how well directed and written they are...because that makes them realistic, which is disturbing.<br/><br/>It's been 28 weeks since the end of the first film, and long since the last infected person died out from starvation. Now, the US Army has landed in Britain, with the hopes of rebuilding the country (sound familiar?). After many weeks of success and progress, a person comes in contact with a carrier of the rage virus...passing the virus on, and the outbreak of insane blood thirsty zombies begins again. Meanwhile, 2 children (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton) may be far more important and valuable than anyone knows.<br/><br/>First off, I was impressed with the acting. Jeremy Renner (S.W.A.T.) was very likable, much like Cillian Murphy in the original. His US Military Sniper character was very well done. He's a truly good and moral character who makes a big decision during the heat of battle, thus setting off the movie's central storyline. Like the first film, the central storyline doesn't establish itself until a while in. Poots and Muggleton both do good jobs as the main characters. You'll feel for them. Robert Carlyle gives a magnificent performance, but telling how so would be spoiling. Harold Perrineau also does a good job in a supporting role, and contributes to one of the most fantastic action scenes with his helicopter.<br/><br/>Like I said, the acting is great, but the writing, direction, and the action is even better. There's a lot more action in this one, for sure. The gore is very plentiful to satisfy the most die hard zombie film fans, and the action sequences are very clever and well done, especially the helicopter scenes. I was left jaw-dropped many times. The zombies are scarier than before, because this time, you see their creation and how quickly they multiply. Sometimes, you can't help but think, ""what if this really happened?"". It's as psychologically scary as it is visually scary, and I thank Juan Carlos Fresnadillo for that. The film is expertly directed and written, and gives Danny Boyle a run for his money. Fresnadillo captures the mood and feel of the first film perfectly, and you'll get chills just from the atmosphere. Also, Fresnadillo did a great job creating a destroyed London. It's very realistic. The script allows for a fast paced movie that balances the action with the drama very well, while scaring the crap out of you. Even though this is a movie, the political undertones are very obvious, as well as Fresnadillo's attitude towards social behavior. The movie eerily resembles the Iraq War, and what would happen if the world was thrust into total chaos with nothing to guide the people. 28 Weeks Later is definitely one of the most complete films I've watched recently. It's as political as it is scary and action packed, and it's one hell of a ride. Great job, Mr. Fresnadillo. I also have no doubt that there's going to be a third part. I can't wait.<br/><br/>9/10 --spy"

","First off, I have seen and enjoyed the first film in this series ""28 Days Later..."", but when I heard about this sequel, i thought ""stupid cash-in sequel"". However, I was extremely surprised by this film. Keeping all of the suspense and gore of its predecessor, while boasting characters which you actually care about, which is very rare for a horror. <br/><br/>This film takes place 7 months (28 weeks) after the first film, with a US-led NATO force repopulating a now infection-free Britain, and of course, the infection breaks out again. The story revolves around one family, reunited after the initial outbreak, and their quest to survive, with more to do with this new outbreak than they think. Not to give too much away, this, like ""28 Days Later"" is not for the faint-hearted, with more gore than the original, while keeping the same tension-filled atmosphere. At last, a sequel on a par with the original, and one leaving you waiting desperately for the inevitable ""28 Months Later...""."

There is one particular scene that by itself should have gotten the film an NC-17 Rating. Very vicious and brutal. The story and its characters are straightforward and all the better for it. This is a film that doesn't need to be weighed down by complexity. Why? Because it's so damn scary and exciting! I have to give a lot of credit to the music composer as well.

"Skutter-2","5","4","9","11 May 2007"," 1 Weak Sequel Later
","28 Weeks Later sits comfortably in the unnecessary sequel camp. The first movie was good, a self contained story that had run its course and did not require a follow up. Things had come to their natural conclusion in terms of the rage virus dying out etc. and there was no need for a follow up. That said I could see some potential for a sequel just in terms of it being interesting in seeing what would happen next. How would the country be rebuilt? What steps would be taken toward containment? In what ways could the virus and the infected have survived and how would it be dealt with in this different scenario? 28 Weeks later deals with these questions and it doesn't deal with all of them too badly. The way in which the rage virus survives was quite neatly done. However, it is in a lot of respects a really, really dumb movie.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with 28 Weeks is the dumb way in which the military deal with the situation. There are staggering holes in their security system, which are just unbelievable. One dude, who is effectively a caretaker as it is pointed out by another character in the movie, has key card access to the highest quarantine section of the base? This same quarantine area, which contains the one individual who is infected with the virus, is not even guarded or under surveillance. This seems especially stupid after the movie has made a point of how tight and invasive the military presence is at this point. They're willing send a few squads of soldiers and helicopters after two kids who wander out of the contained zone but not bother with any real security precautions to guard the one potential remaining source of the virus? The plan after the virus has broken out is even stupider. If they wanted the virus to spread as quickly as possible amongst as large a group as possible they could not have done a better job than they did by shoving everyone on the island into one big confined space and then not securing the entries and exits so that one of the infected can get in. Despite the fact the base was put on an island, presumably for containment capacity, the island is not actually contained all that well, with numerous ways onto the mainland, which, strangely enough, are not properly secured or guarded even when the outbreak starts. Wouldn't it have been the obvious thing to do, to have sealed off the exits off the isle when were first setting up the safe zone or in the case of an outbreak, even if the personnel couldn't be spared, which is in itself unbelievable, to rig them with high explosives which could set off at the first sign of trouble? Did anybody making this movie think for a few seconds about creating a believable scenario or applying any common sense? Maybe the makers were too caught up with introducing a simplistic military force is bad theme. I hadn't even consider any Iraq analogies until I saw them mentioned online, and quite frankly if such analogies were intended, and I'm not sure they were, they would make the movie even dumber given the disparities between the situations. Obviously the film would have been quite boring if the threat could have been contained so easily but the makers could easily have come with some more plausible, less contrived ways to have brought about a continuation of the story? It would just have required a little more thought and effort on their part and the movie could still have contained all the scenes of carnage and anarchy that one could wish for.<br/><br/>All is not terrible, though. The scenes of the outbreak and the military's brutal containment are nightmarish and effective as are quite a few of the chase scenes. The one at the start, with Robbie Carlyle being chased across the open field was quite well done. The movie does wallow in the gore and nastiness a bit too much. There were a few scenes where the violence was lingered on a little too long- a cheap and easy way to make the movie seem more 'intense' or 'hardcore' I guess. Though one the whole, the brutal, kinetic style of film making worked although and I could have done with a few less shaky-cam moments.<br/><br/>Character and acting wise things were okay but not great. None of the characters really stood out, except for the Carlyle character, who had an interesting back-story and personal conflicts, although they could have used the character more than they did. The acting was competent all across the board, even the children weren't particularly annoying- a frequent problem for these movies is irritating and shrill child actors. Though they should have been bitch-slapped for breaking quarantine like they did.<br/><br/>There were other bits and pieces that I liked. The storyline about the children's immunity to the virus and the possibility of the creation of the vaccine was an interesting introduction to the storyline and it lead to a somewhat amusingly ironic ending. The scene with the helicopter slicing up the infected was absolutely ridiculous and I loved it, even if it did seem out of tone with the rest of the movie and was incredibly dumb. Though scenes like this and the one with the airtight gas secure minivan don't make the movie seem particularly intelligent. Not much of it does."

","When you start this up, it doesn't take long before you realize that it's different than the original. That doesn't have to be a negative, and there are good qualities to this. The Infected are still shot in a manner unlike that of the regular humans, and the visual style is nice. It becomes evident from early on that this discounts two rules for them as established before, both increasing how aggressive they come off at the cost of some of the pathos. With that said, there are interesting emotional situations in this, and I found the opening ten, fifteen minutes or so to be terrifying and chilling. This goes for intensity over atmosphere, and depth is lost. The action leans towards the chaotic, we can't keep track of what's going on, and we're not meant to. Think the initial half hour of Saving Private Ryan. I'd say this one is louder than the last one, and less both about the loss of loved ones(without abandoning it entirely). It is claustrophobic and unpleasant when it means to be. The characters are credible and psychologically accurate, the dialog natural. Acting tends to be good, including that of the kids. The concept is great, and part of the way, the idea of the quarantine with the military being in control(I can't be the only one sick of the presence of ""the big, evil, heartless corporation"" in recent films and shows) is dealt with well, in spite of the dumb soldier types. Then the annoying and obvious plot holes began cropping up. I realized how much of the trouble in this was on account of children. And how Americanized this is probably also got to me, because by the third act, I no longer particularly cared. 90 minutes of mostly adrenaline... I don't know, I think we require more substance along with it, especially when the previous entry set a standard for such. FX are well-done. There are a lot of jump-scares in this. This is the only thing I've seen by Fresnadillo, and it won't necessarily remain so. The creepiness and post-apocalyptic mood are effective, when this goes for them. Maybe ""Months"" will put this series back on track. There is a lot of bloody, brutal, gory violence and disturbing content, a little sexuality/near-nudity and occasional strong language in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track(by director and writer, who also offer their thoughts on the 2 deleted scenes), three short featurettes and two animated chapters of the graphic novel(I will review all five of them on their individual pages here on the site) and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to those looking for fast-paced horror. 7/10"

","i enjoyed quite a lot the 1st movie, ""28 Days After"". It was a good ""zombie film"" - a lot better that ""I Am Legend"", for instance, not to mention that it was made much earlier and with a smaller budget.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the sequel, ""28 Weeks Later"" was very disappointing.<br/><br/>They turned a movie that focused on the psychological aspects of being a fugitive in a world over-run with demented zombies (a thriller, in fact), into something like ""Rambo meets the living dead"".

Yet, all of the sudden, one of them is smart enough to use magnetic access cards, and over-rides computerized security settings!!! Wow.. ;)<br/><br/>Quite frankly, a waste of time.."
"sqeaston9","2","3","6","2 February 2008"," Unbelievable plot that insults the intelligence
","I quite enjoyed the original 28 Days Later despite the problem with the premise. If the infected are uncontrollably violent why don't they attack each other? Who knows, but I was willing to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the ride. I was hoping for more of the same from the sequel, but unfortunately so many unbelievable things happen I found this impossible to view as anything but a farce.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers follow *** Robert Carlyle is holed up in a house with his wife and a few other survivors. Unfortunately the place they've chosen has paper thin walls the infected can punch through and they haven't fashioned or collected any weapons, and thus when a group of infected attack they're scr*wed. Robert is forced to abandon his wife and flee, and narrowly escapes.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 28 weeks later, and an American military force have recolonised part of London and are guarding British survivors. Most of the infected are dead from starvation (dehydration surely?), but are still considered a threat. Robert's kiddies arrive from abroad, but are upset they have no photo of their mummy, and so sneak out of the safe zone with the Americans in pursuit. Amazingly they find mummy is still alive, and a short time later they're all recaptured and returned to safety.<br/><br/>The Americans hose down the mother and tie her to a bench in their military complex. They suspect she's infected but for some reason hasn't gone psycho (she has different coloured eyes, a trait she shares with her son). They take a blood sample, and leave her unattended. Robert uses his caretaker pass card to sneak in, finds her, kisses her on the lips, becomes infected and starts killing people.<br/><br/>Realising they have a problem, the military decide to evacuate the British survivors from the safety of the skyscrapers and herd them all into a basement room with an unlocked and unguarded back door. The infected Robert enters and starts attacking them.<br/><br/>This was the point where I lost the ability to take any of it seriously. I simply can't believe any military force, American or otherwise, could be that moronic.<br/><br/>And so having lost containment the soldiers first shoot down civilians and infected alike, and then later napalm and nerve gas them. There's a humorous bit where the kids and another survivor escape the nerve gas hiding in an airtight abandoned car. And so as they flee the mayhem, Robert the 'super infected' pursues them across London and inexplicably keeps popping up to attack them. The son with the eyes is bitten but doesn't go nuts like his mother (what a surprise!). And it seems the infected have become more like traditional zombies in that they can still walk around with wounds that would kill any human. I won't 'spoil' this any further for you, but suffice it to say I was shouting at the TV in anger by the time it was over.<br/><br/>I think this was supposed to be some kind of comment on the American military and the Iraq situation. If so, it failed utterly. It's the film makers that come out looking like idiots.<br/><br/>I'd give this a 1, but the first ten minutes were OK and there were a few enjoyable gore sequences.<br/><br/>2/10"
"CajunGentleman","9","3","6","28 October 2007"," Great film, despite what some may say.
","I think this is one of the scariest movies I've seen in a long time. It's not corny, it has realistic action with realistic situations which keeps you engaged in the story. What makes it so scary is not the jumps, although they are very good, but just the suspense and anticipation of what might happen. You really can't ever rest, there is always something waiting to happen, and there are a few scenes in particular that make you wanna pee your pants.<br/><br/>Some have talked about how astoundingly stupid some of the decisions are that the characters make, and some of them are stupid. Even just the idea of repopulating england seems retarded to me, but I don't think it's far fetched. Stupid decisions are made all the time, with governments, the military, and normal people. Especially since it's the US military guarding the streets in england there, it doesn't surprise me they didn't take better precautions. I don't thing the preposterousness of the decisions at all reduces the quality of this movie. If anything, it makes it seem real to me. There's no lame one liners, no flashy characters, just a lot of normal people that you can relate to, and that makes it seem real, and much more scary."

","28 Days Later was something. Without interesting plot, horrible zombies and highly tense scenes it had some deeper meaning about how humanity act in front of catastrophe.

Kids are not afraid to go there, where even soldiers from NATO (with Americans in front of them, of course :)) are not allowed to go. So, kids make all the mess again and in the end, only they survive. 28... became a horror movie for teens.<br/><br/>There are a lot of plot holes, stupid behaviour of characters and only one thing that reminds an original movie.

"vxcriss","3","3","6","28 August 2007"," plain wrong (if you're offended by bad words don't read this comment)
","This is the most stup1d film I've seen in a long while. The quality of the movie is good, well directed, nice effects all v good, however, it's built on the worst script possible. Whoever wrote the script either entirely lacked common sense and had absolutely no ability to reason or think logically. Almost every single scene in this movie contains an act of logic blasphemy. The army lets the kids get away from a contained area like it was nothing (that does not happen in real life, subjects either obey command and get on the ground or they get shot, regardless of who they are, when you're on highly important guard duty, until you're released, you're the master over the protected objective, I've been in the army and I know that for a fact). The zombies gain supernatural power (what!? how!? why!?). Zombies can break metal doors but can't break a car's windows. Army locks up all people in a safe room and tightly secures a door while the other is unguarded and badly locked (plain stup1d). A few hundred people and zombies break out of the building into open ground under fire from many snipers AND gunners + a mounted machine gunner and most of them get away overwhelming the troops (what!?). Taking out all the snipers and all the gunners and leaving only the mounted machine gunner to guard that ONLY exit point for all of these people, that machine gun alone can EASILY take out an UNLIMITED number of unprotected, unarmed targets that come running out as long as it has ammo (most stup1d scene I ever saw in a movie). Those people that write movie scripts should learn some history, do some research on the Maxim machine gun in WW1 and you'll learn WHY you can't have such a scene in your script. The scene with the night vision scope in the subway is total cr4p, first of all, if you're chased by zombies it's common sense that you don't go running into a totally dark subway (to do what!?), secondly, you don't scream like an 1d1o7 all over the place especially when you're talking to someone right in front of you, and third but not last, you don't need someone to guide you thru a scope on how to walk down some stairs, every single one of us has during their lifetime has been in the situation where they had to climb up or down some stairs in total blindness and we didn't need someone to guide us and it certainly isn't that hard. Another stup1d scene was when the dude gets to his wife and he kisses her, there was nobody there, I mean, she was a surviver just brought in for investigation, they found out she was infected yet they had not even one single guard posted in there, or in the whole building as a matter of fact, since the dude managed to get inside passing multiple unguarded doors (total bu115h17). Well there is more cr4p in the script but I'll get myself around to an ending. The movie is very good considering ""making of"" however the script is TOTAL CR4P, it's one of those scripts that were build with total disregard to logic just so they can create some situations of tensions and to keep the plot going. If you want to see one of those movies when every single minute you get pi55ed off just because everyone acts totally illogical and against common sense and everything happens ""just cause the script made it so"", then watch this movie where every action has a chaotic reaction, and every reaction most of the time triggers by itself."

","I really enjoyed this film, very similar to the first one but with one important difference: The writing. The screenplay should been rewritten because contains lot of mistakes. I'm talking about the way the virus returns, i'ts a good idea to find somebody genetically immune to the virus, same happens with AIDS, but that woman should be under vigilance (1st mistake). The army tries to keep safe civilians with nobody at the doors of the room (2nd mistake). OK let's kill everybody to make sure the virus does not expand, but an infected doesn't drives a car (3rd mistake). They are very common mistakes in this kind of zombie films, but it's common sense to fix those things in the writing, before filming."
"gail-bishop","3","3","6","25 June 2007"," ""Lets see how many London landmarks we can cram into one film""
","On the whole, I've never been that fussed on the horror or zombie genre - but 28 Days Later was a very well made, and a credit to British cinema. As Jim wakes up in hospital and wanders out into a very still London - the silence is just deafening. More than anything, I was just in awe of how they managed to film it! The film proceeds through a dystopia where no place is safe, only safer, giving you a tense build up and a very satisfying sudden release of gore.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 28 weeks later. Within minutes, you're dropped into a horrifying reawakening of just how much damage the infected can do. It's heartbreaking to watch a man witness a brutal attack on his wife knowing that there's nothing he can do to save her, without dying himself, and so he flees. Very good, and very human. Well done.<br/><br/>And then it all goes downhill. There are so many plot holes that you could use the film as a vegetable strainer. Why were the kids accepted back into the country, if the quarantine services weren't expecting them? They could surely have been put on the first flight back. How is it that the army personnel didn't spot them creeping across the bridge? Surely there should also have been some sort of morning and evening register or 'head count' to make sure the numbers still tallied up (to make sure no one had got out and that no one had got in - what if there'd still been one lone infected who'd managed to sneak in undetected? Well yes, we know exactly what would happen, but that's beside the point!). Why wasn't the mother under stricter guard? Why was Robert Carlisle's character given such wide unsupervised access? For true security there should be 2 of you with separate swipe cards/passwords which have to be used together to gain access to certain areas.<br/><br/>But I digress - the film relies on lax security, lack of communication and shoddy protocol - there'd be no way that the infected could get in if all 3 were kept tight, and then there'd be no sequel.<br/><br/>Now for anyone who lives in or near London, as the film progresses, you really do begin to wonder if the writers had ever visited or even looked at a map. Could someone please explain to me how you can see Wembley stadium in the near distance from central London?! Or how you're supposed to get from East London to Regent's Park on foot within four minutes?! Or how you're supposed to navigate approximately 5 miles of rabbit warren-like Tube tunnels from Lancaster Gate to one of Wembley's tube stations in complete darkness and without a tube map or a torch?! Or did I fall asleep when this was all explained? I really began to wonder if there was actually any specific relevance to the locations, or if it was just the writers pulling London landmarks out of a hat and loosely fitting a story around them, and hoping that several million people wouldn't notice their tenuous grasp of the local geography."

","Thank Christ!<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"" is a modern, and un-ironic for a change, horror film. As fast, kinetic, intense and violent as ""28 Days Later"". Also bloody. Very bloody. Some absolutely brilliant set pieces. (The opening sequence, where an almost middle class dinner party rapidly turns into a blood bath, and Robert Carlyle's frantic flight, leaving his wife to her fate. Robert Carlyle's (again - I really like him) transformation from clean to infected and his subsequent rage filled attack on his wife. The moment when the snipers are told to ""kill everything that moves"". The fire bombing of the Isle Of Dogs. A helicopter as an up close and personal attack vehicle. The chemical weapon attack.) Good stuff, but ""28 Weeks Later"" is undone somewhat by a lazy and predictable script, way too dependant on coincidence. Examples.<br/><br/>Two children can avoid detection by the U.S. army, break out of a secure cordon around the Isle Of Dogs, find a motorbike to go back to where they used to live. Then they find their Mother, still alive.<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle is a trusted caretaker for the U.S. army. Trusted enough, apparently, to have a high enough security clearance to be able to get into a medical facility, where the U.S. army scientists are investigating the rage virus, to visit his wife who is in isolation and is strapped down.<br/><br/>Eh?<br/><br/>Or the worst thing. Robert Carlyle as super infected man! He keeps popping up like a jack-in-the-box, as his children's nemesis of choice, long after he should have disappeared into the background. One of a thousand infected getting shot, burned or gassed by the U.S. army.<br/><br/>Final thing.<br/><br/>The climatic sequence under Wembley Stadium, in apparent pitch black, was terribly put together. Maybe it was just me, but I had no idea what was going on. Awful.<br/><br/>I don't suppose I cared very much about any of the characters, either.<br/><br/>Lots of criticisms, there, but I liked ""28 Weeks Later"" enough. I did. It is a true rush of a movie, it just isn't as good as ""28 Days Later"". Such a shame. Maybe the next film (trust me, a European set movie ""28 Months Later"" must be on the cards) will be better. Maybe it will become a true saga and we will get sci-fi epic ""28 Years Later"" a couple of years down the line? That would be interesting."
"MrGKB","6","3","6","25 May 2007"," Serviceable sequel has its moments...
","...but fails to add much of anything substantial to the action/horror genre in which it wallows. This is not entirely a bad thing, but despite the numerous glowing reviews here on the IMDb and elsewhere, ""28 Weeks Later"" is no ""Aliens"" or ""Terminator 2"" in the pantheon of sequels. It's simply an extension of the original's storyline and style with a bigger budget.<br/><br/>Still, there's much to recommend ""28 Weeks Later"" to the genre aficionado. The acting is top-flight, especially from reliable names like Robert ""The Full Monty"" Carlyle and Catherine ""Braveheart"" McCormack (who is rendered looking much worse for the wear than her normal lovely mid-30s), along with strong work from the likes of Jeremy ""North Country"" Renner, Rose ""Troy"" Byrne, Idris ""The Wire"" Elba, and the preternaturally captivating newcomer Imogen ""V for Vendetta"" Poots. Writer/director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo helms the film with a sure hand, notwithstanding the signature shaky-cam action sequences, although I suspect there were one too many fingers in the scripting pie to deliver a truly outstanding product. Enrique ""Down in the Valley"" Chediak's cinematography carries on the look and feel of Danny Boyle's original nightmare, mostly thanks to Chris ""28 Days Later..."" Gill's at times frenetic editing. The production design, art direction, set decoration, costuming and so on and so forth are all excellent, placing us squarely in a ravaged, depopulated Britain amidst a militarized zone of returnees intent on reclaiming their homeland.<br/><br/>The film's weakness is, as mentioned, the script. It suffers from a number of ""oh, c'mons"" that can't be ignored, some worse than others. How did the abandoned Alice escape the onslaught of Infecteds at the cottage, let alone make it back to London and survive there? Why was security so lax in the Green Zone that Don's swipe card gave him access to his wife? And why oh why wasn't said wife under extremely heavy guard? These problems, and others, took a lot of air out of an otherwise respectable story that contrasts the bonds of family with the inexorable requirements of society. I don't know; perhaps further viewings will give me answers to these questions, allowing me to bump my rating a notch, but meanwhile I can't recommend ""28 Weeks Later"" to anyone other than fans of the first film. It boasts plenty of jump-scares and gory sequences, most notably a gruesome set piece in which a helicopter is used as a giant weed-whacker, but suspension of disbelief is something the audience has to wrestle with just a bit too much to make ""28 Weeks Later"" a stand-out experience."

","OK, lets start out by establishing one thing. The first film was revolutionary for its time. It was tense, well paced, and well made. However, in making this sequel the film makers have managed to truly mangle the soul of a once inspired idea. It is basically a big budget rework. I mean come on, when Scarlett says to Doyle ""These kid's lives are more important than mine or yours"" you know both of them may as well be killed right then and there. Plus the father in the film was not a particularly likable character. Not that this is always a problem, but it is when you are supposed to be rooting for him to succeed. Granted, on it s own merits as a good old fashioned slasher flick, it's not a bad film at all. In fact it's pretty good.

","I went to the cinema to watch this film last Wednesday. I enjoyed 28 days later and as soon as i knew this was released I had to see it. Wow i was not disappointed. I was on the edge of my seat right from the beginning and genuinely terrified too. The zombies (or infected as they are known in both movies) scared the daylights out of me as they could run, and I mean they could run fast. I'm surprised that most of the characters were able to out run them. I mean unless you are Linford Christie, you would be so wasted of energy if you kept running from these things, but eventually they would get you and kill you. I was mostly breathless throughout this movie as it is very intense and i was nearly screaming at the screen ""run for your lives and don't look back"" because i was so involved with this picture. The director did a great job creating an atmosphere that you never felt safe at all and you easily thought that most of the characters were going to run into these things any minute when they thought they were safe. This film didn't drag at all, the action came thick and fast and it was genuinely terrifying. I mean being from London seeing it a complete ghost town made my hairs stand on end. I do love this movie for it's atmosphere and yes there is a good amount of gore to please blood thirsty horror fans, but it also carries a message and that stands out a mile. If you don't see it then there must be something wrong with you. 28 Weeks Later is basically a British version of Dawn of the Dead (remake) and my opinion is it's much better. RULE BRITAINNIA!!!"
"zs01-1","6","3","6","14 May 2007"," Worthy of a matinée - feel free to leave after the infection reappears
","The scene where the infection hits the camp is the border point at which this movie goes from great, to blah. Robert Carlyle is amazing - as he generally is - and his character is the most interesting part of this film from the beginning to that aforementioned border. What was so enthralling about the first movie was that all the characters hooked you in some way - so much so that you were able to suspend your disbelief about certain plot points that were far-fetched (really - I'm sure a squad of soldiers could go longer than a month without sex before resorting to raping teenagers to repopulate the world - but it made for a great story) After the infection hits in the sequel, the 2 D stock characters which seem to have been harvested from the numerous other ""us against THEM"" films just aren't that interesting - and forced to watch them - the plot holes loom ever larger and larger. I never bought the sniper character's motivation - killing his comrade was pretty easy decision for him (though he himself did die most beautifully). I never bought the helicopter with unlimited fuel - or the family-man pilot who risks it all not even knowing why the two kids are so important. The hot, young medical examiner (who's driving skills are miraculously able to out maneuver an attack helicopter) who found the cure to the plague of the 21st century was cliché in so many ways. And Robert Carlyle - his performance was so much more appealing before he became all Friday the 13th Jason on us, and kept coming back. The token loser coward who we all knew was gonna do something stupid - etc... etc. if there is a sequel - I hope it is handled better."
"gihrenzabi","9","3","6","9 May 2007"," Excellent zombie film - spoilers abound below
","FINAL WARNING: SPOILERS GALORE! I am actually giving this a wicked high rating because I think it is one of the best zombie movies I have ever seen. The rage virus is so potent and spreads so quickly that coupled with the outright violence we're subject to at the beginning of the movie we have the creepiest premise since the original Night of the Living Dead, I think.<br/><br/>28 Days Later was very good, but after a fashion I think that ""Weeks"" did more with the basic premise. One of my chief complaints with ""Days"" was that the Infected are hardly in the movie, and didn't seem as much of a threat. Jim gets chased by some who we only see from a distance, Tom kills two, one pops its head up to the cab window in the tunnel, the ones shot down outside the house are at a distance, and the scene where Jones gets loose was scary, but not the same as hordes of the Infected running at you.<br/><br/>I wish that fewer hand-held cameras were used during the attack scenes in ""Weeks,"" but you got the idea.<br/><br/>I didn't care for the ending too much, as it felt a little obvious, but I also think that the idea of the Infected making it to the mainland is also so quintessential a question that I like the idea of forcing the next film, if there is one, to pick it up. Would humanity be able to get their collective act together to deal with the threat, a la World War Z, or would it be all over with, a la Romero? I like the idea of setting up Robert Carlysle's anger at leaving his wife as a pretense to why he is so particularly angry and wanting to kill his kids. I can almost accept that he follows them throughout the film. The suggestion that the rage virus doesn't make you 100% of an automaton is interesting.<br/><br/>The political undertones of the film are heavy. The Americans got the clean-up job - and they screwed it up royal. Certain questions come to mind that other reviewers have pointed out as criticisms and plot holes, but which I find myself considering have been placed there very specifically. Why are the Americans repatriating anyone before the clean-up is finished? Wouldn't a thorough search have prevented another outbreak? The line ""We are responsible for your safety..."" is so potent a reminder later on when all heck breaks loose.<br/><br/>All in all, I will go to sleep kind of scared tonight, as the Infected and the infection are completely terrifying when you are actually watching an outbreak. The final frames of the film therefore set up a truly incomprehensibly-terrifying premise, and it makes me want to see more.<br/><br/>I hope it happens. 28 Months Later could be an interesting film, if they turn it around quickly enough."
"emailmaggie","9","5","13","6 June 2007"," Absolutely LOVED IT
","Other than some minor plot holes and parts that could've been better brought out in the plot, I figure this zombie (or infected-people, take your pick) movie is amongst the horror movie epics of all times. It's not scary in a sense that you have to cover your eyes for a particular scene, it is gory, bloody and most of all thought-provoking that keeps you on your toes the whole time, or perhaps even after the movie. It kept me thinking the whole time after I came out of the theater and I kept thinking about the hopelessness portrayed in the movie. The symbolism of the real world of people hurting/backstabbing/destroying people is so strong. You can see how this relates to your own life, that's where the movie ""infects"" you the most."

","Although this film isn't too similar to ""28 Days Later...,"" it is a quality piece of movie-making. The editing is insanely fast, the gore is in-your-face, and the action is phenomenal, albeit over-the-top. If you are a fan of zombie flicks or relentless action, check this out now. Be prepared for plenty of gross out moments and blood letting. <br/><br/>Also, if you pay close attention and get a little creative, you can find a political subtext to the film, much like the first installment.<br/><br/>Yes, the acting is mediocre. Yes, there are plenty of scenes that are illogical or just downright impossible, but that doesn't really matter when zombies are attacking from all directions and people are being devoured and torn limb from limb. This is a must-see for fans of the genre. <br/><br/>The lack of character development is a valid criticism, but, frankly, any more of that would have bored me. I appreciated the ""cutting to the chase,"" over and over again...<br/><br/>One complaint I had was a couple shoddy CGI shots that were blatantly unrealistic.

","Not a bad sequel in many respects. At least it opens out the story more, where the original sadly abandoned the global consequences for a chase around a small stately home. It's fast moving and generally well done film but I have a message for the director - I own a camera tripod. It cost about £20 and it stops my photos being blurred and jerky. If he would like to buy it from me to use in his next film, I can be contacted 24/7 ( I may increase the price a tad - sorry mate ). In future, audiences can then avoid having to sit through endless minutes of fast-cut jerky mayhem where you have no clue what is happening and to whom. It may add to the atmosphere and action in short bursts, as in the first film, but flogging it for too long just makes the viewer nauseous and you lose track of the story. That aside, a pretty good effort all round. Remember mate, tripod £45, no offers. OK?"
"rogerdob","1","6","17","12 May 2007"," Shaking the camera is not directing!
","The direction of the movie is extremely pretentious. Most of it is extremely quick cutting (less than a second per cut sometimes) and much of the rest is a camera shaking. Lots of closeups also (what a cliché it is to show only an extreme closeup of an eye with a tear coming out of it!) None of the characters were likable. The two kids were whiny and self-centered. The wife, who was left behind by her husband, was also selfish when she wanted her husband to save her and a strange kid in a situation where they all would have died. Couples who love each other would demand the other get out and away if the situation seemed hopeless. Overall, not a well-thought out movie."

This is not comparable to 28 Days Later. First off, there is one major difference between the two. They have different directors. If you bought your ticket, expecting to have payed for an unexplained zombie movie, then you will be sorely disappointed, considering it's a perfectly explainable, and real, disease.. just not amplified to that magnitude in real life.<br/><br/>All of these so called ""plot holes"" that everyone has pointed out are actually explained quite well in the movie.. you just have to remember small details from the first, and pay attention to the second.<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8/10, I didn't walk into this movie expecting it to be this good, and in a way, it isn't comparable to 28 Days Later in the least.

"gitanes007","10","4","10","4 September 2007"," Sense of realism creates genuine horror
","There are legions of zombie movies out there as there are legions of gory movies. We've seen 'em all and we've seen it all. What sets 28 Weeks Later apart, what makes it unique is that its story is in the realm of reality. Viruses mutate in nature, viruses are tampered with in military labs. It's not so much of a far fetched scenario that a genetically designed virus somehow slips its confines and gets out of control, effecting a major break-out. And 28 Weeks Later takes this proposition the viewer easily accepts as being plausible even further with its quasi realistic visual style. You'll see a lot of hand camera work here, and virtually no over-the-top, larger-than-live visuals your usual Hollywood action-horror movie indulges in. On top of it you've got characters not much different from the guy next door. There are no heroes nor villains. No fancy or pathetic wise-cracking, gung-ho dialogues or one-liners. There are simply ordinary characters in extraordinary situations. There are those who have to kill and those who are targeted to be killed. And in your ordinary thrill ride movie the first are the bad guys and the latter are the good guys. But 28 Weeks Later not only blurs the line between good and bad, it actually states that there isn't a thing called good or bad. There are only choices to be made, and each character is trying to make the right choice. And as it is in real life, what is the right choice for you might be a bad choice for the guy next to you. There are those who want to contain the virus no matter what, and you don't blame them given the body count the virus has caused. And there are those who want to flee the potential infection no matter what, and you don't blame them either. What motivates and also justifies the actions of both parties is their legitimate will to survive - the strongest force of human nature. Each character started out to act with the best of intentions causing the worst of outcomes in the effect. As they say: the road to hell is paved with good intentions.<br/><br/>And this unique quality of this movie is maybe its only downside. You go to the movies you want to get entertained, thrilled, excited, aroused. And even a movie like for instance Dawn of the Dead will deliver these demands - because you figure it is fiction. But 28 Weeks Later's realistic approach puts fiction out of the equation. It is this sense of realism that creates genuine horror and dismisses you crestfallen: You know you just saw a great movie, but it totally ruined your day."
"aeo","1","4","10","20 May 2007"," Not a good movie.
","I remember how I was really entertained when I saw 28 Days Later. I mean, zombies that run like an Olympic sprinter was simply genius! I have to admit though that the last half of that movie was not that good but the running zombies made the defect seemed minor.<br/><br/>When I found out that there was going to be a sequel, I was waiting in anticipation of it. Unfortunately, I should have just waited for it to come out on DVD because the movie sucked. This time, the novelty of running zombies could no longer hide the poor story line.<br/><br/>In 28 Weeks Later, the movie begins with British Isle still in the beginning stage of running zombies. In a countryside, you have a group of people that is barricaded in a house. They are being quiet so that they don't attract the attention of the zombies. One day, they hear a knocking on the door and it is a boy who is asking for help. They are hesitant at first but decide to open the door. They do but this attracts the zombies and they crash in and do what zombies do. In that group is a husband and wife. They are trying to escape but gets split up. The zombies will soon reach the wife and the kid. The husband wants to rescue them but fear grips him and decides to escape alone. The wife cries out for help but he keeps running and he escapes.<br/><br/>Fast forward and over a month later, all the zombies die from starvation. The NATO led by the US, lead to assess the situation and then decides to repopulate the British Isle 28 weeks later.<br/><br/>They bring in all those British expatriates back to England. In London, they have a ""green zone"" where it is safe and there are plenty of US soldiers guarding it. Many of the soldiers are trying to bag up the dead bodies in order to burn it but there are too many and bodies are piling up on the side of the streets.<br/><br/>Of the 15 thousand British expatriates are two teenagers, a boy and a girl. They are the children of the husband who ran away. They meet with the father and are happy but sad since their mother died. The father lies to the children how their mother died because he is too ashamed.<br/><br/>The children later go to their old house and finds their mother in the house alive. The US soldier picks them up and examines the wife. She is found to be clean and not a zombie. The reason for this is that she has a genetic mutation that stops her from becoming a zombie. Her children also has the genetic mutation. The scientist discover that she is a carrier of the zombie virus even though she is immune to the virus.<br/><br/>Before the scientist can decide what to do with her, the husband sees the wife and kisses her. She bites him on the tongue and instantly he becomes a zombie and kills her. Then he goes and starts making zombies and they in turn make zombies. Soon they are overrun with zombies. Some survivors try to escape and blow up the whole area. But some of the zombies escaped and went onto the continent of Europe, specifically France. So I guess this means there is going to be another one. I guess the next one is going to be 28 Months Later.<br/><br/>My first problem with this movie is the repatriation after 28 weeks later. That does not make sense. Why would the authorities approve repatriation without knowing if the virus had truly been wiped out? I understand the story writers had to think of something but they had several years to think of a good plot. Is this the best they could do?! Also, I don't know about any of you but if my country just have been wiped out because of zombies, I would want to know what the hell happened and is there a cure for it before I go back. In the movies, you see all these expatriates just excited about going back home like it is some Woodstock fest.<br/><br/>My second problem with the movie is that you have sole survivor of a zombie attack. I mean no one had survived except her and also she is found to be a carrier of the virus. Hello! You put guards around that woman like the kind that guards Fort Knox. But in the movie, there is one or two guards at most. That does not make sense.<br/><br/>I mean, the movie tries to make the military in the movie like they are some bumbling idiot. Give me a break. If this is going to be comedic zombie movie then fine, but if it is going to be a serious horror movie, then use realistic story line. I could go on and tell you others but this is enough. You get the picture."

"andydreamseeker","9","4","10","13 May 2007"," Movie Review: 28 Weeks Later
","Bloody good. 28 Weeks Later that is. The film is so much more than what can be interpreted from the trailer. This sequel to the 2003 surprise hit British film proves to be an even bigger surprise, right from the first minute.<br/><br/>In a candle-lit kitchen, a woman prepares tomato sauce pasta. Her husband takes a bottle of red from the shelves. Their faces revealed worry and distraught. The camera now moves to the dining table. An old couple sits there. There's another man. And there was also a younger woman. She's handed a plate of pasta. She places it on the table space beside her. The man becomes agitated. He advises her that her boyfriend has been missing for days and will not be back. She disagrees. He gets more agitated. He tells her off saying that if her boyfriend ever returns, it would be her blood he's interested in and not the pasta. She starts to cry. The soft silence suddenly breaks. There's knocking at the door. A boy is shouting for help. He wants to come into the house. Everyone starts panicking. To open the door or not?<br/><br/>The man decided to open the door. A boy rushed in. The woman hugs him. Where's he from? From a town nearby he says and he's being chased. How many?<br/><br/>The anxious younger woman looks out of the house through a gap. Bham! Something grabs her. Zombies break in. Everyone starts running. It's a game of tag. One by one they're tagged. The horror. The last of them is the woman, Alice (Catherine McCormack), and the man, Don (Robert Carlyle). They're cornered in a room at the top floor of the house. He can't save her, he's terrified, and through a window he breaks out of the house and runs. Music plays, the familiar tune from 28 Days Later, the tune of hopelessness and despair. He looks back and she's watching from behind a window. He looks around; he's being chased by dozens of bloodthirsty zombies. He keeps running toward a river. He found a motorboat. He escapes.<br/><br/>What a start to this movie I thought. A thrilling entrance accomplished by a change of pace.<br/><br/>This is the sequel to 28 Days Later. The last of the zombies have died from starvation in 28 Weeks Later. Aerial shots of London showed a deserted city. The country is now being reconstructed and an enclosed area under the protection of the military, known as District-1 is ready for re-inhabitation. In comes the new residents and among them is a pair of siblings, Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton). They are the children of Don, the man who escaped earlier in the film. He's now one of the in-charge of District-1 with a triple A, Access-All-Area pass. Snipers guard District-1 from rooftops, they complain of nothing to shoot at and spend their nights surveying the privacy of the residents through their riflescope. One of them is Doyle (Jeremy Renner).<br/><br/>Don recaps the story of his escape to Tammy and Andy. He tells them they are not ever going back to their house. He tells them their mum died there, the day of his escape.<br/><br/>District-1 is the first of a program to re-populate the country and it is under the supervision of the military, headed by General Stone (Idris Elba). Aiding the program is Doctor Scarlet (Rose Byrne), who makes sure of the quarantine at District-1.<br/><br/>All is well until one day when the children, Tammy and Andy, who misses their mother, sneaked out of District-1 to return to their house for a photo of mum. There they discovered an infected but not zombified mum, Alice. As the military caught up with them, they too brought Alice back to District-1 where she's quarantined.<br/><br/>Alice could be a valuable asset, she seems to be immune to the Rage virus. As Stone and Scarlet discusses the fate of Alice, Don by himself went to see her. They kissed. He's infected. Can you guess the rest?<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later is better than 28 Days Later in many aspects. It's also a sci-fi, horror, thriller that is outstandingly produced. What is apparent in the film is its military element. It is a dimension that gave the story its shine.<br/><br/>Much credit has to be given out. Producers, director, cinematographer, editors The entire crew and creative team have done an excellent job with this film. This is not a brainless free-for-all flick that makes entertainment out of blood spilling angry zombies attacking bewildered screaming humans. There are lots of details painstakingly thought up and molded together for this film. The audience are well lead by the camera, which catches plenty of details and mood. From the plot, sub-plots, scenes, dialogues and cinematography, everything is top notch. It is a pleasure to watch even though I really should not encourage violent and killings. But a movie of violent and killing it really is not, at least not excessively, scenes of such is used only when emphasis is stressed.<br/><br/>It is more so the underlying meaning of the story and the thoughtfulness of movie-making that are compelling. Seldom is there a genre of this kind made this way.<br/><br/>The film is enjoyable but not to be taken for granted as just entertainment. There are no big stars here but it is for the better so as not to take the shine of its presence. You'll get the scares here and there and will definitely feel the pace when the characters start running. What is most notably well done is how director, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo uses silence and pauses along with darkness and camera shakes to depict some scenes.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later really is bloody good and I meant that in an expressive way, just as the film is."
"poojucu","7","4","10","11 May 2007"," Roller-coaster ride, that follows a fantastic opening scene.
","I was incredibly skeptical before seeing 28 weeks later, the main reason being that a new, relatively unknown director was taking over Danny Boyle's spot. However literally in the first ten minuets I knew that I was in for a roller-coaster ride.<br/><br/>28 weeks later is set several months after the original outbreak of the Rage Virus in London. The Americans have stepped in, and the reconstruction of the once flourishing city is already underway. The citizens now live in designated areas, and are forbidden to cross the river over into more, less protected parts of the city. However when a teenage girl and her younger brother Tammy(Poots)and Andy(Muggleton) return to the city to live with their dad (Robert Carlyle), they decide to break the rules and venture out of bounds in order to find their house.<br/><br/>The children not only find their house but also their mother who was assumed dead in the brilliant scene at the beginning of the film. So after this occurrence the mother is found actually to be infected with the virus, and so within the space of an hour another army of rage infected citizens are rampaging throughout the city.<br/><br/>For me, the greatest scene in this whole movie was at the beginning. This shown shows a group of men and women who have been in hiding since the previous outbreak. Things are going well for them, they have food, company and all the time in the world. However when they suddenly get ambushed by the infected the scene turns to chaos so quickly its incredible. Suddenly they are all trying to fight for survival, nearly all of them run, except for Don ( Carlyle) who attempts to fight. What made this scene so fantastic was the heart wrenching choices each character is forced to make while in the face of imminent death. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did a brilliant job of making these decisions seem so real, and so difficult to make because of the sheere severity of the situation. Afterwards when Carlyle gets on a boat and flees, you hold so much sympathy for the poor guy that you just wish the movie would end there, just so he doesn't have to go through anything more.<br/><br/>After this scene, and the action has begun once again their is very little room for character development, however all the performances in 28 weeks later ( especially Carlye) are very good.<br/><br/>The reason behind the not so great mark I gave for this movie was solely because of the predictability of the main storyline, and also because of some major plot holes connecting with the American forces in London. However in the end, 28 weeks later is an ambitous attempt at a sequel, with a very powerful opening scene."

","When you read the summary of this movie's storyline, the last thing you expect is a movie that is amazingly gripping, and makes you realize just how fragile people are.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes displaying sacrifices and choices sticks in your mind for days. It's a movie you won't forget very soon.<br/><br/>The movie, unlike the typical zombie-movies, contains no humor whatsoever; it is raw and violent, and the dark mood stays throughout the movie. The music of John Murphy, from ""28 days later"" intensifies the chasing scenes, much like the music in ""The Rock"" did. When you are left with the feeling that a so-called zombie-film seems real, it has to be done perfectly. They have made it as real as it can be. The streets of London looks eerily deserted. In a time of chemical warfare and viruses this should leave us thinking.<br/><br/>This isn't a regular zombie-film. There are a lot of scenes which relates more to classic suspense movies, especially the night vision scene is creepy.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent, especially the young boy convinces. And of course Robert Carlyle. The movie gets more personal than the first one, when we follow the two young siblings. You really want them to survive. The mistake many filmmakers do is to follow a whole group, where the survival of each one is not important to you. But not here.<br/><br/>Creepy, tense, gripping... Just superb!

But against everything I believe in I watched it.<br/><br/>The beginning was great, I was very impressed but feared it wouldn't last, and it would be just an intro to tie in the old movie with this American version.<br/><br/>After a while, when I realised the intro I was enjoying - that had totally stolen my attention - was in fact the movie, I didn't know how to feel, I had been thinking how bad it would be for years and now sitting here enjoying it, and not just enjoying a cheesy Hollywood version of the original, but an amazing sequel that felt extremely like the first movie.<br/><br/>What is great about this movie, is it's almost as though they knew I was going into this movie with certain preconceived ideas of how this movie would be, so they basically give you nothing like you expect, totally immersing you and causing you to feel that the original movie was part 1 of this movie. Then they give you a slice of American cheesiness, causing you to suddenly remember and worry that it might go downhill. But then they turn everything upside down and dazzle you until the end.<br/><br/>I totally recommend this movie, without a doubt, and I even encourage you to watch it with fear and expectation of it being another lame Hollywood wannabe, because that's how I felt, and it worked for me."
"without_eyelids","2","3","7","20 July 2007"," If you know better...
","... then you should do better.<br/><br/>I'm hesitant to speculate on the motivations of foreign filmmakers who had a hand in making this film, but it won't escape me how puerile this film is. With all the foreign criticism towards the Iraq War lobbed safely from the sidelines by non-Americans, one can't help but think that 28 Weeks Later is a manifestation of those pretentious, drearily imagined apocalypses in which the evil military reigns supreme.<br/><br/>I'll get right to the point. 28 Weeks Later fails simply because it is implausible and stupid. I hate to be a stickler for realism, but one ought to know better... It's not coincidental that this film has been lambasted for being unrealistic, stupid, brazenly off-target with its pejorative presentation of the military (28 Weeks indicts the concept of the military, in my opinion, rather than the US military in particular).<br/><br/>I don't have the energy to spoil this film, but as you're watching it, try to think of what you might do in their shoes, regardless of your military experience. Would you allow zombie virus carriers to be unguarded, would you allow soldiers to sleep alone without someone standing guard, would you allow ANYONE unsupervised access to sensitive areas which he has no purpose going to...<br/><br/>There's a lot of gotcha moments which make no sense at all and a lot of fast cut/editing. And lots of gore. It's pointless. Many zombie films before this have been great, including the last installment.<br/><br/>This is little more than an excuse to infect the entire world with a zombie virus and then kill off 6 totally unlikeable characters (Except for perhaps the Delta sniper, who plays his part well) to set up 28 Months Later. If this one is any indication, that one is going to suck too."

","Let me start off by addressing all you losers who always complain about the ""Logic"" factor in movies. Like always ,I say stay home and don't go to the theaters. Movies are meant to be fun ,not logical. Besides how much can the poor movie get to explain in less than two hours?<br/><br/>With that said; this is a worthy competitor to its predecessor. All the original scares are their, The lurky dark scenery and mega fast mindless killing machine zombies. Except in this one there is the ""family unit"" concept. Meaning that right from the start of the movie we are introduced to a couple who within minutes of the film are separated in what has to be one the best fast-paced horror scenes to emerge since the ""Aliens"" scene were all the military are wiped out by the aliens. The scene really hits home, because instead of using the burnt out hero cliché, Robert Carlyle's character does something totally human and leaves his wife behind ,while he flees for his life, chased by 100s of those rage infected crazies. This was totally believable and geared me for a great movie.<br/><br/>After that super adrenalized scene, we are taken 28 weeks later to find out that London is now a vast wasteland filled with infected ,who have died of starvation. Carlyle is reunited with his children and the U.S military(What can't they stick their nose into) has set up a ""Safe Zone"" for Britans few survivors. I found the Military concept in the movie to be strictly for Hollywood purpose. ...and once again they are portrayed as the ""Bad guys"" in the film. Those who've seen ""28 Days Later"" know what I mean. It's laughable, but in one scene the military basically opens fire on all infected, including civilians. The military takes out more civilians then the actual infected do. I guess this was all done to introduce the sole soldier with a conscience...and I mean sole, because in one scene another soldier almost refuses to pick up the other survivors that are accompanying him.<br/><br/>One other highlight of the film is the gore. If you like bloody gory films then you will be happy to see that the MPAA does not get to spoil the fun in this one. My only ""beef"" would be the two scenes shot in the dark. I like dark scary scenes, but this one takes the concept a little to far to a point where you basically find yourself in the dark and not being able to see anything for about 10 Mons. The director uses this same effect later in the subway, but not even that can spoil a really good sequel.<br/><br/>My final words are to look out for Robert Carlyle's ""Zombie"". He not only gets into every military access building, but always finds a way to get to his family. ..and has the last laugh at his wife. Payback is a B**CH!"

","Let me tell you i was the worlds biggest skeptic of this movie. From the looks of the trailer I wanted to throw up. The sirens,lighting,fire all looked cheaply done. Boy was I wrong. I went into the theater thinking the zombie horror genre was dead, I left thinking it just evolved. From start to finish the carnage did not stop, unlike other movies it spared no one. It showed humans as they would react in this type of situation. People leaving loved ones to be killed and the army purposely killing innocents just because of a chance of a outbreak. This is a zombie film at its best, bravo 28 weeks later, bravo! This movie surpassed 28 days later and took the ideas and made them better."
"lahlahsr","5","3","7","3 June 2007"," Either the plot-writer is an idiot - or thinks that everyone else is.
","Conventional wisdom suggests that the key to happiness is to expect nothing. As such I wasn't too devastated because I expected that the makers of this movie/story - just like every single other movie in the zombie-genre - would treat viewers like they are morons.<br/><br/>And so it happens yet again.<br/><br/>A teen and a preteen manage to sneak out of a zone that is secured by the US military. Just stop and think about it for a minute. Imagine that the vast majority of London's population had turned into zombies (for chrissakes zombies!!) and the US military (any military for that matter) was guarding against re-infection of the zone....let's just say that a couple of dumb kids wouldn't be able to ""sneak"" out in broad daylight.<br/><br/>Let's then examine why. These two moronic children run into what is conceivably a zombie-populated zone alone, for the sole purpose of grabbing a photo of their dead mom. In a soap-opera that might be ""cute"" - but for people in the real world that is utterly unbelievable. And what makes it worse - these two punk kids are portrayed as the ""heroes"" in this movie - even though they are the sole reason for thousands of horrible deaths that follow in the wake of their excursion.<br/><br/>Then there is the matter of leaving the recovering mother unattended in a dark remote room utterly alone!! In spite of the fact that the chief military disease-vector specialist suspects that she is ""special"" somehow.<br/><br/>On top of this we find the utterly ineffectual measures taken against another outbreak. There are tons and tons and tons of heavily armed soldiers manning even heavy machineguns, snipers and whatnot - a setup specifically designed to manage another outbreak.<br/><br/>Why must the horror always be unleashed and perpetuated by something that appears to stupid and unbelievable? The movie makes a strong attempt to make us like and empathize with the people - and you can't help yourself wondering if the world isn't better off with them turned into a tasty zombie-snack...<br/><br/>Returning to my initial thoughts on expectation management - too many horror movies are like that and within the confines of these self-imposed limitations to storytelling (using idiocy to create the premise of the movie) it wasn't at all bad. Some good acting and effects - albeit with the ever-present hand-held camera-work that only serves to accomplish one thing: annoy and give you a headache.<br/><br/>Cheers :-)"
"siege223","2","3","7","25 May 2007"," Big disappointment
","The only reason why I give this movie 2 stars is because I was able to sit through it from beginning to end. That's about the only good thing I can say about it. The first annoyance was the camera angles and shakiness of them. I know that's supposed to contribute to the atmosphere and make the movie more intense, but it was just done better in the first movie. In 28 Weeks, the cameramen just got carried away with that. The second annoyance was the entire plot. There was a much more logical way to have the virus spread again than what they came up with. And one non-zombie in particular keeps showing up all over town. That makes NO sense. The movie was too focused on blood and gore and crazy camera angles, and not enough on little things like plot, continuity, logic, and character development. The more I write about it, the more I think 2 stars was too generous a rating. The first movie was WAY better."
"boredstiff","2","3","7","19 May 2007"," A total waste of time.
","The first movie, (28 days I think - but I am not certain) was pretty good. The current sequel is truly uninspired. What passes for a plot is almost non-existent. Of course you know that the vampires are coming. Afterwards, it is like ""so what"". As for tension, you get to jump a couple of times, but after that you mostly want something to happen worth watching.<br/><br/>To enjoy a horror flick you've got to either bond with the good guys or the bad guys. In this movie you really don't care about either one of them. When the movie ends you mostly think to yourself ""what happened?."" The answer comes to you pretty quickly. Nothing."
"space_base","10","3","7","17 May 2007"," A Superb Sequel
","28 Weeks Later is one of the best worst-case-scenario films. While it doesn't surpass the first film, it more than lives up to every expectation set by 28 Day Later and is a great sequel.<br/><br/>The second installment of what is all but a confirmed trilogy takes place six months after all of the infected from the first movie have starved and died again. American forces have moved in and are now attempting to rebuild and repopulate England starting at the Isle of Dogs in London. Amongst the civilians now living in complete safety and quarantine is a man named Don, who fled a refuge under attack 28 weeks prior where he lost his wife and was the only survivor, or so he thought.<br/><br/>Don's children, teenage Tammy and twelve-year-old Andy, come to live with Don in the quarantine some time later. The mischievous kids finding it difficult to live in their new surroundings break out of quarantine and attempt to find solace in their old home, and it's there that they find their mother; alive, infected, but not symptomatic.<br/><br/>And from that point on, the movie snowballs into the usual catastrophic, apocalyptic, epidemic scenario film. Sort of predictable, but enjoyable none-the-less (and it's the very formula that always has people coming back for more). The biggest difference of all with 28 Weeks Later is that this film is actually good. It's atmospheric and frightening. There is a fair bit of gore, but it never gets lost in its own indulgences. The film is well acted, well produced, and well worth it. When this film gets moving, it's one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>The only problem with 28 Weeks Later is that there are far too many clichés surrounding a survival horror movie that it's hard not to get bogged down in at least a few. There's the rag-tag group of survivors, the rogue military escort, the looming presence of a hidden evil enterprise, the ""why in the hell would you do that??"" situations, and many more that it's a futile attempt to encompass them all. Thankfully, 28 Weeks Later does enough of them right that it's hard to stay mad at it for too long.<br/><br/>Survival horror movies are unique in the sense that no other film genre has as many clichés to avoid and/or reinvent, and there are an astronomical number of ways to muck it all up. That said, 28 Weeks Later navigates through the pits of plot holes and stupidity well enough that it manages to become stylish, frightening, and above all else enjoyable. 28 Weeks Later is essentially the blue print for all survivor horror movies to come for the next decade, and makes me wonder where the hell Danny Boyle was six years ago when Resident Evil was in production. While not quite perfect, it really doesn't need to be.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm just happy knowing that the end didn't involve blowing up a giant mutated something or other with a rocket launcher with only three minutes left before the mansion/facility/island blows up. (If you've played and Resident Evil game, you know what I mean).<br/><br/>4/5"
"chinchiliman","8","3","7","15 May 2007"," From Skeptic to Fan
","When I first heard about a sequel to 28 Days Later, my first thought was ""Oh boy. Here comes a mess"". Then I heard that Robert Carlyle was in it and he is usually pretty picky when it comes to scripts. So I thought it had a chance. The previews looked pretty good, so I figured I'd take a chance. If you get the chance to see 28 Weeks Later, see it. As far as sequels go, it's surprisingly good. Carlisle is quite good as always, but I was surprised at the quality of acting from those around him. The kids in this movie are great, especially Imogen Poots who eats up the camera. While the attack sequences felt a little choppy, the script, the cinematography, and the story more than made up for it. The possibility for a sequel is there, and if treated like this one was, would be worth a watch as well. But a tip of the cap to everyone involved with this one. Nicely done. You impressed a skeptic."
"baconballs1969","7","3","7","15 May 2007"," Much Better Than The First Film
","I saw this last Friday on release day. I was very disappointed with the first film but thought I would give this a look mainly because Robert Carlisle was in it.<br/><br/>In every single way this film was much better than that pile of rubbish 28 Days Later - and I enjoyed it very, very much.<br/><br/>I was scared all the way through it and the action started just moments into the film and never let up until the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Carlisle was excellent as the father of the family that was the main focus of the film and took his part very well. His transition after being infected by The Rage was both violent and very shocking, especially with what he did to his wife straight after the transition was complete - it was gruesome and had me looking away from the screen in terror.<br/><br/>What sets this movie apart from other zombie flicks is the speed the zombies move - instead of plodding laboriously along at a snail-pace, these babies could really shift at break-neck speed.<br/><br/>Sometimes the attacks happened so quickly that it was difficult to see clearly what was happening - the camera seemed to be unable to keep up with the speed of the action but I suppose it was filmed in this way just to demonstrate how fast and ultra-violent these deadies really were.<br/><br/>The twist at the end of the movie has left it wide-open for a third instalment - more than likely to be called ""28 Months Later"" I expect! No matter what your thoughts were about the first movie, if you are a horror fan I am sure you will not be disappointed with this movie. I am not a horror fan but still enjoyed this very much - well worth the entrance fee.<br/><br/>I will definitely be purchasing it when it is released on DVD.<br/><br/>Great Gory Fun!"
"jakasper1","9","3","7","14 May 2007"," Bloody and well done!
","I saw the first movie and I have to say that this is just as good, and maybe got me jumping in my seat more than the first one did.<br/><br/>The first 10 minutes or so of the film set the tone for me. Those first few minutes are among the most intense I have encountered in a horror film.<br/><br/>I used to work for a special make-up effects man in L.A., and I also worked in the industry for others, and I'm a movie fan. I also like horror and suspense films. There is gore in this film, but with the quick cuts and flashes, and the way it was edited, you see only bits and pieces (pardon the pun!) Also, the director Fresnadillo may have had a limited budget, so not showing everything in shocking detail, in slow-mo, was a way of saving money. The gore made its point, but it wasn't over-the-top. Except maybe for the helicopter scene...lol Loved the characters. You actually care about them. Makes you think about what you would do in a similar situation. Would you save yourself first? Or help others and sacrifice yourself? Robert Carlyle is a gem of an actor, and he does a great job in this one. Also, the actor who was a military rooftop sniper who accompanies the children later in the movie was great as well. The background music in the movie really packed a punch and was very effective.<br/><br/>Good movie, very suspenseful, and almost outdid the original."
"dee.reid","10","3","7","14 May 2007"," Rage strikes back
","OK, so yeah, do you want to talk about a scary-a** fright flick? As an American, I'm beginning to pay more attention to British horror. We've seen it plenty of times within the last seven years. Anything fresh off the boat from our closest European allies, people here eat it up. We saw it with ""The Descent"" (2005), ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), ""28 Days Later..."" (2002), and its sequel ""28 Weeks Later"" (2007).<br/><br/>British director Danny Boyle (of 1996's ""Trainspotting"") and screenwriter Alex Garland were behind ""28 Days Later..."" where radical animal-rights activists broke into a laboratory and freed monkeys that were infected with the experimental ""rage virus."" If you remember from that film, you remember that the rage virus only takes 30 seconds to infect (critic Roger Ebert noted that a virus that only takes seconds to infect will not make an efficient survivor in the long run because the host population will soon be dead - as will too, the virus, at least according to Darwinian evolution) and once infected, the ""infected"" person becomes a wild, salivating homicidal maniac. The virus completely decimated the British Isles, leaving them to be shut down, quarantined, and we were left to ponder the fates of that film's only survivors.<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"" only leaves that up to our imaginations...<br/><br/>Anyway, 28 Weeks Later after the initial infection, the initial infected have begun to slowly die of starvation. American NATO forces move in to remove the deceased infected, eliminate any surviving infected, look for human survivors, and begin reconstruction. In the film's opening moments we're introduced to a handful survivors who are eventually wiped out, leaving only one to escape the carnage, Don (Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" alumni Robert Carlyle).<br/><br/>Don makes it to a military checkpoint, where he is reunited with his two children Andy (Macintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots) and they attempt to start over along with a thousand others in the ""Green Zone"" (sound familiar? Plenty of other terms abound, such as ""Code Red,"" ""Extreme prejudice,"" among others), a U.S. military-controlled section of London with scanning cameras and rooftop snipers. Well, as you know, the calm before the storm passes and the rage virus strikes back with a wicked vengeance, and mass chaos begins once again.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find ""28 Weeks Later"" working from the very first opening scene. The film opens with a bloody bang, with the maddening infected banging down doors, chewing on flesh, and massacring any living thing they come into contact with. ""28 Weeks Later"" builds on the militaristic paranoia of modern times to present us with a chaotic scenario that is all too familiar. Down comes society in one fell swoop and everything they worked so hard to achieve is gone. Also, purists will note that the infected ARE NOT zombies. The infected are technically still alive and can be killed as such; they're just... infected, clawing, gouging out eyes, and vomiting bloody innards all over the place.<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"" does something even more incredible. While one can easily find fault with ""28 Weeks Later"" repeating some of the same plot devices of the first film, it quickly becomes a moot point. In the tradition of some movie sequels, this one surpasses its predecessor in many ways, the least of which is sheer terror and chaos. Make no mistake: this is one intense experience that you're not likely to forget anytime soon. And even as events in ""28 Weeks Later"" prove, surviving the madness is not a sure thing any more than most of us are promised tomorrow.<br/><br/>There's a fine cast of brave performers here, the best of which is Robert Carlyle, who doesn't run through the motions of the typical action-horror hero. There are also some fine American performers as well (while American talents were a no-show in the first film). There's Doyle (Jeremy Renner), an American sniper who is forced to abandon his post once the s**t hits the fan, his buddy Flynn (Harold Perrineau) who's a helicopter pilot and then there's also Scarlet (Rose Byrne), a military scientist who makes a startling discovery about the rage virus.<br/><br/>The man behind this production is the Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who obviously watched the first film carefully and saw all the areas needing improvement. He skillfully crafts his picture so that everything goes downhill (in a good way) from the start. His hand-held camera really gets into the terror and gives it a slight documentary feel, thus putting the audience right in the middle of the action. It also gets up close & personal into the furious, crimson-dyed eyes of the infected from time to time. The special effects Fresnadillo chose to employ here are as gruesome as they could possibly get, with many disturbing images, violence, and gore that are surely miles ahead of ""28 Days Later..."" There is one moment where fighters fire-bomb a mass section of the Green Zone after the infected have taken over that is particularly affecting. On a lighter note, the best of these special effects sequences has to be when a helicopter goes blades-first into a wall of oncoming infected and... I don't want to spoil the effect.<br/><br/>In summation, ""28 Weeks Later"" is one horror flick that takes a look at our modern times and ups the fear and paranoia to almost unbearable levels. Anyone who watches the film will surely be startled by the comparisons but as this film's ending also proves, 28 Days Later... you might as well be prepared.<br/><br/>10/10"
"jacbill63wasdc","8","3","7","13 May 2007"," Fast-paced and Frenetic!
","For starters, let's NOT call this a zombie horror film. The reason I make that statement is because, just like in the first film; discerning critics wanted to negatively slam the movie (despite the successful wide appeal it received) because it isn't in the same vein as a George Romero zombie thriller. I'd like to categorize this movie as an ""apocalyptic horror"" genre film. As we saw in the last film ""28 Days Later"", the rage virus contagion seemed to burn itself out and ""The Infected"" began to starve themselves to death ...due to the lack of their sustenance feeding on the ""uninfected"". So being that Britian has been declared free of infection, the American Armed Forces help lend a hand in repopulating the country with surviving refugees. However, despite the precautions taken securing the small populace within the safety-zone; a small remnant of the contagion still exists on the outside. Which where only in a matter of time, the contagion infiltrates the militarized complex and rapidly spreads again among the populace! Some very good tense moments in this film, and it enables the viewers to somehow put themselves in the same shoes as the characters in the movie. The ending was superb, I'm surely positive there will be a sequel called ""28 Months Later""."

But then the action happens, everything is fast paced and the camera doesn't look like the budget was $100.00 At first I was disappointed that it wasn't filmed like 28 Days Later, but as the movie went on I grew to accept that fact because the movie just got incredible. Need I say it? I liked it better than 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>It's very gruesome, and just like the first one, it's people fighting zombies and people fighting the army a little bit.

It was thought-provoking and very disconcerting. 28 Weeks Later, however, pushes the boundaries way too far, to the point where it became revolting and extremely annoying.<br/><br/>Firstly, it was much too loud. I suppose the makers were trying to involve us by giving us a sense of the chaos the characters were enduring, but I really could have done without the headache that was inflicted on me.<br/><br/>The opening scene was bloody and violent, I was thankful when it was over, but my relief didn't last long. It seems every single scene in this movie was designed either to scare the daylights out of us or to revolt us with gore.

","A few weeks ago, I took a few members of my family out to see ""28 Weeks Later"". My mother had never seen the first film (and in fact cannot stand grotesque horror), so I'm not sure exactly how I got her to be there (she walked out after about a half hour anyway). As for my brother and I, we were watching this movie almost directly after viewing the first one for the first time, so we were feeling fresh and ready for the next chapter.<br/><br/>The next chapter... One of the best things I can say about this movie is that it actually does feel as though it could be the next chapter. Unlike some other summer sequels (to name a few - Spiderman 3 and X-Men 3), it does feel as though this is the same universe that Cillian Murphy adventured in twenty-four weeks prior.<br/><br/>That's about the best thing I can give it, though. ""28 Weeks Later"" is, simply put, a gigantic fall down the stairs.<br/><br/>The first scene in the movie is the best, which features a very frightened Don (Robert Carlyle) leaving his wife to die while he runs from zombies that are many enough to populate a small town. It's sad what he does, it's weak, it's cowardly, but it's powerful. What he was doing really got to me, and that's what had me ready for another great zombie film.<br/><br/>Cut to 28 weeks later, and characterization has died out along with the infection. I'm not saying that characters don't exist, but I am saying that they're dull. We've got the annoying 'older sister, younger brother' archetypes, whose character development goes as far as 'they have parents, they care for their parents, if someone mentions their missing or dead parent they go fanatical and someone has to rescue them from zombies.' There's a rebellious US soldier who goes against orders (how cool) and decides not to kill innocents. There's a beautiful lady whose character seems to be, 'get these children to safety and safe the world'. She's the beautiful bombshell who's all business. Hearing these people talk was horrible. If there had been one more scene of heavy dialogue, I would not be able to handle this film.<br/><br/>Even when the dialogue stops it's impossible to handle. The action can hardly be tolerated, either. Danny Boyle was walking on a tightrope when he filmed ""28 Days Later"" in shaky-cam, which in my opinion is a terribly overused technique in modern cinema. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo tries to emulate the style but goes overboard. It is impossible to see what's happening. At one point, while we're all getting sick from trying to make sense of blur-in-motion, the entire screen goes red. Red? As if it weren't difficult enough to watch already! I couldn't wait for fight scenes to end.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film's only about an hour and a half long. In light of all the things it comes short of, that's a good thing. Nonetheless, it still feels as though it's ended before anything really happened (as much as you may be suffering in your seat, this is the real frustration). Sure, the infection spread out once more and Britain is in another state of emergency, but what happens with the characters? Why should I care about the Iraq allegory when that's all there really is to this film? Anybody can construct a simple metaphor that conveys the public consensus. I don't mind that this movie did. But a deep film, which is what it seemed like they were going for, has to be more than that."

Rent the first one and see it again instead, it was far superior, or rent George Romero's original ""Night of the Living Dead"".

","Whilst not having anything original to add to the formula of the predecessor's ""Viral Apocalypse""- other than the militarization and re-population of the financial district of London (Sector 1)- this is still a very worthy, nerve-racking sequel. What follows is a spoiler free review of the film, followed by a clearly marked separate ""SPOILER"" section intended for those who have seen it to ponder over! <br/><br/>Carlyle and McCormick play a husband and wife, Don and Helen, amongst a small group of survivors from the 28 Days later ""Rage"" viral epidemic, and they illicit our sympathy from the start. They talk of their hopes for survival and seeing their children again. You know this hope won't last long-you're your stomach tightens in anticipation. After the briefest of introductions they are cruelly- and almost immediately- separated whilst trying to escape an Infected attack. <br/><br/>Don's ""survivor's guilt"" is compounded by his split-second decision of cowardice-leaving Helen to a fate worse than death, at the hands of the Infected. It is easy to moralise over his ""fight or flight"" decision- but what would YOU REALLY do given the circumstances? Did I understand his actions? Yes! Would I do the same? No! At least I hope not! But<br/><br/>Any initial sympathy for Don evaporates after being reunited with his children. When asked, ""What happened to Mum?"" by his dewy-eyed kids- He lies- covering up any hint of his failure to help his wife. <br/><br/>The well worked re-introduction of Helen, a miraculous survivor of an Infected attack, re-boots the horror factor. Is she simply now a ""Rage"" carrier? Does she have some special immunity that could be used to ""cure"" the infected?<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later reaches into the Horror movie top drawer for Don and Helen's reunion! The brutal ""re-birth"" of the Rage Infection shows the true impunity of the virus, born of their love, compassion and Helen's forgiveness.<br/><br/>What follows is a wonderful assortment of set pieces, without overdone FX, apart perhaps from the gruesome ""Heli-chop-ter"" scene in Regents Park.<br/><br/>The only real weaknesses in the 90-odd minutes are the convenient plot devices put in place to ensure the outbreak of the virus again. (See SPOILERS section below). Can the American Forces really be so incompetent, as to allow the virus to breakout again?! Okay, given what we have seen in recent real history- YES!. Its to the films credit that you can easily ignore these loopholes- the pace and the horrifying situations that develop mean you are sweep along with the experience.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, 28 Days Later, the ""fly on the wall"" filming, again using hand held Digital Video recorders, grounds the movie in reality. The cruelty of the virus is mirrored in the director's vision- anyone of the characters can die and that leaves a real gut wrenching tension building throughout the film.<br/><br/>I DO NOT WANT TO SPOIL YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THIS FILM, SO IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT, PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER! <br/><br/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>The film does suffer from some contrived and convenient plot holes!  Helen's face-to-face encounter with the infected leaves little doubt she will be ravaged and ripped to pieces. She is trapped in the corner of an upstairs bedroom! So how does she escape?  Assuming she did survive her attackers, surely she would have more than a simple bite mark on her arm? After all, her very own ""infected"" husband ends up totally shredding her to pieces!  Carlyle's Don has access to anywhere and everywhere in the supposedly super secure ""Sector 1"". Lets face it, he is a non-American, civilian with a souped-up janitors job- how could he get to see his quarantined wife so easily? Still, glad he did! What a family re-union! ""Relate"" marriage guidance councillor's heads will spin seeing that one!  Infected Don manages to conveniently find and/or follow his children's route of escape. Given the Infected Rage virus sufferers have no real conscious or reasoning thought processes- other than to kill/attack any non-Rage sufferer, it is extremely unlikely he would have tracked them down.  Some internet comments regarding both ""Days"" and ""Weeks"" link the Cillian Murphy Bike courier, to the children finding a moped outside a pizza delivery in Crouch End. They suggest the bike was his. However, Cillian Murphy character was nearly killed in a road traffic accident, so it is likely his bike was smashed up. Also Couriers tend to deliver stuff other than Pizza!<br/><br/>Still, its a terrific horror movie, left conveniently open for another. I knew that Channel Tunnel was a waste of money and a bad idea.............."

","I loved this movie, it was fast paced and filled with action, but not only that, you really feel for all of the characters. I wasn't a huge fan of the first film but the second film really validated it for me. There's some awesome action that includes not only guns and poisonous gas followed by flame throwers but also an air attack and a helicopter tearing a crowd of infected to shreds.And the best part are those sudden flashes of horror when you aren't expecting it,(I jumped a few times). It may be the fact that I'm an American whose served in the US Air Force, but I really loved how they brought the US troops into Britian to help maintaine order. You are so unaware of any distinction between the two cultures because you're so focused on the human factors, no one wants to die no matter where you're from.I see a lot of movies and I'm usually a skeptic, but I found myself really loving this film. I saw it twice today!"

","28 Weeks Later is a solid follow up to the both critically acclaimed and popular, 28 Days Later. I have to admit that I'm not very fond of the zombie genre, having felt I've seen just about everything they have to offer to the point where it's all quite similar in a sense, but 28 Weeks Later thankfully had a few surprises. The sad part is the movie gets progressively worse as the minutes roll by, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. <br/><br/>The opening scene is great, a nice, calm setting is turned upside down on a moments notice by the most ferocious and aggressive zombies ever shown on film. Of course this can't be stated enough, the zombies in this series are by far the worst kind you could go up against; insanely fast, smart, and driven not by hunger, but by pure rage. This is probably the most appealing aspect of the series, even in small numbers they are a force to be reckoned with! But once you get past the great opening and set up, you are left with another run of the mill zombie survival movie where the characters are just traveling the apocalyptic roads with no real end in sight. It then concludes in a near pitch black tunnel, which makes no sense to me why they would choose to have the climax shot like that, nothing but disappointment there. <br/><br/>But when comparing the two movies in the series, it's obvious the original film is the better of the two, it's well written and dark, aided by its political and social commentary. 28 Weeks Later on the other hand is more of your average, action heavy, gruesome killing sequel with a higher kill count and larger budget."
"bowmanblue","9","2","4","5 October 2014"," A rare sequel that works
","Whether you like the follow-up to cult horror hit, '28 Days Later' will depend on whether you prefer 'Alien' to 'Aliens.' Producer, Danny Boyle, said that '28 Weeks Later' is to '28 Days Later' what 'Aliens' is to 'Alien.' And, I can't think of any way to sum it up better.<br/><br/>28 Days Later, as it told the story of a plague sweeping Britain turning the population into zombies (okay, 'infected' if you want the technical term), it was dark, tense and moody. However, 28 Weeks Later goes in the other direction, being loud, brash and exciting.<br/><br/>The action picks off when Britain is starting to be repatriated by a UN team. Of course things don't go smoothly and the human population soon finds itself at the mercy of a horde of flesh-eating, rage-infected zombies (infected). If you like your horror explosive and non-stop then you should like this. It has a good cast, good special effects and, thanks to the soundtrack, makes sure it feels like it's set in the same universe as its predecessor at all times.<br/><br/>In fact, the only downside I can think of is that it's probably a little too short. The characters - although good - never quite get the chance to be fleshed out as they might have been. Whereas most films go on too long, this one could have done with some extra character-development to go with the excellent action.<br/><br/>It may not be Aliens, but it is a worthy sequel in a world of endless, terrible additions to horror franchises."
"acsbendi","3","2","4","26 August 2014"," This movie shouldn't even exist
","I was very surprised having seen the 7 points this movie has been given. From the start of it I thought this movie was made without a clear plan as to its story. That is, the creators just wanted to make a sequel to earn even more money.<br/><br/>Why do I think so?<br/><br/>First, it's not really common to make a movie set AFTER a zombie apocalypse that is practically over, but there are a lot of survivors. Of course, it isn't problem, but it makes the rest of the story too predictable (at least for me, what else could happen other than the contamination occurring again ?). Here comes my question. How come NOBODY survived the disease and was found within that 24 weeks? Or the whole military just didn't try to search them? Second, just take a look at what happened within the first 33 minutes. Practically nothing. The kids were in the spotlight who were just like these typical stupid horror character ( ""contamination? who cares? we do need those important things like pencil case, schoolbag, photos""). In addition to this we could hear some really important conversation between soldiers.<br/><br/>At first the military looked very well-organized and prepared, but then they just left the infected woman without observing. It was painful for me to see that while the commandant and the military doctor were talking about what to do with the infected woman, her husband just walked in and kissed her. Nobody noticed anything until some soldiers were found killed. The husband had not even been killed by the military. However, they easily gunned down a lot of innocent civilians. This is what made me angry most, despite this and the massive bombing significant number of zombies had run out of the ""controlled"" territory. Initially I thought the gathering of the civilians into that big room was a good idea, but how could they so idiot that they didn't checked if the doors could withstand a single zombie??<br/><br/>About the rest of the movie : there's pretty unrealistic chopper vs zombies fight scene, after which they run back to the city where they get in a car having seen gas. They don't succeed in starting it, so the soldier get out and he start to push it, by which the car starts. I don't understand one thing. How did they know it had fuel??<br/><br/>I have one more question. Why did the military force arrive so much time after the infected's death? What happened in that 6 weeks? The bodies were to be buried anyway as it's shown.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was pretty annoying and meaningless. The mostly nice visual effects didn't make up for its mistakes and immatureness. I guess the way too high rating of the movie (7/10) partially can be reasoned with them, and also that's why I gave it a rating of 3 (not only 1 or 2)."

","Continuing the events first portrayed in ""28 Days Later"", this sequel details what happens when the infected have been dealt with, and London is starting to return to normal. The US Army comes in to supervise the operation, but is unprepared for a development that starts the whole bloody mess right up again. One of the refugees, Don (Robert Carlyle), wasn't honest with his children Tammy and Andy (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton) about what happened to their mother, and that is going to come back to haunt him.<br/><br/>Juan Carlos Fresnadillo takes over the directing chores from Danny Boyle, doing a serviceable job of administering action, atmosphere, and suspense. The screenplay isn't always very believable, but the actors are superb and the pacing speedier than that of the preceding film. Still, Fresnadillo won't avoid some of the more annoying clichés of the modern horror film, such as the frenetic and choppy editing. There may also be way too much digital gore for some horror fans.<br/><br/>The top notch international cast is fun to watch: Rose Byrne as concerned medic Scarlet, Jeremy Renner as sympathetic sniper Doyle, Harold Perrineau as the helicopter pilot Flynn, Catherine McCormack as Dons' wife Alice, and Idris Elba as efficient Army officer Stone. In the films' second half, when Scarlet and Doyle become determined to see Tammy and Andy to safety, Byrne and Renner do particularly good work.<br/><br/>One of the most impressive elements about this film is the stunning aerial photography, giving us a Gods'-eye view of a devastated London. Special effects are generally good, especially in the horrific scenes of the city being firebombed.<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"" looks to be a divisive film, with people usually either liking it or loathing it.

It set a tone that suggested a more hard-edged approach to the story and the world.<br/><br/>But the story began breaking down shortly after that.

"Tss5078","4","2","4","26 June 2013"," The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
","In 2002, Director, Danny Boyle re-invented the zombie movie with his groundbreaking film 28 Days Later. Many credit Boyle with the current zombie craze we enjoy eleven years later. What made that film so enjoyable was that at the time it was a story we hadn't seen in a long time and it was shot in a way that made it look like a much older film than it was. Five years later the studio wanted a sequel and Boyle wanted no part of it, knowing that it would never live up to the original and indeed it does not. 28 Weeks Later is a continuation of the story, which claims that all the infected had starved to death and that England is free of infection once again. People start moving back in to areas of the country that have been fixed up for them and which are protected by the U.S. Government. We are then introduced to a family which has been reunited. The film starts out with a tremendous action scene that was the only part of the film I enjoyed and the only part that is reminiscent of the first film. The terrific opening is followed by a long, sappy, family reunion and then by a sick person being found. From that point, literally within ten minutes hundreds of people are infected and the army is shooting everything in sight. How could zombies have starved in the first place, but more importantly how can so many people change, just like that, within ten minutes? It didn't make any sense at all, to make things worse, all dialogue and storyline ends at that point and the movie turns into one big gory chase scene without any substance whatsoever. As for the cast of this film, they did nothing to help the story. In the first film, Cillian Murphy was amazing and carried us through the low points, but here it's a cast of newcomers and unsuccessful character actors, who quickly bring the story to a halt. I was looking forward to seeing this film, but not only doesn't it compare to the first film, but it doesn't even live up to the broad genre it is exposing us to. The cast was sloppy, the direction was confusing, and worst of all it just doesn't make any sense! 28 Days Later was groundbreaking, but it's sequel is nothing more than an over-hyped movie that never should have been made."

","Adrenalized charged follow up to ""28 Days Later, ""28 Weeks Later"" may not have the formers stark eeriness of waking up to a empty London, or at least what is thought as a empty London, but it more than makes up for it in action. It more than makes up for it in terror. It may not have the character development of the former, but it's storyline of a family tore apart from the ""Rage"" virus is definitely heartening & angering at the same time. It's story of the bond of a brother & sister is very moving, well acted & executed.<br/><br/>Yes, the two movies are different, but in many ways equal. Danny Boyle is not at the directors helm for this one, but new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo infuses the film with his own brand of maniacal mayhem. The editing is fasted paced, more so than the first. The storyline of the US Military overseeing the survivors of the virus is a interesting & logical one. The sense of fear & terror are well done, especially the subway scene.<br/><br/>All in all this film stands on it's own very well as a major contribution to it's genre. When all it's parts are summed up, it's a great sequel, though not quite as profound as ""28 Days Later,"" nor anywhere as complex in character development, hence just a tad inferior, but in a over-saturated genre of Zombies & Zombie like humans, ""28 Weeks Later"" is a highly recommended terror fest!"
"lewiskendell","9","2","4","19 June 2010"," A stellar sequel to a great movie.
","I thought 28 Days Later... was great. A breath of fresh air and a thoughtfully entertaining horror flick. So it's not lightly that I say that I think 28 Weeks Later is even better. <br/><br/>The only thing that's missing from the original is the parallel between the rage virus inflicted attackers and the brutality and rage of the main male character and his enemies, at the end of the movie. Everything else is just as good, or improved. <br/><br/>Well, everything except the one specific zombie who seems unnaturally intelligent and obsessed with two characters in the movie. Super Zombie didn't fit at all into the ""rules"" of the movie, and seemed like an unnecessary plot device. That minor complaint is virtually my only one, though.  <br/><br/>28 Weeks is brutal, intense, and more frightening than its predecessor, with the scenes in the crowded parking garage and the pitch black subway tunnel REALLY standing out. The simple story moves along briskly, with no superfluous moments to distract from the tension. The tone is understandably different (there is a new director, after all), but I don't think that the slight change hurt the movie at all. I loved the cast, and the ending is one of the best I've ever seen in a movie of this kind. <br/><br/>Any time that I feel like a movie went by too quickly, I know it's a fantastic one. And that's exactly the impression that 28 Weeks Later left me with, even the second time around. It's less deliberate and more action-focused than 28 Days, but only the most stringent fan of the first movie will have an issue with that."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","2","4","31 May 2010"," Matches the original's intensity, scale and high concept execution
","When a zombie film gets a sequel, the assumption is that the producers are looking for ways to make more guts, gore and money. But ""28 Weeks Later"" is just as sharp as its predecessor in nearly every way, primarily in continuing the sci-fi post-apocalyptic elements that have clearly been thought out and made believable as they were with ""28 Days Later."" <br/><br/>""Days"" director Danny Boyle stays on in co-executive producer capacity for ""Weeks"" and it shows. He finds Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to direct, who demonstrates a thorough understanding of Boyle's vision for the abandoned, infected England all the way down to camera technique. <br/><br/>Although Boyle has no credits for the story, it's hard to imagine he wasn't the primary consultant. ""28 Weeks"" brings us back to London the titular amount of time later, when one area of the city has been quarantined to start the re-population of the country (under the command of the U.S military -- what a scary thought for Brits that must be ... ). Smartly, the story focuses on one family reunited as the children were abroad during the breakout and the father (Robert Carlyle) managed to survive.<br/><br/>But despite the rebuilding process, little is sunny about ""28 Weeks Later."" It's still more zombie flick than anything else. When the kids' mother is found, she turns out to be a carrier of the infection without it taking over her body. However, it manages to spread and all descends into utter chaos when the military calls Code Red. The film's snowball effect of suspense and violence simultaneously acts as both its best and worst attribute. It's highly entertaining yet absolutely crazy.<br/><br/>Using the microcosm of the reunited family (which doesn't stay reunited for long) helps ground the film. All post-apocalyptic action films that do well stay focused on the characters and ""28 Weeks"" gets off to an excellent start in terms of both character development and intensity. Even when the focus goes away from the parents and to Jeremy Renner and Rose Byrne's characters who try and help the kids to escape the area, you grow to like their character easily because they keep things sane in the midst of panic and a restless script.<br/><br/>Fresnadillo carries an entire arsenal of techniques with him and deploys them all in the hour and a half runtime. Some of the scenes jump around too much and are too dark to make any sense of what's going on, but some are scarily effective. One scene in the subway is entirely done in nightshot and borrows on ""found footage""-style horror techniques while a key infection sequence is a wrenching game-changer.<br/><br/>Zombie fans will be pleased with the follow up to the film that re-launched the zombie genre for the 21st Century and won't find any brains (as in intelligence), scale or character sacrificed as a result. ""Weeks"" carries the promise of a franchise that could rival George A. Romero's zombie empire.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://movimeusereviews.com"

","I found 28 Weeks Later fairly entertaining but was disturbed by the filmmakers apparent point of view when it comes to survival versus compassion.<br/><br/>One can say that the moral of the movie is that the road to hell is paved with good intentions or that the obvious right thing is sometimes not right at all but it appeared to me while watching this that the audience was supposed to be squarely on the side of the infected children and the highly unprofessional military members that defied orders to save them.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that the mother of the children, when discovered to be a carrier of the virus, should have been terminated immediately and the children should also have been killed before they were allowed to spread the disease to the mainland.<br/><br/>The military members who sacrificed their lives to spirit them away to the European mainland were not heroes. They let their emotions get the better of them and ended up saving two people while showing gross disregard for the lives of millions of others. Their despicable actions were quite shocking and disgusting to me, even more so than the wholesale killing that preceded their escape. I would hope that if any of them had survived would have been tried and executed for treason.<br/><br/>I found it quite amusing that the actor who in one scene scared his friend by jumping out and pretending to try bite him also portrayed Jeffry Dahmer in another film!"
"Quebec_Dragon","9","2","4","23 May 2009"," Nice surprise: as good if not better than 28 days
","Gripping and intense, your mileage might vary but I think I preferred this one to the original which was already pretty great. As a matter of fact, 28 weeks could theoretically be seen first since it's 2 different stories with different characters. The camera work is nervous and bold yet keeps similar aesthetics to 28 days even though it's made by a different director. The storyline was very suspenseful filled with powerful moments and difficult moral decisions.It's also quite thought-provoking regarding the American military. Some might think, even me at first, that some plot elements are illogical or too coincidental but when you think about it, you realize that most of it can be explained. Just keep in mind that the infection might have evolved."

The teenagers actors are good too and actor Robert Carlyle is really good as their father Don. The plot is interesting and entertaining, the action and suspense scenes are great. What I liked most about it is that it doesn't end as one would think it could end once one has already met all the main characters.<br/><br/>People are coming back to London for re-population after 28 weeks, once all the people infected of the Rage virus have starved to death in Britain.

"megoobee","1","2","4","28 November 2008"," Started great but went down hill fast
","The premise of the movie is plausible (not likely but plausible) that a virus could suddenly infect a large population of London (hey , the plague did roll through there a few centuries ago) and create all sorts of mayhem. In this story, the infected become living zombies (as opposed to dead zombies since the infected are technically still living) and go around attacking the uninfected living. Why they don't attack one another is beyond me, perhaps out of professional courtesy? Sorry, I digress.<br/><br/>Anyway, the military gets the situation under control (the U.S. military that is....where's the British military and NATO?) and start re-populating an area dubbed ""The Green Zone"" isolated from the still unsecured ""wild"" areas. Huh? What kind of logic is that, something as deadly as this virus and they don't do a complete clean-up before bringing in civilians? Obviously the World Health Organization (WHO) would not have allowed that to happen. <br/><br/>This crazy lack of logic is present throughout the story and really killed the movie for me. Quick summary, the rest of the story goes as follows: Two kids slip out of the ""Green Zone"" and wander around the outside. I estimate at least half an hour goes by before the soldiers mobilize and chase down the kids. (So much for the much ballyhooed secured area) The kids find their chewed up mother still alive and they're all reunited and live happily ever after. Well maybe not but from that point, the story gets more and more ridiculous until you pretty much don't care if anyone survives. It just defies logic that they would bring an infected person into the so-called ""Green Zone"" and allow that person to make contact with others. Predictably, someone gets bitten, the virus spreads, and the zombies start taking over again!<br/><br/>Without giving away the ending, I can tell you that room is left for a third sequel (FYI, the first movie is entitled ""28 Days Later""). I certainly hope they don't make another."

The narrative never lacks, with the whole concept of danger keeping you on the edge of your seat all the way through. Not necessarily scary, but it will definitely play on your mind. The ending with the new stadium felt like a marketing promotion, but was still good to watch. The plot has action, suspense and drama, to make an ultimate thriller, with plenty of gory blood encoded for dramatic effect, which is helped along by stunning direction.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's direction in 28 days was superb, unusual and different, particularly the opening sequences as the central character is alone in England, with the character a little man in a huge city.<br/><br/>Fresnadillo's direction in this sequel is equally impressive, using similar shots to create the lonely and deserted effect. In contrast Fresnadillo's direction is faster and less focused, especially when the infected are involved, conforming brilliantly to the horror thriller genres. These films wouldn't have had the same impact if this style of direction hadn't been encoded, and is a film where you can really appreciate the atmospheric view of the situation.<br/><br/>Having Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting) star gave the film the extra credit it needed, with a fine performance as Don. He did exceptionally well, and gave a different and intriguing portrayal as a struggling family man. Carlyle is helped along by stunning performances by all cast, but in particular Muggleton and Poots, who play Don's kids, two of the best young performances you will ever see in a British film, only behind Tom Turgoose in This is England.<br/><br/>28 weeks later is a fine sequel, fast and flowing, and though not necessarily scary, is a thoroughly entertaining British film."

In 28 Days Later, the plot was basically survival; run from the infected and find a safe place to hide.

ALso after the epidemic begins, we see a new style of survival techniques that were not in 28 Days Later.

","This sequel to "" 28 Days Later""is much,much better than the OK first film.This takes the first film's premise even further and is a rarity these days, a film that manages to be believable,thrilling and frightening.Film has many good, thrilling moments e.g the first zombie attack at the house, the escape by boat, the snipers shooting at the crowds and best of all,the army helicopter cutting it's way gorily through a mass of the infected.There are many more scenes that are good and film's running time at 95 minutes isn't really enough and how many films can you say that about these days?For a horror film this is very well acted by a mostly unfamiliar cast, although both Robert Carlyle and Catherine Mccormack acquit themselves well.Much has been made by producer Danny Boyle that they are not zombies but there is no doubt to me they are.Film borrows liberally from other zombie classics as the first film did i.e George Romero's zombie classics notably the original ""Dawn of the Dead"".Easily the best British film financed with the aid of lottery money."

","28 Weeks Later starts, as you'd expect, 28 weeks after the initial outbreak, when all the Infected have died due to starvation and Britain is now disease-free. The US Military is moving in to reconstruct the island and have started to bring civilians in as well.<br/><br/>Within minutes of the film opening, we are treated/subjected to one of the most gripping, heartwrenching sequences to have graced a horror film, including the wicked opening of the Dawn of the Dead remake. Robert Carlyle plays an incredible role as a survivor who manages to outlast the Infection, but at the cost of his wife and safety. Comparisons to the original film are inevitable... while 28 Weeks Later captures much of the same rampant energy, the vicious, snarling packs of rabid Infected, the bloody room, the overall sense of dread, there's something missing that the first film did well. In a tip to Romero, the first film explored the behaviour of people in an apocalyptic world, showing that we are the biggest threat to ourselves.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later touches on these themes, but butchers it with predictability and cliché. The kind-hearted soldier, the naughty children. The obvious cruelty of the military.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a wild, gripping film, and it spins out of control so fast that you'll be tense. Really tense. So tense that you'll have to eat a big chocolate sundae to settle your nerves.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later is a sweet-ass throw back into the zombie genre, but without the religious sentiments. It's blood-splattered, machine-gun ridden and gives you absolutely no sense of hope for the human race in the face of disaster. Through the film, we are faced with our own cowardice and the desire to flee. A terrible movie to watch before bed, unless you relish the idea of nightmares"
"mbworm","9","2","4","28 January 2008"," Very scary and visionary follow up
","28 Days Later was a jumpy, clever thrill ride which found a patient who woke up in an abandoned hospital and proceeded to discover a barren wasteland that was once London. It was all abandoned... that is, except for hundreds of infected people with ""Rage"", a virus which spreads through the blood in seconds and turns a person into a savage zombie. It was totally f***ing scary and completely believable.<br/><br/>Fast forward ""28 Weeks"" after that incident, and the viewer finds themselves once again in London, only this time American soldiers have moved in and done some reconstruction, sealing off the city except one small part where survivors of the outbreak can repopulate. After a narrow and terrifying attack, a young man is reunited with his children, and with the promise of no more infection from the military, everything seems to be getting back to normal. Wrong.<br/><br/>In a clever plot twist which I won't give away, the virus manages to sneak its way back into the hopeful community, and within a matter of minutes the horror is plaguing innocent people in the most brutal way. Gore is splashed on thick and director Juan Carlos Fresnidilla keeps the pace fast and the cinematography slick. Although the editing is choppy and incoherent in some parts, overall ""Weeks"" is captured quite brilliantly, taking on a whole new style from the masterful first. As equally scary as its predecessor and with a very effective ending, ""Weeks"" scores where the first one did on a truly scary level."

","For those dissing the movie because of so-called plot holes such as how inept/illogical were the U.S. military actions, um, here's a one word response: Katrina. Here's another: Iraq. Is a building manager having access to a military secured section of a building that sets off the new round of infection in ""28 Weeks Later"" any more unbelievable or preposterous than the governmental ""response"" in the first week of Katrina of simply herding thousands of people into a stadium with virtually no basic support allowing lack of food, water, medical supplies, disease, criminal activity and death run rampant?<br/><br/>A major theme in most ""serious"" modern zombie films is how governing institutions and individual survivors react in the face of the complete breakdown of fundamental societal systems and norms we all take for granted each day from the time we get up in the morning to when we go to sleep in the evening. (In the face of a zombie outbreak, forget about holding the door open for the stranger leaving Starbucks with a latte in his hand). In ""28 Weeks Later,"" this gets played out in the hubris of governing institutions trying to quickly impose order before fully understanding the problem and adequately planning a response. Thus, the ""plot holes"" that many have complained about here are in fact a major point of the film.<br/><br/>And to those complaining they don't like any social commentary mixed in with zombie brain matter from heads getting blown upI guess that means either you think that all of Romero's films are not real zombie movies or you've completely missed the point and think that ""Resident Evil"" is the ultimate zombie flick. ""Night of the Living Dead"" was in large part a metaphor for racism in the U.S. and the backlash against the civil rights movement in 1960's; ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a biting (pun intended) satire on mindless consumerism; and the recent ""Land of the Dead"" took aim at the growing class disparity between the Haves and Have-Nots.<br/><br/>Of course, first and foremost a good zombie film must have a strong visceral impact and some decent brain splatter. ""28 Weeks Later"" compellingly delivers the goods within the context of its social commentary. (8 of 10)"

","28 Weeks Later, together with 28 Days Later, is another current masterpiece. Even being two movies setting different stories and time, the continuity idea of this movie fits perfect with the first one because all the elements of 28 Days Later are there... but improved. Knowing that Danny Boyle was there all the time working together with the director, writers and all of the cast and rest of crew members is fantastic, it's a plus to admire more and more his work and professionalism and to believe that this movie could not be described better than one of the best sequels to be placed together with other classic ones as Aliens (1986), T-2 (1991) among very few others. As the first one, it's also not original, but it has all the qualities that a movie like this should always have.<br/><br/>While 28 Days Later has a classic horror feeling because it follows the steps of classical horror movies like those ones from the George A. Romero's first ""dead"" trilogy, 28 Weeks Later elevates it to a truly survivor horror, something that Resident Evil games did quite well, and also was a precursor of this style, but never achieved that objective with its shameful movie trilogy made for the masses. Alike the previous one, 28 Weeks Later is not all about action and deadly virus, it's also critical and realistic with the governments, civilians and military, and all of this criticism is the heart of entire movie.<br/><br/>Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did an AMAZING job researching and adding some of the strong elements of the first movie to the plot, creating a sequel straight faithful to the original but also giving personal touches to it. The actors and the characters are awesome because when you're finally connecting and sympathizing to any one of them, the character suddenly dies, which makes the audience capt the feeling of loss that all the characters have during entire story, and that's simply amazing.<br/><br/>Applauses!"

","28 Days Later is probably my bleak out look on the future. After watching the first movie which was great I thought why not check out this one (after I did not get round to watching American Gangster). I was however pleasantly surprised with the sequel which from the trailer really looked like a badly made version of Resident Evil 2. The story picks up ...28 weeks after the first infection of the Rage virus and with the aid of the US (who for once seemed to do the right thing) but as it happens just when you thought it was safe to enter London again ! the Rage Virus returns with a vengeance! 28 Weeks Later is what a apocalyptic genre should be about , it waste no time to deal with silly little sub-plots . The action was clear and precise , with gore probably this time more than the first film . Robert Carlyle was in pure top form for his role along with all the other cast and crew members especially the 2 youngsters who impressed greatly . My only complaint is that the camera work was a little shoddy from time to time and I felt that things moved a little too quickly in some places as I would love to have seen an expansion on a few things but giving the severity of the situation I was willing to let that go. Nobody can say they are fan of Zombie/apocalyptic movies unless they have seen this movie , It easily overtakes the Resident Evil Genre and in one or two ways I liked it more than Land Of The Dead but remember this is by no means a feel good typical Hollywood movie , but having said it is thrilling and entertaining. I have also just heard that Danny Boyle has announced he wants to do a third one so I am truly looking forward to what happens next , HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br/><br/>28 WEEKS LATER : 8.7 OUT OF 10 <br/><br/>IT ALL BEGINS AGAIN !"

","Apart from an excellent opening scene full of tension which held out the possibility that this might just be a good film, the rest of this film is quite simply ridiculous. It's full of wooden characters and HUGE plot holes. The director seems to have believed that because everyone rated the great panoramas of an empty London from 28 days later he should follow suit on a much grander scale. As a result it seems that the aim of the characters is to run from one landmark to another to fulfil the directors wish to show another aerial shot of London. *Spoilers* And how come Robert Carlyle's rage victim acts completely different from every other rage victim? Rather than wondering around killing everything that moves he manages to know that the secure zone is going to be fire bombed (He hides around a corner with a knowing look on his face, because of course the explosion wouldn't go around a corner would it.....) Then he manages to follow his kids through MASSIVE expanses of London for a final ridiculous fight in the utter darkness of the Underground. So many other stupid plot holes to mention. Zombies, Gore and Aerial shots do not make a good movie by themselves. Very disappointing."

","I was looking forward to seeing 28 weeks later as the first one 28 days later was such a class film. Overall 28 weeks has a lot going for it, the acting, special effects and directing is good and it has it's fair share of scary moments, but it was let down in so many places. In the interest of adding more gore and trying to make it appeal more too an American market, they didn't leave enough time for character development and made certain parts of the film either boarding on, or completely unbelievable. It just made what could have been a good sequel, into just another gore flick.<br/><br/>Really I think you have to look at 28 weeks and 28 days as two completely different films, rather than the first and the sequel as they are so far apart in many ways."

There was talk of quarantine, rage, murder, and ethical issues of repopulating...<br/><br/>So when I heard the sequel was getting some praise I decided to see it... My good friend, however, said the movie sucked, and he's the type who enjoys any run of the mill horror film, so I was expecting to either be let down, or heavily impressed...

","Upon hearing that a sequel to the brilliant 28 Days Later was being made, I was unsure. When I read the plot, I felt like totally dismissing the film. ""Oh great, Americans save the day again!"" was my initially response, as I felt irritated at the idea of Amercians muscling in on an effective and quality British horror.<br/><br/>I finally saw the product last night, and breathed a sigh of relief as my earlier doubts turned out to be a little off target. Okay, the sequel is much bigger budget with extensive special effects and a much wider focus. The low budget, grainy Indy feel of the first one is not so strong here, as the small scale setting of the first one has blown into a city wide, high octane military deal with skyscrapers, helicopters and all matter of weaponry. This film has many more people involved on a much bigger scale. You could call the whole thing an 'injection of Hollywood', but trust me, it could've gone a lot worse than people here are whining about. The energy of the 28 Days is still here, the shaky camera-work during combat scenes, the frenzied feel when the infected attack, the tension and the moments of emotion between survivors.<br/><br/>In 28 Weeks Later, a section of London near the millennium dome has been wardened off by the military, in which society tries to rebuild itself after the infected have slowly died off. It is a complex of tall sophisticated blocks, high tech systems, and plenty of well armed troops around the campus. Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting) takes one of the lead roles as a family man who is reunited with his kids early on in the film. It is soon discovered that his wife is not quite like everyone else, a medical phenomenon, but at the same time very dangerous to be around. Without giving too much away, an internal outbreak is triggered, and lets just say the film gets VERY messy from here on in. If you thought the first one was gory, then strap yourselves in, as this goes off the scale with blood'n'guts. This could compete with ""Land of the Dead"" for gore, albeit this is gore you can take seriously.<br/><br/>Brilliant but never OTT special effects make the combat scenes gruesomely entertaining, camera-work is worthy, as is the tension as various survivors struggle to stay alive in what becomes a free for all area of carnage and mayhem. I thinks fans of the first one disappointed with this should be grateful it wasn't turned into something like Resident Evil:Apocalypse, which would've been just a little insulting.<br/><br/>I think it would've angered people a lot less if the military force sent in to control and monitor the situation were simply UN, instead of having to be solely American. Apart from that the film kept up and gets 7 stars."
"BruddanChrist","7","2","4","13 November 2007"," A good sequel
","28 Weeks Later does everything a sequel should do. It continues the story of 28 Days Later while not depending on it, introduces new characters and new conflicts, and, most importantly, it ups the antee. Fresnadillo revisits the skeletal aspects of 28 Days Later (the photography and the music most notably) while telling his own story, giving the skeleton new meat, so to speak.<br/><br/>I like the diversity of the actors this movie offers. The story allows room for American influence while keeping the focus of the conflict on the United Kingdom. After watching a completely British cast in 28 Days Later, I felt a bit of the strangeness the characters in 28 Weeks Later felt at the presence of the Americans.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later is a story. Whether or not the filmmakers intended it to be a socio-political statement is irrelevant to me. Applying reality to it subtracts from its entertainment value. So, drink a soda and eat some popcorn. You're in for a wild ride."

","Remember, this review does contain some spoilers, of course I am writing this well after the movie has left theaters ...<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie more than I enjoyed the first one, of course I simply prefer more broad based action over character specific drama. 28 weeks later certainly had some unbelievable situations, I mean wouldn't the military put at least one actual guard at the door to the room holding an infected survivor? I know the guy had access to every room in the place but seriously, he has access to the main military medical lab too? I don't think so.<br/><br/>I also thought it was far too unbelievable that the quarantined holding pen for civilians just so happened to be easily accessible for the infected Father.<br/><br/>Putting those two flaws aside, I really enjoyed the action and fast pace of the movie. I also enjoyed the fact that the movie was not so set on keeping specific characters alive. Our heroes and heroines were bludgeoned to death just like anyone else. None of that amazing escape artist nonsense you would expect in your avg. film.<br/><br/>I have to say, as an American I greatly appreciate non-Hollywood movies. Were this an American made film I am sure that Bruce Willis would have taken out a few thousand infected before heroically tossing the carrier boy into a helicopter flown by Meg Gibson all the while Arnold would have been standing on a hill top, mini gun in hand yelling ""GET TO THE CHOPPER!"" And of course, the boy would have provided a mass cure as opposed to the infection of mainland Europe ... and somehow, the Father would have been cured."

","I always had the feeling this was just going to be a lame sequel using the name of the classic movie ""28 Days Later"". Mainly because ""28 Days Later"" had a good ending where infected die of starvation and everything was going to be OK. So looking at the trailer, you might feel cheated to have watched ""28 Days Later"", cause things just don't seem to turn out OK after all. But you would be wrong. ""28 Weeks Later"" isn't an ""Elm Street"" type sequel where evil just comes back for no good reason. As in most horror sequels, ""28 Weeks Later"" takes its own horror elements to the next level. I don't wanna give any spoilers, so all I can say is everything is more intense than ""28 Days Later"" The shooting of the film is just beautiful. The use of filters, lighting, fast camera movement, empty city scenes, and music make this movie a true piece of art. You will realize that it actually is a good thing the sequel has a different director, so you will get a chance to see the idea of ""28 Days Later"" from a different point of view. ""28 Days Later"" & ""28 Weeks Later"" is probably one of the best horror couple ever made, since each of them is a whole different movie in itself with only the idea of infected people in common. The only downside of the movie was it felt too short. It was probably the quickest 90 minutes of my life. This actually IS a downside, because it leaves the viewer dissatisfied. Most characters have longer backgrounds than their lives in the movie. And the overall of the movie gives you the feeling that it was cut short due to lack of budget (probably). Nevertheless, ""28 Weeks Later"" is a must see for horror addicts, and it definitely is better than some of the classic movies of modern time."

","First off i want to explain my love for the first one.<br/><br/>It's very rare that i'm emotionally involved in a film. 28 days took me by surprise. I genuinely cared whether the characters lived or died. Yes for once i wasn't hoping the zombies/infected eat the people, and make it gory. The movie also was like watching how savage humanity is and our struggle for survival. Though the ending i saw was a happy bullshit ending, i had the opportunity to see the other 2 ending which were nihilistic. All in all it did everything right. The atmosphere, the score...man the score was very emotional, the characters and the infected are some of the most savage creatures every!!! The sequel tried to recapture that and more. and does it succeed? well.... The movie is about how America has repopulated London after all the infected has died of starvation. But a survivor is found and all hell breaks loose. Some reviewers often called this aliens to days alien. i disagree. though its action packed and has ten times the infected...i don't think thats a fair comparison. I do think this movie explains a lot. The new ideas they introduced into the franchise is even more frightening then the originals.<br/><br/>The movie can be looked at as a metaphor for the Iraq war or any war America has had in the past. We see them going into a foreign country trying to show them how to live and it back firing horribly. With a code red order sent down..which is reminiscing of the shock and awesome performance we got to witness in the early stages of the now 4 year Iraq war, we see an unspeakable but yet very understandable act deployed. This only adds to the horror which seems relentless once it gets going.<br/><br/>The issue i had with this movie was it didn't capture the bleakness of the original. Though it seemed like there's no hope of repopulating London, the movie wasn't as atmospheric as the original. Here we see countless amounts of soldiers on buildings in a empty London..placed there for safety..think 911..when they aren't doing anything but you feel safe to know they are there. Only the insane and highly replay ably intro captures the true essence of the first film. Now i'm not saying this isn't good i'm saying that one was a better film. The first was filmed with a digital camera, gave it a grainy look. This is filmed and scored like a big budget flick. which its probably what it was but...what made the original that much better was it seemed real...it was damn depressing..and the score was haunting and emotional. It was one of those movies you'd stumble across in a video store and it scared the hell of you.<br/><br/>I liked it...watched 3 times before rendering a verdict. I don't think a sequel is necessary."

","I propose a very simple fix to the story that could've turned this from a gritty, edgy, disturbing, but a bit flawed and confused film to one of the great horror tragedies of all time:<br/><br/>Don't have him abandon her in the beginning -- make the separation between them unpreventable (they end up separated by forces beyond either's control). Look what ensues:<br/><br/>1. You have her ""miraculous"" immunity which allows her to survive and eventually reunite with the husband.<br/><br/>2. The reuniting carries with it no taint of regret, revenge, etc. Only pure re-kindled love.<br/><br/>3. What seems to be joyful reunion turns into tragic betrayal/murder.<br/><br/>4. This eventuality plays in perfectly with the theme of the film: survival of the individual has taken total precedence over love and human-to-human connection. The lie the two believe is that the blessing of her individual survival can carry on to encompass their love as well. In a horrible irony, just the opposite occurs. The blessing becomes a terrible curse. Absolute love is doomed to be completely inverted into absolute hate, and becomes a terrible symbol of a society dependent on love and community for survival imploding in on itself. <br/><br/>I don't understand why the film-makers couldn't have seen this. What we have instead is an irritating ambiguity:<br/><br/>1. If she's bent on revenge for his abandonment, which some scenes such as the vision he has later of her bitter expression indicate, then it wouldn't seem practical for her to plant the kiss of death on him when she herself has no chance of escape.<br/><br/>2. If she's planning revenge/suicide, the horrified reaction she has to his transformation belies this.<br/><br/>3. If she's simply forgiven him, then what is the purpose of his abandoning her in the first place?<br/><br/>Frustrating...such a missed opportunity."

","This is the Sequel to the successful thriller 28 Days Later. As can quite easily be discerned from the title, 28 Weeks Later is set for the most part 28 weeks after the Breakout. For those such as myself who didn't see the first movie, a clear, blindingly obvious outline of the situation is not made. However, based on information picked up as the movie progresses one can work out what is going on.<br/><br/>The basic plot outline seems very similar to that of Outbreak (Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman & Kevin Spacey) where a variation of the Ebola Virus created by the US government gets loose and infects the population at large. NATO moves in and quarantines the area. One member of the army uses their wit and influence in an attempt to A) Prevent the Militaries heavy handed actions. B) Preserve the only hope of vaccination. Of course it is not just Outbreak that this movie is reminiscent of; consider the situation in Iraq as you watch this and you will agree there is an obvious parallel.<br/><br/>The Virus, known as RAGE, causes adrenaline induced frenzy. The Infected become blood spewing maniacs whose mission is to kill or infect those who have managed to avoid death or infection. The Infected in this movie are formidable due to having vastly increased amounts of adrenaline. This means that they are Faster and stronger than a traditional Zombie and resemble those from the 2004 Dawn of the dead rather than from the 1978 original film. They may be significantly stronger but they are also easier to kill (being of the living and not the 'undead') and can require as little as a crowbar to the face.<br/><br/>The action is fairly exciting and if jump eight feet in the air out of fright is your thing then this is for you. There is of course the small issue of the ""Acting"" which consists almost entirely of Robert Carlyle crying (during which scenes he also seems to be smiling) and hordes of mad running, screaming loonies. The point I'm getting at is that Carlyle is the only decent actor, everyone else is either wooden or have a very easy acting part (mad infected loonies).<br/><br/>Don't see this movie if you a squeamish or scare easily. I used to be fairly afraid of Zombie, but now I am not because that feeling is dwarfed by feeling towards The Infected (which is best described as blind terror). The results of the movie are as follows 1) I have vowed off sleep for the rest of my natural (or unnatural) life. 2) I predict the sale of tinned food, emergency bunkers and firearms will increase noticeably. Basically a good horror/thriller and will probably be best enjoyed by those encapsulated by the first film. All in all I give 28 Weeks Later 6 Infected Loonies out of 10."

Also, there are far too many completely illogical holes in the concept of the film that make it far less believable than the first.<br/><br/>Carlisle is solid as the dad who survived, but the rest of the characters are quite dull. I really wish they had cut out some of the plot devices and put a little more effort into humanizing the whole situation.

","As I walked to the theater, the impression of such films were extremely underestimated from my side. But, without a doubt, I can guarantee you, it is a film worth watching. From my various disappointments of the RE series (which I will always have great nostalgia for what the video games offered), this film was able to capture the theme of survival, sacrifice and a sense of loneliness within a city in crisis. Yes, the plot could be considered highly hypothetical, but, under its context, it is represented and approached as a realistic possibility. The cinematography was quite good, giving the audience the impression of a REAL city, gone through a vast sacrifice that ultimately lead to a place filled with emptiness and silence. Overall, it is a film that many will enjoy. I don't want to spoil anything, so just take this as a recommendation."

","I remember watching 28 Days Later (2002) a long time ago and thinking that it was a great zombie classic. And this sequel lives up to it pretty well. It doesn't top the first movie, put it offers plenty of explosive zombie gore and buckets of blood, some intense atmosphere and the cast does a good job. Imogen Poots, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner and Mackintosh Muggleton are strong and believable in their roles. It offers the same gritty and shaky camera work that its predecessor had, and even recycles its musical theme. This sequel is also interesting because it deals with themes of mass hysteria and human nature. Overall, I was entertained by it, 28 Weeks Later is a good and gory horror follow up to a classic genre pic, and I really hope that those talks about other future sequels being in the works are really happening.

"kuarinofu","7","0","0","21 June 2020"," Nice visually and thematically, not as good with acting or storytelling
","28 Weeks Later is a good follow-up to the first installment. It keeps the overall theme while still adding something new.<br/><br/>While it doesn't look like it was shot on a digital camera (like the 28 days intentionally was), it still manages to look realistic and gritty. The overabundance of shaky-cam though is quite annoying though the more you watch.<br/><br/>It has some interesting visuals, some very basic symbolism (I'd even call it ""film school"" symbolism) for most audiences to understand. The music is nice and they have succeded with building up the ""dead city' atmosphere (hence the intercut shots of the city and the graveyard while they are driving through).<br/><br/>And while there lots of really good and stylish visuals that many will enjoy, story-wise it doesn't make a lot of sense. The scenes I'm talking about are cool to watch but when you stop and think about one - it crumbles. Also, the acting wasn't that good, Elba had nothing to do in this film, Renner was boring. Carlyle was the only exception cause of how feral he looks while infected. I'm sure that good performances would've made this much better, but it seems like the script wouldn't allow it.<br/><br/>Anyway, 28 Weeks Later is a good film (especially if you loved the first one). Give it a deeper look and you might find more than just a zombie film, the director has put lots of stuff in there for you to enjoy."

It was packed full of intense zombie chases and fight scenes, and was an accurate (If that's possible) view into what it would be like during a zombie apocalypse. Robert Carlyle is as brilliant as always, and Rose Byrne is great as-well. It does British cinema proud and is probably one of the best zombie films ever made. It follows on well from the first film and has intense scenes such as when the night vision is used towards the end. Would 100% recommend watching.

","After watching the original film 28 Days Later several years ago and enjoying parts of that, decided in watching the follow up. As a whole this sequel remains similar to the original but they added in a few American characters. This does feel a little more Hollywood, but that doesn't necessarily mean it suffers.<br/><br/>The new characters here are quite more intriguing and the plot extends a little more. There are also a few more horror scares. This film does feel more violent where we see more gore. Although the ending was predictable it was enjoyable.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner in one of his earlier roles shines and steals his scenes. His presence makes this film a slight level above the original.

"comicboy-95358","2","0","0","13 May 2020"," Bad editing strikes again...
","This sequel was very disappointing to me because the orginal was flawed but it was still a pretty good zombie movie. This one has so many problems that I might not be able to fit them all into this review so let's start off with what I liked, just as a quick warning this review might be the most spoiler-heavy review I've written so far, so I figured I'd give a warning.<br/><br/>Now this paragraph is probably going to be the shortest because there wasn't much to enjoy the movie had some funny moments but the only one I can remember right now is when Sam jumps on the helicopter and Flynn tries to shake him off. It's kind of embarrassing how I finished watching the movie about 2 minutes ago and I had already forgotten what made me laugh.<br/><br/>Anyway, I can't believe I'm finally doing this, but I have to address this right now. This movie still has the quick and choppy editing so I guess the only thing that was switched production wise was the director. Honestly if its the same editor or a different person, it doesn't matter because their editing is abysmal and they should've left this movie alone and maybe I would've gave it a 5 or a 6. But the editing is just so bad it's hard to ignore.<br/><br/>Now the first movie had some emotional scenes but every time this one tries to have an emotional moment it's ruined by being horribly acted, poorly edited, excruciatingly boring, or just plain hilarious. I honestly didn't understand what was going on half of the time because everyone was dying but the editing was all choppy and I couldn't figure out why. Even the deaths that weren't edited quickly like Doyle's death still aren't very emotional to me because everytime something that you're supposed to feel something about happens the same dang song plays, the song literally plays 5 or 6 times in the entire movie and it is one of the 3 or 4 songs in the movie. I might like the song but it doesn't mean I want it to be the only one in the movie.<br/><br/>Next I'll mention the gore that is either barely shown or over done and there is a lot of blood but there is so much bloody that it kind of devalues the bloody parts because every violent part is either hard to notice due to choppy editing, or just over done.<br/><br/>Now the ending makes no sense because Flynn didn't want to pick up people but once he realizes Doyle died he let's them into his helicopter no question, even though they are dirty and look infected. I personally wouldn't have let those kids anywhere near me and if he was acting how he was earlier, like a jerk, he would've shot them. But in this case it would've been smart to be a jerk in shoot them, even if they didn't sound like they were zombies yet he still didn't know for sure that it was safe.<br/><br/>Anyway half of the named characters are killed in the first ten minutes because the ""main"" character Don leaves them all behind. Which I personally think is just him being mean and a coward. I mean I wouldn't have went back for anyone either, but I wouldn't lie to my kids about abandoning their mother.<br/><br/>Overall, I had to give this movie 2/10 because the only other movie I could compare this to is World War Z, which I personally think is a worse movie than this one. Also thank you to Jeremy Renner (Doyle), Harold Perrineau (Flynn), and Raymond Waring (Sam) for making an abysmal film more tolerable with your amazing performances."
"briandmcaleer","9","0","0","3 May 2020"," Best Zombie Movie Ever
","Whoa! What an incredible film. A great sequel and a astounding achievement in it's own right. The night I went and saw this film, I was actually intending to see Pirates 3 but that session was completely sold out. So my friends and I settled for this. None of us had seen the first film in the franchise, ""28 Days Later"", but I had been told that you didn't have to, and I reaffirmed that for all my friends.
We went in and were all captivated by the opening scene, set in that warm, little country cottage where everything goes to hell. It really set the tone and pace for the film. What followed after the opening scene was arguably the best zombie film I have seen since ""Dawn of the Dead"". The real themes here were panic and reaction, displayed by the characters in their response to what was going on around them.
There were some very disturbing and intense scenes in this film, including the interaction between the husband and wife, where one of them became an ""Infected"". Then towards the end of the picture, when the female doctor is guiding the kids through the darkened subway, using the night vision scope on her rifle to guide the way. That moment really captured the fear inherited with darkness, claustrophobia and the unknown.
So I didn't get to see Pirates 3 that night, but instead saw a film I wasn't intending to see and had one hec of an experience. For the whole running time, I forgot I was watching a film; instead feeling like I was right there in the thick of it, and I went home with an upset feeling that if something like that virus being unleased on earth really happened one day, it would be just like the events of ""28 Weeks Later"".

Yes these are the ""Infected"" & Not Zombies, these are humans transformed by the Rage Virus & not brought back to life from dead as in Zombies.<br/><br/>Now, This fantastic Sequel takes the ""Aliens"" approach as it has lots more action & monsters for an Action-packed Horror sequel. Everything here is tightened up more & bigger in scale for fear & tension but i do still prefer the quietness, full of dread fear atmosphere from the first film, that really gets under the skin & makes you on feel on edge, but the tone & atmosphere is still strong & thick here but there's much more characters around this time so the scary isolated & lonely feel is not as strong here.<br/><br/>People are starting to repopulate England, London & life is trying to get back to normal with the help of the U.S Army keeping watch & on guard. Everything feels realistic & the opinion sequence is absolutely terrifying & nearly equels the terror of the first film. We get an excellent & powerful performance from Robert Carlyle & his opening scene is energetic & heart-pounding with terror as Carlyle runs from lots of the Infected from his hideout farmhouse to the lake & IT'S pure Horror & gripping as hell!!!
A superb opening to set in stone that this sequel is gonna be just as Horrific as it's Classic first film.
The cast is excellent here with, like I've said Robert Carlyle, also Jeremy Renner, Rose Byrne, Idris Elba, Harold Perrineau, Imogen Poots & more. A solid cast of both American & British talent working together.
The usually great, Jeremy Renner stands out as expert Sniper-soldier Doyle, a ""Hicks"" type of Good & strong take charge type of Soldier, a great heroic performance.
The Rage Virus obviously infects & spreads through the Country again & all hell breaks loose again & this time a group of survivors, including some kids & soldiers are on the run through London trying to survive from the Infected.
The infected are absolutely scary as hell again like the first flick & to me are probably the scariest Creatures to ever chase Humans in the Horror genre.
There's lots of super scary & intense moments scattered throughout the movie & everything is done in a gritty & raw look like the first but also in a Cinematic way & not like the low-budget look & feel of the Classic first film, which i personally liked better.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later is an excellent sequel & is just as much terrifying fun as the original but still not as great or as impactful as that Masterpiece.

","The zombies are great. They're aggressive as hell, the makeup is nasty and there are some gory scenes which keep you on edge. The Rage Virus is brutal and disgusting, and every time a zombie projectile vomits blood over someone or something, an angel is born. Unfortunately, that's pretty much it for this movie's redeeming qualities (save for a rad helicopter scene).<br/><br/>The main characters are not only one dimensional, but nobody is actually that likable to begin with. It has a few very familiar faces -- Jeremy Renner being one of them -- and overall the level of acting is high. The acting is not the problem though, nor is the budget. The problem is the way the story was executed: poorly.<br/><br/>It's got a fan-freaking-tastic premise, and unfortunately it was squandered. By the end, I felt three different ways about the 6 or so recurring characters: hate, neutral, or slight annoyance. Jeremy Renner's character gets close to feeling human, but even that one is a reach. People mostly felt flat.

","28 days later is at war with Shaun of the dead for my favourite zombie movie (yes I know they aren't zombies, but they may aswell be) and although I don't think that 28 weeks later is as good, it still holds up in its own way
The film is good in different ways from its predecessor, there is a lot more spectacle in this one if that's what you are looking for. But I find the more personal and human approach of 28 days personally, it makes the surroundings and threats a lot more disturbing honestly
That's probably why the opening is the best part of 28 weeks because it is absolutely terrifying. In fact I would consider it one of the best moving openings (at least in a horror) along with others like Jaws. It's also better than the already great opening of 28 days<br/><br/>I can't say which to watch. In my opinion the first is better, but just like alien and aliens, it's apples and oranges.

"The-Sarkologist","9","0","0","3 February 2012"," One heaps scary and intense movie
","This is probably one of the most intense and scariest horror movies that I have ever seen. I have seen it before, but when I watched it again last night it pretty much scared the hell out of me, and seriously, it is very hard of horror movies to actually scare me. The way Robert Carlise withers in abject pain after he becomes infected by foolishly kissing his wife, and then how in a rage he beats her to death and gouges out her eyes, not necessarily gruesome, but rather me, as a viewer, watched in abject horror thinking to myself that that is probably one of the worst ways to die, that is to turn into a ravaging beast, and further to be beaten to death while restrained to a gurney.<br/><br/>And it does not stop there, after the virus breaks out all of the civilians are herded into a bunker and all of the power is shut down, and it is at that time that Carlise breaks into the room and begins attacking the civilians. Imagine, being trapped in an underground bunker, and not only can't you see, but it becomes very clear that people are turning into beasts and attacking everybody randomly, and once they do escape, they suddenly find themselves being shot at from the rooftops, and are then incinerated as the government realises that they have a very dangerous infection on their hands. Watching this film (and the effects that the director used to really amplify the horror of the situation) just constantly made me think that I am so glad that I am not in that situation. Further, the end of the film just left me sitting there with my mouth open, realising that this is pretty much the end of civilisation as we know it.<br/><br/>Whereas the first movie had the infected in the background, this film brings them to the forefront. The movie opens with Don (Robert Carlise) hiding in a farmhouse with his wife and other when they are attacked by the infected. He manages to escape, but in a fit of terror, turns from his wife and flees as she is dragged out of sight. Then fast forward 28 weeks later and Britain has pretty much been depopulated and it is believed the the virus has run its course. However things are not as simple as that because they then encounter a carrier, somebody who has been infected, but is asymptomatic (though not entirely).<br/><br/>Many have criticised aspects of this film, such as why Don was able to get into the room with his wife, and how he managed to escape from the isolation room. My main continuity criticism is that in 28 Days Later, the infected shun sunlight whereas in this film they are unaffected by it. If there is one thing that I would suggest that dragged it down is that. As for the incident with Don, my position would be that humans are prone to make mistakes, and simply by not revoking his authority, or not even considering that his emotion would overide his common sense, makes his actions very believable. As for him escaping, it is not clear, maybe he was let out by an unsuspecting guard, who was then attacked and killed.<br/><br/>Some have suggested that Don does not behave like a true infected, but once again I beg to differ. First of all it is suggested that despite the Rage Virus affecting him, he is also haunted by powerful emotions, in that he deserted his wife and left her for dead, and as such is still able to retain a sense of control, which could also answer why he managed to escape. Also, when he gets into the bunker and starts attacking people inside, it is clear that it is his intention to spread the infection far and wide.<br/><br/>Seriously, this film is heaps intense, and it is very rare that you actually get to breath, especially after the infection is released on the Isle of Dogs. It is clear that it was always going to be impossible to contain, as can be seen by the end of the film. There are suggestions that a third movie will be made, 28 months later, and there is even a trailer, though it is unlikely to appear until next year. I guess I would like to see how it ends, but considering the general rule of cinema, the sequel in many cases is far better, but once the third hits the screens, then pretty much tune out."

","!!!!!!This review contains a small amount of spoilers!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I have to admit that I might be a little prejudged. I am a huge fan of zombie movies. You name a zombie movie, I've seen it and probably enjoyed it. Furthermore this film's predecessor, ""28 days later"", is one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>Does that mean this movie is without its flaws? Most certainly not. It doesn't resemble its predecessor at all. They could perfectly be seen separately. Still, I recommend you watch them both and in the correct order.<br/><br/>A short summary: 28 weeks after patient Z, Britain has been declared free of infection and the NAVO has installed a military force in London and secured a safe zone. They let in civilians to repopulate the country. But of course (otherwise it wouldn't be much of a movie), something goes wrong. The infection spreads again, the military loses control and the survivors try to stay alive.<br/><br/>I should probably start with mentioning the opening scene, which is one of the best scenes in any movie I have ever seen. It starts out slow and quiet, but then... The pacing, the action, that feeling you get. The song that accompanies the last part of this scene is awesome. You can hear it once again, around the middle part of the movie, in what is according to me the second best scene from the movie. The opening on its own is probably better than the rest of the movie, and captures the feel of the first movie. Something which the rest of the movie doesn't do quite well, since the focus has moved from just surviving to big-budget action.<br/><br/>No character really stands out. You have a nice looking scientist, the standard ""bad-ass"" soldier, the commander that is willing to do all to be in control, some bland people that die very quickly. None of them are too smart, but this seems to be a trait which all but a few rare people in horror movies possess. The effects are fine, the zombies are fine, the ending decent enough. The action is done quite well, great when accompanied by the sublime music, mentioned above. Nothing really stands out, there's nothing really wrong either. Except...<br/><br/>There is just one major thing (and it's major) I don't like about this movie. It has some totally illogical plot holes and errors. All movies have some, and I can live with that. Making mistakes is human, but in this movie some things are just inexplicably stupid. For the sake of not giving too much spoilers. I'll discuss one. John (a key role in the movie), who is the father of the 2 children that can be considered the main characters, is one of the few survivors who is already on the island when the civilians arrive. And he has been granted full access to all compounds, civilian and military alike, in the entire city. Don't you think this a very unlikely? Furthermore, he becomes some sort of a super-zombie, capable of teleportation and surviving a huge fireball. This is just one of the many mistakes in the movie. Some are just so obvious it hurts the brain to think about it. On the other hand, if you're one that doesn't mind these things or can get over it easily, there is nothing really wrong with the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a must for every horror fan, and zombie-lovers in general. It's generally good and really great in some parts, and those moments outweigh some of the more mind-boggling moments in the movie. Just know that you should probably not try to compare it to its predecessor."
"Dbt25677","7","0","0","18 November 2011"," Okay without being excellent.
","This film is worth watching if you have already watched 28 Days Later. Somehow it does not deliver the terror and emptiness which was supplied in the previous film. If Danny Boyle had directed this, it would have been excellent. He is a genius when it comes to the delivery of horror. The thing that I hated about 28 Weeks Later was the gore. I love seeing movies, but I hate seeing gory movies. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo tries to imitate the intense and brilliant action of 28 Days Later, but doesn't quite make the mark. He tries to make it better by crashing a helicopter into a group of Infected, and that is a very gory scene. As well as when Don is Infected and he squishes his wife's eyes with his thumbs! Ew!<br/><br/>I think this film has some good actors, Rose Byrne, Robert Carlyle. This movie did not feature the fear and terror of the virus, and yet again fails to inform us of how the virus is actually created in the first place? I think the audience deserves to know. If there is a 28 Months Later, I hope to god that it is directed by Danny Boyle. This movie is quite worth watching but 28 Days Later is much better.<br/><br/>Overall, if you've watched 28 Days Later, you may as well watch this. It's kind of stupid how they fail to show Jim and Selena, even though they were what made the series great. I suppose it's okay without being excellent. Most of the film is pretty boring."

","With the success of 28 DAYS LATER, it was almost inevitable that a sequel (or two, maybe?) would follow. In the opening scene, my personal favorite, we're introduced to a group of survivors. They have taken refuge in a boarded-up house when a large horde of Infected attack. With terrifying swiftness, the survivors are cut down or turned. And in the end, only one man remains- guilt-ridden and running for his life. From there, the story picks up 28 weeks after the first person got infected. Now, NATO and the US Army have moved back into London to rebuild. However, it soon becomes evident that all is not well. For you see, the Army scientists learn that certain persons can act as carriers of the Rage virus without turning into zombies. And through a simple affectionate kiss, the plague begins again. Now survivors must flee as the Army resorts to more drastic measures to contain the epidemic. In this film, we get less of the existential philosophies of the first as the filmmakers focus more on extremely graphic, pulse-pounding effects and scenes. While this is a fairly good sequel, it's not as good as the original. However, I still recommend it and hopefully wait for the much-anticipated 28 MONTHS LATER... please Oh Please OH PLEASE?!?!?!"

","After the superb '28 Days Later' expectations were quite high with '28 Weeks Later' even though I did keep in mind that most sequels fail to measure up to their predecessors. That is exactly the case with this film. Not only does it fail to measure up, as a stand alone movie it really disappoints. On the technical side it's a well shot film. The scenes are cut-together fine. The main concept of the story seems promising but it is the script that disappoints yielding to clichÃ©s such as the teen and preteen screwing things up and in the end it is these two annoying characters that survive. Plot holes are abundant and the dialogues are formulaic. None of the actors perform to their optimum. Catherine McCormack is wasted. Robert Carlyle isn't given much scope either besides playing the typical dad-becomes-zombie. Rose Byrne looks incredibly uncomfortable playing an American doctor. The teenager and little boy should have been devoured by the zombies. '28 Weeks Later' is by no means the worst of its kind but I would definitely recommend the likes of '28 Days Later', 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Planet Terror' and even 'Zombieland' any day over this."

","This shocking sequel to Danny Boyle's 2002 box-office smash is a devastating assault on the senses from start to finish. The downbeat tone of the original is retained as we see Don (Robert Carlyle) escape from the infected ""rage-virus"" victims by going to London's Isle Of Dogs, where all survivors are kept safe in quarantine. Upon arrival, he meets his two children and later his wife - who he had previously presumed dead. She, however, is infected and soon infects her husband as well - leading to a frenzied outbreak at the Isle. The fast-paced gritty action has a discomforting realism - echoing Romero's ""The Crazies"" - which places the film amongst the best of it's kind."

","This film is about a deadly virus raging through London that turns people into zombies.<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"" has a lot of action, with a lot of escaping scenes to pace the film. The actors, particularly the two children leads, are great as they can enact the sense of pressure and desperation while being a fugitive. The film also successfully creates a dark, desperate and hopeless atmosphere. It's very bloody, but it is not scary because the way blood scatters around is almost comical. However, the ending is a little disappointing, as although it has a climax, it still is not as tense as it could be."

","A very good zombie film, it even surpasses its predecessor, the very worthy 28 Days Later. Directed by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, the movie starts 28 weeks after the first film. With the first outbreak apparently ended, an American led military force arrives at the deserted London (in a not so subtle allusion to the occupation of Iraq), securing certain areas and allowing English citizens who have been abroad during the outbreak to return. Among them are two children (played by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton; one of the best scenes of the movie has nothing to do with zombies and have them running through the deserted streets of the English capital). As expected, though, the zombies have not exactly disappeared, and are bound to return with a vengeance. Robert Carlyle does a fine turn here as a survivor of the first outbreak who becomes infected here (and the opening scene is great). Intelligent, very bloody, entertaining, what more can you ask from a horror film."

","Sequel to the original Brit-flick horror, this time there's a bigger budget, more Rage infectees, and a veritable invasion of American troops. 28 weeks after the initial infection, the Rage victims are all dead, starved once the population had been converted to their own kind. Gradually, a small number of survivors are being repatriated to a secure area of London, situated on The Isle of Dogs. The perimeter is protected, nothing can get in or out without the soldiers knowledge, and anyway, the virus has gone. Course it has..... Three of the survivors are of the same family: the father, Don (Carlyle), who survived by fleeing from the house he and his wife had holed up in during the initial stages of the epidemic, and his two children. He believes that his wife is dead but, unfortunately she's not, and when his children escape the secure area and return to their home to collect some personal possessions they find her alive and, apparently, uninfected. Problem is, she does have the disease, but has some sort of immunity to it - special blood. She's isolated from other survivors, but a chain of events kicks in that sees the infection spreading out of control once more, and the soldiers that once protected the inhabitants of the secure area now determine to eradicate all life to ensure the second extermination of the virus. Action packed, gory - the helicopter blade slicing scene is a riot - and tense, this is quality modern horror. Carlyle is as reliable as ever, and well supported by the rest of the cast. There's the occasional lapse of logic (why would you lose your way in a corridor when there's only two ways to go, and you're in the lead?!?) but, in general, this is a movie that is hard to fault.<br/><br/>Blood filled fun for all the family."

","I'm not too sure, but i might have preferred this one to the first one 28 days later. Point is I liked them both at the end of the day. This did something for me, struck a new chord. I would not call this a zombie movie though. Zombies are the living dead, you shoot then and they get back up again, these are infected humans, infected with rage. This one is bizarre. Love it from beginning to end, it does have that Hitchcock touch to it, like in psycho the hero, the trail you been following gets smacked out of the picture and you find yourself in new case scenarios. Here at one point, just when we think that things might be turning for the better, all hell suddenly breaks loose and you not just trying to survive against the infected, but the snipers too. What brings the infection back is someone somewhat immune to it, but a carrier, just a kiss will do the job. There is a part of this film reminiscent of the Jews in the extermination camps. I would not be in the least bit surprised to see yet another continuation, say 28 months later and what not, most worth it, great project, very courageous."

","28 Days Later was a suspenseful, atmospheric and thrilling addition to the 'zombie' genre. At least until the third act, when the film loses it's direction and ultimately failed to reinvest interest. I put zombie in quotes because any fan of the film will tell you they are not zombies, just infected people with a virus. When I heard that a sequel was coming out, I figured it would be even worse because a sequel being better than the original is rare, specifically in this generation of film-making.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later furthers the story, this time with new characters. The virus is gone and re-population has begun. The American army is in charge and have everything under control. That would seem like a boring movie, so of course they have to have the virus come back and wreck havoc. Which it does. In a very lame way I might add.<br/><br/>The film opens with an attack on a house, this is the highlight of the film. The film never reaches the same height of excitement as this, but it does keep the viewer interested. I was never bored and found that it did work well as a sequel. It doesn't have the same feel as the first. All the atmosphere that made the original good is gone here. I felt more threatened by the infected in the first because it was them against ordinary people. Here, we have guns, helicopters and apparently tons of napalm.<br/><br/>In one scene the soldiers bomb half the city, it looks cool, but seems ineffective, they later use gas that seems to kill everyone in sight. My question is why not use this gas first, it sure as hell beats out blowing up half the city. Small things like this are all over this film. Lead a bunch of civilians into one room for 'protection'. Of course this is one room in which the infected gain access, other people are left unguarded and creatures run around unnoticed in this government building. These things aside, the film is really well done and very enjoyable. It serves the genre well and is ultimately more enjoyable then the first.<br/><br/>Boyle acts as producer this time around, so the feel of the film is not all that different and the film does offer some intense moments. There is one sequence in which our characters go underground to the subway system. It's totally dark and one uses night vision from a rifle to see. They filmmakers use this to show us exactly what she sees, in a first person type of way. Very effective and scary.<br/><br/>The gore has been turned up a notch, with more blood splatter and a severe beating of one person that may turn some stomachs. There is another scene in which they use the blades from the helicopter to make quite a mess.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining sequel that manages to actually be better, albeit not by much, to the original. It adds new elements, but doesn't necessarily take the story into new directions. It is better than one would expect."

","28 Days Later, which is the prequel to this film, completely revitalized the zombie genre, in my opinion.

The film reveals to us that the Infected have all died of starvation, but in this film, the virus makes an unfortunate return and begins to spread once more in a way that I won't reveal to you, for it would spoil the film.<br/><br/>This film takes some unexpected turns and keeps you guessing for the most part, and is a great deal more brutal than the original film.<br/><br/>So it's up to you.

The plot, action, suspense and thrills worked really well. Don't let the word ""horror"" give you the wrong idea though; this is simply a great movie that also happens to be a horror movie.<br/><br/>Basically, the story starts 28 weeks after the contagious ""rage virus"" has run its course in Britain. All the infected people have apparently died off and an American led NATO force is now dealing with survivors. At the same time that an amazing discovery is made, a disastrous sequence of events changes the situation for the worst ... and the story progresses from there.<br/><br/>The things that impressed me the most were the interesting storyline and suspense. As the movie went on, I become increasingly engaged in the movie and found it hard to stop watching.<br/><br/>While the actors were reasonably good, it took some time to get interested in their characters. A big reason for this is that you don't really get a lot of time with the lead characters in the beginning.

","I loved 28 days later, but almost walked out of the theater when watching 28 weeks later. The entire movie is just showing innocent people being bloodily killed... and that's it. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy many ultra-violent movies such as Sin City or Pulp Fiction... but those movies actually have a plot, and they purposely try to make it not incredibly realistic looking as 28 weeks later does. They also keep some of the main characters that the audience cares about alive in the end. It makes me wonder what is up with people's psyches to actually take pleasure out of not only seeing all the human bystanders slaughtered in this fiasco, but also all of the main characters be brutally killed (ie.- close up of a man tearing the eyeballs out of his wife's head, a 5 minute montage of the US military tearing innocent people up with bullets, one of the main character's face being smashed in then her child companion looking at her flattened head under a night scope). I can understand getting a kick out of a cheesy horror movie, but this is far too realistic to pass as entertainment. It's like if somebody had graphically filmed the most gory parts of the Rwandan genocide, put it on big screen, then millions of people paid $7.50 to watch it for fun.<br/><br/>The violence probably wouldn't have bothered me as much if the plot was more than just ""I know, let's put all these people back into the epicenter of where the outbreak began... then the virus will be unleashed again...then there will be a bunch of people killed again... then the virus will infect the one hope for humanity, carrying it to the mainland... then everyone will die."" It is so predictable it seems the only reason why they made this movie was to show ""cool"" ways that zombies and people can kill people and zombies.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just getting old or something, but 28 weeks later is poison to the brain and a sad outlook on humanity."

Some have said that it is impossible to relate to the characters of this movie, which is completely untrue. While short lived, I felt for every person in that house. Add that to my complete disgust for Don as he ran from the house, and you have one ball of confused emotion.<br/><br/>Just the prologue alone made me love this movie. I haven't seen a beginning like that since Zack Snyder's Dawn of The Dead.<br/><br/>The presence of the US Armed forces turned out to be not half-bad, either. In fact, it was pulled off very well. The characters were realistic, ranging from emphatic to apathetic extremes throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The kids were extremely well-played. Child actors have yet to play a part as well as the two in this film did. <br/><br/>As far as plot holes, they can, for the most part, be ignored. The idea of the virus staying within species was bullshit, I can't lie, but as far as card-key using zombies, we never saw don close the door, did we?<br/><br/>I was very pleased to see that none of the old characters were in this one. Not because I disliked them (They still rank as some of my favorite cinematic characters) but because this really was a different story, based around the same virus. Staying away from well-known superstar actors was a great move, although it HAS been a rule since Romero first made the modern zombie in 68.<br/><br/>As a fan of zombie flicks, I could see many things tastefully taken from classic Romero flicks, as well as the new Land of The Dead come into play. This movie not only serves as a great sequel, but also an amazing memorial for all of the great B-Rated zombie flicks.<br/><br/>Ignore the low ratings of some others, and see this movie.

The USA armed forces are there to help control things. But not everyone alive is clean, and that starts another infection.<br/><br/>This story is not nearly as interesting, and the movie relies way too much on horror action involving those infected against those healthy.

The dread and unease it pervades transcends even the horror genre, approaching something much more primal. The brutal treatment of human life is artistic in an almost Passolinian way (as hard to imagine as this is) and, in fact, I think it carries the series into the realm of artistic statement.<br/><br/>Every character is believable in a way that is uncommon to horror, making the movie almost seem to spring from the school of realism that Flaubert, Zola and Balzac are famous for, simply put in the context of horror (as potentially asinine as that sounds). Robert Carlyle's character strikes me as profoundly interesting and thoroughly complex, due to very subtle and quick techniques used when portraying him.<br/><br/>To say that this film exceeded my expectations going in is a gross understatement and, in fact this is truly something special in the horror genre, and for contemporary film as a whole.<br/><br/>I only hesitate to give it 10 stars because it is so fresh in my mind and I want it to steep a little more, despite my strong desire to simply say: ""10 stars! 10 stars!"""

It was by far one of the most brutal, sick, shocking, scary, and so great you can't even explain it in words all rolled into one giant monster of a movie. <br/><br/>People say that the first five minutes of a film set's up the tone for the whole movie and i can honestly say it did, it was awesome.<br/><br/>Now I'm not going to give away key pieces of the story but when a film maker has the gut's to not go by Hollywood's rules and not make the film a happy ending and instead make it totally shocking the i take my hat off to them (that's if i was wearing one)<br/><br/>All I'm going to say is if you haven't watched the movie already watch it and if you have let me know what you thought!"

","It's seven months after the outbreak of the rage virus in London, and it appears that the disease has been eradicated. American troops are stationed throughout the city, which is now being repopulated. Among the new/old citizens are two children, the first minors to reenter the city. London is now a dystopia, much as it was in the similarly themed Children of Men, in which mistrust runs high and the government and military seem more antagonistic than beneficial.<br/><br/>It's all safe, say the American soldiers. Mission accomplished, and all that. It's safe to come back in. A dedicated military doctor wonders why the newest repatriates include children - ""What if it comes back?"" she wonders. ""Then we kill it,"" she's told. I immediately felt safer.<br/><br/>Of course, the virus IS back, else there'd be no movie. In a prologue, a small band of survivors holes up in a secluded country cottage. When one answers the door to find an uninfected child, all hell breaks loose, culminating in one man's decision to abandon his wife to the clutches of a rage-infested undead mob.<br/><br/>That man, Don (Robert Carlyle), is the father of the two new young arrivals to London, and now he has to explain how their mother died. Being the kind to spare his kids nightmares and to avoid probing questions, he fudges the truth a bit. Next thing you know, the kids are scampering across the Thames to visit their old home, against the express orders of the military, which deems most of London to be very unsafe, rife with disease and pestilence and the like. These are not smart kids.<br/><br/>You can see where this is going. The rage virus makes its return, spreading extremely quickly from person to person, and suddenly it's a race against time to get the kids out of London. Now, in all honesty, there's a good reason they have to make it out of the city, other than preserving their own lives, but I won't spoil it here - I point this out merely to show that there is, indeed, a logical reason to hold their lives as more valuable than those of the adults around them.<br/><br/>But the trouble with 28 Weeks Later is that it's largely uninvolving, boring crap. The people, except for that Army doctor (Rose Byrne) and an intrepid, ethical soldier (Jeremy Renner), are largely stupid. And I don't mean just that they're all one-dimensional characters, it's that they do dumb things that cause all sorts of mayhem to rain upon them. Things like hugging a woman who may carry the rage disease. Or kissing a woman who may carry the rage disease. Breaking into a security facility to do the latter. That sort of thing. Dumb, dumb, dumb.<br/><br/>The second problem with the movie is that there aren't nearly enough zombie attacks. There are some, sure, but they're isolated and feel mighty stagy. Compare the scene in which the doctor and her charges attempt to get out of the city by car with the one in Children of Men in which Clive Owen attempts to escort the first pregnant woman in a generation out of the city. In one, you know the characters will run into a series of obstacles that they'll likely overcome, but in the other, there's no certainty at all - anything could happen.<br/><br/>The third problem is that much of the movie's action scenes feel as if they're part of a really bad music video. I'm talking choppy editing with quick, dizzying cuts - this is not a movie for those suffering from vertigo or epilepsy. The action moves so quickly that I literally could not tell what was happening, which can hardly be the point. It reminded me of being in the middle of Space Mountain at Walt Disney World. I saw flashing lights and heard screams, but that was about it. Just poor, poor editing and cinematography.<br/><br/>If this was supposed to be a commentary on the dangers of a having the military run a city, whoopee doo - we've seen this kind of junk before. I get it: military bad, citizens good. This movie ups the ante a little bit by actually firebombing London, a sort of Blitz II, but the effect would be the same if I were playing the old Nintendo video game Contra. Because the outbreak's so bad, you see, the soldiers are ordered to waste everyone they see. Everyone's a target. Including, apparently, the audience.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later isn't just bad in the sense that most sequels are bad, it's bad in the sense that it manages to replay all clichés about dystopian societies, and End Days plagues, and so forth without giving us the goods of zombie attacks, which is what we came for."

"ax-32","Null","2","5","31 October 2007"," Not so much
","""28 Days Later"" was one of the finest films I've seen in recent years. That said, I'm afraid to say ""28 Weeks Later"" fell far short of its predecessor. What made ""Days"" such a fantastic movie was its creativity and originality. The acting was excellent, the plot was interesting, dialogue was believable, and, most importantly, the characters acted in a manner that most people would act. Not so in ""Weeks."" I sincerely doubt any person interested in self-preservation would leave the safety of a military complex to go get a picture of their mommy. I don't care how young you are, how much you miss her, or if you can't remember what she looked like, YOU DON'T LEAVE THE ARMY TO GO HANG OUT WITH ZOMBIES. That's just stupid. The very beginning, when the dude runs out of the house leaving his wife behind, believable. I'd do it. When his wife runs back to save the kid, no freaking way.<br/><br/>Now for comparison, in the end of ""Days,"" when the girl backs the car into the doorway of the mansion to kill the Sergeant guy, completely believable. Actually quite a bad ass moment. In the beginning, when the woman kills the guy she's with because he's turning, absolutely believable. This is what ""Weeks"" could not pull off.<br/><br/>Its painful to see a great movie go down the tubes once they get a big budget. It seems like once they have the money they have to sell their souls to Hollywood and take all the awful Hollywood horror movie conventions along with them. Oh, now the kids have to be stupid like in Jurassic Park. Oh, the mother has a weakness for children. COME ON people, no one acts this way. It could have been so good if Fox didn't buy it.

","This was possibly the most terrifying experience I have ever had in a movie theater before. It was excellent, and I'm sure with a nice big TV and surround sound, or at the very least just with the lights off late at night, all of the horribly wonderful terror of this movie will translate. Watch it if you want to be scared shitless without allot of gimmicks or (aside from one scene) gut wrenching gore, just simple excellent direction and terrifying score and visuals. The first five minutes are so extreme I had the hair on the back of my neck standing up and felt like I wanted to turn away from it, I felt like a kid sneaking a horror movie I knew I shouldn't watch, and horror, or scary movies just don't do that to me, but this one did. Zombies don't scare me, but I really like zombie movies none the less. However, the infected DO scare me, just the way they are so fast and relentless and even if completely far fetched the idea of a mind affecting virus that causes people to become ""zombielike"" seems as if it could almost be plausible. After all the Mad cow disease affects the central nervous system and in its later stages induces psychosis. Really its the just the vision of 30 screaming unreasonable people with nothing on their minds other than tearing you apart in the most efficient way possible, filled with screaming rage, chills me to the bone, and there's not really any way to adequtely describe it in words, you just have to see the movie.<br/><br/>I give it a ten."
"usafschue","8","2","5","23 September 2007"," Funny how people expect so much from so little
","I came to 28 days later with low expectations, seeing as it was a low-budget horror movie. I was pleasantly surprised and even shocked that so much movie could come from so little money.<br/><br/>That said; knowing that this movie was given a bit more funding and that a change of director was in order, I was surprised yet again at the quality of horror presented in 28 weeks.<br/><br/>A lot of users here lament the ""plot holes"", such as the stupidity of the boy and his sister, but they fail to explain why panicking in a panic-ridden situation or being cunning and using their exclusivity as children are out of place. The soldiers weren't paying attention because they had become jaded and wanted to leave due to lack of action. I, having served in the armed forces myself, understand this complacency and its ramifications. They didn't have an armed guard outside the woman's door because she was deep inside a facility where you need a badge to go EVERYWEHRE and everyone has a firearm. Not to mention she was strapped down in a locked room inside all that. Is that so hard to believe? On the military's willingness to kill innocent bystanders: they were being decimated by the infected (and none were going to survive) so it doesn't really seem out of question to me.<br/><br/>The themes and plot bases used in this movie can be a stretch, but the fact is, when a virus eats London, reality changes just a *tiny* bit. I just hope France falls the same way, or harder, in the next movie :) I give it an 8 out of 10 for fantastic gore, visceral camera-work, and that element of reality that is enough to make your stomach knot."

","""28 Weeks Later"" A film review by Brian Murphy With a prime-time budget, a new director, and sans original star Cillian Murphy, ""28 Weeks Later,"" the sequel to the indie smash ""28 Days Later,"" seeks to one-up its predecessor. Shockingly, it succeeds.<br/><br/>""Weeks"" director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo maintains the look of the original's British, neo-zombie film ""Days"" and director Danny Boyle's style through stark, washed out cinematography, and hyper-realist, docudrama visuals created by the use of jittery, hand-held cameras.<br/><br/>The sequel also benefits from a more involving story, an intelligent critique of the military (primarily the U.S. military), a seemingly endless horde of zombie extras and more money to spend on CGI effects and explosions.<br/><br/>Not much time elapses before the film launches its first, frightening, hyper attack. After a recent outbreak of a ""rage virus"" in London and its surrounding areas, carriers, who are eager to beat and bite common citizens, are infecting the inhabitants at an exponential rate.<br/><br/>Barricading themselves in a country house, a small group of survivors, including a married couple played by Catherine McCormack and Robert Carlyle (who starred in Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting""). After initially defending his wife from a gang of invading zombies, Don (Carlyle) leaves her for dead, escaping by a boat as she stares out a window in disbelief as he runs away. How's that for a complicated protagonist? Fast-forward roughly 28 weeks later to a U.S.-led, U.N.-coordinated reconstruction of London, after the contained zombies have starved to death. Within the protected ""green zone""(sound familiar?), snipers peep into local high rises, scientists probe returning citizens, and Don's children, Tammy (penetrating-eyed Imogen Poots) and Andy (the ""Harry Potter"" sounding Mackintosh Muggleton) come home to their father and a strange new militaristic world.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle had creatively, tightly shot a city seemingly devoid of life, but Mr. Fresnadillo takes it a step further, by having either shut down several blocks of London at a time, or by having employed the mass use of CGI. Either way, his endless high-angle long shots of downtown London depict mass areas bereft of life. The experience then, of these returning citizens, is like the discovery of a new world.<br/><br/>Don's lies to his children concerning the ""death"" of their mother are soon rebuked after his children escape the green zone to return to their house to gather their belongings. The military captures them, along with their still living but infected mother. Her body's rejection of the virus garners the attention of compassionate military doctor, Scarlet (Rose Byrne of ""The Dead Girl""), who makes every effort to protect the mother and her children.<br/><br/>When an anguished Don sneaks in to apologize to his wife, things, as they tend to do in horror films, go very, very wrong.<br/><br/>In this film, chaos and terror go hand in hand, and both are effectively generated in an instant. The deterioration of the military complex takes mere minutes of screen time. The outbreak abruptly erupts, and the soldiers turn from protectors to murderers in the blink of a an eye.<br/><br/>The guitar-heavy, electro-tinged score effectively frays our nerves to further heighten the tension of an inherently tense movie.<br/><br/>Poots and Muggleton are fine young actors who convincingly portray a brother and sister looking to protect one another from the ensuing chaos. The script allows ample time for the two to form a palpable, on-screen bond while the pair dodges both zombies and military personnel.<br/><br/>Disregard the dodgy ending, it was clearly created solely to set up a sequel, and you've got yourself a taut, well-acted and well thought out horror film, comparable to Romero's ""Land of the Dead."""

","1: the gestation period is like 5-320 seconds max for someone to become a blood thirsty berserker. That is not how viruses work. A virus doesn't change genetic or behavioral attributes, it replicates itself from cell to cell and the ""hijacking"" of theses cells and the following eruption of the virus from the cell thereby breaking it apart cause damage to a person. If a virus were to affect a person so quickly, that in itself would cause the body to shut down, not get up and become inhumanly strong! <br/><br/>2: the Infected seem to be mutated into pain impervious super-humans. Okay, that might somehow be possible, but how can the writers expect me to even remotely believe that a virus can make a person's whole skeletal structure stronger than steel. Say some guy, Jack, is infected - Jack is mad with ""Rage"" and wants to lay waste to everything around him, don't forget that they are so ""Furious"" that they have no coherent thought at all except the need to bite another person and will do ANYTHING to get at the intended victim - are you telling me that Jack can do what martial artists train for decades to accomplish? That they can break through doors with just their hands without the repercussions of broken fingers??? Yeah, right, and my mom flies faster than Superman! During the Helicopter scene we see Doyle shoot an Infected and his abdomen is halved... this guy continues running - defying basic tenets of physics - he lacks the whole right side of his abdominal musculature shouldn't he have collapsed on that side and lost his balance? Lot's more of junk like that to complain about.<br/><br/>Like Don getting infected before killing his wife, he has massive spasms and is shown banging his head against the glass window with tremendous force. The makers of the movie want us to remember that these are normal humans who have been drastically affected by a virus - they go out of their way to prove that these people can die. So, why didn't Don collapse his own skull pounding it that way on the glass??? He should have died then and there from those spasms. It is has been known to happen that an epileptic can cause a person to swallow their own tongue or bite straight through it. I'd say that would stop even the most ""Raged"" human body cold, wouldn't you? What of the blood loss also? Where's all that coughed up blood coming from? Doesn't a human body need it's circulatory system intact to perform strenuous physical feats? Where is the oxygen coming from into their muscles? Anaemia anyone? <br/><br/>3: I still wonder, how do they mean to explain away the fact that the Infected don't attack Infected. What virus can do that? A rabid dog with bite another rabid dog, it doesn't distinguish healthy from infected - how does this virus make them so discriminatory??? <br/><br/>4: One last question. They show the blood vessels in Andy's (the kid brother's) eyes swirling with blood activity, almost becoming red and then clearing but leaving only the irises a new color. Eye color is determined by melanin in the cells located there. Pigmentation from melanin is very different from redness caused by flooding of blood in the irises. Not likely. Also the lymphatic system is mostly responsible for cleaning up junk from in between cells - ever notice how long it takes bruising to clear up? How does the virus make the capable of clearing up all that free floating blood in seconds? For that matter, how did it replicate fast enough to burst enough capillaries in the first place to make so much blood visible in the eyes??? How? How? How? That is all the movie makes you wanna ask."

Often times they're a remake of the original film (think Final Destination I, II and III), but in this case the sequel would have to be a continuation of the story. . . something different. And at first the film promises to give us something new. The set up is great, some of the subtle references to Iraq come through nicely, and we learn something new about the disease. The film becomes cliché when a blood bath unfolds.<br/><br/>Where 28 Days Later kept the horror intimate, personal, immediate - 28 Weeks Later opens up the violence making it impersonal. Perhaps another reference to the war in Iraq. The movie should end 30 seconds before it does.

","In this sequel, new director Juan Carlos Frescadillo focuses on the reconstruction of London after the infection of Virus Rage is apparently gone. To ensure this purpose, the US Army takes full control of the situation. Hence, the repopulating London's Isle of Dogs appears to be an easy task.<br/><br/>The place seems perfectly safe and secured. All the infected are presumed dead, so the US Army reasoned, because of prolonged starvation, which they estimate at 5 weeks tops. However, this turns out not to be the case. The mighty, overly confident US Army has overlooked gene mutation. Alice, survivor and mother of two, has heterochromia, a rare genetic trait in the retina that gives her immunity to the Rage Virus. Thus, when she is rescued and brought to Isle of Dogs, it is only a matter of time before all hell breaks loose. Again.<br/><br/>Medical officer Scarlet, apparently the only one with brains in the US Army, quickly realizes that Alice may be the key to finding a desperately needed antidote. Her moronic Commader-in-Chief thinks otherwise. ""If you want to perform experiments"", the top military responds to Scarlet, ""do it with her dead body."" <br/><br/>After recklessly kissing his recently rescued wife Alice, Don (who had escaped the first infection and has access to most places in Isle of Dogs) gets infected and begins spreading the deadly disease. Soon the ubiquitous zombies start the carnage within the narrow confines of the jealously guarded island.<br/><br/>There is more. Don's twelve-year old son Andy is also immune to the disease. Bitten by his own zombie father, Andy remains normal. Too bad, no one except for Dr. Scarlet is paying attention. And since the restricted area is out of control, Red Code is put into effect from above. That means to ""kill/destroy/obliterate"" all the settlers. So the gore reaches its climax too early in the film.<br/><br/>The best part is when the military, who can't distinguish normal from infected, start the massacre. I only wish this part had more built-up tension. Also, it would have been great to have this psychologically powerful scene closer to the end. <br/><br/>Please, don't get me wrong ----overall, the movie is beautifully shot. It also has great, mesmerizing special effects. Unfortunately for the film, its many characters are one-dimensional, to the point of being cartoon-like. Had more attention been paid to the characters'personalities, their growth as they cope with imminent death, 28 Weeks Later would have been a kick-ass film. <br/><br/>Sadly as it is, we only have a B-movie, only worth watching for its extraordinary special effects."

Half the time your thinking ""stupid, stupid, stupid."" ""Can't wait for this one to get it."" Leaving one without even a tingly of remorse for thinking such evil thoughts. This seems more gory and trite than ""28 days later."" At least in ""28 days"" the mistakes are understandable from the characters perspective, and there are some folks you want to survive. This had some suspenseful moments, but relied far too heavily on the crafty camera work and music. One must lull the audience with story, suspension of disbelief is critical to really scaring people versus just annoying people. So - go because we know your going to since ""28 days"" was so bloody awesome, and you best see it on the full large screen.

By any case, it is not one of the zombies' movies, it is slightly touching, and it is not those bloody zombies eating people, there is a meaning to what the director had directed. It is short but it shows a lot blood squirting, explaining things and big action, thrilling chase scenes. It is slightly a bit too dark to see, I know the director's intention- to make the place dark and makes zombies suddenly attack people, the shock factor.

"Rathko","9","2","5","21 May 2007"," Best Horror Movie of the Year...(so far)
","I've never been that big a fan of the original '28 Days Later'. It was a brilliant premise, excellently directed by Danny Boyle, and really injected something fresh and genuinely terrifying into the zombie genre (I know they're not really zombies, but the Infected populate the zombie genre). But the second half was awful, with a distinctly uncomfortable performance from Chris Eccleston. Megan Burns, as the teenage Hannah, was such an unbelievable bad actor that she managed to make almost every scene in which she appeared unwatchable. I've seen more realism and conviction in a primary school nativity play. It's sad that one performance should ruin an entire movie, but so spectacularly bad was young Burns that '28 Days Later' was consumed by the fire of her incompetence.<br/><br/>And so here we have a sequel, lazily titled '28 Weeks Later', coming from the MTV-Horror studio of Fox Atomic and created by a bunch of virtual first timers. Expectations are very low indeed. It's even more shocking, therefore, to discover that the movie is not only far superior to the first, but the best and most satisfying horror film since 'The Descent'.<br/><br/>The opening act, set in an isolated farmhouse, is an incredibly tense and visceral set piece of frenetic camera work and almost strobe-like editing that perfectly captures the feral ferocity of the Infected. The hand-held digital camera-work and over-saturated photography are beautiful; the performances are all solid; the special effects virtually flawless.<br/><br/>There are some really deep plot holes, the more unkind viewer may call them cavernous  it's really quite unbelievable that two children would be able to simply sneak out of a military quarantine in broad daylight, or that a building janitor would have security access to the deepest levels of biomedical containment, or that the French would not bother to guard the Channel Tunnel. But such inconsistencies failed to really bother me, so swept up was I in the dreamlike vision of an abandoned and depopulated London. To see something so familiar become so alien never ceases to fascinate, and I was more than happy to overlook a plot hole for the chance to see just one more sweeping shot of deserted terraced streets and garbage collecting in newsagents' doorways.<br/><br/>The Infected themselves are one of the most remarkable creations in the history of horror movies. They don't grow large teeth and claws or really transform in to anything supernatural or monstrous. They're still very much human, and recognizable so, and their mindless ferocity is all the more terrifying because of it  a raw and primal expression of the Freudian Id that is far scarier than any CGI monster. As such, the Infected are perhaps the purest horror-move expression of evil yet created. This franchise really could run for a very long time, and if they manage to maintain the creative quality of this one (with a little more attention to those plot holes) then I for one will be buying my ticket on opening day."

","I saw this movie last night. I had heard that it got both good and bad reviews, so I was prepared for anything. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed 28 Days Later, and this sequel clearly lives up to the first movie. It may even be slightly better. It's fast-paced from beginning to end. The scenario is pretty believable -- the kind of thing you could picture happening with a bird flu outbreak or a dirty bomb. <br/><br/>If you liked the 2004 remake of the old George Romero movie Dawn of the Dead then you'll like this one. <br/><br/>See it in the theater and then add it to your collection when it comes out on DVD!"
"walken_on_sunshine","8","2","5","20 May 2007"," Better than the Romero Films, By far a superior sequel
","I was not one to find 28 Days Later to be a zombie masterpiece that redefined the apocalyptic genre as the previews say personally i thought it was far too slow moving and boring so obviously i expected a rushed sequel like The Hills Have Eyes 2.28 Weeks Later is one of if not the best zombie films ever made i think it is better than George A Romero's series of Night Of The Living Dead, Day Of The Dead, and Dawn Of The Dead which have for the most part been deemed the best zombie movies to ever be made.28 Weeks Later has an extremely intense and realistic start as these zombie don't wonder aimlessly, decaying, and grunting ""BRAINS!"" these zombies run at you like an angry bear clawing and biting at you, they don't stop or slow down for a moment even when that means trying to abandon them in water.The entire movie is a rush of action and adrenaline with a great story and great themes of togetherness and conspiracy.The acting is phenomenal especially for a film that is being lead by a 12 year old and his teenage sister it's surprisingly realistic, and not over the top or campy.The visual effects are that of the first film nothing too glamorous or stunning but it keeps you remembering the events in the first film.The score from the first film is kept and is absolutely riveting and just gets you pumped up for terror.The film is innovative in terms of it's methods to scare the audience with a good balanced mix of psychological horror and well place jump scares that catch you off guard.The directors film techniques are also unique as one entire scene is filmed as if the audience is looking through night vision with that eerie green glow you see on shows like Most Haunted and The Blair Witch.The gore isn't fake or corny and the stunts and events that would've been corny are done so well that it just fits into the whole rush of action and adventure.The script and dialogue is very good no over exaggerated humour crying for a laugh track and no stereotypes something Dawn Of The Dead lacked.The only complaints i have is there is a big plot hole in which one of the scientists says that the virus is not trans species when in fact the original outbreak was caused by chimpanzees, and the boring visuals.Other than those few minor flaws the film is action packed with unexpected twists, shocking violence, and heart-stopping terror."
"roedyg","2","2","5","19 May 2007"," Worst 12 hours of movie viewing ever
","One of the most unpleasant twelve hours I ever spent was watching this movie waiting for it to end. It was not really 12 hours, it just felt that way. What an utterly boring movie! Almost nothing happens except people killing each other. It is hour upon hour of mindless slaughter, as monotonous as tapes smuggled out of Iraq of American soldiers mowing down children with machine guns. To make matters worse it is filmed in wet poodle cam. They strapped a camera to the back of a shivering wet poodle. On top of that they used old batteries in the camera so it jerks along worse than Edison's originals, with smear/blur special effects effects so most of the time you can't tell who is doing what to whom, just that it is violent and bloody.<br/><br/>For the sadistic, there is a remarkable scene where a helicopter pilot mows down a field of people with his rotor blades. Other than that scene there is a total lack of imagination.<br/><br/>The plot makes no sense. Why are children allowed into a bio-contaminated area. Why does a man knowingly kiss a woman infected with a deadly virus? Why do the ""zombies"" always go after people who are not infected rather than each other? Why is everyone so casual around a disease more terrible than ebola? Why did the Americans invade Britain knowing full well it was infected?"
"wrathchild712","9","2","5","15 May 2007"," Excellent second chapter for the franchise!
","Simply put, summer sequels should never work out this well. Normally, follow-ups to reasonably successful movies fall flat - it's nothing new. But this is a normal scenario; in most of these cases you'll have all of the superstars that made it's predecessor such a success coming back for more, and maybe the director if you're lucky. 28 Weeks Later, the follow-up to the brilliant 2002 flick 28 Days Later, went 0 for 2 here, losing not only visionary director Danny Boyle, but also its entire cast - which had no A-List stars but rather an infinitely more effective group of lesser-knowns. On paper, this movie was doomed to fail.<br/><br/>But amazingly, it doesn't. New director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has created an excellent new chapter for the franchise - a success in that it maintains the style of the first film, but still manages to be its own movie.<br/><br/>Arguably the biggest name in the movie is Robert Carlyle as a middle-aged Englishman named Don, although the film focuses primarily on the journey of his two children, Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots). We don't meet them immediately; the prologue beginning places them at refuge in Spain shortly after the first outbreak of the rage virus, setting us up for, yes - a zombie attack, and more importantly a key moment of cowardice from their father.<br/><br/>Following this, we learn of the events that followed the initial breakout of infection. Fast forward to today, and we see an American occupation/restoration attempt (sound familiar?) of the lone secure area of London, the Isle of Dogs. If the new populace stays within the boundaries, they're safe from infection. Right...if you give a child a new toy, is he really to be expected NOT to play with it?<br/><br/>Inevitably, Andy and Tammy's curiosity gets the better of them, and after a reunion with their father, they venture outside to explore their old home, setting off a chain of events that will introduce infection to the world again. Along the way, we meet an array of genuinely likable characters, including US Army nurse Scarlet (Rose Byrne) and the sympathetic sniper, Doyle (Jeremy Renner).<br/><br/>From a stylistic standpoint, Fresnadillo's clearly polished up the work of Days. The tight, frenetic camera work is still present, but the film no longer has that grainy quality that was the first film's lone miscue. In other words, the franchise no longer looks as though it's being shot on a Super-8 camera, and this is a welcome change. Special effects are perfectly utilized, particularly in one specific moment of desperation that is also the film's most notable for possible political undertone. The result is a work that looks the part of the Hollywood blockbuster it's sure to become while maintaining the best qualities of its lower- budget predecessor: endearing characters and an intriguing plot.<br/><br/>But now we're left with the vital question of whether to take the franchise a step further into 28 Months Later. Weeks sets that venture up perfectly, and with a possible return of Danny Boyle to the helm, one can only look forward to it with great anticipation.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"cpbadgeman","Null","2","5","14 May 2007"," Big thrills, huge plot-holes
","The first thing to note about this movie is that it is one of a very small group of films: a sequel that is as good as it's predecessor. However it excels in different ways, ""28 Days Later"" was primarily a psychological horror flick that examined how well-drawn characters who care for each other react to terrifying circumstances. ""28 Weeks"" is first and foremost an action movie loaded with large-scale effects-laden depictions of carnage.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly straightforward- seven months after the outbreak of the Rage virus, an American military force has started the task of reconstructing Britain. In order to repopulate the country, the surviving Britons are housed in a military base established on the Isle of Dogs in London. These survivors include 12 year-old Andy and his teenage sister Tam, together with their father (the fantastic Robert Carlyle) who knows more than he is telling about the fate of their mother. All of the original ""infected"" have starved to death, but it turns out that some people bitten during the epidemic never exhibited symptoms themselves but can still contaminate others. Needless to say, it's not long before all hell breaks loose and Andy and Tam- together with a U.S military doctor and an Army sniper- have to fight for their lives.<br/><br/>Though ""28 Weeks"" has a different director, the film has a very similar look to it's predecessor with lots of jump-cuts and jittery photography during the action scenes. Locations and music are both used very effectively also. Like in all the best zombie movies, there really is a sense that nowhere is safe and nobody can be trusted. The whole film exudes a deep sense of dread and menace, danger seems to lurk everywhere even when it appears there ought to be nothing to fear. The pace of the film grows increasingly relentless and it is genuinely exhilarating to watch the characters struggle against ever-increasing odds in order to stay alive and escape to safety. The action set pieces are stunningly executed- particularly one involving a field full of infected and a swooping helicopter.<br/><br/>However, all of this comes at price. The plot has some absolutely massive holes that most viewers will have no difficulty identifying. In ""28 Weeks"" things happen just because they do and necessary explanations are simply not provided. Having said that, this is a worthy sequel that provides lavish helpings of tension, exhilaration, and gore. Definitely worth seeing."
"gswanson17","7","2","5","13 May 2007"," A Nice Complement To The Original
","Twenty Eight Days Later became the cult smash of 2003 because of its radical departure from what made up the quintessential ""Zombie"" film. Instead of using a wide 2.85 ratio with long shots, it resorted to a more intimate scope with quick and jerky movement. Instead of comedic clichés and over-the top violence, there was intense fear and realistic gore. The film succeeds on many levels in its theatricality and style, but on others such as plot, it fails to enthrall the audience and feel like a shell, for what we all truly want to see on the screen.<br/><br/>After Danny Boyle left the film to do Sunshine, Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo stepped in. Fresnadillo incorporated much more flair into the film than its predecessor. The camera transforms London into a labyrinth of modern buildings and steel with sweeping crane shots, pans, and fast cuts. It lulls the audience into a sense of peace and security with allusions to the chaos that is soon to follow.<br/><br/>Unlike most of the previous film, Twenty Eight Week Later benefits due to the clash between the modern and the devastation. In Days it is the desolation of the countryside that contributes to the edginess of the film; here it is the exact opposite. Also, in Days the destruction has already happened, and the audience is catapulted immediately into the action and chaos of the Rage Virus. In Weeks, we are obviously aware that these events will happen (we wouldn't have a movie if they didn't, right?) but it's the how, when, where, and why that captivate us.<br/><br/>The place where the film stumbles is the plot. Clearly Fresnadillo's intentions were not to hit it out of the ball-park in complexity or inventiveness, but there are holesnot necessarily plot holes, but weak spots in the script where one has to question the logic behind decisions made. Obviously it creates frustration within the audience which was most likely Fresnadillo's intention, but there is a line that needs to be drawn between intentional creation of frustration and poor script writing.<br/><br/>The political themes in the film are very broad and much more unnoticeable than mentioned elsewhere. There is that very present ""Destroy everything to eliminate the few"" theme that perhaps can be construed by some as American foreign policy but this implication is very broad, and I sincerely doubt the filmmakers of a zombie film had that on the brain. Needless to say, it is slightly visible and is food for thought.<br/><br/>The film also takes some cheap shots in the horror department. This is not to say that this is the only film that has succumbed to that temptationmost modern horror films build upon the notion that their audience likes some throw away scares. However, there are too many of these and it becomes tiring for the audience as well as detrimental to the pacing of the film. It has its gore as well, but nothing incredibly shocking or grotesque is seen (i.e. torture shockers like Saw and Hostel.) Not all is lost because of the film's plot or shock tactics. Throughout the film there are many creative scenes, (The scene in the subway is wonderfully done and the scene with the helicopter is absolutely shocking.) The blaring rock music juxtaposed with escape scenes (such as with Robert Carlyle in the beginning) assaults the audience's ears creating a great tension that the audience desperately seeks to relieve.<br/><br/>All in all, Twenty Eight Weeks Later is a worthy addition to its extremely successful predecessor. What makes it successful is the 'give and take' this film experiences in relation to the original. What one film does, the other seeks to balance by doing the opposite. They complement each other perfectly similar to the success shared by the 'Alien and Aliens' films twenty years ago. In this summer of sequels and more, this is one film that definitely holds its weight against the slough of other films that will undoubtedly not turn out to be as successful."
"salted11","6","2","5","13 May 2007"," It started well, but afterwards, I just stopped caring.
","Aliens was a good sequel. It had marines. Bad alien screws stuff up, send in the Marines. They're all tough as nails with lots of cool kit, then it all goes to hell. This flick is something like that. London is supposedly Rage virus free and so a US-led NATO force is now on the ground helping with the reconstruction. The first thing I noticed was that there was an armed soldier about every three feet inside the Green Zone. The second thing I noticed was that the NATO force had no representation at all from like, you know, NATO. But whatever, this is a zombie movie right? I mean, they wouldn't make the flick if the zombies didn't come back, right? So right around the time they come back, I suddenly am told how the movie ends, but I won't ruin it for you, if you see it, it'll be pretty obvious. The rest of the movie is then spent trying to overlook the obvious ridiculousness of the American response and obvious lack of preparations. For instance, the zombies are fast and like to jump on people and bite them. So if I was planning a mission involving running zombies that bit, I think I'd want to put my soldiers in a big metal box with wheels. You know, like a tank. Or a personnel carrier that is armoured. I think they're called Armoured Personnel Carriers. Oh yeah, and the plan for containing the safe population from the infected, I think I'd want to avoid putting them all in one dark room with a fire exit that is completely unguarded. Might make for a problem. Oh yeah, and if I was flying around in a helicopter, I might want a guy in the back. You know, like a doorgunner. Oh, and if you're told to bring a kid along with you, that he's like, the saviour of man-kind, but he's also retarded and keeps wandering off without telling anyone and not responding when his own sister screams his name at the top of her lungs even though he's about three feet away? I'd leave the little turd behind. So is the movie worth seeing? Sure, why not, it's production value is good and there are some good shots, but when you're being shocked more from the steady stream of incidents of poor judgement rather than the zombies ripping people apart, you might want to think about renting it."

The story is great. I thought it was even better than the first one. The performance by the new cast is brilliant. I haven't seen horror film like this with so much action and guns. The opening scene of the film is scary and creepy. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did an amazing job directing this film. There is no question that the next installment will be call 28 Months later.

","""28 Weeks Later"" is gory, wicked and fun, that rare and impressive sequel that can stand alongside the film that inspired it.<br/><br/>In 2003's vicious and frighteningly real ""28 Days Later,"" a horrifying strain of athletic, bloodthirsty, virus-fueled zombies overran Great Britain, and ""Weeks"" is a vision of civilization trying to get a handle on that terrifying nightmare and rebuild in its wake.<br/><br/>The creators of the first film, director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland, serve as producers here, putting their gory baby in the hands of Spanish writer-director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (""Intacto""), and it turns out to be a trust well warranted.<br/><br/>For starters, Fresnadillo and his co-writers know that we still vividly recall the horrors of ""Days,"" so they begin in mid-plague, as it were, with a ragtag group waiting out the invasion in a rural cottage. Among them are Don (Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack), a couple whose children are on a school trip to Spain and thus safe from the virus. Alas, Mom and Dad are not. After a stunning assault on their hiding place, Don escapes alone.<br/><br/>Presently we learn what has happened in the wake of the awful outbreak: the quarantining of Great Britain; the death of the infected from starvation; the introduction of NATO troops to secure London for repopulation. Don's children (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton -- I swear those are their names) are among the returnees, and, determined to reclaim a remembrance of their mother, they sneak out of the secure area to their old house for mementos. What they find is much worse, and before the chief science officer (Rose Byrne) can get a handle on the situation, the infection has blossomed again and the military does what militaries are meant to do.<br/><br/>Just as ""Days"" contained echoes of 9/11, so does ""Weeks"" allude freely to the Iraq war: the use of tools of warfare against an invisible force that turns civilians into enemies; a ""green zone,"" surrounded by snipers, within which a new country is being planned; the decision to destroy a place in order to save it.<br/><br/>But that's subtext. On the surface is a thrilling and chilling and sometimes grisly zombie movie that occasionally loses its way in genre conventions but generally keeps you locked into a heightened tension. I give the slight edge to the first movie because I prefer Boyle's craft to Fresnadillo's, but the action is more intense here, and I greeted the thought of a third film -- virtually assured in the closing shots -- with a little yip of ""Yes!"" Likely you will, too."

","The terror of the Rage Virus, an experiment that went wrong and destroyed most of Britain during 28 Days Later, has returned to a country devastated and a US led NATO effort to rebuild. However, as can happen, what was once thought gone has returned with even deadly consequences.<br/><br/>Don (Robert Carlye) is one of a few survivors who has managed to remain safe and hidden from the population of the Rage infested. Along with his wife and several other survivors, their existence is kept secret and safe until they are discovered and quickly overcome during one of the most intense horror scenes in recent movie history. Don is able to escape but only after leaving behind his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) in order to save his own life. Later, this theme becomes important and the irony of it being that this relationship has much to blame for the second outbreak.<br/><br/>28 Weeks after the first outbreak, a US led NATO force has occupied much of London. The population of Rage infected has died off due to starvation weeks earlier and now a clean up operation is established in order to bring back expatriates. Among the arrivals is Tammy (Imogen Poots) and her younger brother Andy (Mackintosh Muggelton) who happen to be the children of Don and Alice. Sent away from England before the outbreak, Tammy and Alice return to a country that is empty and abandoned as well as their father who has found employment with the occupation forces. It is their first day with him that he ""explains"" what happens to their mother and why it is she is no longer with them. As children often do, they accept what they are told and grieve for their loss.<br/><br/>However their father's lie becomes obvious when, during an attempt to return to their old home outside the safe zone where US forces have locked down the refugees, Andy discovers their mother hidden away in their home. It is then that she is discovered by the US Army which quickly wants to know if she is infected and how she could have lived so long on her own. Alice herself seems almost fine if not in a state of shock.<br/><br/>Alice is discovered to have a rare gene that allows her to be immune from the effect of the Rage Virus even if she remains a carrier herself. It is through Don, who is stunned as his children to discover that she is alive, that the outbreak returns just as quickly. Within a single day the entire safe zone the US military has established is overrun forcing General Stone (Idris Elba) to declare a Code Red: an order to kill everyone moving whether someone is infected or not.<br/><br/>Tammy and Andy find themselves protected by a Major with the US Army named Scarlet (Rose Byrne) and Sergeant Doyle (Jeremy Renner). While much of the action moves too quickly to establish much depth for the characters or even plot, the military response to the outbreak is shown as quick and merciless. Non-infected humans are shot down quickly without a second thought before air strikes and chemical weapons are used. Scarlet, who believes that both Tammy and Andy hold the same gene of their mother, wants them protected at all cost. In this her wish is granted even if it means her own death and Doyle's but the two are taken off the island..... Even if Andy himself was infected by his own father.<br/><br/>The question of Andy become more important when clips of Paris, along with calls for help over a French radio, show the signs of an outbreak on Continental Europe.... 28 days later.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later lacked the amount of depth that 28 Days Later was able to create. Besides Don, Tammy, and Andy, every other character has little growth or even to say beyond the stereotypical roles we see in movies like this. The violence is there but often the camera shots are so quick and rapid that it's hard to take in everything that is happening. The idea that the US and Europe would allow so many to return without much more protection or even a real reason besides being British is rather far fetched and I wondered how the rest of the world would have seen such a failure. It would seem as if the very attempt to create a new England only destroyed what little remained of the old one.<br/><br/>However, 28 Weeks Later is a good movie if one can ignore some of the weaker aspects of the plot. The question of what happened after 28 Days Later is answered and now what remains to be answered is the consequence for the rest of the world.<br/><br/>9/10"

","""28 weeks later"" is just another of those sequels that do not live up to your expectations, unless you have seen enough to learn to curb your expectations, as I did.<br/><br/>Those who have experienced the breadth of imaginative landscape of ""28 days later"" but have forgotten a lot of it can perhaps use a reminder:<br/><br/>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/usercomments-616 <br/><br/>Those who have not seen ""28 days later"" need nothing more than a very brief background that a strange virus coming out of a lab test gone wrong turns people into zombies in London. While ""28 days later"", after starting with this plot, leaves it behind as nothing more than a vague backdrop and takes flight into a world of creative imagination, showing you things, one after another, that surprise, delight and trouble, ""28 weeks later"" picks up the zombie plot, period, and gives us a run-of-the-mill zombie thriller. It is not bad, mind you, just far from being good.<br/><br/>I wouldn't waste time with a plot summary  it's simple and predictable, often two or three steps ahead. Several sequences (mostly scenes of chases) have a distinct music video flavour and are quite enjoyable. The scares, however, if there really are any, are quite incompetent, relying on sudden loud sounds and blood, blood and more blood. If you really insist on sub-texts, you could look at mass hysteria getting out of control and heavy-handed military counter-measure.<br/><br/>The unfamiliar (but not entirely unrecognizable) British cast is at least a welcome change from all-too-familiar Hollywood faces. A delightful surprise is seeing, in an unfortunately anything-but-delightful role, Catherine McCormack who was such a captivating beauty, playing Murron MacClannough in ""Braveheart"" (Mel Gibson's short-lived young bride)."
"hark2oo2","8","2","5","11 May 2007"," very good movie in general, not just horror
","I don't remember the first movie as much as i should (will check it out again in a bit), i just remember not liking it as much as everyone else seemed to. I really wanted to love it though, because it was the first ""zombie"" movie in a long time (yes, i know its not traditional lumbering zombies, but it did blaze a path for more zombie movies over the past few years). One thing i do remember is the atmosphere and the frenetic, shaky cam style of action. Those are definitely back in the sequel, but with that being said, I won't compare these two very much.<br/><br/>I don't know where to start... maybe I'll start with the bad. There is a particular scene that is really cool to see, but seems a tad too goofy for the serious tone of the rest of the film. There are also some big coincidences, and stupid actions (mostly by the kids) that crop up here and there. The shaky cam style is getting pretty old also, but it is effective in showing how crazy and intense things get. A tacked on last scene that is totally unneeded caps off the worst of the movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>Bring on the positives: Although just briefly mentioned, the way the city is being rebuilt and controlled shows more intelligence than your average horror movie. There are parallels that can easily be drawn to current events (as with almost every zombie movie... kinda funny that to the non-fan, ""zombie movie"" makes something sound stupid, when in truth they are usually very intelligent). The characters are deep enough to care about. There is a decent amount of emotional tension, and some decisions and actions that are taken are given room to show both points of view and how not everything is ""good guy, bad guy"". The action is intense and the pace is great. The is some very striking visual imagery in the movie also... some of the shots they show really are remarkable.<br/><br/>I don't have much bad to say about this movie, and i don't want to say too much of the good stuff either because i don't want to ruin anything. As stated earlier, there are problems, but they do not weigh the movie down that much. I would like to see people that don't like horror movies or zombie movies, to give this one a chance"

","I'm amazed that anyone could have given this movie better than a 1. I'd personally give this junk minus 10. It's inconsistent, the acting direction was terrible, so many random and senseless violent scenes that the movie was no longer scary... I don't blame the actors in this movie at all. I blame the screen writer which made this junk (I can't call it a movie) painful to watch. Then 2nd I blame the director's amazing ability to destroy an amazing story. The first movie (28 Days) was excellent regardless of its flaws... but this sequel was just outrageously bad. They were given a great story/premise and they literally hacked it to pieces. I was so excited to see this 2nd half to the story. Get some closure... IHMO, the worst sequel to any movie I've seen over the last 25 years!

","There hasn't been a horror movie like this in a very long time! Horror movies today only rely on gore to please the audience (which doesn't work anymore) but this film has a slightly different kind of gore. The gore is only used when it needs to be and sometimes has over the top scenes but it surprising makes the film more watchable! <br/><br/>The acting was incredible! Everything they reacted to, you felt like you would do the exact same thing! Similar to the original, the actors aren't famous Hollywood stars that are recognized by everyone. They have the realistic looks of any average person. Which adds a lot more depth to their characters, and you know you can relate to them. The kids in the film were surprisingly good and intelligent unlike Hollywood child stars today.<br/><br/>Throughout the film you are always engaged and want to watch more. When the movie ended I didn't want it to end, I kept wanting more and more non-stop action. The opening scene is a truly amazing classic horror film moment. Just from the beginning you can tell this movie will deliver what you were expecting and more!<br/><br/>The music is great! The movie score does play the emotions of fear, sorrow, and emptiness very well. I simply can not wait for this film to come out on DVD. I recommend this film to every horror, thriller, action movie fan out there!"

We walked out before the end - mainly because the kids were so annoying. If I hadn't seen the original and just wanted to see a zombie film - it's not that bad. However, if you are expecting more of the original - don't bother with this."

Secondly, there is a lot of psychology included and this makes a very realistic movie, I do believe something like that could really happen.

","I'm a huge fan of zombie flicks and from the very beginning this movie delivers. There is tension through the entire film and the story line was put together smoothly. In the downtime the movie was still suspenseful. I actually thought this was better than the first film '28 Days Later'. Unlike it predecessor, this film starts out with pure zombie action and finishes with pure zombie action. The last film, although providing a fine storyline, was very boring at times, this film will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good zombie-blood-gore film. For those with a weak stomach, you'll know this isn't for you in the first 5 minutes of the film. For those who dig the idea of zombies taking over the planet and the human race fighting against it, this is that movie to see."
"tortious_dude","2","2","6","27 May 2007"," Empty London
","OK, so 28 Days Later wasn't wonderful; it was a perfectly watchable zombie flick with some nice touches. On this basis I had no intention of seeing 28 Weeks Later at the cinema -- after all, it was a remake of an average film. The chances were that the new film was going to be exactly that: average.<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying 'average' would have been a blessing. My friend and I decided on 28 Weeks Later because the queues for the new 3rd instalments -- Pirates and Shreck -- were extremely long. All in all, i wish we'd queued.<br/><br/>The film itself lacks two vital components of a decent film; one being plot and the other being dialogue. I've read many of the reviews on here that mention the believability of the film. Would the US army have done what they did? How did those children escape the Isle of Dogs? Who knows. I don't go to the cinema to pick holes in fantastical ideas. No, the film was awful in-spite of its premise.<br/><br/>The beginning, with Robert Carlyle running away from the zombie invaders, is quite cool. There's plenty of action and it's genuinely well paced and interesting. However, once the ex-pats are repatriated to England the plot loses its way. The first problem is the lack of plot. In-fact, it's the same as the last plot with an add-on. Whereas before the virus was the thing everyone was scared of, now the US military, after losing control of the situation, are slaughtering Britons on sight. So that's the plot -- there's no delving into the science of the virus, no character development beyond 'dad loved his children, but is unfortunately a zombie now' and the rag-tag band of survivors who escape the Isle of Dogs are pretty wooden characters. Once they've escaped the Isle of Dogs, the plot is literally 'get to Regents park without being shot by Americans or eaten by zombies'. So, we have a survival road-movie. There are long drawn-out interludes of an Empty London and the film pretty much montages the journey from Greenwich to Regents Park (the route is accurate, by the way -- take it from a Londoner).<br/><br/>When they get to Regents Park, with a minimum of dialogue, you think ""well, thank God that's over!"" But not quite, the helicopter pilot won't take the Britons with him and re-arranges a pick up at Wembley Stadium. Great. So there's another 20 minutes of their journey to Wembley stadium replete with shouting, screaming, crying, but no talking. At one point they end up in the underground, presumably taking the Jubilee Line to Wembley Park, but that's never quite explained.<br/><br/>And that's it. That's the plot. Virus breaks out, American army loses control and decides to terminate repatriated Brits, go to Regents Park, go to Wembley Stadium. The other problem is the complete lack of dialogue in the film. There's very little talking at all, meaning that one learns very little. Nothing more is uncovered about the virus. The characters are without a history or back-story. There's no discussion about policy or intention on repatriation. Nothing. Just no talking. Instead there are pictures of an empty London.<br/><br/>My final 2 gripes are this: How on earth did the zombies get into the 'holding area'? All the Britons were down there; the zombies were at the door; the camera seemed to whizz around so you didn't have a clue what was going on and, bang! Zombies in the room! I thought they were locked in?? And secondly, the ending was completely unsatisfactory. They escaped to France but then France got the virus. Presumably they're dead after that ordeal. Fantastic! Well, that's it. As a sightseeing tour of London it's a fantastic piece of work. I've never seen the place looking so peaceful. But that's where the fun ends. As an interesting, plot-driven film it's utter trash."
"teh_mode","7","2","6","25 May 2007"," Raging good fun
","No one does post-apocalyptic films like Britain, and 28 Weeks Later is no exception. The film begins with a group of refugees hidden away in a shack somewhere in the English countryside. The plague outbreak is still running rampant, so they take every precaution possible. Among those shacked up are Robert Carlyle and his wife. Unfortunately, the rage-infected killers find their way to the shack and begin proceeding to bang their way in. Rather than staying to fight, Carlyle leaves his wife and companions and runs away. 28 weeks later, London is declared a ""safe zone"" by a NATO-lead American force, who are now occupying the city. The area of the Isle of Dogs is now a large refuge camp, with heavy military occupation. The outer limits of London are still not ""safe"", although Britain itself has been declared under a system of ""containment"". You don't have to be a genius to work out the parallels between the film and the US-lead occupation of Iraq. The US army have set up a reconstruction policy of ""containment"" where a set of land is considered a ""safe zone"" when it clearly isn't. When all hell breaks lose, it is not just the hoards of rage-infected beasts that are terrorising the refugees.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later is splattertastic stuff. The action is frenetic, the gore is unrelenting and the horror is full on. The real treat of all this is seeing it take place in around the east London docklands. Watching hundreds of bloodthirsty killers raging through canary wharf, the millennium dome and the grain and dirt of those factory-outlet areas, we are treated to a vision of London that is all to often glossed over. It has meat, both subtextually and masochistically. It even has a cameo by the docklands light railway. For some gorrific entertainment, you can't go wrong with 28 Weeks Later."
"annoman","8","2","6","19 May 2007"," '28 Weeks Later' is a refined horror in its own, let alone as a sequel.
","Oh, the terror! '28 Weeks Later,' the long-awaited follow-up to 2002's British horror, '28 Days Later,' which was met with much acclamation from critics and horror-hounds the same, was scowled upon by dubious skeptics in its early days of production. The first film was delivered smartly and bluntly, with loads of gory fun; and was at the sure hands of one of Britain's finest, Danny Boyle. So what of '28 Weeks Later?'<br/><br/>'28 Weeks Later' seems to steer clear of this summer's pack of dimwitted horror sequels (led by Fox Atomic's other release, 'The Hills Have Eyes 2'), with its increased budget and the addition of semi-well-knowns, Robert Carlyle and Jeremy Renner. However, why the change of directors? It's hard enough to transition from a familiar cast to a completely new one, while at the same time maintaining the interest of potential viewers. Though, for a film to change directors, typically suggests a new style  one different from Boyle's shaky under-lit method that brought '28 Days Later' its believable atmosphere; and a dissimilar technique could potentially lose a good part of the first film's fanbase.<br/><br/>Well, a very much deserved kudos to Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who welcomed the challenge and left not only victorious, but neck-and-neck with Boyle's insight into one of horror's best one-two punches of all time. In fact, Fresnadillo's techniques appear to have been crafted by Boyle himself, who took on the role of executive producer, alongside Alex Garland, for the franchise's second offering. Everything that was seen in Boyle's first chapter is seen here. However, in the sequel, everything's been magnified. There's more terror, more gore and more rage-infested zombies than in the first film; the excitement's been heightened, the panic's been intensified, and this year has found its most clever horror since its own predecessor!<br/><br/>The film opens with a husband and his wife (played respectively by Robert Carlyle and the terrific Catherine McCormack), shacked up in a cottage with a four others in rural London. When the cottage is overrun by the infected, Don (Carlyle) escapes to the countryside, leaving his wife and all others for his own safety. After twenty-eight weeks of reconstruction, a secured district guarded by American army forces becomes the temporary home for Don and other estranged refugees, including Don's two children, Tammy and Andy. All's well until the two rascals escape the guarded boundaries, only to return with the virus's passage back into the film.<br/><br/>'28 Weeks Later' is reflective of the war in Iraq, and gives wonder to how our troops are keeping containment. The adroitness of Fresnadillo's craft behind the lens is scary in its own. As the panic in the film ensues, it is captured with grave detail by Fresnadillo's mix of sporadic and monotone shots. The acting is anything but what one would expect from any horror film, and is pushed forth by the perfectly cast Jeremy Renner and Catherine McCormack as Alice, who gives a horrifying performance. If I could say one thing about this film, I'd scream to all of the fear, and the fearlessness in which it portrays. It'll bite you and bite you hard, and it won't let go until your heart's skipped twenty-eight beats!"
"sk8xgms","10","2","6","19 May 2007"," The best horror movie I have ever seen...
","I am usually not the biggest horror fan. I enjoy seeing a movie that will either make me want to cry, make me want to become a special agent in the military or make me laugh... thats it.<br/><br/>A few years ago, when 28 Days Later was released on DVD my friend forced me to watch it and I was so glad he did. The movie was not just a bunch of unrealistic zombies killing everybody in sight, it had human vs. human drama. Once I saw that film, it automatically became tops for me and was my favorite horror movie.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I went to go see this movie. I was scared out of my mind before I went to see it mainly because it was a different director and a different writer. If that is the reason you do not want to see this movie, DON'T LET IT BE! The director and writer of this film totally saved that ""feel"" that the first film captures so perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie totally pulled a Godfather and was better than the first movie, which I thought was unbeatable. This is the best horror film ever made, that's my input."
"Agent10","8","2","6","19 May 2007"," As good as a non-sequential sequel goes
","Now a lot of people were initially skeptical about this movie. No Jim, no Naomi and no Hannah in this movie. You got to be kidding me!! It looked like a lame attempt by some lame Americans trying to Americanize (therefore making it lame) a perfectly good Euro-thriller. What we got was something far different.<br/><br/>28 Weeks can't top 28 Days, which is something I want to mention right away. But this film was surprisingly effective. While it did possess some plot holes, they were not enough of an issue to make the movie unwatchable. What we get with this installment is a taut and gripping movie that is both political and intriguing in its composition. From the first scene of Robert Carlisle running for his life to the last, we get a sense that the gloom and doom of this world follows the original vision of the film a little more closely. We all know Danny Boyle wanted Jim to die a the end of 28 Days Later...., but he chose to make the ending much happier. This movie is just downright bleak, a perfect reminder that not all cool movies need to be happy at the end to leave a feeling of satisfaction when you leave the theater. <br/><br/>Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did the best he could even though he had to use the cheap mediums of CGI to get the same effect 28 Days Later did without them. But one thing he did maintain was just the downright creepiness of the Rage victims. Unrelenting and genuinely scary, their thirst is still quite a sight to see. While the ambiguous ending laid the foundation of another sequel, at least they proved a movie with a completely different cast and crew can still carryover quite well."
"mrniceguy21","8","2","6","15 May 2007"," Good shock flick - compares very favourably to the original
","28 Weeks Later builds on the tension, horror and shock value of the first film and delivers a new level of frights and scares that had the people in the packed movie theatre I was in gasping, jumping in their seats and hiding their eyes behind their shaking hands.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later continues the story of the Rage Virus that has decimated the UK, and sees the US Military establishing quarantine Zones for survivors in an effort to repopulate London. The virus is thought to be extinct after all the infected have starved to death, but of course, it's not long before an infected survivor brings the Rage virus into the safe zone, and all hell breaks loose as the Military is forced to execute Code Red - total extermination of the population.<br/><br/>The storyline is original, the way that the virus reappears is quite clever, and the pace never lets up in a film that is sure to please and shock most viewers. The scares come thick and fast, the soundtrack is relentless and there are many claustrophobic and highly impressive cinematographic scenes that serve to scare, unnerve and increase the tension.<br/><br/>Spoilers FOLLOW! The scenes in the crowded underground when the lights go off and one zombie manages to decimate half the survivors is truly frightening, and the scene with the helicopter decapitating the zombies on the hill is awesome.<br/><br/>Rose Byrne is excellent in this Ripley-esquire role, and the children aren't the typical annoying or precocious screen brats, so you actually empathise with all the main characters and pray for their survival.<br/><br/>Be warned, there are gory scenes and it is extremely graphic and violent in places (Robert Carlisle gives his wife some tough love!) but it certainly provides entertainment. <br/><br/>There were a few places when the crowd laughed (Robert Carlisle tells his wife he is happy she's alive after leaving her for dead months earlier) and many people left the cinema talking excitedly about the film and recapping their favourite scene.<br/><br/>Good movie, great scare and good entertainment - recommended but not for young kids or a date movie :P"
"Aaron1375","8","2","6","14 May 2007"," 28 weeks later a frenetic nonstop horror thrill ride.
","I first have to admit I did not much care for 28 days later, however, part of my dislike for that movie may stem from the fact a review I read said it was like ""Dawn of the Dead"" which it wasn't really. Still, I may not be as harsh on it now as I was when I first saw it, I found it was a bit slow at times and you really never got to see the best horror, only have it described to you by the one person talking about how people were in a panic and that one by one people turned. Here you get to see exactly that. The movie starts with a bang as a husband flees from the rage infected hordes of people having left his wife behind seemingly to die, flash to 28 weeks later and the city is being repopulated slowly, but surely as the husband from the beginning is reunited with his kids who are extremely stupid. Yes, they do what they are not supposed to and go into a non safe area in search of their old house so they can pick up a few mementos of their mum. Well surprise, surprise their mother is alive, though not so well and is taken back to the city for examination. Well we soon find out why you should stay in the safe zone as the infection begins again and I am pretty sure most of the people who have returned home are now thinking maybe we should not have returned. The infection spreads as fast as described in the first movie, there is panic in the streets and the military is now in kill mode as our two kids are joined by a medical officer and a military man not keen on shooting everyone in sight whether infected or not. So you have cool chases with both the infected and the military and the characters in this one don't have much time to do anything, but catch their breath. Very good and fast paced horror movie."
"jaypugh","9","2","6","14 May 2007"," One of the Best Horror Films in a Long Time
","I went into the theater not having a clue as what to expect with this movie. I had seen a very short trailer that didn't give anything away and I'm glad for this.<br/><br/>I was so afraid that this was going to be yet another zombie movie that is set in some post apocalyptic time frame where the movie feels more like Mad Max with Zombies than it feels like a horror movie. Don't get me wrong, I will still watch these and love them but not like 28 Weeks Later. I loved how this had a very realistic progression from the first story. If something like this did happen in real life then I can see things being realistically similar to 28 Weeks Later. A NATO force, particularly US forces moving in to help contain the problem was spot on. This wasn't only realistic but also made a great back drop for zombie killing fun and 28 Weeks does it with style. One of the other things I liked a lot was the retaining of the look of the first film as well as the sound. I've seen plenty of people mention the love of the grainy film type used to keep the feel of the first film but few mention the music that was the same or at least very close to the same as the first. Both of these things really helped me like this film along with its predecessor. The rabid, ultra furious zombies on crack are back as 28 Weeks continues to show the advantage of not using slow dumb zombies as the enemy. To say that it is more intense to see a very quick rabid looking zombie actually running after people is more intense than traditional zombies would be an understatement. To the credit of traditional zombie films I guess I should point out of course that what we call zombies in 28 Days and 28 Weeks aren't zombies at all as one would define them in past zombie films since they aren't even dead. We are really talking about a virus that infects humans and makes them crave flesh. I guess it would be more funny than scary to see a half rotten corpse running full speed like those infected in 28 Days/Weeks. Nevertheless, my point is that the infected zombie like creatures in the 28 Days/Weeks movies really build tension to the max with their ferocity. About the only thing I wish I had seen in 28WL would have been the original actors from 28 Days. I had really grown fond of the characters in the first film and would have liked to have seen them involved in the second. Then again, I suppose they wouldn't have transitioned into the updated storyline very easily. So, this is merely a minor complaint and is really rather picky considering how great 28WL was. I hope to see a 28 Months later before too long. :-)"

","I grew to like 28 Days Later originally and even watched it again recently. I was eager to see if the sequel would do anything different or better.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert: It does by adding children, a silly ""pop-up"" father, and panic stricken American Military. The movie begins well enough with a gathering of what initially appears to be a family holed up in an old farmhouse and the first 20 min or so are pretty scary. The rest is a bloody mess devoid of plot and sure to arrive on DVD next week (its that poor).<br/><br/>So many scenes beg to be expanded - including the relationship the two children have, which almost made me care about them. Heck the first scene set up a whole movie that was never explored as far as I am concerned. Even a flashback to how they all got to the farmhouse would have been much more entertaining.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert:<br/><br/>The reintroduction of the Father in the story (to say more would be unfair to those who haven't seen this bloody mess of a film yet) makes the story just plain silly.<br/><br/>The much ballyhooed surprise ending made me laugh out loud...it was that stupid.<br/><br/>I give one star for the first 20 minutes and two stars for the children.

Most of the action in this film is so hyper and it is just like the director stood right next to it and shook the camera around to make it seem insane. Im very tired of this type of filming. It really ruins movies for me nowadays. The setup dragged on a bit long and truthfully you don't see much of the infected except for a lot of running around. That being said however, there are some very killer moments in the last half that make up for all this.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>The bombing and chemical weapon scenes were very cool. Their was a true intensity not seen in most horror movies today in these parts, and you really were not sure who would live and die. The nightvision gunscope scene was awesome. Very reminiscent of Blair Witch and The Descent, with a very serious tension I haven't felt in a while. And last but not least, the helicopter mutilation. The best death scene in any movie ever, period.<br/><br/>END POSSIBLE SPOILERS All in all it is worth the time and money to check this one out in the theater, but if there is a third, I truly hope they get rid of this shaky camera nonsense.

","28 Weeks Later is certainly not a bad movie by any means. This is why people's subjective points of view are unneeded.

I felt like I was just watching bodies pile followed by close-ups of brutality with In A Heartbeat (the score from the previous film) being played GOD KNOWS how many times. <br/><br/>My biggest gripe was with the thumb-in-eye thing: what the hell? Boyle did this in the first one to show human behavior in a state of rage and survival and how it mirrored the behaviors of the infected. They throw in Don newly infected doing it to his wife while she was strapped to a bed; seriously? From then on the movie leaves horror territory and starts becoming a sadist's playground."

","I am surprised to see so many positive reviews for 28 weeks later, as in my opinion it bares little comparison to its excellent predecessor the movie just keep on going without making any proper sense half of the time it really gets frustrating when they just show scene that just not make sense in many scenes there is just no logic behind . There are too many plot holes in th movie it looks like there are plot holes in plot holes it a disaster . How come the kid get out of the security how come there was nobody to guard the woman infected.. i have seen many bad movies but after watching this they seem pretty good. hats off to writers they should make this movie the standards against which all badness should be measured"

","28 Weeks Later is directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo who also co-writes with Rowan Joffe, Jesus Olmo and E. L. Lavigne. It stars Robert Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Harold Perrineau, Catherine McCormack, Mackintosh Muggleton and Imogen Poots. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Enrique Chediak.<br/><br/>Six months have passed since the Rage Virus decimated the UK, but now people are returning to London's District 1 with the U.S. Military overseeing the project. However, the Rage Virus can be carried in people with no outward symptoms.<br/><br/>After the monster success of ""28 Days Later"" it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. With director/writer combo Danny Boyle and Alex Garland off making ""Sunshine"" with Cillian Murphy, the big players from the first film were missing (Boyle and Garland were Executive Producers here). There was reasonable cause for some concern that this would be the latest in a long line of horror sequels that, quite frankly, suck the big one. How great to find that not only is ""Weeks"" an excellent sequel, it also doesn't sit idle and copy Boyle's winning formula.<br/><br/>The blood and ick factor is considerably amped up, as is the action (there's running, lots of running, guns, lots of guns, panic, lots of panic), but the writers have put intelligence into the writing by expanding on the Rage Virus victims as not just being an outwardly ferocious beast, and some topical smarts are spliced into the narrative with the presence of the American military ""enforcing"" the reconstruction of London. Also, with the film's central focus being on a splintered family, brilliantly set up by the breathtaking/horrifying opening 10 minutes, there's a mighty heft of humanism flowing in between the blood vomit and body shredding.<br/><br/>Cast are mostly terrific, with Carlyle and the impressive young actors, Poots and Muggleton, leading the way. The American lads playing military men have to make do with slender written stock roles, but Byrne provides spunk and McCormack leaves an indelible mark in a small, but key, role. Fresnadillo (Intacto) ensures Boyle isn't missed in the director's chair, with a keen eye for action construction and an awareness of pacing for such a horror movie. While Murphy again scores with that knack for doom mongering beats. There's some missteps, logic at times goes out the window and in the case of Renner's character, outcome is a bit too much of a bitter pill to swallow. While dialogue at times shops at ""Clichés ""R"" Us"". But this is still a mighty fine thrill ride, often scary and stomach turning, and even flecked with emotional worth. On this evidence a part 3 would be most welcome. 8/10"
"bussboy","8","1","2","22 July 2011"," Different movie than the first, completely enjoyable.
","I almost feel the need to review some of the ""bad"" reviews listed by users for this film. Seriously, there's a reason that you don't write professionally let alone review films professionally. Anyway... 28 Days made an excellent comment on the human condition by posing the question: Is violence a necessary aspect of humanity? Violence might be necessary to create order as personified by the English soldiers welcoming the crew into their occupied estate. I found 28 Weeks as completely enjoyable as it's original in different ways. It was a different movie with different characters set in a different time of the same story setting. I almost feel the second (28 Weeks) to be more serious in tone. 28 Days had moments of dry wit spliced between moments of sheer terror, but the feel of the film felt more playful and philosophical. I feel the funniest parts of 28 Weeks was it's moments of over the top gore. I don't mean to equate violence with humor but gore can be likened to slapstick comedy depending on it's context i.e. helicopter in the field scene. Many people seem to focus on the unbelievability of the movie. Guess what. It's an unbelievable premise. So was the first one. It's a movie. It's a zombie movie. Actually here's another thing that irks me. They aren't zombies, people. They're infected with a virus that induces extreme rage. If you don't view them as zombies but as people who are enraged beyond anything that you or I could possibly imagine, it makes sense that the father figure retains some if not only a small bit of his rational thought prior to being infected much like the infected soldier in 28 Days they were keeping chained and alive for purposes of study. There's a moment where Jim sets him free and he is completely conscious while being a ""zombie"" and recognizes what Jim intends for him to do. Also why is it so unbelievable for some people to accept that the children wanted to escape the occupied zone to go back to their home to gather personal effects? OK, maybe they're kids and it's impossible for them to escape a border of soldiers, but the tone was set. It's 6 months after any sign of existing infected person. The American soldiers that are there are bored. No one sees the threat as imminent anymore. It is a relaxed occupation where refugees are made to be comfortable in high-rise apartments as rebuilding of society is quickly underway. The kids escape and are scooped up rather quickly, considering. It's a movie. It's not the best movie but far from the worst. Definitely is deserving of more than 1 star. I would expect maybe 5 on the low end and 8 on the higher end. Oh, one more thing that bugs me. This is not an Americanized remake or sequel. It's not a typical Hollywood movie. The same makers of the original had their hands in the production of the sequel. I feel if you enjoyed the first one, it's entirely possible to enjoy this sequel especially given that most sequels and/or remakes or re-imaginings are crap. I read somewhere someone likening it to Aliens vs. Alien. I find that a completely accurate comparison. Guess what. Aliens was fantastic as a sequel as well and I can and will defend that movie if need be but not here."
"Bloodwank","6","1","2","21 June 2011"," Fun though flawed sequel schlock
","28 Days Later was, passé final block aside a near ace slice of post apocalypse horror and something of a sleeper hit, leading inevitably to a sequel. Fortunately for those of us who value some level of artistic integrity, 28 Weeks Later is pretty solid stuff and nicely ballsy, albeit to flawed to really rock out or make much more than a superficial impression. It differentiates itself from the original tale by being one of destruction rather than aftermath, in this one we have a state of order and its spectacular disruption, the horror unfolding in front of us. Regrettably it also differentiates itself with absurd contrivance, the two events unleashing horror both utterly unbelievable in the realistic context in which the film sets itself. It's all the more galling because the opening sequence gives us a bleakly realistic depiction of human frailty, total contrast to the painfully irksome generic screw ups to come. The final moments fall prey to the same problem, though I kinda give them a pass on amusement value. The biggest problem aside from this is comes in the camera work which is in a few key moments of the shaky variety. This kind of fast camera, fast cutting work only tends to be effective when used by directors with a smart feeling for the kinetic and Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, though undoubtedly talented (watch Intacto kids), doesn't really have this. He is much better at more traditional means of depicting carnage though, giving us lots of nicely shot shootings and a simply magical scene of helicopter violence that had me near cheering. A decent amount of bloodshed here and it gives the film most of its kick. The rest is provided by its mirror of mass carnage to personal trauma, it is a film given to kicking happy go lucky cliché in the teeth and all the better for it, moreover it does so in a fashion that feels organic and not just a cheesy means of the writers showing off some edge. Acting is reasonable throughout, Robert Carlyle is the standout as a devoted dad, but the lovely Rose Byrne does a decent tough but tender job and Jeremy Renner gives a likable show as a good hearted soldier. There are a couple of kids key to the affair though and neither are up to much, they aren't terrible but I can comfortably say that I wanted both to die in gruesome fashion for their role in the whole debacle, but mostly to give the adults more screen mileage. Lets face it, most child actors are horrendously unsympathetic compared to their adult counterparts and almost always less talented and this is the case here. Everything bowls along pretty nicely though, nothing made me want to eat my laptop in irritation so this one gets a OK score for the good stuff, high 6/10."
"rooee","6","1","2","4 June 2011"," The guts and the ingloriousness
","Danny Boyle directed 28 Days Later, and he exec-produced this sequel as part of his burgeoning partnership with Alex Garland. Directing duties fell to Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, creator of 2001's ingenious Intacto. He stamps his authority on the picture with a startling opening sequence: a dizzying attack on a country farmhouse, which not only violently reminds us that these are far from George Romero's shambling knuckle-draggers, but also that anyone – man or woman, young or old – is fair game. It sets the tone. It sets the rules.<br/><br/>Next we're thrown into a grimy, semi-deserted London (reminiscent of another Spanish-speaking director's apocalyptic vision, Children of Men). It's here that Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) arrive to meet their father, Don (Robert Carlyle). But something is rotten as a corpse within the family unit, and the kids take it upon themselves to sneak out of the militarised zone to put a full-stop on their unfinished childhood. What they discover unleashes hell, and it's up to the US occupying forces, led by a stolid Idris Elba, to quash the infected insurgency.<br/><br/>The film's early sequences contain some creepy, classical horror imagery, usually concerning Catherine McCormack's stricken Alice, before the film gives way to a series of expansive, logic-be-damned action set-pieces. As a marriage of styles it's not quite as broken as Alice and Don's, but it makes the film feel lopsided.<br/><br/>While The Walking Dead proves that the zombie holocaust genre hasn't really the flesh to fill a whole series, an extra 20 minutes wouldn't have gone amiss from 28 Weeks, just to add a little meat to the bony characters – particularly Jeremy Renner's pragmatic Doyle, who seems to be riding on a kind of Hurt Locker zephyr, but with hints of a heart. Rose Byrne, likewise, as Scarlet, can only show a glimmer of the utilitarian behind the perma-frown.<br/><br/>There's no profundity on offer here, just basic moral dilemmas as fleeting as a moving target in a gun sight. At a push there's a veiled allegory about post-war Britain's reliance on the US; and moreover, particularly in one barmy sniper sequence, a crack at repeated ""friendly fire"" debacles in the theatres of madness mired in the Middle East. But it's really about the visceral thrills. Like its predecessor, budget restraints are a blessing not a curse, forcing imaginative film-craft and rabid performances into the space that, one fears, CGI excess will occupy when the infection extends to 28 Months."
"filmfan887","8","1","2","4 February 2011"," Great Zombie and Horror film
","This blew ""28 Days Later"" out of the water, though still a good movie. Both movies lack a good storyline, but they have their own artistic qualities.<br/><br/>This movie is filmed much like The Bourne series, and I love the angle in which many scenes are shot in. Scenes can be very intense and along with cutting in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat - some is cut in a very ""in your face"" style - very fitting for a horror film. Cinematography was also very well done. Camera aesthetic was superb and Sound Design also gets high marks. These two movies will be going on my shelf."

","28 Weeks Later knows it doesn't want to just be the same as 28 Days Later in every way. While we are given a handful of solid characters and good performances, these play second-fiddle to the tension and pace.<br/><br/>Starting with one of the best horror openings of all time, 28 Weeks Later introduces itself as a horror/action film with much less down time than the original. This bothered many people, but I was fine with it. The characters were just good enough to make me care about what was happening to them. Giving a crap about anyone in a horror film is pretty rare by itself, so I didn't feel the need to bash this one just because the script wasn't as intelligent or character-oriented. I don't know what we have in store for us when it comes to 28 Months Later, but I know that I'll surely be there."

"dftwilight","4","1","2","30 June 2008"," A Late 28 Weeks Later Review
","I won't go into a summary of what this movie is about. I think anyone who has seen ""28 Days Later"" has an inkling of what it revolves around.<br/><br/>What did I like: Mucho more gore than the first. Always a big plus in my book. Very apocalyptic and not as ""Hollywood"" as I thought they would go. Great hand-held shots and timing/shutter effects similar to the first flick so you can practically see every little drop of blood in crystal clarity. The beginnings of a great flawed hero with an outstanding chance for a journey to redemption.<br/><br/>What I did not like: Though the gore was greater, the actual scare factor was significantly less. The first one had some intense scary moments. Granted the first 10 minutes of the second installment were really nail baiting, afterwords it was one big chase scene and the intensity left me numb. Maybe it wasn't as scary because those great hand-held shots, timing/shutter effects I mentioned earlier were so quick, chaotic, and distracting that I could barely comprehend what was going on. Artistically I know where the director was going with this. That was obvious. But it lessened the entertainment value because the shots are so quick that I sometimes had a hard time following exactly where I was in a scene. Since I couldn't see anything for a period of time longer than a nanosecond the scare factor fell dramatically.<br/><br/>The potential character arc of Robert Carlyle's character would have made for a superb flawed hero but that was snatched away halfway through when he became infected with ""rage."" Some may think he got his 'just desserts' for his actions earlier in the film, but what a great emotional hurdle to overcome and be eventually redeemed by at the end of the movie - if only they had given that specific plot a chance. Instead, the plot switched gears to the much less interesting children of Carlyle's character as we see them bumbling like dunder heads through a devastated London. Totally one-sided characters who I kept hoping would come to some untimely end while the minor characters out-shined them by a mile (and that's saying a lot since the minor characters were just as witless as the kids).<br/><br/>Oh well. It wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't that good either. I wonder if/when we will see a third installment?"
"Rasbenek","3","1","2","31 May 2008"," New Injection of Creativity Needed..............*May Contain Spoiler*
","Much has already been said on this board regarding the disappointing interpretation of Boyle's highly acclaimed source material - in developing a sequel that paid little heed to the triumphs of the original and opted instead for the completely over-the-top spectacle that Hollywood is renowned for. When substance is substituted for spectacle in some vain attempt to seduce popcorn-munching audiences into cinemas, not only do filmmakers, or rightly Producers, risk the sort of backlash already seen on this board, they also risk losing the long term support of audiences disgusted at the lack of respect shown in providing them with intelligent story-telling. No longer will we sit in darkened rooms, slurping on cola, and filling our faces as we numbingly consume any old dross put before us. No! We want smart, intelligent, quick-witted, and clever storytelling that leaves us with quality questions and talking in hushed gatherings long after the movie has finished - not with frustrated cries of ""but that didn't make any sense"". And to all film producers out there - we are many in number so please don't take us for granted. This story was wholly (forgive the pun) unacceptable, ill-conceived, thoroughly under-developed, and despite the enormous budget and the quality of the special effects, severely underwhelming. I left the cinema feeling cheated - and so disappointed in what I saw that I want to write ""28 Months or 28 Years Later"" myself - and maybe I will. As a screenwriter new to the business (and I mean in the business and not on the outskirts of it) it frustrates me to read, or to watch films that have under-developed narratives, or ones where the fundamental elements that tie events, characters, subplots, decisions, and resolutions together, are at best, not thought of, and at worst, ignored. That shows either a margin of contempt for the audience that is just not warranted, or a level of ability well below that perceived as necessary to succeed in the film business. You wouldn't catch David Koepp, love his work or hate it probably the busiest writer in Hollywood, creating such a mess. If he did, he wouldn't be working so often I would suggest. Just take for example (and many have been cited) the cottage in the opening scenes. When Carlisle leaves McCormack in the bedroom, she is whisked from the window before his eyes. We know many Infected entered the bedroom. His violence towards her later in the med centre was not atypical of other Infected behaviour. In fact the violence as the Infected pursued Carlisle to the boat and thereafter in the river is the standard by which his wife should have been treated. How then did she end up with only a bite on her forearm? By rights she should have been torn to shreds! And this is just one criticism of the lack of thought that went into the story-world creation. For all its aspirations ""28 Weeks Later"" remains a spectacle of the modern, and thus becoming more and more traditional, Hollywood model - explosive, rich in look, and texture, epic-reaching in scale and design, yet ultimately floored at its foundation - it has little or no story worthy of such immense effort. And if the proof is in the pudding, you only have to read the comment boards - the end users' verdict. It is the admission paying public after all for whom the film is ultimately made. And more heed should be taken of audiences' response. Let's hope that any further offerings in this franchise deliver more closely on Danny Boyle's superb creation and not on this over-blown, and over-budgeted disappointment - and maybe I'll just write the next instalment! What do you say Mr Boyle?"

","At first, I was appalled at how bad this piece of tripe was. Then I finally got it. As the camera jerked from one scene to another and the music swelled to make sure that we knew something horrific was happening (in case we hadn't noticed heads flying off), I was reminded of the Blair Witch Project, another paean to hurky jerky movie making. Then I got it. This movie was released only a few days before Tony Blair left office. This was a subtle (well, not not subtle, maybe) vision of what GB would be Post Blair. A brilliant satire. But did anyone get it? No one could take this incredibly inept piece of nonsense seriously. But how was one to take it, then? The answer? Laugh hilariously. As people chew each other up, pass the popcorn. When they burn up all the survivors, yell out, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning."" When the few actors who are not infected try to act terrified, yell ""Ooooh, scary."" I suppose the current movie going generation, apparently under 17, has never heard of George Romero. They may think all of this gore is a new vision, or think gore has only to do with global warming. George did it much better in every one of his movies and they aren't brilliant... just good. But compared to this nonsense, Romero's movies are the Sistene Chapel compared to finger painting. Hopefully, even though this movie seems to have pleased some, we will be spared anymore efforts from this promoter of sensationalistic blood and guts in which the guts of the movie are constantly spilling out of hapless victims.

","This film is insane! Ditching the desolation, characterisation and sustained bleakness of the original, this worthy sequel is an adrenaline soaked thrill-ride that is dizzyingly shot and graphically nasty. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's visuals are stunning and the frenetic digital camera-work adds to the sense of paranoia and panic. The camera is always moving, using everything from extreme close-up to POV as sudden bursts of rage-induced violence burst onto the frame enhancing the need to escape. Like the original, the fear stems from a viral pandemic that takes over and this primordial fear is shown in all its glory, shunning any signs of characterisation and plot reasoning to instead deliver edge-of-your seat shocks, brutal action and unsubtle scenes of gore to great effect while seemingly taking a socially-conscious dig at the incompetence of the American military and contemporary security meltdown.<br/><br/>7/10"

","There is one shot very early on in 28 Weeks Later where Robert Carlyle's character is seen fleeing a house that has been breached by the ""infected"" (I'll be referring to them as zombies from here on out, for simplicity's sake), leaving his fellow healthy survivalists -- including his wife -- to fend for themselves. Carlyle runs like hell, and we see in his face a sudden twinge of guilt and helpless desperation. It's nothing over-the-top; just a fleeting and seemingly natural reaction to what he has just done.<br/><br/>This is the moment where director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo shows us how he is going to turn a sequel to a moderately successful 2003 zombie flick into a great and wholly original film of his own. 28 Weeks Later is so triumphant that, as a sequel, I would say it falls just short of Aliens' greatness. This is a highly original entry into the zombie subgenre, whose realism and strong establishment of its unique tone and universe set it apart from other zombie movies (including 28 Days Later).<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot because, like any effective horror film, 28 Weeks Later's brilliance is in its simple and visceral structure. There are no huge derivations or twists that cause the material it adapts from the previous film to jump the shark, and there are no gimmicks. There are, however, some intriguing revelations in store. Otherwise, it's refreshingly forthright and streamlined for a horror sequel, and something that you simply have to experience.<br/><br/>The film features some solid performances, especially from the always reliable Carlyle and plucky newcomer Imogen Poots. And the proceedings are spiced up by amazing action sequences, including a fire bombing of the Isle of Dogs and a helicopter vs. zombie showdown that has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>Considerably more concise and tautly constructed than its predecessor, 28 Weeks Later might just be the superior film."

This boring film was really like a hour-plus Windex commercial. Every other scene had somebody putting their fingers, bloody or not, on glass. I am sure Juan has some kind of explanation for this silly device, but it got boring really fast. So did all the gore scenes, which were, in essence, identical in pace.Films like this are only fun as a game. How many scenes can you predict before they even happen? Despite the praise of some misguided critics, 28 Days was a terrible film and this is an unwatchable sequel. I won't reveal the ending, because I can't.

","As a big fan of zombie movies i could not wait to see this film,and after the opening sequence i was really impressed.The sad thing is that is the best part of the movie.The way in which the outbreak reacures is rather silly and most of the infected are killed after about 10 minuets which really annoyed me.The way that Don follows the group around remaining in the background goes against the actual effects of the virus and seems a bit confusing,and the rushed ending leaves you a little disappointed.This is by no means the worst 'zombie' film in the world but i believe the original was better.Hopefully they might make a prequel to explain what happened in the first 28 days rather than watch the Americans mess everything up for 2 hours.<br/><br/>Overall it could have been a lot better!"

","The comments on this movie are as diverse as night and day. But I tend toward night. What is it with all the dark lately? Was also not really impressed with the cameo-style camera work blurring edges so we have a limited view. And all that shaky camera stuff which should bear a warning not to be watched by people sensitive to this eye aching, brain jarring style. Far too manic for me and I kept thinking about the rage that was inside these people and wondering why they didn't blow up. As others have said the first movie was scary in its silences. Anticipation can get your stomach churning. The first one was so reality based, well acted and well scripted. This second movie was just a screaming fest full of jarring movements and noise. Yes it was unreal that London was to be repopulated in such a short space of time. Or was that a experimental plot, commissioned by some scientist from above. Conspiracy theories? Maybe I am giving them too much credit,but who knows as we are told very little. Robert Carlyle was amazing as the father/husband, who for all of the love he professed for his wife, left her with very little hesitation to save his own neck. Then lied to his children about what had happened. He sure got his worse fear answered. I did find it interesting that he was/became so super intelligent as to be able to be one jump ahead of his family and away from all attempts to blow him up by the army. Clever Boy! I liked the army guy who tried to improve the situation rather than slaughtering all en masse. Pity! Some of the effects where good, but effects for me are getting a little tiring, rather a good story like the first one. And if the boy was immune then......... Think I shall go and meditate now. All this rage is getting to me"

","Without Danny Boyle in the Director's chair, i feared that the essence that made '28 Days Later' so good would get lost; but Juan Carlos Fresnadillo clearly knows how to keep a winning recipe, and once again we are treated to a fine horror movie.<br/><br/>'28 Weeks Later' doesn't hang around before it gets going, it's pretty much straight into the action and horror, and once its there it keeps going at a steady pace throughout. The story is well constructed, and everything falls into place nicely, leaving just enough to the viewers imagination to keep our minds stimulated.<br/><br/>The dark and creepy tone that succeeded in the first film is retained, and the infected once again bring real terror to the screen, but the all new cast inject enough freshness to make this film every bit as good as the first, with some excellent stunts and action sequences thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first outing for the infected, this is quite simply a must see movie.<br/><br/>Credit to everyone involved, it's a sequel to be proud of! 9/10"
"Dave_mech","7","1","2","20 September 2007"," Enjoyable MOVIE
","The first part is in reaction to low rated reviews, after that i'll discus the movie, so if you've never seen it, skip that part.<br/><br/>Before I begin I want to say a few things in reaction to some of the very low rates this movie got (like ones and two's). Please remember that it is a MOVIE, so stop comparing a movie to how things would happen in real life ! I mean come on, of course it is not realistic that they are repopulating after 2 months. But ehm, the whole virus is unrealistic as hell, so why bothering giving this movie a 1 for not being realistic?<br/><br/>Now the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a constant sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat-and-jump-up-every-now-and-then rush. Especially in the first half of the movie you will see much creepy things. The empty streets are again very effective to make it even more creepy. At some point in the movie 2 kids do plenty of odd things even a grown up would not accomplish in a life time , but that does not make the film annoying or anything. There is very much gore but it affects the movie perfectly well. It's certainly not overdone even though I'm not a huge fan of gore.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie kind of repeats what was happening before, again with pretty odd moves on humans side, and a few clichés (Car won't start... do they have to put that in almost every movie??), but it doesn't ruin the movie. <br/><br/>The ending is clearly made for an sequel but I thing everybody expected that even before seeing the movie (at least, I did. 28 months and then of course 28 years, I would bet on that). Anyway, the ending although made for a sequel did satisfy me.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for all thrill movie seekers. It's a pretty good sequel of a pretty good first movie. Oh and before I forget, good acting (for most of it). Most horror movies are all about screaming and running and although that is also added in this movie (doh), other emotions are well placed and not stretched for to long.<br/><br/>I'm curious how everything is going to develop in the next sequel."
"SimonHeide","7","1","2","18 September 2007"," dystopia with a happy end...?
","The plot evolves around a family of four; father, mother, daughter and son who desperately fight for survival in the post-infectious age.<br/><br/>As you may know the infected on mainland Britain dies of starvation after a while and society is then being rebuilt with the help of forces from USA. Here you have the first really controversial moments in the movie as they (the American soldiers) are being portrayed as trigger-happy brutes with no respect of the potential danger that surrounds them. This is tiresome to watch and also a to often used cliché in other movies; the bragging soldier with his big gun who dies a violent and unexpected (to himself) death. I don't necessarily agree with other reviews that points out that this could be seen as a political comment on the behavior of US forces around the world.<br/><br/>One of the things that I like the most about modern zombie-movies is the sense of dysphoria portrayed. The whole atmosphere should be permeated by terror and fear of total annihilation of the human race. One by one the protagonist should die, your friends and family should turn against you and survival should only be possible for a limited period; a modern dystopia.<br/><br/>In my view zombie-movies should explore the human reactions to these kind of extreme life-conditions: Fear, survival-instinct, heroism, coward-ism, traumatization etc. There really shouldn't be a happy end nor shouldn't the protagonists destinies be decided upon some sort of higher justice (eg the coward dies the most brutal death and the hero gets away in the end) and there shouldn't be a big show-down in the end to settle the score. Realism should be favored instead. And I really think that the movie fails here on several accounts.<br/><br/>I am not even sure that the word ""zombie"" is being used in ""28 weeks later"" but never the less the resemblance to older zombie movies is strong. There is no more talk about superstitious explanations like ""no more room in hell"" or voodooism but instead we deal with virus and genetics which only adds to the realism (I think that every age has it own fear-phenomena and that we in our time are really, really afraid of virus-attack). We don't have to shoot the infected in the head anymore to kill them which again in some way adds to the realism and thereby makes it easier for us to identify with the protagonist.<br/><br/>28 weeks later works well on several levels given the genre its in but it still has some major flaws. In order for the story to develop the protagonist does some really stupid things which is very annoying to watch and which again makes it difficult to empathize with them. They take some big risks at certain points which they don't have to take. For me one of the important aspects of being a screen-writer is to make the persons portrayed believable which I don't think is entirely achieved in this movie.<br/><br/>Another thing that was annoying was the lack of fear or alertness in some specific situations. I am thinking in particular of the scene where the children and some other survivors pause at some sort of fair-ground. They seem so relaxed and off guard like they were on some Sunday trip.<br/><br/>All in all I would still recommend it to anyone who likes to be taken away into a dark and sinister world for 90 minutes."

","28 weeks later is yet another Hollywood sequel released in 2007. And in this summer's long line of sequence, this one surely has the least following. With low market potential compared to this year's other sequels, the freedom given to the film maker by the studio bosses can be made out after watching the film. The movies restrained act can sometime gets over your skin but overall the movie is a satisfying experience for the fans of the horror zombie genre.<br/><br/>The movie starts as the title literally suggests 28 weeks later after the first attack of the rage virus on the British Isles. The virus has been overcome by humans in some parts of London which have been quarantined for the settlement of the first batch of refugees. The quarantined section is being controlled by the U.S occupied forces. The trouble begins when two of the youngest refuges sneak out of the quarantined area to their old home, where they find there supposedly dead mother alive. The mother, whose blood is infected, has been successfully been immune to the virus. As she is quarantined by the occupied forces, things turn over its head when she infects her husband who is not immune to the virus. This starts another round of rage attack which grips and destroys the secured area. The director shows his class when the two young protagonists struggle to survive, not from the infected but from the human forces itself who themselves turn intensely hostile as a human nature itself. The director successfully puts down his point that at this juncture of human evolution, the humans have become incapable with there survival instincts as they turn upon themselves during times of crisis which is relevant to today's time. The movie does loose on its horror effects as audience struggle to find any sympathy for the lead characters, as the 90 minutes running time give very few moments for character building with its fast pace editing. A 10 minutes plus running time would have been satisfactory.<br/><br/>But overall the movie satisfies with its gore and violence quotient which is at its peak in the final reels. The crisp editing and story satisfies the audience who are struggling to the find any sense in the scripts of this year's many more popular sequels."
"therealmercury","7","1","2","10 September 2007"," more than just OK
","This movie was - lets say - more than just OK, it had terrible flaws, but despite of that it is very entertaining.<br/><br/>Let me start with the flaws:<br/><br/>As some have already said the movie has some very stupid people doing very stupid things. Dons son, for example, it one of those typical kids you just hate for what they do, he reminds me of Bob (the House By The Cemetery). His sister is only a little better, the movie would have done great without those two and their annoying actions. Don kissing his wife even though she had bite marks is just... ouch<br/><br/>There are quite a lot of logical mistakes, which have already been mentioned in other comments, so i won't list them here.<br/><br/>But, if you want to overlook its flaws and the terribly shaky camera, the movie is a feast for horror and gore fans. There where many scenes, that made my heart beat faster, like the one with the night vision. There where some scenes, where i wanted to give the movie an applause, like that ""helicopter chopping up the zombies"" - scene. This movie digs deep to find every last kind of possible shock-effect, which could or might be scary even today, some get used twice and some fail, but all in all they get it about right (i have seen better effects though).<br/><br/>I hated the first one for its lack of consequence, it was like watching two movies, one good - one terrible, just to get all the social criticism into it. I feared the same for the second, but this one stayed true to its self AND managed to communicate the criticism.<br/><br/>After all the funky effects and well done stories with all their depth, a movie always boils down to the way it entertains the audience. 28 Weeks Later might not be one of those fresh flashy movies straight out of the computer with a well sorted out storyline, lovable main characters, hate-able baddys and cool one-liners, but it is great fun to watch and you get a good chance to get shocked at least once in a while."
"Mister-Fahrenheit","4","1","2","10 September 2007"," 28 weeks later; the infected have died out, and so has our interest
","28 Days Later gave us a concept, opened it up and ran with it for about 2 hours, dodging and weaving its way through the country as the compelling characters struggle to understand what is happening and who to trust.<br/><br/>28 weeks later takes around half an hour to get into the thoroughly predictable plot and then attempts to tick every box in the ""scary horror sequel"" application form while the un-engaging children run from the menace of the infection. The fact that by the end, I'd rather the infected munched on all of them and everyone leave Britain for dead says a lot for the whole thing. It has not half of the intensity, suspense or atmosphere of the original. And the plot is so stupid at times you believe some characters should be turned into flesh-eating monsters for making such ridiculous choices.<br/><br/>The absence of Danny Boyle is what I attributed this shoddy sequel's high disappointment to, until I spied his name in the producer credits. And cried.<br/><br/>And the ridiculous ending undoes any work put in by this Movie and its predecessor.<br/><br/>You will probably laugh out loud.<br/><br/>But to highlight it's good points: The production design. Its nice to watch something set in a world we know and if it wasn't for the script this would be very believable. The camera work is cracking and the London I see is the London I know well (apart from the fact Wembley Stadium appears to be five minutes west of the Houses of Parliament)."
"ZombieGeek","7","1","2","9 September 2007"," Brave horror in this era of lightweight movie-making
","Credit to this movie is the fact I'm moved to comment at all. As a hardened horror fan I am seldom moved to do so by todays' safe, formulaic, cookie-cut offerings.<br/><br/>I began watching 28 Weeks with modest expectations. The first of this soon-to-be-trilogy excited me primarily as it marked a shift in British output; it didn't have Hugh Grant (aaargh) in it; it was a horror; it was made on a budget. As a movie though, it left me feeling a little under-fed.<br/><br/>28 Weeks however is a rawer, meatier dish.<br/><br/>Not since the first 11 minutes of Dawn (2004) has an opening segment grabbed my attention and stirred my senses. Sadly, Dawn 2004 quickly put me back to sleep for the remainder, but 28 Weeks faired much better.<br/><br/>The first half of this movie is extremely bold and genuinely jarring in parts (how rare is that!). The second half markedly is less so. No spoilers here, but suffice it to say this is almost certainly part 2 of 3. In that context, the less breakneck mid and concluding sections are forgivable, even right and understandable.<br/><br/>Not wishing to steal from others observations, but I read a review on here discussing this movie being less character-driven. I wondered how that could be, but having now seen it, I'd say that is not only true, but the core strength of 28 Weeks. It is the virus, the horror of reality, the infected, the breakdown of systems, the American response and ultimately hope for the future that drives this story.<br/><br/>Much more than a question of 'how will this character survive?'. The question begs more of 'can this virus ever be stopped?'.<br/><br/>From an aesthetic perspective, I was certainly no fan of the high shutter speed, shaky-cam approach to action scenes so prevalent in 28 Days; and unfortunately it's back in force.<br/><br/>Used sparingly, this effect does work - giving the viewer a more frantic, discombobulating, brutal sense of the infected, but once again, I found it overused. Perhaps this is now a 'signature effect' for the franchise; but I'd like to see less of it, and at times be given a half a chance to compute what I'm seeing.<br/><br/>Many say that the best gore is that made-up by the viewers own imagination, implied gore if you will (as in the infamous 'Reservoir Dogs ear'). For me, part of my enjoyment of horror has always been real FX, real gore, Savini style.<br/><br/>It's fair to say 28 Weeks has both. The high-speed shaky-cam quick-cut stuff I'm sure left me thinking I'd seen things I hadn't, but also there was a good portion of honest-to-goodness shock FX. More of the latter and less of the former would be nice for 28/3.<br/><br/>Fine acting throughout, especially memorable was young Imogen Poots.<br/><br/>Odd name, truly memorable face. Not for a long time have I seen an actress/actor say so much with just expression. From Casualty to (the excellent) V for Vendetta and then this; she's rightly doing rather well for herself.<br/><br/>To conclude, I'm now quite a fan of this franchise where before I was a little indifferent. There _will_ be another instalment, and I look forward to it! I hope it retains and builds on the punch of this movie, and with luck, punch hard consistently throughout. Nothing short of a truly shocking climax to this series would do.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. Lights out, late at night, volume up. It's a rare beast - - - horror with frights.<br/><br/>P.S. Great soundtrack too! 7 / 10"
"friend567","8","1","2","3 September 2007"," It gets serious this time.
","I really liked ""28 Days Later"". Just like the Dead movies by Romero or the remake by Zack Snyder, ""28 Days Later"" featured a somewhat nihilistic vision of the future and even had a message behind it. When I heard that there would be a sequel, I wasn't really glad about it, especially when I read the title which I first thought was just ridiculous. After having read lots of positive reviews, I stopped prejudging and developed a certain interest.<br/><br/>And I was not disappointed with the movie. First of all, it is nicely connected to its predecessor and not just the same story brought up a second time, but it felt like some elements of the first movie were thrown away and other aspects absolutely pushed to full dedication. ""28 Days Later"" came up with little but still pretty shocking gore. But compared to ""28 Weeks Later"", the movie was children's entertainment - I'm talking lots of messy blood splashes, burned people, masses of skeletons and the already infamous helicopter scene.<br/><br/>The real terror which makes the movie as good as it is does not just evolve through some gore. The real terror is in how totally merciless main characters suddenly get infected or killed, in how relentlessly innocent people get killed by the government to prevent the infection, in how you started caring for something you see in ashes right away.<br/><br/>In term of atmosphere, Fresnadillo did a good job in replacing Danny Boyle..which easily could have failed since Boyle is a great director. Actually, I must say that I found ""28 Weeks Later"" partially even more gripping than its predecessor. The sight of empty London also was increased this time and though it looks beautiful, it's also extremely scary and unsettling.<br/><br/>For sure, it is not a perfect movie. Though there were some great actors at work, others didn't really seem fitting. Mackintosh Muggleton had his first role in the movie and he's not doing a really bad job, but I had a hard time ignoring how his emotions seemed unreal. But I can ignore one fresh actor, especially since he is a child and it did not interrupt the ""enjoyment"" of the movie.<br/><br/>Another thing I would criticize is the small development of the plot. The entire idea of the movie is presented early in the movie and built upon, but sometimes I had hoped for a little more story around the main plot.<br/><br/>All in all, ""28 Weeks Later"" was a very satisfying experience. It had lots of gruesome gore, shocking moments, great and gripping music, an interesting plot, well developed characters and a fantastic cinematography which led to a stunning atmosphere that made me care.<br/><br/>-> 8 out of 10."
"jimthechin","4","1","2","23 August 2007"," Ruined by it's style.
","Most of the movie was shot in the dark and when combined with the shoddy camera work it makes for a less than entertaining experience. I know it's a ""directing-style"" to make movies in this blurry and rapid-frame fashion, but they've just gone too far with it this time. I was left thinking ""what happened?"" rather than appreciating the story, because i couldn't see what was happening. As i mentioned earlier, a lot of the scenes were in almost complete darkness, so it's like driving in the dark, but with pouring rain and no window wipers. This thoroughly ruined the movie for me.<br/><br/>Additionally, it was only 90 minutes.<br/><br/>The story was in principle quite good, but i just couldn't appreciate the experience or feel what i knew i would be feeling if i could have seen a little more of what was happening. Such a pity."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","18 August 2007"," A worthy sequel (spoilers throughout)
","First things first  28 Weeks Later isn't as good as the film that preceded it. Its narrative is a lot more flimsy, the characters aren't as engaging and it relies more heavily on cheap shock tactics to provide thrills and chills. But that being said, it is a decent sequel. It certainly doesn't embarrass itself.<br/><br/>One of the most unfortunate things about 28 Weeks Later is that its best scene happens right at the beginning. The film opens with a group of survivors holed up in an isolated cottage. They have little to do but eat and squabble amongst one another. But then the infected attack and all hell breaks loose. As is usual these days, the action is frantic and confusing. Sometimes you're not really sure what's going on. But then Don (played by Robert Carlyle), while being chased through the house, has to choose between saving his wife from the infected and saving himself. He chooses to save himself. And the scene where he leaps from the cottage and is pursued through a field by swarms of the infected is an outstanding moment. John Murphy's magnificent score pounds from the speakers and more and more diseased individuals take pursuit. And then as he's running Don looks up to the window and sees his wife begging for help. But it's too late  she gets taken. And then with swooping helicopter shots and with more infected oozing from every corner of the countryside, Don heads for the river and leaps into a boat. It's heart-stopping stuff  wonderfully cinematic and strangely moving too. Can you really blame the guy for saving his own skin? How many of us wouldn't do the same? <br/><br/>And I like the scene later in the film (in a supposedly 'safe' London) where Don tells his kids what happened to their mother. He breaks down crying and says that she was killed in front of his eyes  there were was nothing he could do. Again, is it so harsh to judge him? Would the truth serve any purpose? It's just a bit of a shame, then, that as the film is slowly building this morally ambiguous character that he becomes a fully-fledged monster.<br/><br/>One of the film's twists is that Don's wife isn't really dead. Even though she was attacked by the infected, she's immune to the virus  she's a carrier. So then when she's captured by the American troops who are now running the show in Blighty, Don goes to see her so that he can apologise. However, he makes the mistake of kissing her and gets infected. The scene that follows  Don's brutal killing of his wife, is actually quite hard to watch. He beats her and claws at her and then sticks his fingers in her eyes. The film doesn't pull any punches in terms of violence.<br/><br/>However, some of the gore is a bit silly at times. There's a bit where a field full of infected get mown down by helicopter blades. Heads roll, limbs are torn from bodies and blood sprays everywhere, and while it's quite amusing in a sick way, it feels slightly out of place in what is an otherwise deadly serious horror flick.<br/><br/>A much better scene is the one where the Americans lose control of the new community they've established. Infection spreads, and not being able to tell the infected from the normal, the soldiers are given orders to kill everyone. I guess it's quite easy to draw parallels with the situation in Iraq. When you can't tell the bad from the good, just kill everything. (In both 28 Weeks and 28 Days, normal humans are shown as the real monsters, although I actually think that point is better conveyed in Boyle's film  the military terror in that film is more personal; here it's more abstract.) <br/><br/>And then there's the carpet bombing of London. The military goes to all this effort to set up a new community and then proceeds to destroy it once it becomes clear it can't keep order. Again it seems to be inspired by the current political climate.<br/><br/>But back to the scene where the Americans have been given orders to kill everything that moves. There's a wonderful bit where Don's son is wandering the streets, civilians trying to escape and the infected pursuing them as bullets whiz by and as the same John Murphy cue, the one that was used in the scene where Carlyle escapes the cottage, plays on the soundtrack. It has a wonderfully chaotic feeling to it. The real terror in the film isn't from people leaping out of the dark but of feeling completely helpless  all we want in life is safety and security, but in this film, like in Iraq, you're never too far from chaos; everyone seems to be conspiring to kill you, even those who are supposed to be your saviours.<br/><br/>However, as good as all this stuff is, the film can't claim to be a classic of the genre. For one thing most of the acting is decidedly average. And also the characterisation is pretty thin. Therefore it's hard to care too much about the characters, as the film doesn't seem to care that much about them either. The writing, too, is mediocre. There weren't any lines that stood out as godawful, but by the same token there was nothing that stood out as outstanding. But as an action/horror film, 28 Weeks Later works well. It certainly gets the blood pumping. And although it hits you with a few cheap shots, for the most part it's a pretty smart flick, which is always something to rejoice when it comes to modern horror films."

A definite must see!"
"monk_e_fish","7","1","2","22 May 2007"," Effective and disturbing horror sequel
","Five years ago 28 Days Later revitalised the zombie genre. The gap between that film and this should be enough to convince that this is no cheap rushed cash-in sequel. However, with writer Alex Garland, director Danny Boyle and star Cillian Murphy all off making the superb Sunshine, 28 Weeks Later comes from an entirely different team. Fortunately, Garland and Boyle as executive producers have seen fit to hire a director who can bring his own interesting vision to the project, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, whose debut film Intacto was a stylish and unusual thriller.<br/><br/>While it has always been made very clear to us that the Infected are not zombies in the conventional sense, it is hard to view this film and its predecessor outside the zombie genre, especially as, wittingly or otherwise, 28 Weeks Later features aspects of some earlier zombie classics. The clashing ideologies of a medical (find a cure for it) or military (wipe them all out) solution is not only a development of the final third of the first film, but also of Romero's excellent Day of the Dead. Meanwhile the end of the film seems to be a Euro version of the final moments of Lucio Fulci's Zombie Flesh Eaters, after all you can only do zombies and London landmarks for so long.<br/><br/>Indeed, the opening prologue, set during the time of the first infection, is like a Night of the Living Dead influenced zombie picture in miniature, a disparate group of survivors holed up in a remote, rural house with the Infected outside. It also happens to be the finest opening sequence in any horror film you're likely to see any time soon. It starts admirably restrained, starting with just the central couple, Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack, looking for food in the dark house, before revealing that there are others with them, and beginning to show the tensions in the group, tantalisingly setting up relationships that the movie doesn't have time to explore as their peace is quickly shattered by a banging on the door and soon the peace is completely shattered by a chaotic moment in which Carlyle makes the selfish choice to preserve his own life at all costs.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, although for the most part the film retains this breakneck pace, it doesn't always maintain this quality. That is not to say that there isn't plenty of interesting things going on here, just that for all Fresnadillo's efforts, the characters are not well enough drawn to be those we care about. In the first film, we viewed the world through the eyes of Murphy's Jim and shared his confusion and fear at the deserted London and the sudden arrival of the Infected, here there is no such audience substitute. For the most part, however, the film is packed with enough great moments to save it from these poorly developed characters.<br/><br/>Although it takes a little while to get going after the skip forward 28 weeks, when Britain, or rather the Isle of Dogs, is being repopulated, Fresnadillo and his co-writers' idea for how the infection returns and begins to spread again is an interesting one that raises some new ideas. Some of his ideas and techniques work very well were others do not so much. The fast running infected shot with shaky hand held cameras become a little annoying as it proves hard to keep track of what is happening and they do not have the unsettling quality of the old slow moving zombies, meanwhile his decision to view scenes through the eyes of an Infected character and to give one of the Infected this extra depth and ability seems ill suited to the genre where the menace comes from the facelessly identical evil of the whole group.<br/><br/>Never the less, other moments are brilliantly effective. As an outsider and a foreigner, Fresnadillo brings a new eye to the first film's disturbing moments of deserted London streets and landmarks and, in setting the whole film in the capital this time, is able to cover more sides to the city, all of them chilling, abandoned and damaged environments. The presence of the US military provides a further interesting threat as well as a very effective if unsubtle critique of the current global situation reminiscent of Romero at his best. One superb sequence features the American snipers unable to deal with the panic caused as the Infected maraud among the civilians desperate to escape. They are given the order to simply shoot down everybody down there. It is a brilliantly realised moment of convincing confusion, panic and desperation.<br/><br/>Fresnadillo also provides two absolute standout horror movie sequences that will be well remembered for a long time by those who see this movie. The first is the already infamous helicopter sequence, a brilliantly gory moment in which a slightly out of control helicopter decapitates and slices limbs off a whole crowd of Infected resulting in a massive pool of blood and severed body parts. The second is more atmospheric, set in a dark tube station, Rose Byrne's Scarlet guides the two children down the dark staircase, helping them to avoid the corpses on the ground with the night vision on her rifle's sight.<br/><br/>The end is rather abrupt and involves a brand new London landmark that surely does not fit with the chronology of the series. Despite this fact, and the lack of characters you care for, 28 Weeks Later is an effective little horror of many fine moments and a worthy sequel to the earlier film. ****"

","One of the qualities I really enjoyed about the first movie, 28 Days Later, was the story within the story. So many great movies tell a 'human' story while a genre is being displayed around it. Shyamalan seems to be exceptional in doing this with his movies. We get to see people going through real life struggles and reaching resolutions while aliens are crawling in their back yard or in 28 Days Later zombies are ripping throats open. Watching the characters in 28 Days Later go through hell together and come out again new and changed was just as exciting as the raged undead tearing people apart.<br/><br/>(This Paragraph may contain spoilers)So thus not as good as 28 Days later. 28 Weeks Later starts interestingly enough introducing us to compelling characters, leading us to believe their sacrifices may lead to something, may build a meaningful outcome or a change of heart, but in the end everything every character does leads to nothing. I think movie makers especially in the horror genre are reaching that point where grunge/hippie actually becomes the Hollywood/yuppie. Its become trendy to build a masterpiece then shoot it to hell with a blunt weapon at the end just for shock value. Making a genre movie while telling a great story is no easy feat and the movies that pull it off are among the greatest of all time. This movie missed that possibility by inches and perhaps thats the worst part, how close it really was to being one of the greats.<br/><br/>Now if you take this movie away from its predecessor and look at it on its own two feet, then its not as bad as the average horror flick. Its a tragic horror film where dread and fear slowly build then slam you in the face without apology. Its aggressive and fast paced and at points you will need to catch your breath. Its shocking in new ways and pulls at emotions as well as nerves. A fun ride.<br/><br/>An interesting comparison of tragedy horror that still tells a story is Pan's Labyrinth. I hope more movie makers think about a story and characters rather than a sequel and shock value. But not all movies and their makers are meant to be great."

","No, it's not as good as the first one. No, it's not as smart as the first one. No, I'm not saying it's bad though.<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"", is scary fun and a full throttle fast paced zombie movie that doesn't let up till the final scene.<br/><br/>First of all, sequels are tough. So, rarely does a sequel measure up to the first installment. But, like other successful part deux's 28.W.L. carries the load on its own merits. Different director, no Danny Boyle here. Different writer(s), no Alex Garland here. But, the story Danny boy and Mr. Garland conceived continues logically and terrifyingly. Because this world is seen with fresh eyes i.e. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (director) and Rowan Joffe, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, Jesús Olmo (screenwriters) the movie feels fresh and new.<br/><br/>The approach they take reminds me of ""Aliens"" the stupendous sequel to ""Alien"". Military might takes on a familiar foe. But they don't forget what really set ""28 Days Later"" apart from other films of this genre: the quiet human element. There are interesting dynamics between characters that really lend the movie real dramatic context.<br/><br/>Once the zombies, rather those infected with the ""Rage virus"", pounce onto the screen the audience is dragged kicking and screaming along till the final credits roll.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later"" was in my opinion the best zombie movie ever so, no, the sequel isn't as good but damn if I wasn't white-knuckling the armrests for the entire thing. A definite must see!"

","(My Synopsis) 28 Weeks after the rage virus infected everyone in Great Britain, the U.S. Army inspects the city of London and announces that the city is now safe, because the virus has burnt itself out. The army begins to clean up London and brings in British refugees who were not infected. They are all quarantined on an island near the wharf in London. Don (Robert Carlyle) was able to escape the infected zombies, but his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) became a victim of the rage. Don is reunited with his two children who were abroad on a camping trip during the outbreak. Unfortunately for the new population of London, the virus is not totally dead; it only takes one person to start the process all over again.<br/><br/>(My Comment) If you like blood and guts, this horror film is for you. The storyline is foolish, brainless, and a little gross, but what do you expect from a B-grade horror movie. This is one horror film that will make you tired by the end of the movie. What I mean by this is that if you really get involved in the movie, you will run your heart out trying to get away from the infected zombies who sprint everywhere to their next victim. I know that I didn't want to be caught, because I jumped around in my seat, especially, at the beginning. The scene that I liked the best was the helicopter taking out the zombies; if you see the movie, you will know what I mean. The writers have set it up for a third movie, maybe 28 Months Later. (Fox Atomic, Run time 1:39, Rated R) (6/10)"

","This is the follow up to one of the best horror movies ever made. And what a letdown it is. While 28Days had slow buildup, atmosphere and a very realistic depiction of military personnel; the sequel goes the opposite direction. You are continuously exposed to action scene after action scene which quickly follows a predictable formula: slow music builds, infected attack, gore everywhere, repeat. The music isn't even close to the original greatness (GYBE!) from the beginning of 28days. They attempt to emulate it in EVERY action scene and it becomes tiring and not very effective by the end. Unfortunately the sequel does not have a very compelling story or believable characters and this ultimately makes 28weeks just a mindless action flick. If you like turning your brain off you will love it, however, if you are looking for something comparable to 28days...prepare to be disappointed."

","28 Weeks Later was to 28 Days Later as Aliens was to Alien. 28 Days Later, just like Alien, was original, with an engaging story, and scary. And then ... Lets cash in. Bring in the troops, and the clichés! Bang, bang, and jut have a good old idiot plot. (You know, which plot would immediately ceased to exist if any of the characters would not behave as a total idiot.) People will flock in to watch zombies, and, more importantly, leave their money with us. But, if you liked 28 Days Later, stay away from 28 Weeks Later, it is not your kind. It is not interesting, nor scary, only frustratingly stupid... How could any critic write anything good about this is beyond me. At the same time the movie does not have a cheap look. They did spend time, effort, and money on window dressing. It was the first time I have seen Robert Carlyle (the father) since ""The Full Monty"". What a disappointment. Was not his fault, there was nothing he could have done for this role. I'll not go to see the inevitable 28 Months Later, nor the likely 28 Years Later."

","The original movie, ""28 Days Later"", was very well done. This sequel fails in so many ways I am almost angry that it was even made.<br/><br/>The real tragedy is that there were many opportunities to make this as good as the original. Instead, they made an exploitative blood-bath and gimmick-fest with no depth and plot holes GALORE.<br/><br/>When Sci-Fi and Horror are at their best, they provide allegory. This was provided deftly in ""Days"", without being overdone or clumsy. Sadly, any attempt to do so in ""Weeks"" failed miserably.<br/><br/>Even if you are just looking for decent entertainment, there are so many things that don't make logical sense, it will drive you to distraction.<br/><br/>A very disappointing movie, even without regard for the original."
"RCYthefourthbc","8","2","7","12 May 2007"," Fast and Good
","This movie is an hour and 40 minutes long but it feels like it is 30 minutes. That is a good thing. One of the ways I judge a movie is by how many times I have to take out my cell phone and see how much time the movie has left but for this movie i didn't do that once. It is a very fast paced movie with great action scenes and lots of blood. <br/><br/>The movie starts off with people hiding in a house and then a infected busts in and everyone but one supposedly becomes infected or dies. Turns out that this guy has two children and he meets up with them. After he tells the story of how his wife died the two kids go out to find their old home which inside they find their mom alive. Things happen and the dad gets infected and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>A few problems I had with this movie is the way the camera shakes almost non-stop and that makes you miss out on what could be beautiful and terrifying shots. The night-vision scope camera wasn't a good idea or at least the way they used it was bad. Also in this movie I think the US Army killed more people than the infected which could lead to some thinking it as an Anti-America movie. Finally we come to the ending. Although I would love to see 28 Months Later, I couldn't help but be upset over the almost non-existent ending. This is obviously going to be a trilogy but they could have ended with at least somewhat of a conclusion."
"w00f","8","2","7","12 May 2007"," More Straight-Up Horror than the Original, and Very Good At It
","This is a good, straight-ahead horror flick with enough story and character development, not to mention blood and gore, to keep horror fans happy. That being said, the story isn't nearly as nuanced as the ""28 Days Later..."" Like that movie, however, there's an obvious anti-war/anti-military message, and this time around the references are even more blatant. If there's a moral to this movie, it's ""to err is human, but to really screw things up requires military intervention."" 6 months after where the original leaves off, ""28 Weeks Later..."" picks up the story of the rage virus. After the grueling opening sequence, we see that the US military has been brought in to begin the repatriation of London. They've established a green zone (just like in Iraq. Hmmmm...) and the Brits are being flown back in from refugee camps on the continent, particularly in Spain. Two children, each of whom has two different colored eyes just like their mother, are among those being resettled. Their father has managed to survive, as has their mother, though we don't find that out until a little ways into the movie.<br/><br/>As it turns out, mom is a carrier. She has the rage virus in her blood, but she doesn't manifest the syndrome. That's great for her, but not so great for dad. When mom is found and brought into the green zone, she and dad are reunited. He gives her a kiss, and the virus is off once again. Before long, the situation in the green zone is out of control, and American soldiers are mowing down everything that moves in an attempt to contain the plague. In the end, they firebomb London... but the virus still gets out. The ending tells us that there's going to be another sequel, because the virus manages to jump the English channel. We see the Eiffel Tower in the background of the closing shot.<br/><br/>Along the way, we get some very gory images. The greatest single scene of carnage takes place when a helicopter pilot uses his rotor to mow through a crowd of rage-zombies in Regent's Square Park. Limbs, heads, and other less identifiable bits of bodies fly everywhere in a scene that reminded me of the lawnmower sequence from Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive."" Even moreso than the first movie, ""28 Weeks"" owes a lot to George Romero's zombie movies, though for my money the rage-zombies are scarier than the lumbering corpses of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and its sequels. These revenants move fast, and most of their victims never really see them coming. I'd rather face a Romero-ghoul any day of the week! This film definitely succeeds in building tension and suspense. It held me throughout the slightly over 90 minute runtime, and once the action starts, it never lets up. This comes at a bit of sacrificing of the more complex human interest story that formed most of the middle of the first film. The two turn out to be very different movies in this regard. ""28 Days"" was largely a story about humanity set against a horror backdrop. ""28"" Weeks is about the horror itself. It's still a good movie on its own terms, though not quite as good as ""28 Days"" overall.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have with ""28 Weeks"" is the editing of some of the footage, particularly early in the film. The images flash by so quickly and disjointedly that its impossible to figure out what's going on. That's probably just the effect that was desired; at various times, we get POV's from both victims of the rage zombies and the ragers themselves. Still, the flash-flash effect gets a bit annoying after a few seconds and it literally hurt my eyes to the point where I couldn't look directly at the screen for more than a couple of seconds at a time. Sequences using the effect were a bit too long. Overall, this is a small complaint, though. ""28 Weeks Later..."" is a good, taught horror flick, and viewers with strong stomachs will probably enjoy it."

","Just like the 1st one... a very engaging topic and a good start. IF you have read any of the reviews of the movie and the story as well, everything is about the 1st hour of the movie. The rebuilding of London, the start of the new RAGE virus, US military control, a possible cure. Very interesting build up and plenty of direction.<br/><br/>Then it becomes ZERO plot other than the 2 child actors doing what they can to stay alive. YUP... thats it, no other involvement with the cure, US military, NOTHING. The US military involvement isn't even shown in the last 1/3 of the movie. Just lots of ""stay alive just because"" plot as the build up of the movie and plot lines just end. You are left when the credits roll with the feeling of... ummm well it started off cool.<br/><br/>The 1st two minutes are NOT engaging at all but lead to a VERY COOL sequence, then... after the 10 minute opening sequence, the carnage they started was the best the movie has to offer. People comment on the helicopter scene. Yeah... thats pretty sweet, but really... if you are looking at one blood bath scene that lasts about 5 seconds as the savior of the last 1/2 of the movie, I suppose you are easily amused.<br/><br/>If you remember the 1st one, the DVD had a TON of alternate endings and i wasn't too impressed with the way that it ended, and if you see the alternate endings, you will clearly know why they chose the one they did. The problem with this movie isn't that it kicks the door open for a 3rd, but rather the last 1/2 of the movie that has zero character development and completely absent of any plot that was built up in the 1/2 half.<br/><br/>I give it a 3 for the potential that the movie had, but nothing more as the last 1/3 of the movie felt like nothing but zombie movie filler."

","I like 28 days later , its a good movie. Good character that you can empathise with and follow throughout the film, a slow build of of tension and the explosive gory ending.This sequel has none of this. The gore begins right from the off and is laid on too thick and too fast , making it lose its impact and seem slightly comedic at times. None of the characters are likable apart from Robbie Carlises , who isn't given enough decent screen time to carry the film. The gore/violence gets more and more ridiculous and at times it was like watching one of those crappy films like Hostel or the remake of the Texas chainsaw massacre.Basically this film relies too heavily on the ""shock factor"".Whereas 28 days later is a decent dark drama/horror, the sequel is just a pointless romp which uses up gallons fake blood in an attempt to keep its audiences attention. Needless to say , I thought this movie was a wasted opportunity and left the cinema disappointed."

"mistoppi","9","1","3","23 March 2017"," An amazing sequel, even if it's not necessary
","Did 28 Days Later need a sequel? Probably not, but I'm still glad we got one.<br/><br/>The story in 28 Weeks Later is happening in significantly smaller area. In 28 Days Later the main characters travel a lot while in this one the characters mostly stay in London, and especially that small, secured area in London. The more confined milieu gives the story something more, since the virus and the infected aren't really a thread somewhere outside, but it's inside, among you. And it creates even more chaos when the US soldiers are trying to control the situation. It's brilliant and agonising.<br/><br/>While all of the movie is very good, one of the most effective moments is at the beginning of the film, when Don (Robert Carlyle) runs when the infected attack his wife. Another friend of mine had seen the movie and described it to me when we were younger, when I was about 11 or 12. And I still remember the way she described it and how impressive, maybe even awesome that scene was. You're used to seeing people being heroes in movies, and that was the opposite. Even if we may not really experience Don's fear in that scene, his actions are incredibly powerful. <br/><br/>Also the shaky camera, quick and fast shots at the beginning were a bit worrisome. I was afraid that's what most of the movie was going to be like, because it just kept going on and on. It's effective, but also makes everything really hard to follow. Yet you could see the most important things. <br/><br/>The only thing I like less about this movie is how American it seems. Of course it takes place in UK, and Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is a Spanish director, so it's not the movie itself. It's mostly how the US army is involved in securing London, letting people back in London. It's annoying, but also it seems really typical. It's annoying because you know that's exactly how it would go.<br/><br/>28 Days Later doesn't necessarily need a sequel. 28 Weeks Later is different, and a certain touch is missing with Danny Boyle, but Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has made something haunting and amazing. You don't need to see it, since the story is different, but it's still absolutely worth your time."

This is a obviously not an easy decision, but the only intelligent one. So far so good.

Okay, so obviously we're to assume he's immune. At first you think ""That's too obvious, I'm sure the writers think more of their audience than that"", but later on we learn that he is indeed immune and this fact is where the movie hits one of its many sporadic climaxes(Note that I say many climaxes because I'm honestly not sure what this movie is trying to prove, but it's my opinion that it has nothing to offer or prove). Was anyone with an IQ above eighty surprised by this?<br/><br/>We now learn that they are the children of the man from the first scene, the man is now the caretaker/engineer of the newly established colony run by American lead NATO forces. I honestly didn't take note or care about any parallels to the war in Iraq, but looking back apparently the filmmakers think Americans are bunch of bumbling idiots; most of the people that gave this movie positive a positive review have proved them to be correct.<br/><br/>So first were made to believe that ANYONE would want to come back to Britain only 28 weeks after such a horrible disease destroyed much of the population.

Then you realize the genius behind the operation! The only logical way to keep the operation cheap would be to hire the most incompetent untrained dipshits ever to don the uniform.

I guess were to assume that whoever he reported them to was in no major hurry, because they freely run/ride about London for what seems like hours. Eventually they get to their house and retrieve a few personal effects. Then the facade of the movie is truly revealed, this movie is simply a product of appallingly lazy writing. The mother who was presumed dead has been living in the house since she escaped the massacre from the first scene. We later find out that though she shows no symptoms, the mother is a carrier of the virus. Everything from the point on is predictable, engineer upon learning his wife is alive nonchalantly waltzes through security(They made a point earlier in the movie to shove his big all access pass in our face and wiggle it around a bit, but even so it doesn't make any sense that he would have access to an area so potentially dangerous) and lays a big sloppy kiss on her. He rages(?) kills the mother and proceeds to infect some morons, and those morons infect other morons, so on and so forth. <br/><br/>Whats the best way to make sure a disease is controlled? If you answered ""Huddle everyone you're supposed to be protecting into a confined space where the disease can spread more easily"" then you answered correctly! So the predictable happens followed swiftly by the predictable, until we're left with a bunch of morons attempting to survive the onslaught of their moron overlords. The leader of the bunch of morons is one of the sniper morons seen earlier throughout the movie.; he radios his helicopter pilot moron friend and arranges a rendezvous. Remember when arranging a pickup NEVER TELL HOW MANY PEOPLE NEED TO BE PICKED UP. So the pilot moron and sniper moron meet, argue, and then some running happens until the morons trap themselves in a car in the middle of some unidentified deadly gas. The sniper moron gets himself killed by pushing the car out of the gas, his death is met with apathy.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the zombified father appears randomly. So what a surprise when he appears at the very end of the movie and attacks his children. His son is infected, and now a carrier that shows no signs like his mother(As indicated by what looks like blood in the whites of his eyes). The siblings are evacuated and, predictably, the final scene shows that mainland Europe is now infected, presumably due to some contact between the boy and a priest.<br/><br/>I don't see how anyone with half a brain could have enjoyed this swiss cheese plot. Maybe, MAYBE, if I could have looked past all the gaping plot holes then I might have found something enjoyable in this movie, but I seriously doubt it. The characters aren't believable, plus they're very shallow with few redeeming or relatable qualities(Although I'm sure many moviegoers could relate to their stupidity). Don't support this piece shoveled crap by renting or buying it. Please pretend it never existed and go watch a real movie."

The first 20 minutes or so were quite good, so when the film went south -- quickly -- it was all the more disappointing.<br/><br/>The typical end-of-the-world-type virus wiping out most of Britain was pretty well done, as was the US military coming in to handle the recovery. Then two incredibly implausible, nay, downright idiotic,things happen. A virus survivor -- possibly a carrier -- who should be under tight security, is basically left alone in a warehouse so that her husband can wander in and get infected. After the outbreak is discovered, the city (London) is supposedly ""locked down"" -- which apparently means you crowd a bunch of people in a basement with big windows on all the doors, and then only lock the front door.<br/><br/>Once the infected husband basically walked right into the ""quaranteen"" area, I had to turn this stupid piece of garbage off. Did a six-year-old write the script? Don't waste your time. I'm with some of the other posters who find it incredible that this dog got a 7.1 rating out of 10.

During the movie it shows that they were being watched as they crossed, why did it take 15-20 minutes for them to drive and pick them up? Also, their father is the ""caretaker"" of the facilities keeping the power and water running smoothly. No one ever said he should have access to military equipment or secure medical facilities. Had he not had access to the containment room, which he wouldn't in real life, the 2nd outbreak wouldn't have occurred, there fore rendering this movie useless.<br/><br/>Not only was I a projectionist, but I've worked in casino security, and I've had a lot of access to a lot of places in casinos, but unless I was directly responsible for money, I didn't have access to the money.

","Zombies began as shambling reanimated dead who's favorite word as well as food was Brains. Then, they became shambling, slow-paced, white-eyed reanimated dead with death on the mind. Now, they are welcomed to us as sprinting death machines that will mow you down and not relent for a second until you're one of them.<br/><br/>In 28 Days Later, everyman Jim awakes from a coma that shielded him from the new world order as well as a wardrobe. A fateful disease consumes London with the power to turn even the nicest of people, some devoted to god if I remember the church scene, into raging, bloodthirsty mobs of sprinting terror. After escaping the pandemic with some survivors, Jim is welcomed into a house filled with British soldiers who would kill you as much as look at you. Jim and two other girl survivor swiftly escape the crazy army men as they are swarmed by zombies, bringing an end to that tale. Now, a new one emerges.<br/><br/>As England is declared relatively ""safe"" from harm, NATO Forces from America begin repopulating with new and familiar residents. The Infected die from starvation bringing the disease's vengeful course to an end. However, one loose end may bring about the disease again. A man named Don escapes an infected raid on his farmhouse, leaving behind his wife and survivors. Days later, he arrives in the city and takes up a job as a maintenance man in the Residential Block used for housing survivors. His children, Tammy and Andy, arrive after him to stay in the cordoned block of the city. One day, the children take a motorbike and leave the safe zone to the outer zones to find their old home. While exploring, they discover dead bodies from the infection among other things. Arriving at their old place of residence and exploring the inside, they discover their mother, scraggly and slightly infected, however, a unique genetic disorder has kept the infection from fully taking her. They bring her back to the laboratories to figure out how she is not infected. Discovering that her son, Andy, may be the key to the cure as he possesses the same genetic trait as his mother. As they study her blood and keep her locked in a safe room, Don enters unauthorized to speak with her and apologize for leaving her behind. She recognizes Don and seemingly accepts the apology, kissing him...but transferring the virus into Don through her saliva. Don, who is without the genetic trait, immediately becomes infected, vomiting blood and showing signs of the disease. He bites and mutilates a restrained Alice, the asymptomatic carrier of the disease, and the second available cure for the infection. Don escapes into the surviving population, beginning the course of the disease once again. Now it is up to an American nurse and a NATO Special Ops officer to get the children out of the city, specifically Andy, the only known cure to the virus.<br/><br/>CONCEPT - 10/10 - It's a step up from the documentary-like 28 Days that led us through an odd course of events, and a very good way to kick off the new Fast Zombie Horror genre.<br/><br/>MUSIC - 10/10 - I know there isn't a whole lot of it in there, but the beginning part of the movie had me out of my seat with the fast paced guitar/piano music.<br/><br/>ACTING - 8/10 - Well, the acting was okay, could've been better, but nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>OVERALL - 10/10 - A great movie and a great display of things to come in the Z-day genre. I can't wait to see other 28 remakes and maybe some use of the fast zombie style in other movies. This'll be a great tradition and an excellent addition to anyone's horror collection."

","There are horror movies that really scare and there are horror movies that really shock. For me, this one does both. As a die-hard horror fan, I would have to say that this is probably the best horror movie ever made and is better than the original. This film grips from start to finish. The scare factor is rife throughout the film. It succeeds in unsettling and scaring viewers when required. The part which gave a real fright was when one of the survivors looks through a gap in a boarded-up window looking out for her boyfriend only to be confronted by the infected. Realism is key here. The film makes you believe that you are witnessing real fear and panic and the reality that calm can so easily turn to anarchy in a second. The gore, the likes of which has never been seen before in mainstream British cinema, is great and the pace is almost breakneck. The most unsettling thing about this celluloid experience is the realism that you do not know what they are cooking up in science labs. This is the movie which could more terrifyingly close to reality than the producers think."

Built on a poor premise to set up the action, I found the characters unlikeable and stereotypical. The usual meddlesome kids and the anti-hero army type. The shaky camera affect, while affective and unnerving in 28 Days, is just annoying in the sequel. Anti-climatic ending combined with the standard set-up for a third film, probably set in Japan judging by the accents broadcast over the distress radio promise more pain down the road. The original film was groundbreaking and inspired moments of real terror while this piece is barely worth a rental and a big disappointment considering the hype given pre-release."

","After a second viewing on DVD, this sequel really grew on me. At the theater, I was put off by what I thought at the time were absurdities in the plot. The incompetence of the U.S. military brass seemed too absolute to be believed. But when I think about it, a little disconnect can go a long way, especially when you're dealing with a beast like this virus.<br/><br/>This film is not a simple rehash of it's predecessor - it spins it's own yarn. While the horror elements are undeniable, Weeks is structured more like a disaster movie. The first act provides plenty of buildup and foreshadowing. I don't think I'll be giving much away if I say that at a certain point, things proceed less than perfectly. The writing is solid enough that I felt for the characters. Certain scenes delivered extra dramatic and/or tragic weight and there were many visual images that suitably conveyed the most ghastly of occasions.<br/><br/>Following an original breakout like 28 Days Later is a thankless task. If not quite as bold and original, Weeks acquits itself well, successfully maintaining my fascination with the overall scenario established in Days. If sensational bleakness is what you crave in your entertainment, this franchise is hard to beat."

The shaky-cam was cool and edgy when it was a new, innovative technique. But it has become so commonplace that I'd reckon that it's time to move on and find something new.<br/><br/>Yeah, this film is fraught with stereotypes and enough plot holes to fly a squadron of jets through safely. Admittedly, I couldn't watch the entire film. It was intolerably loaded with inaccuracies; blatant glaring inaccuracies. First, when the kiddies are in-processing through the medical station and alighting at the subway station, in the background are Soldiers in full battle-rattle, locked and loaded. There is security every ten feet in secure areas, but no security on the bridge leading into and out of the green zone. There's no security on the infected patient. There are no roving guards outside the peri. The sniper witnesses the kids leave the green zone and does little to stop them or take any decisive action to notify anyone. There would be concertina wire around the bridge. A Soldier enters a house and begins clearing it alone. No Soldier would enter a house by himself. After the husband is infected and clearly shows signs of infection, he encounters two Soldiers who run up to him and seem to want to play patty-cake with him instead of shooting him on sight before he closes. The final straw that caused this crusty old Soldier to rip off my headphones and slam my laptop shut mid-movie was when the officer in charge walked past his gauntlet of indoor sentries, each of whom saluted him (something an interior guard in a tactical environment would not do) into the tactical operations center and someone yelled, ""Ten-hut!"" No one in the real Army would utter such nonsense. <br/><br/>This film blows. Its only redeemable quality is that it has Catherine McCormack, but even she doesn't last long. <br/><br/>Thunder Phil out"

","2002's ""28 Days Later..."" was a huge hit on both sides of the Atlantic,so of course they(as in the producers,company and some of the creators)would feel compelled to make a sequel. And why not? When ""...Days..."" left off left just enough of an opening for more to this story.<br/><br/>So it is that some seven months after the outbreak,England has been almost thoroughly ravaged by the RAge virus,but order has been restored via the U.S.Military(feeling false swelling of patriotism here),and expatriated English citizens are brought back into the country as the messes left behind are being cleaned up.<br/><br/>A brother and sister(IMogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton,whose names will catch at least a few eyes strange,methinks)return from abroad and are greeted by their dad(Robert Carlyle,getting what seems to be a rare chance to recreate the easy-going everyman character that once made him famous in stuff like ""The Full Monty""),who appears to be the lone survivor of an attack in the country which counted among the casualties their mother(CAtherine McCormack,a lady I wish I saw more of in movies),but when the duo escape the quarantined,military sanctioned facilities to retrieve their stuff from their downtown London home,they find her alive. She,along with her kids are brought back to the facility,and while under observation,a remarkable(And chilling)secret is discovered by the staff medical captain(Rose Byrne,often confused for other pretty,doe-eyed actresses I bet),and it poses a double-edged sword for what is an actually more delicate situation to the public safety that what appears.<br/><br/>I'll stop with the description to avoid any spoilers(though it's possible I might've already given some). I will say that once the show's action begins rolling,it is frenetic and emotionally very effective. Even though there's plenty of activity(And hence people active in it)it is actually somewhat sparse on characters,with the brother and sister as your main focal points and heroes. Solid,emotionally draining performances by Poots,Muggleton and Carlyle are supplemented by physical(if perhaps abbreviated)impact players such as Jeremy Renner(As one of the unit team snipers who decides to aid the kids) and Harold Perrineau(as a nervous chopper pilot on patrol). Director and co-writer Juan CArlos Freinadillo is brought in to replace Danny Boyle(who produces)and probably is fortunate to start with what can be considered a new deck of cards here,since the previous movie is treated entirely as given background effect. THat way,his direction and script(co-written by Rowan Joffe)gets the fresh treatment,neither aided nor hindered by the original. I wish I could honestly say that this show either was an improvement or a step-down from the first movie,but I'm not sure how to compare. I WILL say that this film enlightens the viewer from the first film as to the full nature of the calamity(taking it away,for the most part,from the concept of the carriers as being purely ""zombies""and more toward the concept of ""infectes""),which I think couches this in more grim and powerful reality. I guess I will say to those interested in catching this film,who hasn't seen the first movie to check ""28 Days...""(not to be confused with ""28 Days"" with Sandra Bullock),because this movie,despite being populated from almost top-to-bottom with new names,the storyline is THE most important part of both films. Like the last one,it works on a deeper level than an ordinary horror film,even if it feels like it sometimes falls into the traps(i.e. underdeveloped players,shortening of logistics to speed along action,etc.)that many films of its genre does.

Singular zombies were good and scary but when 10's or hundreds of them are running, yelling, collaborating to get the human's it all seems a bit weak... they looked/ran/acted like people - not zombies.<br/><br/>The basic premise and events that transpire were interesting in 28weeks and could have resulted in an engaging film (in abstract). Unfortunately these ideas (virus immune carrier reinfecting repopulated Britain etc) appeared clumsy and this film came off dumb. For serious horror like this you can't expect people to be actively suspending their disbelief every 5 minutes.<br/><br/>*Let me be perfectly honest and say I switched off this film after 20 minutes. I saw one scene later in the film before I watched the start and this suggested to me it wasn't going to get any better! So my giving a few examples here won't spoil anything if you watch more then 20 minutes of this awful movie* Here's how to move forward a zombie movie if you know your target are undemanding idiots:- <br/><br/>1). Refugee civilian population reintroduced to London behind military cordon. Entire situation seem artificial and unbelievable down to the unconvincing military personnel complete with artificial command structure...<br/><br/>2). (Civilian) Survivor of zombie attacks given limitless access to all facilities in a secure (military) compound.... cos he is the janitor/manager/whateverer.<br/><br/>3) Wife of said civilian is only surviving example of the virus that nearly wiped out humanity and her blood could presumably produce a cure. Yet she is held in a barely secure quarantine lab without guards or constant surveillance... This allows hubby to walk straight in (they didn't think to limit his electronic access to his own highly deadly infected wife!) - remember he is the caretaker so he has a key to walk straight into her quarantine and reinfect the whole area.... WEAKKKKKK (I nearly gave up here but wait..) <br/><br/>4) Hubby gets infected and because this film is pretty much for idiots who are numbed by films like Saw, which was also crap, we need to have him rip her to pieces and push his thumbs into her eye sockets in full colour and surround sound. CRAPPPP (I waited for the next bit before committing to cancel this awful movie).<br/><br/>5) Unbelievable-airport-novel-army-personal move all civilians into underground bunker. Their individual apartments were secured at the ground floor and probably needed card access to even get their floors... This presented a major difficulty for the plot to get enough zombies to really cause a stir. So the army people had to decide they would be safer all shoved into a dingy hole/bunker without explanation or support people - they were literally moved in and the army all buggered off... - this underground bunker is attached to the quarantine lab by unlocked emergency exit doors (the kind you find in a gym/highschool or other unsecured facility and designed to be openable by rage infected zombies...) allowing infected hubby to reinfect the population and get the whole thing rolling again.... <br/><br/>TOTAL RUBBISH, ONLY SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU LIKE CRAP, OR POSSIBLY HAVE A PROFESSIONAL INTEREST IN CRAP OR DON'T MIND CRAP!"

","The first 28 movie was a masterpiece of macabre. It had much of what is needed to have a successful horror movie: It's scary, nothing is scarier than walking alone in a dead city. No one to help you, no one to save you, all alone. Now add violent psychotic people who want simply to eat you alive. They are faster than the average zombie and they are really, really not happy to see you. Then we move away from the city and then 28 days later falters. It loses any ""scare"" factor and simply dumbs itself down. And this is the problem with 28 weeks: 28 weeks later sucks all the scary out of the film and goes with cheap scares and jump out at you horror. It's scary the first time, but after a zombie jumps out yelling ""BOO!"" for the eleventh time, it start to lose it's effect. So 28 weeks later simply loads the movie with as much cheap action as it can, so you don't feel completely ripped off. The plot is nice enough but it just lacks the SCARY! It's got atmosphere but that quickly makes room for corny dialog as they introduces 3 characters, who all last about 2 minutes into the movie. You don't CARE about any of the people in the film! They just run around screaming ""OH NO! WHY ME?!?!"" Like chickens with their heads removed! The film has zombies, it has gore, death, blood.

Whenever they died, I sort of thought, ""oh well, at least I'm a bit closer to the end."" Mainly, I felt it was a crying shame that the two people who were to blame for the whole thing survived to the end without being righteously incinerated by angry Americans.<br/><br/>The bizarre teleportation skills that the protagonists developed to move 10-15 miles around London (on foot) were particularly offensive when combined with their determination to double-back on themselves at every opportunity.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the ""dramatic"" ending designed to deliver the virus to mainland Europe completely ignores the fact that there is already a tunnel connecting Britain and France. If a US/NATO force can't even quarantine the Isle of Dogs, why should we believe that a bunch of customs officers managed it with the Channel Tunnel? This film is a perfect example of what goes wrong when you take a great, low-budget zombie-flick and increase the budget by 20 before you've asked for a decent script.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there's still 30 minutes of a very old Columbo on TV, so the afternoon hasn't been completely wasted."

I'm NOT a horror film fan, at least not of the slasher/gore genre. I'm pretty squeamish about zombie/monster movies. I don't want to be grossed, disgusted, or repulsed.<br/><br/>2.

Something more in the vein of things like Silence of the Lambs and The Andromeda Strain than Friday the 13th.<br/><br/>With all that in my, I say this: it's hard for me to understand how anyone with half a brain can say this film lives up to the first in any way whatsoever.<br/><br/>For those that disagree or don't understand what I'm saying, let me explain: horror films such as 28 Days and 28 Weeks surely require a suspension disbelief at SOME level. The question is, where does one draw the line? To what level must you be willing to suspend that disbelief? It is my opinion that, for those who expect a reasonable level of intelligence in their entertainment, 28 Days does of great job of NOT asking us to cross that line, while 28 Weeks not only asks us to cross the line, it asks us to forget that it even exists.<br/><br/>Here are examples of things that require us to suspend disbelief in the original 28 Days:<br/><br/><ul><li>that the original research facility would not be secured enough to prevent activists from breaking in and freeing the infected chimp, and thus initiating the outbreak. To me this is plausible; unlikely, but plausible.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>that such a virus could even exist. Again, unlikely, but plausible. It could have just been a biohazard like Ebola or the avian flu, but those only make people sick and die, and that isn't likely to work for a horror flick. Therefore, not such a stretch that asking us to believe that it could exist.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>that infected only attack the uninfected. This is something more of a stretch, but mostly this was a non-issue for me personally, since most of the population had already been decimated by the start of the first film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>that infection happens so quickly. Real hemorrhagic fever diseases, such as Ebola, have an incubation period of about a week. So, 20-30 seconds is quite a stretch. Still, this is a plot device that I was able to overlook, personally. Judging from the amount of brain-dead responses I've read here, this is easy for others, as well.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>that the infected are so agile and energetic in attacking others. You'd think that they'd mostly be pretty limited since they don't seem to know anything about feeding themselves. On top of that, you'd think that the infection would have other detrimental effects on their physiology, eventually making them sick and weak--especially if they aren't eating well. Again, something I was willing to overlook.</li></ul><br/><br/>You can read from the other reviewers that panned this flick about the awful plot holes that make this film unbearable. If you like standard horror fare, you'll probably like this sequel. I just can't buy characters making ridiculous decisions that are so idiotic that even someone with mental retardation would not make, just to have that character killed off, because a writer was too frigging lazy to come up with a story line that made sense.<br/><br/>If you don't care so much for such films but, like I, enjoyed the original because it was so different, then you'll likely be greatly disappointed and annoyed with 28 Weeks.<br/><br/>And sadly, this doesn't bode well for the next installment of the franchise, which will likely be even worse (as hard as that is to imagine)."

","This movie was entertaining up until the point it revealed the whole purpose of the film was to lead into the next sequel. The idea was great but when no loose ends are tied up and the plot never brings any sort of closure. Movies are intended to have endings and sequels to those movies are supposed to have endings as well. Unfortunately this isn't television where the next installment will be aired next week. I most certainly will not waste another two hours of my life to see the next movie that will most certainly end with a zombie invasion of October fest. If that happens all faith will be completely lost in horror film genre that I so used to love. What happened to movies that had psychological horror which actually made the individual feel as thought the events unfolding were actually something that could or might happen to them. Anyway i am going to watch the Silence of the Lambs or The Shining. Till next time. Goodnight and sweat dreams."

","I completely agree with the previous reviewer in everything he says concerning plot holes and the completely moronic behavior of every character in the movie leading up to the outbreak and beyond. I couldn't help but crack jokes about and express bafflement at the complete and utter lack of judgment of each and every character above the age of 12 (the age of the ""protagonist"") and really, even he should have known better.<br/><br/>Yet I'll give it a four because if you can allow yourself to fall into an impenetrable state of disbelief, the movie is fairly entertaining as a gore-fest with a few scares and it does make one reminisce about how awesome its predecessor was.<br/><br/>In fact, I would have perhaps given it a seven, even given all its negatives, if the message of the movie in the end wasn't so entirely and irredeemably contradictory. I don't want to spoil the ending, but think about the actions of the military, think about the intentions of those dissenters, then think about the outcome and tell me who the **** was supposed to be right. What did the filmmakers want us to take away from that?! My frustration with this ending is almost unparalleled. Certainly, I wasn't expecting a profound message, but I expected so much more from a film that at least was supposedly produced in part by Alex Garland and Neil Marshall. Honestly, I doubt they even read the screenplay carefully and just took a check to let someone else make a slick but ham-handed sequel to an intellectual property that they owned but weren't really interested in pursuing further.<br/><br/>Still, there's lots of fast zombies that eat people and puke blood and whatnot. That counts for something."

","After having loved 28 Days Later, I was pretty excited when I heard there was going to be a sequel. And then I saw this movie. At first I found the genetics aspect interesting, but then the one intelligent part turned out to be weak, when the entire plot line is made blatantly obvious about 20 minutes in. The camera techniques are really bad, with the exception of the scene at the beginning when Robert Carlyle's character is being chased through the field. <br/><br/>The plot holes start almost right away. Would Donald not be attack every time he passed a city in that little boat? What kind of military force allows civilians back into a place like that so soon after infection? Especially when they're still cleaning up biohazardous materials. So now the infected aren't just mindless rabid killing machines, as they were in the first movie, they can think and plan well enough to follow a tiny band of survivors across a city like London, after surviving an annihilation like that one. And of course, the main infected is completely unharmed by the wall fire shooting past his face for several moments.<br/><br/>This movie wouldn't have been as disappointing if it had had some decent scares or even tension. My sister didn't scream once, and to put that into perspective, she screamed during Pirates of the Caribbean. <br/><br/>Overall, the only decent thing that carried over from 28 Days Later was the music."

","I liked the movie, although like its first movie and so on ignorant people keep saying that this is a good zombie movie. Well if you are old enough to write about a movie then you should have enough intelligence to understand that Zombies are people who were once alive then were killed and then reanimated again by a virus or other means that kill humans and eat them. They are not people infected with a rage virus that run around spitting blood on people and end up in death due to starvation. For those who do not know this, you should not be writing comments when you do not know the difference.<br/><br/>On the movie, the only thing I did not like was the ending. Did the girl survive or was the brother the new cause of the infection? It does not say for sure and that bothers me like the time I was watching the Lord of the Rings movie and it just ended...<br/><br/>But again for those who are still confused watch a George Romero Zombie movie then watch this or the first movie and you will see that the difference between the rage virus people and Zombies is like calling a piece of Spam a Steak...."

Of course everything goes to crap, and only a few survivors are left after the smoke clears. Im being vague on purpose here.

The action/thrills are top notch, and this time noticeably bigger in scope...firebombing half of London is pretty spectacular.<br/><br/>You can tell Danny Boyle had some input in this thing, simply because it fits so well with the first one, and doesn't fall into any of the trappings most horror sequels hit.<br/><br/>I can wait for the last installment."

","Well I've been reading a lot of the comments from people on this site. I was mostly reading the negative comments of which I just had to post something to make something clear. After reading review after review about how the movie has to make logic I just thought to myself. ""WOW."" People this is a horror movie, does the movie have to make sense? No it doesn't because zombies don't exist. Period. How do you know what people would do in certain situations, have you had a zombie attack? Like said in scream, Why does the dumb blonde run up stairs instead of using the front door? The movie doesn't have to be logical, because then it wouldn't be a horror movie.<br/><br/>***Contains Spoilers*** ***Don't read if haven't seen movie*** -Now my review of the movie- I'll start right from the beginning. Well It started off just like I would want any zombie movie to start out, wondering WHAT IS GOING ON!! When it starts the people are in a house boarded up, so ""something"" can't get in. I thought it was very well done right off the bat. The infected get in people run for their lives, only one makes it. Then you meet the main characters, A Girl, and a boy of which is the children of the man that made it alive in the beginning scene. Well I'll cut to the chase. Evantually the virus gets out. When the soldiers are ordered to go ""Code ReD"" I'm thinking wow this is how a horror movie should be made every time!! The music is pumping, the soldiers are shotting away, You can't even tell if they are shotting the infected or the civilian, unforunetly. they eventually go through a series of events to get to the helicopter to get away from the city.<br/><br/>***If you haven't seen the movie you can read this*** This movie is one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen, Some of the best music I've ever heard in a horror movie, it played at all the right times. The blood was so realistic, it was freaky. The zombies were not the slow moving zombies that any ole body could kill. These zombies are fast and you are going to run your legs mad tired.

"DarthBill","4","1","3","11 October 2007"," Weak sequel to art house horror hit ""28 Days Later""
","Picking up the title number of weeks after the original ""28 Days Later"" left off (after an opening flashback set within the time frame events of the first film), the infected appear to be finished and the army is now moving people back into London, or at least the cleanest area while salvage is still underway. But in the tradition of stupid people doing stupid things, two kids sneak out into not safe zone to get whatever material possessions they want from their old house, where they find their mother, whom they believed was dead. Their mother, with her two different colored eyes (she played Mel Gibson's doomed wife in ""Braveheart"") is infected by the rage virus that ravaged the first film, yet she appears to be immune to it, though she is still a carrier. Naturally, an army doctor (Rose Byrne) wants to examine her and see if they can find a way to cure her and then turn that cure around the world, but her superior does not agree. Before either can do anything, the kids' dad/husband of the woman (shark faced Robert Carlyle) visits his wife/mother of his kids to beg her forgiveness; he kisses her passionately, her saliva transfers the virus to him, he goes mad, kills her, then he starts the whole epidemic all over again. To make a long story short, lots of people die (including the army doctor and a heroic US Delta Commando), London gets firebombed, the two kids seem to get away, the infected dad is killed by his own daughter, and while the two kids are air-lifted out by a US chopper pilot, the film ends with his chopper empty in Paris, where the infected run wild.<br/><br/>Like so many sequels, ""28 Weeks Later"" tries to up the ante and shoot for a larger scale. In short order, WEEKS tries to be an epic film for its genre, whereas the original ""28 Days Later"" was a smaller, more compact road movie. ""Weeks"" has high ambitions but it never lives up to them, the film is too long and does not really go anywhere. A true blue disappointment.<br/><br/>I imagine the inevitable sequels will be ""28 Months Later"" (which would be about 2 and 1/2 years) and ""28 Years Later""."
"LazySod","3","1","3","27 September 2007"," An insult to the first film
","In 2002 the audience was treated to 28 Days Later. A film in which a group of environmental activists release animals from a laboratory. Animals that happened to be infected with Rage, a virus that makes them incredibly aggressive and hostile. The activists get killed or infected, one by one, and the virus escapes from the laboratory. 28 days later, the whole of the country is infected. The survivors seeking shelter for the infected that have only one drive: hostility towards non-infected. It radiated desolation from the word Go and to that a quick building and never relenting tension was added. At the end one felt bad. Maybe with a slight hope that better days might come in the future, but generally bad. Despairing, lonely, looking forward to accept the inevitable death that haunted all.<br/><br/>Now, in 2007, the story picks up 6 months after the original film. The US army (where did the US come from all of a sudden? This happened in the UK and as far as I know the UK is closer to the European mainland than the US - insult number 1) holds a base in London. Around that base is a secure area in which survivors live and find shelter. Then two kids of one of the survivors return from their vacation abroad and are reunited with their father. From their the chaos starts.<br/><br/>And quite sadly, that is where the insults come flying in quicker than the Rage itself. To give examples would be giving away much of the plot and its massive holes but IMO the film insults the army quite badly, it insults the audience very badly by throwing cliché after cliché at it, and it insults the first film by taking its name and part of its story. There are gaping plot holes aplenty and the whole film is predictable from the point where the kids get home again.<br/><br/>3 out of 10 infect-eds eating the directors and the plot-writers"
"InTheWakeOfReason","2","1","3","17 September 2007"," Say it ain't so...
","Staggering! How anyone could consider this film anything but appalling is beyond me. It's predecessor '28 Days Later' is brilliant, this is nothing short of shockingly bad.<br/><br/>Relying on cheap 'shocks' (which fail to shock since they are telegraphed by the use of the most clichéd cinematic devices) this film fail on every level.<br/><br/>Shaky cameras are interesting when intelligently deployed, but tiresome when overused - guess which camp this film falls into.<br/><br/>Robert Carlysle does himself no favours in this film. He is an incredible actor but obviously failed to read the script before signing on the dotted line for this one. Ouch! Robbie, you really can do so much better than this pap.<br/><br/>--Spoiler time--<br/><br/>This film is so full of bad cinema it is hard to know where to start. The plot has as much substance as jello, the acting aspires to mediocrity (with the occasional exception), he choice of lighting (especially the naff 'simulated night-time imaging' sequences) leaves much to be desired, the shaky camera with very rapid cutting fails to inspire, shock or entertain (it simply annoys).<br/><br/>Let's look at the plot...<br/><br/>We follow on from 28 days later, but 28 weeks later (brilliant), all ""infecteds"" are supposedly dead. Two children (children of Carlylse character) are passed into a ""safe zone"" (WTF? Who would bring their children into such an environment, I'd be trying to get out to them!). Okay, perhaps Carlylse's character is a humanitarian (not that the film suggests this) and he wants to help. So, the Amaericans have invaded yet another country and are clearing up London and attempting to repopulate it. The children ""escape"" the safe zone into London (passing armed guards, climbing outside bridges, and being spotted AND REPORTED while doing all this and the Americans cannot catch them! DUMB or what!<br/><br/>The children then proceed to go home to recover a photo of mother, only to find mother is still alive (having survived an attack earlier in the film - it turns out she is somehow immune to the rage virus). Okay, if we forgive the kids for being as dumb as house bricks, and the American's for being hopelessly incompetent, and the script writers for... (No, sorry, that one is unforgivable!)<br/><br/>So, mother is brought back to the safe zone as a ""survivor"". Note, SHE IS BROUGHT INTO THE SAFE ZONE. No quarantine outside the safe zone until we know what is going on. No quarantine for the children who have been wandering around outside the safe zone. Nothing. Oh, sorry, they are locked in an apparently unguarded room.<br/><br/>At this point my suspension of disbelief blew a gasket and the whole film collapsed into silliness. Despite my best efforts to forgive incompetent scripting, poor story line, lousy film making and generally sad acting I really, really, really recommend you give this a miss.<br/><br/>Even the gore is weak.<br/><br/>I'll give it two because I'm in a very generous mood."

","First, just to make clear 28 Weeks Later shouldn't be included in the zombie-movie genre. The infected aren't UNDEAD but very much alive. Geroge Romero movies are zombie movies. <br/><br/>28 Weeks Later sustained the suspense which 28 days later had and in some points went even further. There was good balance between the gore and suspense which kept the movie interesting till the end. Juan Carlos F. really made his own movie and is great addition to the 28 movies. When scenes with people their emotions in the situations were directed truthfully which gave the movie more realistic feel. This movie is just action and gore, but it centers around people, who are trying to survive in the middle of catastrophe. This is what Fresnadillo has done perfectly he has told us a story. This movie is full of surprises, and things that happen to some character and the twists are truly amazing and there's hard to before hand what happens.<br/><br/>Even though Juan Carlos Fresnadillo hasn't done a horror movie before this he shows that is capable of pulling that of with flying colours.<br/><br/>8/10 Excellent choice for horror fans."
"jezzerr","2","1","3","9 September 2007"," Eh? What?
","Those two words kinda sum up 28 Weeks Later, a sequel with admittedly a lot to live up to but after a promising start devolves into the usual zombie chase flick with plot holes big enough to make the plot of a troma movie look like a masterpiece in comparison.<br/><br/>28 Days Later (the original) was a great film, and deserves so much more than this trash as it's sequel. 28 Weeks Later starts with a group of people taking shelter in a farmhouse. We are introduced to the main character (portrayed by Robert Carlyle) and the semi-main character, his wife (Catherine McCormack), suffice to say the relatively calm opening soon descends into the usual Zombie Attack (tm) with Carlyle's character forced to abandon his wife after being separated.<br/><br/>The film then continues into a plot-hole filled absurdity that many sequels are guilty of falling into. My main complaints are as follows...<br/><br/>1. We are introduced to Carlyle's son (son!? i though he was a she for a good while) and daughter who have been living in a refuge camp in Spain. According to Carlyle's character he has ""access-all-areas"" due to his job as a kinda supervisor. Now i don't know how the USA army does things but i can kinda hope that they never allow a civilian an ""access-all-areas"" pass.<br/><br/>2. The two kids then ""escape"" from the secure compound and enter the main area of London. OK stop me if im wrong, but surely any entrance/exit would be covered with enough guards and cameras that no-one (especially not 2 kids) would get through. But nope, the USA troops gain a collective ""blind spot"" and although one of the snipers does see them there is no response to his report.... err scuse me!? people escaping into major city that was filled with Zombies!? surely all the apaches flying around could maybe persuade them to go back into the city but no...<br/><br/>3. The contingency plans are so laughable its painful, shove the entire 15,000 repatriates into a garage and lock the doors!.... hang on, what about that un-secured fire exit, shouldn't that be guarded... nope!..... stupid stupid stupid, this is when you realise that 28 Weeks Later is just plain insulting. Suffice to say loadsa people get infected so the response by the military... kill everyone!.. yep the US army really is that bloodthirsty.. c'mon! In the end, instead of establishing outposts and firing lines for the zombies to break on the decision is made to firebomb the island (hey we gotta get at least 1 explosion in) <br/><br/>4. The main party (Carlyle's kids along with the general ""red shirt"" group) try to get themselves extracted by helicopter, however the pilot can't land where they are so directs them to travel 1/2 way across the city to a park... 2 minutes later there is a shot of them standing in a street that could fit 2 choppers in side by side! <br/><br/>5. Robert Carlyle's character is so built up, but then contracts the rage virus by kissing his wife (who's been found alive and is infected but not a zombie.. yadda yadda thin plot) so the first 20 minutes or so of the movie seem to have been a waste of time as he descends into a rage filled, growling, snarling rampage. However once he's left the military area (seriously, not ONE person managed to shoot him, in what should have been the most heavily guarded area where his wife was being held) he becomes super-zombie... able to track his kids somehow, and showing up like a messy version of Jason to stand menacingly in the background. Seriously, how was he meant to have escaped the firebombing?! <br/><br/>6. The ending is predictable and screams ""ONE MORE SEQUEL"" at you.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later could have been brilliant, instead it leaves you confused and insulted. Avoid!"

"patrick-web","3","1","3","2 September 2007"," A not-so-good sequel due to a weak screenplay and logical errors
","Let's turn to the good things first:<br/><br/>The first 10 Minutes were really scary and reminded me of 28 Days. Watching Donald Harris (Robert Carlyle), his wife and some other people hiding in a cottage, desperately trying to survive and to keep up some kind of normality and the tragedy that follows gave me the creeps. <br/><br/>To show how the authorities would deal with such an epidemic on hostile ground is a good starting point and not a bad attempt to make some easy money with a sequel. Even the ""Crime And Punishment""-stuff - the conscience-stricken Harris trying to fix things and making everything worse - gives the story some weight and could be used as an excuse for his high frequency appearances in a not so good shape during the second part of the film. <br/><br/>Using a hand camera can underline the severity of an outbreak, how normal people turn into fast and furious killers. I guess that's why they used it in several key sequences so extensively. And, of course, the in a certain way hostile action against a crowd of infected with the only help of a helicopter is really an excitement!<br/><br/>The bad things (which unfortunately dominate):<br/><br/>Well, as a lot of people here have already claimed, while the setting, the acting, the FX and even the dialogs are not that bad, it's mostly the script that sucks. There are so many illogical elements in the story and so less room for suspense:<br/><br/>Why has a facility manager access to the most secure research areas, which in fact turn out to be less secure then a broom closet in a countryside hospital? Why does the secure zone look more like a post-epidemic theme park with civilians enjoying their stay than like a research area, in which lots of scientists are trying to deal with the virus (like in ""Outbreak"" for instance). While there are lots of military personnel, there seems to be only one medic in charge! <br/><br/>Why is a secure zone settled into an urban area which is a nightmare scenario in terms of protection and security control? And why does the mood of the military change from ""evething's fine"" to ""let's nuke the whole city"" within the twinkling of an eye (which is somewhat comical).<br/><br/>I think all these caveats are the prize for a fast forwarding action flick, in which dealing with a majority of infected and burning down a city area is more important than showing how even a highly sophisticated security system would be eroded step-by-step by the virus.<br/><br/>So after the moment something went wrong in that film, the story is quite predictable, it's only a body count without suspense or even some twists in the story which could beef up the suspension. And that's why a shaking hand camera and a showing up Carlyle are more annoying than giving us any creeps or telling us something new."
"steve-ballantyne","9","1","3","29 August 2007"," An excellent play on our fears, a ""zombie film"" for modern time
","Many argue that they just don't make good zombie movies any more. When George Romero created his classic movie about the common man becoming the undead, he was making a political statement. He brought race, gender, and the Vietnam war all into a sick and horrifying satire and made you digest it until the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Somehow this film managed to draw you in a similar way. It seemed that the director was able to bottle up some of our worst imaginable nightmares and feed them to us with a hand-held camera on foot.<br/><br/>Some great directorial ploys which work very well in this film: Empty streets - nothing is creepier than seeing people tread around a completely dead city which once thrived with life. Crowded dark streets - we know how people react in a panic situation (and it was painful to watch). Confronting loved ones - I don't want to spoil the whole film if you haven't seen it ... but what a set up! Military loses control - the American military is sure that they are in control, but they slip their grip and we are all in danger. Seeing horrors unfold from a child's eyes - Most of this film takes place around a young boy who is just old enough to know what's going on, but not quite man enough to control the situation. You are in constant fear that he's going to be next. Musical score - rather than plug a lousy soundtrack, this film used non-vocal scores to push your buttons and give you the willies (which was quite effective).<br/><br/>I would sincerely like to see a follow up to this film, if the same writers, directors, etc. are all involved. A highly underrated success, which deserves multiple watchings."

","28 Weeks Later is a very dynamic, fast, ferocious and wild movie. And, yes this is true, this one belongs to the kind of films that do not make you think, but, instead, grip and hold you by their tempo and speedy change of events. The sequel to 28 Days Later is also taking place in infected London. The view of the great city, taken by the plague, is breathtaking. All those empty streets, all those neglected parks, all those ruined houses are spellbinding, as well as excellent helicopter shots. Then, there are very, very fast zombies, running all around and looking very frightening. Well, the film is only about 90 minutes long, and this is a rare treat nowadays. What is good, it does not get boring or dull. The fast pace remains throughout and that is a great side. What is bad, somehow, is that method of shooting the scene, when the camera is shaken and stirred all the time, and in some 3 minutes it becomes very inconvenient to watch that blurred sequence of actions. The heroes? Well, the movie is so intense, that they have no time to develop or express themselves at any rate. They either run or chase. The only person you feel sympathy to is that military marksman who gets killed by mistake as he is thought to be one of the infected zombies. His death is so tragic, but his life is so full of heroic deeds that he really evokes sympathy. Watch this film if you want some really intense and condensed action. For some deep and serious pondering, this work is not a good choice."

After we had Jim and co. - a group of people we really cared about - how could they base the sequel on some children, the parents, the military, and general British society? <br/><br/>It's almost as though it was undone by a bigger budget. Too much thinking went into it. Nobody really cared about the details of the rage virus. The entire 'immunity concept' should have been kept as a little by-the-way storyline. <br/><br/>It starts off well, though. A tad too slow, but good. Then, after the beginning, it gets bad. We see too much of these children. You mean to say that with a virus threatening an entire country, they found time for the family drama? Come on... Resurrecting the mother later on, spoils the beginning, which had up to then, been the high point. And we keep seeing the father throughout... as though he's like a zombie stalker. Infected don't stalk... or at least, they shouldn't. <br/><br/>And then, what's worse, after bombarding you with the family drama for about 60% of the movie, mother and father die and they hit you with doctor girl and army man. (note - the annoying children are constant throughout).<br/><br/>In the end, I think what killed this sequel was poor characters. Just as Jim and co. made the Days enjoyable. Either poor characters, or poor character development. Or maybe I just hate it when 15 mins into a picture, every character just fits into a cozy little character description. eg. 'annoying/stupid children'; 'pretty doctor girl who can't hold a gun to save her life' ; ' goodish-looking army man who dies ten - twenty minutes before the end who leaves you wondering wheter or not he is a main character' ; 'worhtless/coward father who dies badly'... you get the drift. Nothing new in Weeks."

","SPOILERS!!! <br/><br/>Firstly, it's extremely improbable that anyone in the world would even attempt to repopulate Britain in the short span of seven months. After years of intensive research and testing it may be considered; but a few months and risk exposure to something that can literally wipe out civilization in the blink of an eye? I doubt it. Second; for what exact purpose do they import these civilians? To get on and lead what sort of productive lives on an island in the middle of what is clearly the most dangerous location on the planet? The whole premise behind the repopulation idea makes no sense at all. You would suspect that any Britons lucky enough to have been out of the country wouldn't enjoy the prospect of having to go back. They would have far better and safer futures elsewhere. If anything, a safe zone may have been established for any survivors, but one purely for purposes of quarantine first, and their protection second. Next, considering that this disease is as rapid as it is deadly, the defenses from entry and egress into a secured safety zone seemed rather anemic. To allow two teenagers to so easily breach a perimeter defense is a stretch. Further, it made no sense either to allow the husband to come into contact with the lost wife so easily. Again, an aggressive contagion that can destroy the world and anyone can just walk in and kiss her? Security pass or not, he should have been shot just trying to enter the building as something of this sort usually qualifies as a CDC level 4 containment. <br/><br/>Notice how the rage zombies can easily punch through walls in the beginning scene, then when the escape party is trapped in the car, the zombies can't seem to punch through the windows? And locking people up in a basement for their own safety? It would have been easier to keep them all upstairs in their apartments and protect or block the entrances as zombies can't fly; and if they get infected, occupants within the building can be contained much more easily. Also, jet fighters dropping incendiaries onto the street may look cool, but fuel air munitions would have done a lot more effective job in the nooks and crannies. Walking in the darkness, it would have made more sense to have the one with the enhanced optics lead the way while the others held onto her belt than have her play traffic cop in the dark. That too, seemed improbable.<br/><br/>Best part? The helicopter zombie lawnmower. First time I ever saw a helicopter do that. It was great. Overall, I had waited for this sequel with baited breath as I loved 28 Days. Was I a bit disappointed? Yes. But did I enjoy seeing it? Of course. That makes it a 5/10 effort in my book, and an extra 2 points just for the helicopter scene, giving it a final 7/10 score.<br/><br/>Ralph"
"MartianOctocretr5","6","1","3","26 June 2007"," Stage 3: Extermination
","A wild zombie style movie, with blood and gore galore, boasting some uniquely grotesquely ways the ""Infected"" and the non-infected find to exterminate each other. Keep an eye out for the pilot, who gets the award for the most creative way. The movie borrows the theme from such classics as The Thing, Body Snatchers and many others: the victims transform into killers, too.<br/><br/>This movie is set some six months after ""28 Days,"" and subtly works in to the story a little background for those who did not see the original. The virus is believed dead (ok, allow poetic license on that one), and although this is an obvious set up for its return, the story works in some character development and subplots to spark the disaster. I liked the contamination/riot sequence, spiced by manic camera movement that increases the level of chaos. These camera movements sometimes make the fates of individuals difficult to see, however. Pivotal characters to the plot, such as Rose Byrne's (the finest actor in the cast), could have been on screen more. The children were fairly good actors, but some of their scripted actions (like deliberately visiting a quarantined area) were contrived. The ""Blair Witch"" style sequence, although obviously just for fun, was clever. <br/><br/>This movie guarantees more ""28"" sequels, since several story arcs are left wide open for further use. Overall, if you can overlook the movie's plot holes, it's a good horror story, where the action never lets up."
"redwhiteblue5087","6","1","3","27 May 2007"," Fairly good sequel
","If the makers of 28 Weeks Later set out to make a shocking, gruesome and intense horror film, then they succeeded, but it was such a frantically paced movie, half the time I had trouble working out was going on.<br/><br/>The film moved at such a breakneck pace, it barely had any let up for the audience to absorb what was happening, unlike the original which had a steadier pace and allowed the suspense to build gradually, rather than a full on assault.<br/><br/>I found some of the scenes shocking, especially the dad becoming infected with the virus and killing his wife, and the main soldier getting burned to death, which was harrowing to watch.<br/><br/>The film was very graphic and intense, but was more shallow than the first one, as the characters weren't as strong and it didn't really add much to the story from 28 Days Later. It worked better as just a straightforward zombie/action film."
"kevin_crighton","9","1","3","27 May 2007"," Intelligent, thoughtful, scary horror movie...
","28 Days Later, directed by Danny Boyle was a well made and intelligent movie about a virus infecting people in Britain and the chaos that results. It was also a scary, gory horror movie.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later picks up the story after the end of the RAGE virus in Britain. The Americans are leading a NATO force to rebuild the country and re-populate the evacuated people. Into the mix come 2 children, Tammy and Andy who had been abroad on a school trip when the original outbreak occurred. Their parents, however were caught up in events... which leads to an act by their father Don that ultimately will cause chaos and horror once more.<br/><br/>I believe there have been comments by some critics, comparing the events in the movie to events in Iraq. I will concede that. But I'm not here to talk about a political horror movie (if you want to call it that). I'm writing to say if this is a good or bad horror movie. That's all.<br/><br/>And I'm happy to say that it is. It's got a few scares, some bloody violence, some shocking moments, and an ending that sets up a potential 3rd movie.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, but credit has to go to Robert Carlyle. The scene where he tell his kids what happened to their mother is very well done indeed. Rose Byrne is also good, as a major in the army worrying about the possible return of the virus. With this, and Sunshine this year, she may be on the verge of big things. Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton are good too as the kids who get caught up in the horror of the virus.<br/><br/>Credit must also go to the director, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo for not simply following the brilliant original but making this follow-up his own movie. The scenes in an empty London, don't look like copies of the ones Boyle did in the original, but his own take on the city.<br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant sequel (and when was the last time we had one of those?!). Who knows what horrors await if they decide to do another one (28 Months Later?).<br/><br/>I for one would look forward to it..."
"gary-444","5","1","3","26 May 2007"," Irritating but Inventive Sequel
","After the shortcomings of the recently released ""Sunshine"", Garland and Boyle, the Executive Producers give further evidence that their talent doesn't quite match their ambition.<br/><br/>A sequel to the limited, but well delivered 28days later, was merited.A sci fi film set in a contemporary Britain riven by virus crazed zombies/ crazies is worth revisiting. Initially the opening sequence when Robert Carlyle, the lead, is besieged by lightning quick vicious zombies is handled brilliantly. The camera work and editing combine to make a genuinely terrifying and horrifying scene.<br/><br/>However when the film settles down the hand held camera work and trademark grainy dark visuals start to irritate, as do the holes in the plot. The London settings, for a film financed in part by the UK film Council are thudding - Tower bridge,The Dome, Wembley, Big Ben.Nice for the Yanks, but a bit too obvious for British audiences.<br/><br/>The allegorical content regarding the parallels between the Americans inability to ""hold"" central London in the same way as they have failed in Baghdad is fine. You either ""get"" the layering, or you don't. Those that don't are not missing out as it does not interfere with the mainline plotting.<br/><br/>Pretty consistently dark, gory and unpleasant, there is an hilarious scene towards the end when a helicopter uses its blades to decapitate dozens of attacking zombies causing everyone in the cinema to burst out laughing - intentionally so, and a piece of welcome ""black"" relief.<br/><br/>The finale neatly opens the way for a third installment in such a way that i am sure it would b successful. Maybe next time eh Danny and Alex?"

","Wow, I just went and saw 28 weeks later and it was fantastic! I don't know where to begin I can't even watch horror movies, I watch about 1 a year and usually regret it. I saw 28 days later at the cinema and enjoyed it, surprisingly. So was very excited to see more.<br/><br/>I was sold within 5 minutes and it kept getting better and better. Despite a change in director the film clearly kept the same feel as the first, even the same sound track, this is all a very positive thing. The shots, colours, lighting it's weird to say but I feel in love with a horror film!<br/><br/>The London shots were full of emotion, sad to see it in such a tragic state with shots of destruction but they were also magnificent and stunning pieces of CGI. I must say the whole film was surprisingly emotional.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle was brilliant, as were so many, even the whole American's coming to save the day thing didn't bother me, every character had good reason. I don't want to hype it too much but<br/><br/>One Word: Fantastic! And how excited are you about 28 months later?"

I loved the beginning, but the rest of the film felt rather drab and didn't really have any direction, it felt like it was going nowhere and this was more apparent after the outbreak. Then the film ended just when it started to do something. The ending was very quick and felt like a chunk of the movie had been cut out so that the film could be wrapped up to fit into your typical 99 Minute movie.<br/><br/>The film didn't create as much tension as the original did, I never felt like I was on the edge of my seat. I felt it was more of a bloodbath movie where there was plenty of unnecessary gore, some scenes were just had to look at.<br/><br/>But there were plenty of good bits in the film and I did end up enjoying it, I'm a bit of a sucker for Zombie film.

Why did Don have security access to enter his wife's holding/observation room? (I know he showed off his access to his children at the hotel in the opening.. but why would he have full military access?) Why wouldn't her room be guarded at the very least? The evacuation of the people and subsequent ""Code Red"" chaos was shot so chaotically.. i couldn't tell up from down. Kinda cool on a visceral level..

"neilmitchell","Null","1","3","21 May 2007"," Dumbed down for American audience
","I was very excited when I heard that the sequel to 28 days was out. My excitement turned to reservation when I heard that Danny Boyle wasn't directing and Cillian Murphy wasn't the lead. But Robert Carlyle did a fine job and Fresnadillo directed in a similar fashion to Boyle anyway.<br/><br/>It seemed to me that the story is Americanised not because (Surprise surprise) it was the yanks who come to the UKs rescue, but because to enjoy it or even ""get it"" the US audience needs macho phrases (using their own terms and accent)and US trigger-happy troops shooting the place up. There was plenty joking from us, about the UK being better off with ""RAGE"" than having Dubyas troops over here.<br/><br/>This film was dumbed-down for bigger box office earnings in the states and in doing so it lost the story line. <br/><br/>It was like watching a London tourist board promo DVD!! IE. come to London and see Canary wharf,the Dome,Greenwich,Millennium bridge,the London eye,Wembley stadium etc etc These landmarks are so randomly located that even with enraged zombies chasing me I'd be unlikely to find my way round them all in a couple of hours. Nevermind a tourist finding their way from a West-End tube station to a North London stadium, in-the-dark, underground and without a gps or map. And while were at it..... how did Carlyle find his son and daughter on a random platform on the other side of London (from the isle of dogs)???? In short, they lost the plot by Americanising but I still enjoyed the ""jumpy"" frights, gore and the ""in a heartbeat"" soundtrack. ""28 days"" was much more believable though."
"grahamh-5","6","1","3","19 May 2007"," A Repeat of Resident Evil 2
","OK, first off there may be things you consider ""spoilers"" in here, so *SPOILERS*, OK, the movie wasn't bad. I enjoyed it, but there were a lot of things that make you say... why? Why would you do that? Why?? But the thing is, if you've ever seen the second Resident Evil, it is pretty much like the writer of this film just took the Resident Evil script and adjusted it. In Resident Evil, there's the happy city of Raccoon Town or something, and they're all fine and happy, until the virus breaks out. Then, the army people who are supposed to be protecting the people of the town instead end up killing everyone in the town as a way to get rid of the infection. In this movie, after all the citizens get back to England all happy, what do you know, the infection is back. And then they can't contain the infection, so the army who is supposed to be protecting the citizens, start shooting them all down even if it's obvious that they're not infected. Secondly, the reason that the infection returns is because there is a random person, the mother of our hero children, who turns out to be immune to the virus. So they don't appear to be affected, but they are just a carrier. So she gives it to someone else who then gets infected and spreads it leading to everything. If you remember in Resident Evil, Anna, or whatever her name is, yeah she's immune to the T-Virus, so even though when other people are bitten or whatever they turn into a zombie and start killing people, she looks fine. And then there's the little girl who also is immune to the T-Virus. She has it in her, but she isn't a zombie, what do you know this mother who spreads it... yeah, her son ends up to have it as well. There really isn't much story outside of that. Citizens running and getting bitten by the infected, or being shot down by the US Army. That's it... Resident Evil without the final fight between Anna and the big monster dude with guns and knives and such... and I guess that's kinda sad that that's missing. Again, it wasn't bad, I just feel it could have been better... Disappointment since I love the first movie..."

Its lonely, its tense and the emotion and fear is pervasive.<br/><br/>The cinematography is spot on and looks like the success of the previous film got them more than 5 minutes to seal of parts of London this time as we run for our lives through the abandoned streets. 28 Weeks feels bigger budget and aimed to cross the pond successfully but the cleverness in story telling doesn't leave the viewer feeling like another great foreign films been hijacked by Hollywood."

","I'm really surprised at the unusually high ratings this movie has gotten here thus far. I love schlock, exploitation, and just plain bad horror films, but it's usually because they were intended to be such, or the budget dictated they turn out as such. 28 Weeks tries to do far too much in one film and actually accomplishes little. I felt like I was watching a series of extended trailers for parts two, three, and maybe even four. There are some ridiculously stupid plot movers that defy actions even the most clearly painted victim at Camp Crystal Lake wouldn't make; character missions and goals that seem closer at home in a video game (get here and complete the level type stuff) that left me frustratedly wondering why. The one good thing 28 Weeks delivers--gore. There's enough great looking carnage to satisfy any gore-hound if he or she can survive the epileptic seizure inducing camera work. It appeared as if much of the action was filmed Pamplona style with raging bulls hot on the heels of the cameramen. I liked the original and had good hopes for this sequel, but I cannot say I liked it after the first 40 minutes passed."

"christopherstock","Null","1","3","16 May 2007"," A bigger, badder, British!, zombie? thriller.
","28 Weeks Later (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 2007, UK) is the sequel to Danny Boyle's British zombie thriller 28 Days Later (2002, UK). Fresnadillo mixes dark fast-paced chaotic close-ups with huge special effects and tension building periods of eerie quiet in a film that is big on gore and scares.<br/><br/>The film is set twenty-eight weeks after the rage virus swept across Britain and now, still in the midst of a US led clean-up operation, Britons' are being brought back to London for repatriation. Needless to say the virus breaks out again and the film follows two US soldiers trying to save brother and sister Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots) as they try to escape from the infected.<br/><br/>It is disappointing that after the original distinctively British film the sequel sees the American's wading in to sort out a mess that the British seem to make worse in thirty-minute increments. I suppose that this is down to the American money that was poured into the film and the need to tailor it for a US market.<br/><br/>This hardly detracts though from the blistering camera work that is at its best during the terrifyingly disorientating and frenzied zombie attacks. A dark and desolate London landscape is conveyed through a mixture of voyeuristic high angle long shots and uncomfortably close close-ups that convey both the isolation and vulnerability of the protagonists as they make their way past a series of noticeable landmarks.<br/><br/>The soundtrack uses the same motif from the first film and benefits because of it, heightening the desperate battles for survival that the children have to endure."
"g_skerry","5","1","3","14 May 2007"," What exactly was 28 weeks later?
","As a big fan of 28 days later, I was looking forward to this. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. I think as a film it was torn between the thought provoking ideas and phenomenal camera work of 28 days later and a more straightforward horror film. The scenes of a deserted London, especially with the gas pouring through the streets, were brilliant but this is nothing new. Most of the ideas were recycled from the original, without adding anything new. Particularly irritating was the repetition of the 'thumbs in the eyes' scene. However, the parallels to the ongoing situation in Iraq, particularly the U.S. occupation of London were really well done and effecting. Undoubtedly Danny Boyle's role as executive producer gave the film some of the qualities of his original but other than that I was not that impressed.<br/><br/>OK, so i admit that I jumped when expected, and was unsurprisingly horrified by the film's brutality and gore but it was all too predictable. I began to get annoyed by the choices people made that in real life would not have been made.<br/><br/>The children deciding to leave the safety of the compound was the stupidest decision made, but was ultimately necessary as the only means of creating the plot. The film was riddled with these unrealistic choices and, combined with the excessive scenes of various people running away from various zombies, it descended into a run of the mill series of horror scenarios.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle was, admittedly. Ultimately this, and some other redeeming features, was not enough to counter the film's inadequacies. Leaving the cinema I didn't feel thrilled, or happy, I was pretty disconsolate. I guess that was the point though."

","When I walked into this movie I was not expecting a lot. A sequel made without the same director, or writer, or one member of the original cast seemed to me a direct to video movie. For the first half of the movie I was wrong. The opening scene with Robert Carlye was suspenseful and the start of the outbreak was great. It was the first horror movie since the remake of Hills have Eyes that my friends shut up and just watched. Unfortunately the mistake happens when the story focus on the two children of Robert Carlyle. Their Brother and Sister always protecting each other relationship was a downer because they always seemed to cause the disasters that they needed rescuing from. The look that Srgt Doyle gave the Doctor was more interesting than the siblings relationship. What finally killed it was the car scene where the character Doyle is pushing the car in the smoke. I would not try to ruin it for anyone, but after that scene the movie became predictable. I personally would see this movie for the first half, which was suspenseful, had great action, but was extremely gory and than go out and see another one when the car scene is over."

This is quite possibly one of the best sequels to a movie i've ever seen.

","Immediately, 28WL grabbed me with the familiar sense of abandonment and helplessness that I felt in the first film. The crude actions that lead one to survival in the midst of the infection. The motivations of the characters were more personal.<br/><br/>The action scenes were more violent, the infected just as violent but held more intensity, and the plot drove through the film like a Japanese bullet train. Unfortunately, the chaotic scenes between the infected and non-infected were not shot as clean as the first. Danny Boyle did a better job in respects to making chaos look clean.<br/><br/>At times, it was difficult to collect my thoughts b/c of the fast pace. Several hoaky and unrealistic scenes took away from the film, but not enough to walk out of the theater disappointed. If you liked or loved 28 Days Later, I highly recommend spending the $10 bucks to see 28WL on the big screen to form your own opinion.<br/><br/>-SC"
"ll254","6","1","3","11 May 2007"," Could have been great
","OK, I just watched this. This is not a review, just one guys opinion.<br/><br/>Its a decent popcorn movie, but it fails to rise to the level of the original. Its a fun night at the movies, but once you watched it once there is really no reason to watch it again. It fails where the original succeeded for three reasons.<br/><br/>Actors - the original had some of the best acting ever seen in a horror movie. There was great chemistry between Celina (sp?) and Jim and between the cab driver and his daughter. This movie has four generic bland actors in lead roles as the kids, pilot, and the medical officer. None of them are really developed beyond what I just wrote. We don't care if they die. The parents (cant spell actor names) are actually played by good actors and have chemistry between them, but are killed off early and needlessly. The guy who played the sniper is the only one who shows some character, but he cant carry the film by himself. All the deaths are pointless, seeing one good character die creates a bigger emotional impact than seeing a thousand extras mowed down by snipers/machine guns, helicopter blades, and fire bombings. This movie is like Aliens without Ripley or Newt.<br/><br/>Director - More is really less. Hence books are always better than the movies based on them (unless the book was awful to begin with). The first movie left a lot to the imagination, we didn't see how the infection spread through London but everywhere we saw the aftermath. This movie shows everything, leaves nothing to the imagination, and the result is underwhelming despite a lot of creativity on the part of the filmmakers. Same with the shots of empty London. In 28DL we got small glimpses of deserted London that haunted us, here we see a travelogue of every single landmark in the city shot from a helicopter, it stops being cool really quickly and gets annoying.<br/><br/>Cinematography - is also out of place, the movie apes its predecessor without understanding the purpose behind the technique, as a result action sequences are hard to discern, and you are always aware that you watching a movie cause every second the camera does some art school shot. The technique was effective in a small horror movie, it is not effective in a big budget action movie which is what this is.<br/><br/>Its last sin is actually a result of the other three, its not scary. Between the generic actors, expensive but soulless crowd scenes, and drunken monkey camera work, we stop being concerned for the characters and are taken out of the movie, as a result we are just not scared.<br/><br/>There are five good minutes in the movie, and its the intro. The movie would do better just to follow Don."

The first movie (28 days later) had an amazing story, and while this one lacks the story a little more than that of the first, everything is made up by just the overall action packed entertainment in this film and all the characters did a great job with their given rolls in the movie. <br/><br/>**This movie is violent!! The eye-gouge scene in particular is hard scene to watch so I'd recommend this movie to only hardcore horror fans who are used to that kind of stuff.**<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to any horror fan looking for a suspenseful thrill ride.

","Compared to the 2002 movie ""28 Days Later"", then the 2007 sequel ""28 Weeks Later"" is actually a notch better. Which in itself is a good achievement for a sequel.<br/><br/>And in my opinion it is the storyline told in ""28 Weeks Later"" which just nudges the sequel ahead of the first movie. It is every bit as fast paced and action packed, but the difference is that ""28 Weeks Later"" have a more detailed character gallery in it, which adds a whole deeper level to the movie.<br/><br/>Similar to the storyline as in ""28 Days Later"", the story told in ""28 Weeks Later"" is set in Britain after having suffered through a debilitating outbreak of a deadly rage. With the American army coming to the rescue (medling as always, eh?) things seem to might be brightening up. However, things have a nasty way of not turning out as intended and all Hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>The characters in ""28 Weeks Later"" are more detailed and given much more personalities and background compared to the character gallery in the predecessor movie. And the talents cast for the various roles and characters in ""28 Weeks Later"" also really added to the end result of the movie. They had some pretty good talents on the cast list, and I was especially impressed with Robert Carlyle.<br/><br/>The storyline is helped along quite nicely at the hand of director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who skillfully carried on the torch from the 2002 predecessor movie. And the effects in ""28 Weeks Later"" were as good as they were in the first movie, a thing that is essential in zombie / outbreak movies.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed ""28 Days Later"", then you definitely have to, without a doubt, sit down and watch the sequel ""28 Weeks Later"", because it is every bit as thrilling, captivating and manages to actually be a notch better. This is, by all means, a worthy addition to the collection of any zombie aficionado."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","4","9 October 2015"," An Inferior Sequel Yet Very Much Capable Of Standing On Its Own.
","The follow-up chapter to Danny Boyle's post-apocalyptic horror that infused a new life into the subgenre of zombie films by replacing its reanimated corpses with people infected with rage-inducing virus, 28 Weeks Later stays true to many elements of the original but makes way too many absurd choices over the course of its runtime to finish as an inferior sequel.<br/><br/>Set nearly 6 months after the events that transpired in 28 Days Later, the story of 28 Weeks Later paints an empty portrait of London that seems to be on the road to recovery after US military intervenes to restore order. The survivors are brought into a quarantined facility but things once go out of control when a surviving member turns out to the carrier of the virus that decimated the entire city.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 28 Weeks Later begins with an absolutely thrilling prologue that sets the tone for the upcoming events. The plot then takes us through what all has happened in the time gap between the two films and from that point onwards, it's a downhill ride. There are plenty of poor decisions made here, whether its reintroducing the virus or a resurfacing zombie or the drama surrounding one dull family.<br/><br/>The set design manages to capture the tone of the original but fails to take advantage of it. Cinematography goes completely mental after the brilliantly filmed prologue for the camera is swung without any sense of direction and the chaotic aura it was aiming for isn't entirely realised. Editing is fine for the most part. John Murphy returns with a welcome score. And the performances are all over the place, with Jeremy Renner leading from the front.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, 28 Weeks Later follows into the footsteps of its predecessor with much bigger aspirations & higher budget but fails to provide us with characters that are worthy of emotional investment, something 28 Days Later pulled off quite effortlessly. However, much of its unfolding story retains the thrills & terror of the previous chapter, and apart from a few dumb decisions, it's an enjoyable, entertaining & quite satisfying ride capable of standing on its own. Worth a shot."

","My favorite movie so far, iv seen it once in the movies (snuck in because I'm not yet 18), rented it out on DVD and watched my friends download of it. Each time it gets better. This movie is a great combination of gore, storyline and great acting. It is a battle of first the infected and uninfected, second against the aerial attacks and lastly the protectors themselves. All of the people featured in this movie should be proud of being a part of this production. I suggest that everyone wanting a great horror and dramatic storyline this is the way to go. If you are not a fan of renting, download this movie. I am not usually a fan of people downloading illegally but it would b a worse crime to not watch this movie"

","It gets a rating of one because at least the acting was good. But otherwise, the plot was crap, the film started really quickly then slowed down then got quicker again. The audience didn't feel any empathy towards the characters when they died, the audience doesn't care. To give the allusion that there were lots of people infected, the cameramen swung the camera around- frankly leaving me dizzy. It was obvious that they only had a 40-50 people taken from the street and given the part of running around like deranged lunatics, but not very convincingly. It seems only James bond films and the Queen, are the only good films to come out of Britain.<br/><br/>I would have been more entertained by watching a Disney film."

Unfortuneatly this was yet another poor relation of a film cashing in on the franchise name. If this film had been a stand-alone effort it would have died quicker than the cattle-like victims in this film.<br/><br/>The biggest horror of this movie is the virus of stupidity that has spread from the US gore-fest horror films and has infected and corrupted this film.<br/><br/>As a Londoner I have to ask whether Kellie Pickler or Miss Teen South Carolina were responsible for the Geographical continuity and the plot?<br/><br/>Robert Carlyes GPS enabled super zombie was a marvel, because if the film makers can mass produced his ability to track his children, I'm sure the CIA would be the first to buy it so that they can find Osama Bin Laden.<br/><br/>If this films depiction of the efficeincy and abilities of the US Army is accurate then I'm truly surprised that they were capable of invading Grenada let alone Kuwait and Iraq. <br/><br/>Though there is much banter over the supposed stupidity/ignorance of the citizens of the US, films such as this re-enforce this stereotype."

That's pragmatically excusable to save budget, but this film shouldn't have needed it. It could have done with less CGI, and more choreography.<br/><br/>And finally we ding 2,562,724 for stupidity, which kicks in as soon as the location moves to London, and never quits. There's too much to list, but the standouts include the tedious guided tour of London landmarks, the ""securing"" of people in a bunker with a back door, the curious ineffectiveness of automatic weapons against massed charges (funny, it worked in World War I), the unbelievable deliberate Blue on Blue fire, the ""I can see, so you go first"" subway scenes, the infuriatingly clumsy military banter, and in the helicopter rip-off scene, they apparently plain forgot that they weren't making a Romero slow-headshot-zombies film!<br/><br/>It's simply sloppy writing, scene after scene after scene, and I find it intolerable in comparison with 28 Days Later, which only required a suspension of disbelief in the premise. 28 Weeks Later seems to cry out ""Yeah, we know this is dumb, but wait until you see the next pyro-CGI-gasm!""<br/><br/>So, that's a total score of -2562717, rounded up to the minimum that IMDb will let me vote."

For the simple reason of good acting, good story, plenty of zombie action and gore and some of my favourite scenes are when London gets fire bombed and of course that scene when that helicopter comes in and chops up all those zombies also it looked so real. I think by looking at the ending if there's going to be a sequel it will be set in France. And of course after I rented it from Blockbusters I quickly went out to bye it.

","Very good! This is a top notch zombie film, but it didn't quite live up to its predecessor. It was a little more predictable then ""28 Days Later"", but is still a very frightening and disturbing movie. One area in which this film exceeds ""Days"" is how claustrophobic it is. I don't quite know how to explain it, but certain parts in the movie just made me feel uncomfortably close to what was going on, and the first seemed to take place more out in the open.<br/><br/>I thought that most of the actors did an excellent job. Robert Carlyle, Jeremy Renner, and both of the children all gave great performances. Jeremy Renner in some respects reminds me of Nathan Fillion. He is a talented actor who is very underrated. He was definitely one of the better parts of the SWAT movie. It was good to see Michael from Lost in the movie also! Harold Perrineau was a great addition to the cast.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is tense, and it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat through its entire length. I loved all the neat camera views the director used, especially the night vision scope in the tunnel, that was great. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a good job with taking over the reigns from Danny Boyle. I'll be interested to see what the success of this movie does for his career as a filmmaker."

It seems that the inception of the virus is within seconds and immediately forces the person who is infected to expectorate to reinfect. The beginning of this movie graphically depicts this within the movies' first ten minutes. The ending is brutally depressing, but I won't mention it even in a spoiler, it's that good to see.

","I had no intention in watching a sequel of the Danny Boyle classic. I thought, as so many sequels, 28 Weeks Later would be cursed from the start. The viewing of the stinker 'The Hills Have Eyes 2' made my preconceptions only stronger. Boy, was I wrong...<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later is an exciting mix of horror(gore) and action that will please fans of the genre. It's at no time as good as 28 Days Later although the action scenes are more spectacular at times. I was surprised to see the excellent Rose Byrne turn up in this and some other solid actors. Of course the story is improbable, of course the action is over-the-top, of course the acting is ridiculous at times, of course there's no character development...nevertheless it's a movie that will have you jumping out of your seat and that's exactly what it's intended for. The gore is excessive ( much more than in 28 Days Later) and I couldn't help but look away in one scene.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later biggest flaw is the lack of dramatic intensity, no philosophical content and of course many, many plot holes. Do not try to compare it to it's predecessor, as that one manages to score a lot better on the above mentioned points. At what points is 28 Weeks Later better then 28DL? The action-scenes are downright spectacular, also the originality of the action-scenes deserves to be praised. The camera-work is excellent, contributing to the choking atmosphere throughout the movie. <br/><br/>To sum up: 28 Weeks later is a great summer action/horror movie, that will definitely satisfy fans of the genre."

Alien was an example in tension, Aliens was an example of the emotions felt on a roller-coaster ride.

Nobody to hate, nobody to confront, no target for revenge. Only total anonymous death to run from and wait out for years.<br/><br/>I combed over all the horrible decision making regarding the handling of the virus with a good friend of mine.

This could be any of a dozen horror flicks where the focus is one the splatter rather than the characters. The characters, unlike in the first one, suffer from terminal stupidity. The way which the virus gets out again is dumb even by horror movie standards. Oddly enough, since it seems like such a lesser movie, there's not enough time to get to know any of these characters and care about them. In 28 Days Later e knew that it was Jim's story. In this film whose story is it? Is it the father? Is it the kids? Is it the military? The whole thing is a mess. The military plan makes no sense, even as these things go in films.

The difference here being that the real success of the first movie was done to the fine details and characterisations,That feeling that You could see Yourself in those situations,and the way that self survival and the idea of cowardice can be interchangeable.I believe that if the movie had been made by the people that bought us the implausible but highly entertaining "" Children of Men"" that we would have another hit on our hands.However this is not the case.The movie seems to go for the usual generic shocks and mind-games without provoking any sense of real interest.Im so annoyed with the makers of this film because although fans seem to feel that a film they like has some obligation to go the way they would wish it to go.I just feel that this movie went straight to bargain bin popcorn flick.Please no sequel ..........."

Only with the video game, you generally get a little entertainment in between the snippets of bad acting and worse dialog. You may notice that it took 3 writers to write the 100 or so lines of dialog in this movie. If you get a chance to hire any of them, stone them instead. I did say there was a redeeming quality.

I should have heeded the golden rule about sequels. They generally suck. To be fair I am not going to claim that this film sucks, or that it is not worth seeing. But at matinée prices of 9 bucks a head for three of us, (+ gas and overpriced popcorn and cokes) we could have seen something that didn't just tick us off. And I don't know how anyone who loved the originality and cleverness of the first film, couldn't be ticked off. Gone is the loose indie feel and haunting quality of the first film. In it's place is a hi-pro-glow shoot-em-up with over-played MTV style low-attention-span action sequences that go on and on long past the point of generating any excitement, and leave us only confused as to what the hell is actually happening. Gone is the clever subtext from the first film contrasting the infected and the militarist mindset of the soldiers in the keep. Instead we have an attempt to only create a non-stop adrenaline rush, volume full-blast from the resurgence of the infection until the very end. How to take something unique and make it typical. IMHO, not an awful film, but I could have waited the DVD... in order to skip past the stupid bits."

There is strict control and military law that screens all incoming people and protects inner London from possible contamination. However, things do go quite as planned and there is another outbreak of the Rage virus.<br/><br/>The story is a good continuation and there is a solid tie in back with the first film. There is more intense gore and horror, but the film is brought down by several crippling weak points. The way the outbreak starts here is due to some incredible coincidences that don't make for strong storytelling. Then there are the dramatic elements, which made the first film powerhouse horror along with the gore, but here they are much weaker. Several things that demand some sort of explanation remain virtually untouched and then by the end the script starts to take turns that very obviously favor action/suspense over following logic that was established during the build-up. Then the ending sets up the film for a sequel in a very uninspired way.<br/><br/>Audiences that enjoyed the tension of the 'Days' will have more of that here to look forward too, but as a good really horror film, this just doesn't work.

"TheNorthernMonkee","5","1","4","15 May 2007"," Not as good as the original, but still freaky
","SPOILERS So it comes to this. Another sequel of a decent one off movie. I'd love to know how much of the decision to make this movie was down to the American studios. Distinctively more of an Anglo American project than the first movie, ""28 Weeks Later"" is a weaker movie attempting to blatantly create a series out of an original one off concept. Continuing the violence and gore of it's predecessor, however distinctively less character driven, it is a suitable Americanisation of a British concept. It's freaky and sometimes fun though.<br/><br/>Half a year has passed since the original outbreak of the virus. With Britain quarantined and the majority of the population dead or relocated, the infected have died out. With an American lead NATO force clearing out the Isle Of Dogs in London, so begins the gradual re-population of our fair country. With an American military assuming that everything is under control and civilians increasing in numbers, you just know that things are going to go wrong. So begins the onslaught.<br/><br/>It's remarkable how a film can repeat so many ideas and yet get them so hideously wrong. Just like the original film, here we have a deserted London (how the hell they managed to make certain places so devoid of life, I do not know) with landmarks left to grow aged and untouched. Just like the scene on the bridge in the original, so we have major landmarks shot beautifully with a grainy camera. Whether Canary Wharf itself, or more traditional locations like Big Ben and St Pauls, so we have venues which I know and love. Yet, unlike our original film, these are not clever, subtle moments, no, instead at times it is like we are watching some form of holiday programme working for the Tourism Board. Walking across the Millennium Bridge, for example, is completely unnecessary. Yet it feels like the location is added purely for the hell of it.<br/><br/>Most notable in the flawed advertisements of London is the use of Wembley. Filmed prior to the completion (Another example of the slow building affecting events), the interior of the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was used instead. To most I confess this would not be obvious, but to anyone who has watched the FA Cup, or a rugby match, or any sporting event at that venue, the switch is pathetically obvious. If the filming couldn't have been done inside the stadium, change the script.<br/><br/>Away from the locations chosen, the story just isn't as good as the original either. So good because of the characterisation, the first film was a joy to watch. Shocking, unnerving, but ultimately brilliant, it developed characters fully, and then bumped them off without much of a fuss. Yet in this second chapter, blatantly following on the American style, here we have badly developed individuals killed in a beautiful moment of poetry. Well, that's the intention anyway. The ultimate flaw here is that this concept is the wrong way round. Like in the original, people are interesting beings, with lives, histories, and generally a personality. They are also ridiculously mortal and can die in an instant. So, how come in this film, they are all shallow, weak, basic characters who appear to fight through multiple scenarios and come out on top. It's insane, and closer to a Die Hard movie than real life.<br/><br/>Another complaint, albeit slightly less important than characterisation and location, is the way that a powerful song from the first film has quickly become a soundtrack.<br/><br/>In the first film, as we all remember, and if you are like me, adore, Jim invades the military compound to one hell of a good piece of music. Building up slowly but surely, this tune aided the film and developed subtly. It didn't overwhelm, it appeared purely once, and it fitted perfectly. So on to the sequel, and again we have it. Yet no longer is this piece of music gradual and poetic, now it has become a soundtrack piece to be used half a dozen times whenever something ""scary"" happened. Over used, it looses it's power. Yes we wanted to hear it again, just like how we wanted to see the virus take form, and see a few subtle landmarks, but like everything else of beauty in the first film, it is smeared on here in excessive proportions.<br/><br/>It's a weary route to try to bring back some sort of reprieve for this film now. So flawed in so many ways, I want to leave it be, and yet, like I said in my introduction, there are good sides to it. Well, one good side. Basically, it's fun, and it does hit the occasional right note.<br/><br/>Much more low brow than the first film, for all it's flaws, ""28 Weeks Later"" does provide the adrenaline rush required. Gruesome and often violent, it does leave you with an uneasy feeling. Like many other Zombie films, it is out to satisfy the blood lust which we possess, and it does that well. It also possesses the occasional joke, and allows us our brief British Xenophobic dislike for the Americans. It pushes those buttons rather well in fact. Like I've said though, it is distinctively low brow. Whilst the first film was a near masterpiece of British cinema, this effort feels distinctively more like a middle of the road American gore-fest.<br/><br/>All in all, ""28 Weeks Later"" is a bit of a disappointment. Vastly inferior to the original in all the ways that made it a classic, it is a violent movie with minimal characterisation, excessive tourism agenda, and an overuse of a subtle tune. If you want a blood bath though, and feel like walking out of there with a dislike for everything American (including the woeful set up for a third film), then you are in luck as it does these well."

","OK, so some friends decided that it would be a good idea to see 28 weeks later last weekend. i was kind of opposed because i had never seen the first one and i wanted to know what it was about and all that fun stuff. i learned that it is pretty much about how this rage virus takes over Britain. Cool, but I didn't think there would be much more to it than that.<br/><br/>When the movie first got started, and didn't look like they were trying to set up for a horror film. But this was probably one of the best horror films I have ever seen. It contained all the necessary elements to make it not cheesy and not completely over the top. Although the likelihood of London being overrun with crazy diseased people seems a tad bit far fetched, it doesn't take away from the movie at all. Sometimes zombie movies are generally plot less and it is about people running away from the scary zombies. But 28WL has plenty of action, emotion, and a wonderfully written plot to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>if you hadn't seen 28DL but you want to see this one, go ahead. you won't have missed anything. The movie was absolutely wonderful and you should definitely go see it right now!"
"stepwallace","7","1","4","14 May 2007"," Excellent sequel
","A film should always be judged by what it wanted to be in the first place... This film wanted to be a sequel to a very simple horror film. The first film posed the question: ""What happens if and entire country was infected with a zombie inducing virus?"", the sequel looks at the obvious follow on question: ""What happens when the zombies die out?"".<br/><br/>28 weeks after the first film concludes, the US army (under the NATO banner) has moved into London to start rebuilding. Exactly as you would suspect, the Virus has been long dormant (presumed dead), and the population is slowly starting to rebuild.<br/><br/>Throw in a nicely thought out revival of the virus, some nice if stereotyped characters, and let the fun begin.<br/><br/>The movie moves along well (at barely over and hour and a half), characters make all the classic ""oh no"" decisions, it's good gory fun.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first, then you'll love the sequel."
"carronuk","7","1","4","13 May 2007"," Frightening possibilities
","It is rare that a sequel is as good as its original, but 28 Weeks Later is one of those films that lives up to the success of its predecessor.<br/><br/>The plot was simple but effective: After allowing the virus to die, the American Army begins to rebuild Britain starting with 'District 1' AKA the Isle of Dogs... While the regeneration of London continues, District 1's population grows, and the first children arrive to rebuild their home. They are told about the death of their mother to the rage virus and that they won't be going back to their old house, so they decide to sneak out of the complex to get some old belongings including a photo of their mother. It is during this escapade, that they come across their mum who appears to have survived the virus...<br/><br/>The film definitely lived up to the original in pace, effects and plot. In fact the time flew by and although it may have been possible to make it longer, I think the right decision was made to leave it as it was, and use the time in an extremely effective way. This film had a bigger budget then the the first and I felt that this was used sensibly. In fact what made the film was the same choppy and grainy camera effects used in the original, although they were used to a much greater affect.<br/><br/>I was also impressed with the realistic attitude of the film including the decisions that would be taken in this situation, such as the anguish of the soldiers in having to first identify the infected from the uninfected, to then having to kill everyone. There was good choice of scenes used, with the 'hideout and ambush' at the beginning and the 'fox in the chickens coup' scenes (You'll know what I mean when you see them). These were particularly strong and were extremely intense.<br/><br/>Having said all this the film's time line is fairly short (24 hour period), and I'm sure many who have not seen 28 Days Later may think that the real issues such as survival, food and shelter have not been dealt with. It is important that anyone thinking of watching this does watch the original first as this film is not separate but leads on from where the first left off. This film now deals with: The problem of re-populating a country; How people handle a re-infection; The hope of creating a cure through the carriers, but at the same time the devastation the carriers can cause if the world is unaware of them; And what might happen if the virus manages to cross the channel<br/><br/>Finally this film leaves a terrifying image of how easy it would be for the virus to infect the world...<br/><br/>I couldn't fault this film in any way. Superb 10 out of 10."
"eswtg","8","1","4","13 May 2007"," ""Realism"" is all the more scary
","I know that realism is an odd point concerning Zombie films (I know they're officially not ""zombies"" but for the sake of argument I'm going to refer to them as such) but once you accept most of your fellow humans are out to eat/hurt you with no thought for themselves, its the practicality of such a real life situation that gives me the most interest. With this being set in Britain without the mandatory gun shop on every corner, it makes for a far more gritty, ""hands on"" horror film. The panic and squalor of quite literally fighting for your life amongst the normally mundane countryside/urban scenarios are far more upsetting than any cocky American, confidently shooting a corpse with a witty sound bite or overly sentimental reaction (although that does sadly occur a little in this film). I was fearful this film would fall foul of the zombies showing recognition or mercy on loved ones but instead the catastrophic change in victims is shown brutally well (in the medical room for example). The currently very popular ""night vision"" tool is used well in one scene and although the film does fall back on tried and tested structure (kids being naughty/annoying, people and zombies surviving the unsurvivable and then handily coming across each other to tie things up nicely etc) the film gripped me enough and pulled me in sufficiently to not hold them against it. I know my Utopian ideal of a zombie film where the events and horrifically realistic situations form the bulk of the film (what would I do questions raised etc) and overly emotional character plots are spared instead going for a more general overview of human response is unrealistic, my fingers are still crossed."
"johnthedon85","9","1","4","13 May 2007"," Zombies that can run.......now that's horror!
","OK OK hardcore horror fans, these are not the exact definition of ""zombies"" but with the rage virus the 'infected' in this film are showing distinct symptoms of zombie-ness. Not those stupid, bumbling ones that try and gnaw on your leg....these are fast, clever and ruthless and pretty bloody scary.<br/><br/>I never want to give away spoilers with my comment section as I always think this jeopardises someone elses enjoyment of the film. What I will say is when you combine a helicopter and a field of zombies there is a recipe for a scene of carnage..definitely one of my favourite moments of the film! Robbie Carlyle and the chick from Braveheart put in brilliant performances and it is a gear up from 28 days later (which I feel was a film that faded somewhat near the end).<br/><br/>A deserted London portrayed in film is a simple but effective tool to give an audience that 'chill' we expect from 'well written' horrors. There is blood and gore....lots of it but it never feels overused.<br/><br/>I feel the Americans come off a wee bit badly here :-) as they didn't exactly pull out all the stops to contain the spread of the virus. Even I may have worked out that putting hundreds of people in a pitch black compound with flimsy walls is not ideal in avoiding panic and keeping those blood thirsty, red eyed monsters out. haha.<br/><br/>When my GF asked if this was a sequel to 28 weeks NOTICE I said yes, so we are going this week and I shall have some zombie delight for the second time. I think it will be worth the fact she won't speak to me for a week when she realises Hugh Grant is nowhere in sight. lol.<br/><br/>ENJOY"
"gilman824","6","1","4","12 May 2007"," Decent Movie
","I never expected much from this movie because it always looked to me like an unnecessary sequel to a great movie. However, I held out with a little hope and saw it today. And, I was disappointed, yet not surprised.<br/><br/>While the movie is enjoyable on a very primitive level, it doesn't strike as many intellectual or emotional chords as the first one. Weeks focuses almost entirely on chase sequences. The movie begins fairly well, with a group of people together. Then, the infected attack and we are introduced to the annoying shaky camera technique used throughout the movie. While a ""shaky"" camera can work well with chaos on screen, it becomes a bit much in this movie. It just seems to unnecessarily confuse things sometimes. Either way, when these infected show up, the movie becomes about running, and running... and running. It rarely takes a brake to breath so we are never allowed a chance to know any of the characters. That is where this film becomes a typical horror movies. The characters are not here to be understood, they are only here to be chased by the bad guys. There are a few moments when the movie rises above this, which places the film a small step above mindless entertainment but not enough for me to recommend it to many people besides horror buffs.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a decent movie. I wouldn't call it a waist of time, especially if you are a fan of the zombie genre and are looking for your latest fix (if you are offended by my reference to this film as being in the zombie genre, replace zombie genre with ""post apocalyptic world overrun by mindless carnivorous beings genre"")"
"ChiefGoreMongral","7","1","4","12 May 2007"," Gore Mongral's Rage Review: 28 Weeks Later
","Back to Britain we go for the sequel to 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later. ""Weeks"" tells the tale of the aftermath of the first cases of the Rage Virus and then shows us what happens when a successful clean up operation goes horribly FUBAR.<br/><br/>Basically we get a telling of some events from another family that occurred during the time frame of the original and how one of the said family members is left for dead only to later be found alive. The catch is this member is not infected in the way the others were however she does become a ""carrier"" of the virus. Starting from a simple kiss we have an outbreak all over again.<br/><br/>This movie is scripted well (except for what is mentioned below), and there is enough character development to move the story along and there are some decent kills and gore but there are two things that keeps this from being a knockout punch. One the camera work, the same thing that plagues the original is back again rearing its ugly head. I like to call it Rage Cam. It seems whenever there is an action sequence the camera also gets infected with the Rage Virus and starts to spaz out so much that you can bearly make out what is going on. I don't know if when it comes to DVD if viewing it at home will make a difference or not as in the case of movies like Batman Begins but at the theater it is a definite detractor.<br/><br/>The other is some of the coincidental happenings that occur in the movie and the rather dumbed down ways that the script decides to throw the audience bones as to what is going to happen. The whole dual colored eye sequence with the boy and him saying that he got that trait from his mother and the infected father always seeming to be in the right place at the right time to jump out and attack them. You would have to see the movie to totally understand but it dumbs down the movie slightly as oppose to having some surprises we pretty much are force feed what is coming next.<br/><br/>In the end though this is a solid film and well worth a look. I really like how the ""28"" Films keep the tone very serious throughout and never reduce themselves to crappy imitators to horror by having to have a token comedic character to ""lighten the mood"". Thank God for this movie as this year has been a roller coaster for the horror genre, from the superb throwback B movie Planet Terror (part of the Grindhouse double feature) to the God awful Hills Have Eyes 2, this film fits firmly in there as a solid entry into the horror genre and maybe even upon DVD the hyper camera sequences may look a lot more clearer and bring the grade for this one up.<br/><br/>A solid movie that gets a solid score of: 7/10 Good. If only for a few ""dumbed down"" moments in the film and the Rage Cam issues this may have even scored higher. Regardless as it is it is a solid movie that if you can look past those issues you'll find more than a few things to entertain you."

"danielepinat","9","1","5","4 January 2016"," Comparing 28 days later and 28 weeks later
","Comparing two zombie films.<br/><br/>If I had to compare 28 days later and 28 weeks later, the comparison would be that the former is a good action film based on surviving a threat and while being on the road in order to find a mystical Eden, while the latter is more on an intellectual based film on relationships such as the two children and their father, lies that a father tells as not to bring to the surface his inability to have saved his wife while zombies were attacking the village.<br/><br/>In fact, one does not need to see the first to appreciate independently the two films.<br/><br/>For my critic of 28 days later, the idea of finding shelter in a mansion protected by soldiers who want to gang rape the women who are now in their custody in a supposedly core idea of repopulating the world, is quite scary as to see how people or survivors would react in an end of the world tragedy. It is a film genre where an obscure place is found only to detect the profound horror governing the find. It would be like Hansel and Gretel who, lost in the woods, come across a gingerbread house which is a form of haven only to discover the truth behind who lives in the house.<br/><br/>Without mistake the film does it very well.<br/><br/>Now, for 28 weeks later, the ingenuity of the film relies on the postulate that a safe haven has been created for survivors and that life can continue. The evil is now, not inside but outside. One can compare with Anne Frank's diary where the father amid the war raging he believes life can go on even if they are imprisoned in the house attic where they found refuge.<br/><br/>Yet, two children are brought in and meet their father who takes them in his loft and life as a family begins. Then, the boy misses his mother and with his sister go seek the home they lived in the country to seek out mementos like pictures. They find the mother, all are brought back to the city, the father reunites with his contaminated wife in the hospital, they kiss then hell breaks out.<br/><br/>Finally, the two children are saved and brought to Paris and they are responsible for the contamination of the last French survivors as we see the zombies rush out of the metro at the Trocadero, Paris.<br/><br/>The end of the two cities has come from the outside.<br/><br/>Some would argue that this film has some analogies to the Iraq war.<br/><br/>I would disagree since I see no glimpse such as symbols to the Iraqi war. However, I see some analogy to that of not protecting the borders of countries. <br/><br/>With the breakdown of borders by the unification of Europe, probably it sends a negative message as to limit entry to those who may be like the Trojan horse; enter a city with an unclear motive without anyone noticing it and bring havoc. <br/><br/>We see that today, some barriers are being installed as to limit unwanted immigration. Think of the barrier being mounted between the USA and Mexico, the wall already built in Jerusalem and now the whole of Europe with the Syrian immigrants, some countries creating barriers to slow their advance.<br/><br/>Sad! indeed. And some argue that there are terrorists are among the lot thus build barriers so they can be filtered out."

","I don't think this is worth more than a few words. A plague has killed or exiled the residents of London and the US Army, the world's epidemiologist, is now patrolling the city as exiled are re-introduced in small batches.<br/><br/>Among them is a hapless father who has lost his wife and his two lonely children, just returned from exile in Spain. A kind of Army hostess greets them at the equivalent of Ellis Island on the Isle of Dogs. The island is completely safe, she tells them in a soothing voice. Just be sure you don't leave it or you might encounter a contaminated object or a survivor. In this kind of movie, when a warning like that is issued, you become prescient.<br/><br/>The two kids promptly leave the Isle of Dogs looking for what was once their home and, with luck, a photo of their mother. They do better than that. They find mother herself, an asymptomatic contagious survivor. The Army finds the three of them and takes them back to the isolated Isle, where the next stupid act comes from the woman's husband. He can't stand to be without her. The sanctuary apparently has no control officers or guards because the husband waltzes blithely through the many doors, kisses his wife, who is under restraint, then becomes infected at once, goes berserk, bangs his head against the walls, screams, has an epileptiform seizure, spurts blood from every orifice, and attacks his helpless wife, gouging our her eyeballs with his fingers, battering her face into pulp.<br/><br/>It's a shame that it so quickly deteriorated into a more than usually violent bath tub full of gore and violence because the premise has promise. The disease being dealt with has symptoms similar to those of ebola, except for the superhuman strength and madness that movies must tack on for greater impact.<br/><br/>The locations are surprisingly good. London has changed a lot since I was last there. But the photography is fashionably dark. I have no idea how this fad got started, perhaps with ""The X Files,"" but every scene is underlighted. Even a hospital is dark during hours. It doesn't enhance the sense of mystery or threat. It only irritates you and makes you wonder what the hell is going on. And the fashionably wobbling camera is enough to make you spurt blood from every orifice.<br/><br/>The early scenes with the soldiers jerking around with one another are kind of fun, although even here cheap shots at shock are taken. (Eg., a pilot is dozing off and there is a loud noise and he is attacked from someone off screen -- but it's just a buddy playing grabass. It happens twice, as if once weren't too much.) <br/><br/>Aside from those opening scenes, what the film has going for it is Imogen Poots as the daughter. She has a nose on her that seems sculpted out of one of those plastic French curves used by school children. She's stunning. Her beauty is strictly conventional but undeniable. But -- Imogen Poots? And her close friend is supposed to be Mathew Beard? Where do the Brits get these names from? I mean, Micawber or Bumble, okay. But Poots and Beard? It sounds like a Monty Python sketch. Poots and Beard present: ""YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE IT!"", A Zany Laff Riot That Will Jar Loose Your Dental Plate!!!"
"sixbells99","6","1","5","24 August 2008"," A dark disturbing film that remains with you long after the end credits
","When I first saw the trailer for 28 weeks later, the overhead shots of apache gun ships and jets firing money shots disguised as missiles and bombs into London like a UK version of Independence Day didn't give me much hope for this film. My first reaction was oh no the studio and film makers have been infected by the greed virus and this is going to be a lowest common dominator film, made by a focus group who had just read how to make zombie films for dummies. However I couldn't be more wrong on just how good this film was and how little it sold out.<br/><br/>If you expecting a no brains blood splattering zombie film with Arnie look a-likes firing rocket launchers from their sides in an endless spiral of blood, then avoid this film. Instead it paints a bleak and hopeless landscape, a far darker and broody brother to 28 days later, It is grim and desolate and it doesn't let up from the first scene to the last. It is more kinetic than the first film with less time for character development and more action. While 28 days later shows what it would be like to wake up in a world after the apocalypse. 28 weeks later puts you right into the middle of that hell and as a result the action and intensity is relentless. Saying this even with limited screen time the main characters remain solid with only the peripheral ones being slightly weak, but in no way does this spoil the films.<br/><br/>All Zombie films fall into the realm of fantasy or quasi-believable; they take a sense of truth and reality and twist it. Zombie films in many ways are cousins to fantasy films and you'll get the most out of this film if you watch it with this frame of mind. 28 Weeks later was not designed to stand-up to scientific scrutiny, there are some plot developments that wouldn't stand-up in a court of law. But like all fantasy films this is not the point. The films makers were never trying to make a super realistic docu-style film. Even the rage virus itself was skipped over in the first film and the director and writer admitted that they themselves didn't know a whole lot about the origin of the virus. They were out to make a zombie film and a statement about modern life and where we maybe heading, which is what all the best zombie films do. 28 Weeks later has some truly terrifying and disturbing scenes. The action is brutal and packed with emotions; there is only one over the top scene, which seems like homage to other zombie films. But that is the only time this film looks into the past; it is not a rehash of 28 days later. It has a very different pace, but certainty comes from the same family with a high quality of production and direction.<br/><br/>This is well directed quality film with more than a few shocks in it, definitely not a date movie, but a disturbing statement about modern times and is harder to watch that 28 days later. Like all films that ask uncomfortable question about the present, not everyone is ready to hear the answer and it will be a love or hate film as you can see from the reviews. But as time goes by this film will grow in stature and become a snap shot of the times, just like all great zombie films."

","My expectations for this movie were really high! Because I really enjoyed the first movie, there was no doubt in my mind that I should see the sequel. Alas, this movie had many disappointments, many of which made no sense at all. That may seem a bit harsh, but there is no question about it, this movie was trash.<br/><br/>The first thing that I thought was wrong with the movie was that it was totally anti-American, but that is not why I think it doesn't make sense. There reason why I do think it does not make sense is when the people start getting infected by the rage virus again.<br/><br/>After ""weeks"" of neutralization of London, all of the infected were left to die(most likely starvation). Once this quarantined area of Britain was ""safe"" people were led into what is to be called District 1; a fully-functional, infection free section of Britain. All hell breaks out when the two kids sneak out of District 1 and go back to their home to collect a picture but also to find their very much alive mother. After a little confrontation, the movie moves to District 1 again and we see the mother strapped, clearly infected. Now this is the part which makes no sense to me. Why would she not be under any surveillance when her husband goes to see her if she is supposedly the only one infected in the entire district? Anyone with common sense would think that no one would be allowed to come in 10 feet of her, especially her husband. This also leads me to question the husbands intelligence. Why in Gods name would he kiss her after he saw her bloodshot sclera? And even if he was ignorant to the fact she had the virus in her, did he not see she was strapped there, covered in cuts and not her self. Knowing all these things, what brings the husband to kiss her? Its not love i tell you, because he left her to die.<br/><br/>This being said, why did i continue to watch the movie? Well the reason why is to see if it got any better... It didn't! The movie further starts being anti-American when the military forces all the people to run into a ""secured"" area and then closes the door on half to make it seem as though the American military does not care. This is also where the movie does not make sense to me. Those said people who were left to die in that room did not care to barricade the door. This allows for one infected father to turn into thousands of infected people. Why was the only entrance to that place left open for the one infected person to turn into thousands. The reason I believe is so that the movie can progress its anti-Americanism by showing how the American military would call for Code Red and eliminate not only the infected but the innocent people.<br/><br/>All these reasons and more lead me to believe this movie makes no sense and that it is not worth paying for. Although the the thrills and shocks in this movie are unbelievable and the only part I enjoyed, this movie gets a 2 out of 10."

Number 1 you've just escaped an infection like the rage virus and you actually volunteer to go back to Britain? Laughable plot line as you could not even pay me. Another thing how did the kids escape the quarantined zone so easily? Also this is the worst. If you've just created a 'safety zone' (which I now understand is a reference to Iraq) as any general knows you flatten all other buildings outside the zone = you see an infected and he dies straightaway. At least Land of the Dead had a legitimate answer for this one in that the zombies could swim. Another thing Robert Carlysle getting into top secret military facilities? All it would have taken for this crappy film to never have taken off was for one guard to be present outside her door and bang. Thanks for wasting 45 minutes of my life 28 Weeks Later."

","The sequel to 28 Days Later is 28 Weeks Later, and it's very good. There's a new director, a new story and characters, and WAY more production value. It took some warming up to(I was a little mixed after the ending), but this film is a definite watch. This is an action/horror/thriller with some really intense and well executed scenes of carnage and chases, as well as some fiery explosions that had me wide-eyed for the better part of 99 minutes. The film is not perfect of course, due to some very inept decision making by certain leads(a quality that always seems to pop up in standard horror) and a noticeable lack in the scare department; despite occasional scenes, the original takes the cake for the more frightening moments, though Weeks has its fair share of discomfort. But, it is not average, and a seasoned actor like Robert Carlyle ensured that it wasn't. He has some great scenes, and his acting abilities are fun to watch, ala Ravenous. Extremely loud sound effects and some bad choices aside, 28 Weeks Later is really fast-paced, violent fun with cool make-up and a decent soundtrack."

","this movie is without a doubt one of the better sequels to come out in a long time, especially for a horror movie. While the saw movies all seem like the same movie this sequel tries new ideas and takes the overall story arch into a new direction with the introduction of carriers who don't turn into rage fiends and the hope for a cure. while the first film was more of a character film and a thriller this one is a horror movie with no real main character like Jim to follow. it has several different characters that all end up together. personally i liked the first film much better, it was more interesting and felt like a complete story, where as this sequel is all about upping the action and violence and yes like almost every other horror movie coming out lately it doesn't really have an ending. loved the music though, it just seems like when all is said and done nothing anyone does through out this movie amounts to anything unless they make another one. Also I'm still unsure how i feel about the dads storyline. i liked it until the twist half way through, then i thought it was kinda clichéd and uninteresting."

","My husband and I saw 28 Days Later and loved it but this movie was not even close and the end cried sequel like so many others these days. The story is weak and the gore is just over the top. The movie lost me very early. First of all, if a woman is a virus carrier and she is locked up and strapped down, why does her husband just walk in the door with not a guard in sight? It made no sense considering the whole city is under lock and key and they still hadn't cleaned outside the borders. Did the army just turn stupid overnight?. Then there was the gore that was sometimes so crude that I held my popcorn box up to my face. The whole helicopter scene was so disgusting that it was laughable. As for the tunnel scene with the infra red camera, I didn't know what I was watching for most of it-Blair Witch Project came to mind. All in the movie was a total waste of what could have been a real good story. If you haven't seen Distubia yet-Go!...and skip this one. Or better yet rent the 1971 movie ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston. Same concept-better writing."

","This has to be one of the best horror/action movies I've seen in a while. It was somewhat original, with everything a horror movie needs plus, a great story line and great actors. Yet the most affective tool they used was reality. The only part i found hard to believe was the helicopter scene. I found that this movie wanted the viewers to feel that this could happen and that is the scary thing. They wanted you to be afraid that this could happen any day to anyone. Unlike other zmbie movies like undead, resident evil, this one had a different approach. I gave it props for giving me everything i want in a movie. I like these zombie movies because, yes they have gore, but do not try to have the big breasted teen girls and the killer in a mask type deal. It is much, much worse.

"charchuk","8","1","5","14 May 2007"," A worthy sequel
","I don't know which reviewer said that 28 Days Later is to Alien what this film is to Aliens, but they are absolutely right. Not only is the comparison apt genre-wise (first one is more horror, second one is more action) and plot-wise (first one is more intimate, second one is more broad) but also in the quality. In both cases, the first one is better, but the second one is a terrific sequel. And, even though I liked Alien more than 28 Days Later, I much preferred this sequel to Aliens. It's not without its faults, but it's a helluva film and one of my favourite sequels ever made.<br/><br/>My favourite part of the original is the scene at the end with the soldiers in the mansion, and how Jim is able to overpower them. It's very violent and gory, but also very powerful in the message that it's making. It's what elevates that film above most other films of the genre. This film is just as telling in its message. While it doesn't have one specific scene that reveals its intentions, the actions of the characters and some very memorable images (along with that brilliant score!) combine to make the sequel just as political and critical as the first one.<br/><br/>I was sorta bothered by the quick editing and shaky camera during the intimate action scenes, as other moments in the film showed that the director did know how to stage a shot and make it look good. My only guess could be that he wanted us to experience the chaos and horror of the attack scenes. It did irk me a bit at first, but I soon got used to it and I was able to enjoy the pure visceral excitement of the action. That said, the cinematography of the film is quite amazing for much of it. The wide shots of the firebombing and its aftermath, the extreme high- and low-angles used at varying points, the moving camera which works for the chase scenes - it all combines together to make an expertly shot horror film.<br/><br/>The acting was surprisingly pretty good, given that I was most worried going into the film about the kids and their involvement. Fortunately for me, even though the kids are really the leads of the film, they are neither annoying or obnoxious, and are able to carry the story. They manage to portray interesting characters without seeming older than they are - a rare feat for child actors. They're surrounded by an able cast of recognizable adult faces (if not names) that appeal to the audience before being mercilessly killed off - but it's not their film, so it works. Indeed, this may be the first horror film with children as the leads that I really liked.<br/><br/>It's not as good as the first, but it's damn close. It manages to look more polished while still harking back to the gritty feel that made the original so memorable. The ending is quite good and definitely leaves me wanting more, so it's one of the better sequel set-ups in recent memory. The return of the great score from the first is another highlight - makes the action scenes that much more thrilling. Just another chapter in the great books of British horror and apocalyptic drama, and one of the best films so far this year."
"gdematties","8","1","6","18 June 2015"," A tenser sequel!
","""28 Days later"" was a surprise hit when released, and though it didn't do as well at the box office, I feel its sequel ""28 Weeks Later"" is a much more action packed thriller than its predecessor. It is 6 months after the rage virus has swept through London. The city has been cleared of all infected victims, and is now starting to repopulate. However, when two children are reunited with their father, who survived an attack at a farmhouse, and seemingly saw his wife killed, they find their mom has also survived, and is an immune carrier of the virus. She inflicts the virus at the hospital where she's being treated, and hell breaks loose as a doctor tries to save the children from the onslaught of infected, since they might carry a cure in their bloodstream. A great turn by pre-""Hurt Locker"" Jeremy Renner as an American soldier who tries to aid the escaping group, as well as Rose Byrne playing the sympathetic doctor. In my mind, much more action than the original movie, and the film keeps you on your seat's edge."

"chrome_spokes","6","1","6","15 May 2007"," The movie failed... Sorry, hardcore fans.
","One of the best looking crappy movies I've ever seen. If only effects and masterful technique were enough. It's as if director Fresnadillo decided to forget about the plot and just go rampant with grit and artistry, which works if all we're seeing is an 11 minute film or a static wall-to-wall museum exhibit, but this is supposed to be a 90 minute film for god's sake. While the two children's desire to explore beyond the containment zone is understandable, the lack of perimeter watch-posts was totally illogical. The Army's lackadaisical response to the children going on their fit of wanderlust is thoroughly illogical. Here's the deepest cut: the children's mischief and disobedience directly contributes to the fall of the entire containment zone, AND YET, they're supposed to be the objects of sympathy throughout the film ?!? How does that make sense ?!? Conveniently, the Army doctor (Rose Byrne) couldn't put two and two together or simply overlooks that fact altogether: hello !!! In that respect, it was very difficult to root for and feel any sympathy for those sorry rascals. So now you have an implausible and illogical chain of events and characters you can't possibly sympathize with because they are so inconceivably dense. All the pyrotechnics and hyper-stylized shots won't rescue you from that... Or can they? Well, I guess it depends on who you ask. I, for one, found the plot lapses all too inane and simply unforgivable. ""28 Weeks Later"" begins magnificently, then rots."

","28 Weeks Later has way different feel than 28 Days, but I did feel like the sequel lived up to my expectations and served justice to the original. This version has way more action in terms of death scenes and it seemed way more gory. Right from the beginning the action and scares occur with little development of the characters. I like Jeremy Renner a lot and thought this was the kick start to his phenomenal career since he was so great in this. The story jumps ahead a lot, which is why 28 Weeks Later gets an 8/10 but it didn't fail to entertain at any point.

","I saw this before (and after) seeing 28 Days Later. While Days was about some individual survivors, (and had lots of silly flaws), Weeks has two strong story lines. One is about the family. There is Don (Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) at first hiding in a cottage while their children are safely in Spain on a school trip. The opening scene shows the dilemma that Don faces when threatened with attack. He panics, abandons Alice. Scary, how would I react?<br/><br/>28 weeks later, the US/UN army has come to try and rebuild Britain. There are plane-loads of new people coming in, including Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), who are Don and Alice's. When Andy bemoans that they don't even have a picture of their mother, they sneak out of the secure zone and get back to their old house. They get a photo and collect some personal things, then... surprise, Alice is sheltering there.<br/><br/>The army helicopters take them back to the medical centre, where Alice is scrubbed and a blood sample taken. Alas, she has the virus, but no symptoms, and so is immune and worthy of serious investigation. The army guys are real and likable (not like in Days). There are tender and intelligent scenes where Doyle (Jeremy Renner) shines. But they have to survive, and what ensues is awful.<br/><br/>Now the second theme of the movie takes hold. How does officialdom cope? Containment, isolation, extermination. Code Red. Ghastly.<br/><br/>We could think about the wider implications of the threats to civilization that an outbreak of Rage (the virus that causes it all), involve. Something like this.

But because it follows that film, it has certain rules to live up to, and a standard of quality. It fails miserably.<br/><br/>As a horror fan, I get used to the absurd. I get used to the ridiculous coincidences required to make a movie go. But I could NOT suspend my disbelief here, and I'm the guy willing to believe the judge in ""Ghostbusters II"" didn't notice the giant marshmallow man destroying New York City five years prior. Simply put, the way the outbreak...uh...breaks out again does NOT work. It requires a series of incredibly stupid decisions to get to where it is. I can handle plot holes, I don't expect a movie to be perfect, but if you're setting up your film as a serious horror film following a serious horror film...well, the movie doesn't play by the rules established for it.

"The_Void","4","1","15","8 October 2007"," Soulless, boring and ridiculously stupid - a turgid sequel to an overrated original.
","I wasn't in a rush to see this film when it was released as, despite the fact that the idea for the film is interesting, the film that this one sprang from - 28 Days Later - is one of my least favourite popular modern horror films. I was really hoping that this sequel would deliver, and after the first ten minutes, it seemed like it might do. I'm not a fan of the whole fast zombie thing, but the opening to this film is action packed and exciting and it seemed like the film was going to give way to something like the film that the original one could have been. The basic plot is similar to George Romero's Land of the Dead, and focuses on the idea of survivors coming back to live in a land savaged by zombies. In particular we focus on one family, the mother of which we see killed when the father left her to the hordes of undead and ran away. The story picks up when the kids return from a refugee camp in Spain to live with their father. The first half of the film is really quite good; we get plenty of eerie location shots and the plot seems fairly interesting...but then the first twist comes into play and it seems like the writers are taking their audience for fools...<br/><br/>I can't believe how ridiculously stupid the central plot of this movie is. Without giving anything away, the script writers take coincidence, stir it up with plenty of moronic character decisions, sprinkle on a few plot holes and expect everyone to buy into it! (And even more unbelievably, many people have...). Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo expertly captures the soulless, MTV music video style of the first film, and ensures that the characters snugly fit this, as despite a little character building for Robert Carlyle's character; everyone featured is impossible to care for, and the two central characters are incredibly irritating, too. Fresnadillo obviously subscribes to the view that freewheeling camera angles and flashy editing make films exciting, and that's a shame as they don't. This stuff only serves in making the film boring as it's usually impossible to see what's going on. The film does have a couple of plus points; the shots of an abandoned London are good, there's also a cool scene involving a horde of zombies and a helicopter and, as mentioned, the first ten minutes are good. Other than that, 28 Weeks Later is a horrible film with so many illogical distractions that I didn't even bother to think that Wembley Stadium wouldn't have been finished by the time of this film if there wasn't anyone around to finish it. I honestly can't believe this film got, and continues to get, good reviews...there's far better horror out there than this."

","The first film from director Danny Boyle was a fantastic British horror, this sequel from new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is just as much the same quality. The film begins first with a reminder of what the film deals with, where a family, including Donald 'Don' (Robert Carlyle) and Alice Harris (Braveheart's Catherine McCormack) are invaded by many innocents infected with the Rage virus, and have now become those fast, flesh-eating killing machines. The film then continues to the history of the infection, till eventually it reaches 28 weeks later, where the American military have secured a safe, rebuilt environment in London for the uninfected people to return to. Don, with with his son Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and daughter Tammy Harris (Imogen Poots) are among them, and it is when the kids go beyond the secure zone into the now empty and cut-off areas of London that they come across their Mum, Alice! Somehow she (and later Andy) was born with a special gift where she cannot get infected, and proof is visible in her one red eye, but what Don didn't realise when she kissed her was that she could infect others, so he is obviously the one to first start the Rage, and reinfect it back into others, and it spreads rapidly. The American army have now initiated Code Red, but they give up shooting one at a time, and they now have orders to kill all. The two army members not obeying are Sgt. Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and maybe his friend in the helicopter, Flynn (Lost's Harold Perrineau). They manage to escape the big fire dropped into the city, and they run as fast as they can to the rendezvous point, but there is almost nowhere they can go without an infected there. Also starring Rose Byrne as Maj. Scarlet, Idris Elba as Gen. Stone, Emily Beecham as Karen and Meghan Popiel as DLR Soldier. The action is the same, fast-paced, the acting is very convincing, the camera work is effective (like a documentary style), and it is just a fantastic sequel. Very good!"

With a plot description like that, '28 Weeks Later' might sound like a shameless copy of its predecessor, but it is actually refreshingly different during its first half with helicopter shots of a deserted London in ruins and lots of bureaucratic issues as various soldiers try to control the re-population of the city. Robert Carlyle is also saddled with a curiously morally ambiguous main character who we see abandon his wife early on in a desperate attempt to survive a zombie attack. The second half of the film is nowhere near as solid its the build-up though as the movie descends into mindless zombie attacks that never really resonate that much since Carlyle's kids here are never quite as interesting or well developed as the main characters of the original movie.

If you liked the first one, but still want to give it a chance due to the actors in the cast then go ahead, but be prepared to face some very bad acting. My score was given solely on everything summed up together."

","It's a rare thing to have the sequel of a movie to be equal to or better than its predecessor. ""28 Weeks Later"" is one of those rarities.<br/><br/>28 weeks after the outbreak of the ""rage"" virus that turns people into rabid, maniacal killers, an American led NATO force begins the clean up and reconstruction of England. Displaced survivors are now filtering in to a large district controlled by the military. But two children, a brother and sister, will enter the district and set forth a chain of events that will bring back infection, death and destruction. Two U.S. soldiers (played by Jeremy Renner and Rose Byrne) have the opportunity to minimize the effects of the new outbreak; but their chances are slim when they are going up against hundreds of infected and soldiers ordered to kill everyone on sight.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""28 Weeks Later"" is **SPOILER ALERT** the scene when Renner gets out of a stalled car to push it — and those inside the car (Byrne and the two children) — to safety, while soldiers behind Renner are getting their flamethrowers ready to burn him and the car.<br/><br/>A few glaring shenanigans destroyed the A grade I wanted to give this movie. 1) a woman who is a carrier of the virus doesn't have armed guards posted at her door 24 hours a day; 2) the lead infected has thinking abilities that are not present in any other infected, and the movie never explains why; and 3) a glorified janitor has access to the most sensitive areas of the military compound. Still, ""28 Weeks Later"" is an above average horror movie. Very good acting, direction and editing; a fast pace, numerous tense and horrifying scenes keeps the viewer entertained all the way to the last second.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
"ThomasDrufke","9","0","2","7 May 2017"," Terrifyingly Unexpected
","The 21st century has been flooded with films and TV shows about zombie apocalypses, so it's difficult for any of them to stand out and feel completely fresh. But there's something about the '28' series that really hits well for me. There's something so glorious about seeing the streets of London be a wasteland that only occupies a select few living and undead.<br/><br/>Similar to how the Cloverfield films are related but not directly tied in, 28 Days Later is a prequel of sorts, but the characters and plot are entirely different. 28 Weeks Later picks up after London is deemed safe and virus free, as the undead have starved to death after the events of the previous film. Of course, apparently it was a good idea for the military to reoccupy London and start building up a civilization again, even though it was the center of disaster only a half a year earlier. Implausible probably, but we've never really seen an apocalyptic series that attempts to go back and restart civilization from the same area. Usually we either see everything as the apocalypse is going down, or maybe several years later. So, in that way I like what the film tried to do.<br/><br/>I also found the cast to be quite impressive. Not only do you have some nice lead turns from Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack, but you have Idris Elba, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, and Imogen Poots before they became famous. All of which, do a wonderful job in roles that aren't necessarily flushed out. That partly because it's only 100 minutes long, but mostly because the film never takes a breath. That could lead to pacing and character issues, but with a non-stop action-horror, it actually works to the benefit of the experience. Adding to that experience are running zombies. Yeah, I'm looking at you every other horror film, it's cool to make them run.<br/><br/>But perhaps the biggest compliment I can give to the film is its utterly unpredictable. With a horror film, you expect there to be an ample amount of deaths, but the way in which Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directs the deaths is terrifyingly unexpected. And when you can't see where the terror is coming from in a horror film than you're in for something special. In all, 28 Weeks Later improves upon 'Days' scares, story, characters, and plot to make for one exciting entry in the horror/sci-fi/drama genre. <br/><br/>+Great performances<br/><br/>+Horrific scares<br/><br/>+Refreshing take on apocalyptic zombie flicks<br/><br/>+Unpredictable<br/><br/>9.0/10"
"ScottAmundsen","9","0","1","25 March 2017"," Runs a Very Close Second to the First Film
","Sequels do have an annoying tendency to take up the ideas from the original film and reheat them for a (presumably) new and younger audience. What makes 28 WEEKS LATER almost as good as the first film (28 DAYS LATER) is that it does not do this. <br/><br/>It does take us over the same ground as the first film, only as the title says, six months later. And the viewer sees the passage of time in the changes from the original. The Americans have settled down in Britain and are apparently doing their best to wipe out the plague. The question is: will they succeed?<br/><br/>It wouldn't be fair to reveal much more, but I can say that this sequel is way over-the-top in violence compared to the first film; I found this slightly irritating. As if they were simply trying to fill out the story. But that's just my take on it. <br/><br/>It is still a terrifying film, violent and bloody (not for weak stomachs), and with the same jerky camera work as the first film, which keeps the audience off balance in addition to scaring the living daylights out of them.<br/><br/>I really do wish there were more horror films like this one, willing to think outside the box."
"talisencrw","8","0","2","21 July 2016"," Surprisingly good contemporary horror sequel delivers the goods!
","This was a very good sequel to a fine zombie work (my favourite zombie film is STILL Jean Rollin's remarkable and extremely aesthetically-pleasing 'The Grapes of Death'), and I was very pleasantly surprised. Pardon the pun, but you would think that by this time, everything in the land of zombie movies would have been done to death, but I remain consistently admiring of just where the best and most thought-out renditions of the template can go. In THIS case, the most intriguing dynamic is a cowardly husband choosing his life rather than helping his wife out of a horrible crisis, then infanticide (or worse) of his own children, rather than face their wrath over the poor decision he had made.<br/><br/>It's interestingly hilarious that when you think about it, humanity is doomed because a 12-year-old had to go back and get a picture of his mother, because he was afraid that without it, he would forget what she looked like...A surprisingly satisfying work, that for horror fans, is worth a purchase and rewatching. I'm admittedly more for classic films, from the 20's to 60's, but for contemporary horror cinema, I liked this a lot, especially Jeremy Renner and Imogen Poots. It's no surprise to me that they soon became superstars."

Haunting and genuinely scary with an excellent story that gets marks for originality, has a superb soundtrack and a wow opening sequence -intense & scary- that really sets the pace for the remainder of the movie.<br/><br/>This sequel picks up 28 weeks after the ""rage virus"" has decimated the city of London, leaving it a ghost town. The virus has been eradicated, the infected have starved and an American led NATO force has moved in to restore order and supervise the repopulation of the quarantined city. For the most part we follow the Harris family, led by Robert Carlyle who is newly reunited with his children when a carrier of the virus enters the safe zone, the military loses control and all hell breaks loose again.<br/><br/>It has a gritty look to it with loads of weird camera angles; overhead, close up, shaky and grainy and of course all the shots of the deserted London streets, eerie. Its gory and graphic, about what I'd expect from a zombie movie unlike WWZ which I watched the other night this is a genuine horror flick not an action-thriller/disease movie.<br/><br/>The cast surprised me here too with turn ins from Jeremy Renner, Rose Byrne and a small role from Idris Elba.

"kannibalcorpsegrinder","5","0","2","6 April 2016"," Barely better sequel to a rather decent original
","Trying to curtail the infection, a group of soldiers attempting to reopen London thinking it safe inadvertently unleash the virus back on the population causing the original chaos all over again and force the few survivors to trail the remaining soldiers to get out alive.<br/><br/>Though it's better than the original, this one here doesn't have a whole lot really about it that works. One of the biggest problems is the fact that the film is just way too dull, as the middle section where they're going through the motions of re-adjusting to daily life is one of the longest, dullest sections in the film, coming complete with no action whatsoever amongst a general sea of nothing going on. The endless scenes of them going through the different sections of the city, from the abandoned homes to the different ways of fun, allow for plenty of scenes that are just down-right deadly dull. These have no interest at all in them, and are just thrown in for no absolute reason at all. There's also the film's maddening ability to get way too theatrical and artistic for no purpose, where this is loaded with scenes where it's just a close-up of the talker's mouths or of their eyes, and scenes throughout the film are presented by doing this, and it's distracting, unnecessary and just plain annoying. It has no bearing on anything other than an attempt to make it feel more artistic than it should. That also goes for the shaking camera tactics that it loves to explore as there's a never- ending succession of scenes that are readily destroyed by the shaking camera making it impossible to see what's happening. That this occurs during most of the action scenes is even worse, allowing them to be ruined by the shaking camera-tactic. That is the film's biggest issue here, that it rarely gets to do anything since it's mostly cut off by the tactic. The last flaw in here is the running zombies angle. This doesn't work at all, they're not scary, and even though it tries to get around them by calling them infected, they're still zombies and they don't work here. Even among these flaws, there's some good parts here including the fact that there's a great bit more action here than expected. The opening assault on the family in their home following the retrieval of the kid makes for a frantic occurrence as the ultra-fast pace and brutal kills leads to a couple thrilling moments. The outbreak sequence in the control center is top-notch, bringing together three fantastic scenes in the questioning lab that starts the infection, the creepy scene in the containment area with the darkness hiding the gobbling and attacking of the victims, and finally the full-on fun of the attack on the populace in the streets. In a sea of chaos, they target, trap, attack, kill and get killed by the others around them in a flurry of activity that is incredibly exciting and is one of the best scenes in the film. The last thing in here that works is the ending half, which includes the race to get to the safe spot in the city through the previous methods used to contain the creatures, is visually fun, exciting and a little creepy at times. Together with the violence which isn't too terrible, these are all the film has to offer.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity."

If you enjoyed the original, do not watch this. Please. I couldn't understand what was going on. When the kid gets bitten by the zombie, it 'somehow' starts to get infected then stops.

","I was actually very pleasantly surprised by this movie. I loved the first one, and expected the worst from a sequel featuring an American-led NATO force, as I though the first one was perfect as it was (especially the directors cut). I steered clear of it for a few years, before coming across it one sleepless night on E4. And I LOVED it! I'm not even that big on zombie films but this one just had me hooked, start to end. I was very pleased to see that Boyle had been involved in producing it and I actually felt Fresnadillo maintained the gritty feel of the first film. The second half was perhaps a little video-game-ish at times, but still chilling and bleak (and Jeremy Renner was particularly watchable - it was so sad when he died but then again, he did get a great send off). There were three tiny things that I kind of disliked: <br/><br/>1) I love Robert Carlyle, but did zombie-Don have to chase his kids all across London? I thought it was a nice touch that he kind of recognised them, but it would have been better if he hadn't survived the firebombing. His role was done by then. He should have just been used to get the infection from his wife, spread it amongst the people crowed in that rooms for 'their protection' (that was such a great scene) and...after that his character had no more use.Any other of the infected could have been in the underground with the kids and Scarlett: even an infected Scarlett could have been the one to bite Andy. I thought it was a little too much.<br/><br/>2) The Helicopter blades being used to slice up the infected. Couldn't Flynn's helicopter just had some machine guns on it somewhere? This was the only part of the movie that I almost rolled my eyes at.<br/><br/>3) The last...30/60 seconds. The ending didn't RUIN the movie for me, but at the same time, it would have been much, much more interesting to finish it when the screen blacks out after a glimpse of Andy looking out of the helicopter. Or it could have ended after that shot of the abandoned helicopter. But the Eiffel tower shot was a bit silly. I won't mind so much if they make a third one, because that scene's almost necessary for setting it up, but if there is no third one, the series ends on a weak note. <br/><br/>But those were the only issues I had with the film. It was so much better than I expected it to be and still managed to be original, gripping and dark. 9/10"

","I found 28 days later a good movie and expected much from 28 weeks later. It turns out to be a real disappointment.<br/><br/>Starting from the first attack, zombies seemed to come out of nowhere and were highly organized and synchronized. Otherwise why did they attack the same house at the same time in a low population area?<br/><br/>Zombies bite and beat victims so vigorously that the victim should have serve injuries over the body. It is quite impossible to survive the attack, even if the virus is submissive. (And in 28 weeks later, now blood doesn't transmit the disease if not through biting. People can have zombie's blood on face without getting sick.) <br/><br/>After 28 weeks, WHERE did the dead zombies in London city go? The US army took the risk and picked them away 1 by 1? The UK has a population of 62 million, plus a billion mammals. Dead bodies of them will be . If this happens in the real world, the new camp would be built out there in the countryside (even better an island), where zombies have no place to hide, and the old cities will be demolished with hydrogen bombs together with dead zombies, clearing up any potential carrier man or animal.<br/><br/>The worst thing is, someone could meet an EXTREMELY dangerous carrier and *kiss* her. If you won't kiss a rabies carrier, why do you kiss someone much more fatal than that? I really, really don't think we should discuss any further. Everything in this movie happens just because someone wants it happen.<br/><br/>For those who want to know insane and stupid the US army acts in the film: People, aka potential victims/ biter, were half-locked in a room to wait for the zombie to kill. This ""half-lock"" was unbreakable at first but suddenly opened up after people were bitten. The whole is absurd totally, just to find an excuse to throw new zombies onto the street.<br/><br/>Later, a flying helicopter was used to chop zombies with its rotor. Everyone knows helicopter should avoid being damaged there. <br/><br/>Summing up all these, I call this movie ultra-terrible."

I think that it is simply unconscionable that this movie exists. I have seen quite a few zombie films. None of them (that weren't comedies) compare to 28 days later. That movie was atmospheric beyond belief, had intelligent characters with realistic decisions and, above all, we saw no more than 30 infected during the entire film. 28 weeks later opens with no less than 200 infected in the middle of the English countryside...why?? these aren't undead, they're living people. a single infected probably kills twice as many humans it infects so there aren't going to be many infected after 4 weeks.<br/><br/>The only thing that this movie lacked that would have made it a total resounding masterpiece of failure was people turning on each other like in dawn of the dead (if humans did that in a fight-to-survive situation the species wouldn't have lasted 4 generations). other than that we have one, single infected (not out of many, literally the only one) somehow killing several soldiers, shot in a manner that doesn't show us how because it wouldn't be possible. we have this same infected somehow breaking into a ridiculously fortified room. we have infected surviving a firebomb. and we have an annoying waste-of-space of a teenage girl that cries while a normal human being would still be in DEEEEEP shock.<br/><br/>The only character that could be related to (that actually made decisions) was, very ironically, the army sniper. out of all the people in the movie, you would think a goddamn army sniper would probably be the least relatable.<br/><br/>I don't think that every little detail needs to be shown in movies.

","Please understand that I am a fan of horror films, and am often annoyed at how they often appear to be flamed, purely as they are part of the horror genre. However, I think it is highly debatable if 28 weeks later is a horror film at all, or actually an action film. There is much less suspense in 28 days as opposed to 28 weeks, which appears to have been dropped in favour of sporadic moments which make you jump (only one of which actually succeeded with me). Additionally, the characters appear less fulfilled in 28 weeks than in its predecessor, although the concept of following a family, with all of the issues this creates, was a good one. The infected themselves also do the film well, with very good acting and actions, vastly superior to those in other zombie films. The film is however let down by the main cast, which feel under developed, and often not well acted. Additionally, the plot was weak, and although some ideas (around the start of the film) were very good, they were rapidly brushed over in favour of lots of running from the latter half of the film onwards. It is however, a zombie film at heart, and for fans of the genre, is well worth a watch, despite not meeting the bar set by 28 days, it holds its own within the zombie genre, and is as such, worth a look."
"pkzeewiz","4","0","1","8 April 2010"," A sequel that doesn't live up to the first - no surprise!
","I thought the first movie was good, it wasn't perfect, but good. The thing that held the first movie was the production side of it, Danny Boyle's direction and the score as well as great acting. Here, we had nothing but a decent story and that along works for lower budget horrors, but ones with such a huge funding as this one had, we expect more.<br/><br/>Its 28 weeks later and the rebuilding of England is under way. The city is controlled under U.S. military and only a small section of one city is allowing people to come back. One man who had left his wife cowardly during an attack has fled and is now working with the military to rebuild the city and his two children who had been in America return to see him an begin their new life.<br/><br/>One day the little boy claims he has almost forgotten what his mother looks like, so he and big sister sneak out to their old house and find their mother is there and wasn't killed by the infected after all. She ends up in the city and medics soon learn she is in fact infected herself, but somehow able to not be in rage like the others. She later bites her cowardly husband and he then turns the city one by one and all hell once again breaks out.<br/><br/>The direction in the movie was bad, there were no beautiful shots, nothing impressive and an obvious rip off at times to Boyle's original work. He had too many close-ups and I found myself so often hating the cinematography. Conducter John Murphy only had two weeks to work on his score and it was nothing great either, almost entirely recycled music from the first movie. The movie finally picks up about half way through, but by this time it's so predictable that it is a let down.<br/><br/>Much of the acting is good, Robert Carlyse had been offered a part in part one but refused and here he does a great job. John Murphy also did a great job as Doyle, I kept wondering where I had seen this guy before and he had did a great job years before playing the title role in the movie Dahmer.<br/><br/>I didn't hate this movie, but I was disappointed. There wasn't a lot of personal encounters with the infected. This was not a zombie movie, but it lacked what zombie movies have and that is some focus on the monster. We watch these types of movies to get scared and see these creatures and here, as in part one, the infected were not the main characters.

","It is common knowledge that sequels fail to rise to the standards of the original, but for some reason or another (money?) producers tend to forget this simple fact. And of course, this one is no exception: while ""28 days"" was by no means original in terms of idea, it succeeded when it came to atmosphere, plot and (mostly) character development, doubled by Boyle's beautiful direction and Dod Mantle's superb cinematography. ""28 weeks"" is an attempt to recreate the same atmosphere - and it almost succeeds in the first scenes, only to head swiftly towards disaster as the movie unfolds - through decent (decent, not good, not brilliant) direction, but it totally fails when it comes to plot - it is no better, but less amusing, than the average B movie, with the least plausible situations, up to the point where it gets you frustrated and finally mad, yearning for a bit of common sense -, while characters get no room to develop and they often leave the impression that they are just pawns to get things moving. Last but not least, Robert Carlyle's character is just a total waste of talent. P.S. could somebody explain the ending? or was it just meant to let us know that there is another sequel coming, maybe one with Uwe Boll in the director's chair, marking the ever-improving quality of the sequels?"

It is definitely not the worst sequel as some have said here and I didn't hate the film and I am just joking about wanting my money back. But was very disappointed (not that 28 days was very good) but I did know what I was getting into from seeing the first film. I felt Juan Carlos Fresnadillo the director kept the movie on track and presented it in tradition to 28 days however I didn't find the movie intelligent.<br/><br/>Really the entire chaos that brings down the safe haven they worked so hard to achieve was brought down by some chick and her brother because she wanted to go home for her favorite pair of shoes???? (well wasn't exactly shoes but you get my point.) If you've seen this movie you have to ask yourself is this the only way the disease ""Rage"" could have infiltrated them? This was the best the writers could come up with and the director did not throw the script in there faces and shout ""Not Intelligent gentlemen re-write it or I quit!"" Why not rats or birds causing the epidemic to get in or anything except some stupid ... wow ""let's break out of the safety of this beautiful place disobey everyone steal a scooter and go home so I can collect up a pair of shoes a picture or two ... oh hey mom what you doing up here?"" What the hell were they thinking? Sorry not a very well done. No not well done at all.<br/><br/>Mom would have taken a sniper round in my movie 200 feet out from the city along with the sister and brother. With a CG on the bullet tracking behind the shot until impact upon there foreheads. Now that's what would have really happen.<br/><br/>What I did like was the directors and writes experimenting with the idea of someone being immune to ""Rage"" that was interesting how they handled it. But there were just to few redeeming qualities to this film to score it very high IMO.<br/><br/>I really wanted this to be better than 28 days I really wanted them to make it more intelligent than 28 days but to me it fell short of the mark it made me hope there will not be a 28 months later but I think by the looks of the ending we have been set up for the next bad release of 28 months later. This frightens me more than the films do! If you haven't seen this yet and are a fan of the first film it's worth a watch; is it something you'll be watching again and again probably not.

","""28 Weeks Later"" picks up where ""28 Days Later"" left off. The virus that's been turning ordinary human beings into flesh-eating zombies has apparently run its course, the infected humans have all died of starvation, and Britain is slowly being repopulated with many of the citizens who fled the scene at the start of the epidemic. One of those returnees is Don (played by Robert Carlyle), who is suffering from survivor's guilt after leaving his wife in a moment of panic to be devoured by the creatures. Or was she? Suffice it to say, it's hard to keep a good virus down and soon London is in the grip of a major new outbreak of the illness. Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots and MacKintosh Muggleton (what a great name!) play various characters who spend the bulk of the movie running for their lives from the menace.<br/><br/>Zombie pictures have become such a staple of the horror movie genre that it is hard for anyone to do anything particularly novel or original with them anymore. Zombie bites human, human turns into zombie, new zombie bites another human, and on it goes ad infinitum. That scenario may have been fresh and exciting when George Romero first introduced it to the world in ""Night of the Living Dead"" back in 1968, but it has been diluted through repetition and overuse ever since (partly by Romero himself with his endless, ever diminishing variations on the theme). The one innovation the original ""28 Days Later"" came up with was to speed up the zombies' movements so that they were no longer the lumbering creatures that anyone's 85-year-old granny could easily outrun.<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"" has some genuinely suspenseful moments and a nice post-apocalyptic feel in its early stretches, but, like its predecessor, it tends to devolve into a tedious shooting-gallery sideshow the longer it goes on. Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's hurdy-gurdy film-making style, which is intended to replicate the chaos and pandemonium of the situation, often leads more to confusion than to clarification for the audience. Still, the movie contains a few cool plot twists and raises some thorny ethical issues, such as whether or not innocent people are to be sacrificed if that means ensuring the safety of the population as a whole. And there is certainly more than enough bloodshed and general mayhem to keep the zombiephiles among us rooted to our seats. Even the undead should have fun with that."
"Pantalaimon60107","5","0","1","23 June 2008"," Well...
","Whenever someone complains about the original film, they complain about either the time spent on character development or the ending. The character development seems to have been taken care of by... Well, removing character development completely. Aside from the opening scene, one of the most masterful opening scenes in any zombie movie I have ever seen, let alone in any horror movie I have ever seen, there is almost no character development. Children are thrown to you and you are expected to care about them. Personally, I could not have cared any less about them. I can empathize, but I cannot sympathize. Why? Because they are only given screen time to show what they are doing, not what emotions motivate them. When Tammy sees a dead body (presumably for the first time, as she and Andy were not in England during the time of attack) she recoils in disgust, not horror. Yes, the body is gross, but in the moments of silence she has on screen, she does not appear to be truly affected, other than the potential reflex to gag. She acts differently than Jim after he kills an infected child by... Well, hardly acting at all. Granted, the act was different, but I would have liked to see more than what was offered. Another complaint I would like to throw out there is that their father, while infected, seems to show up a hell of a lot more than is necessary. He seems smart enough to avoid being shot by the soldiers he kills (who, mysteriously, after being bitten, do not become infected - their bodies lay in wait to be discovered, so that the general can decide to order code red), he is smart enough to avoid being killed in the chaos that ensues when several others are infected, he avoids the firebombing (by cleverly hiding behind a wall, while his poor wife's body, with all of that steel and concrete between it and the explosion, is burned), and he manages to avoid the gas and surviving soldiers. He's pretty smart for one of the infected. The film leaves too much up to mere coincidence. Of course, there is always my complaint of how the supporting cast of characters is predictably killed off, until all who remain are the truly important ones. The movie earns points in its action scenes, which are surprisingly intense. I liked what I believed to be were Hot Fuzz references (a boy from Sanford and a swan, just to name a few). The helicopter scene is a stretch, but an enjoyable stretch. Sadly, what there is does not match up to what there should have been. Still, if nothing else, there is one improvement: a better ending."
"robgrantuk","9","0","2","11 June 2008"," human emotion, panic, terror, realism told through sound,camera&politics
","******************************THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS THROUGHOUT AND IS ONLY MEANT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEE THE FILM******************************<br/><br/>I have only just recently watched this film as I was very sceptical about a sequel to such a brilliant and outstanding film! Especially knowing that Danny Boyle wasn't in charge. Also, the whole Americanisation put me off quite a lot. Therefore, I was very keen for the director to bring realism,tension, the feeling of panic to this sequel if it was to ever come close to the success of the first film. From the very beginning, I found the camera shots very intense, being so close to the characters, producing a feeling of cabin fever and dread. One user said that the camera shots were somehow epileptic(cap can uk)? I do not agree. The film begins slowly, introducing you to the different characters ,luring you into a false sense of security before the dread and intoxicating feel of isolation jammed like sardines in a tin, very quickly spills into chaos. <br/><br/>As the directors explain in their commentary, it's as if the camera is also infected, translated through the use of fast and intense edits, flicking from one character to another (including the zombie). I loved this as I felt very insecure as an member of the audience, trapped as the characters were, in this shitty little room with just one exit! Credit to Andy4444, as the viewer, it did feel like i went from comfortable to F**K, S**T, WTF, panic mode in just a short space of time. Therefore, I don't see how people can say that the camera shots had no meaning or failed to produce any realistic connotations.<br/><br/>Also, how it 'brings no tension' ? I thought the music was great for the opening scene, such calm music and yet such a horrid and unpleasant scene! Excellent! made it even more intense for me! Very good combination, actually seems to enforce and instill panic in the viewer + translates what's going through the husbands(Carlisle) brain as he struggles to decide what to do! <br/><br/>People have complained about the camera work, yet didn't Danny Boyle help direct the scene in the barn(very ""epileptic"") and the boat scene, so is that a criticism of Boyle who directed the film so many people who complain, love so much? Oh, 1 more thing, people have said that the camera work is shaky throughout and that has no meaning at all. Well, how about when husband(Carlisle) sits down to talk to his kids to explain what happened? does the change from shaky camera - calm hand held, not relay the seriousness and importance of what he is trying to get across? his confession, his guilt, his consciousness, his desire to maintain honesty to his children while trying not to scare them off? I think both scenes(opening&confession) relay the contrasting moods through a change in style, very well merited in my opinion(yes i do not claim that anything i have said is objective). <br/><br/>In regard of the plot and situations in which the characters find themselves in, it is very easy to simply go ""how cliché is that? they're in DANGER!"" SHOCK HORROR! yes, this is a HORROR/THRILLER, therefore the point is that effect! Has there ever been an outbreak of a zombie virus where people have been evacuated? no, therefore how can it be argued that is isn't ""realistic""? it is pretty damn hard to come across realistic when a series of events has never occurred! <br/><br/>**Spoilers!**<br/><br/>If this film was so cliché, then how is it that the solder who helps them doesn't survive and fly off into the sunset with helicopter dude ?? he doesn't just die, he gets burnt alive! I expected this film to sell out and to just have the 2 kids and either the nurse or the soldier alive, but no! the mean helicopter dude(who is black and doesn't die) saves them!<br/><br/>In addition, one monumental point; people who criticise this film, do so without a considering the political relations and history between the USA and Britain and of American intervention, not forgetting the inferiority complex the USA has towards Britain and always has done throughout history, such as USA lending Britain over £50billion after the 2nd world war and charging interest !! (cheeky gits lol). Also, it's constant undermining in foreign affairs, e.g. threatening to use force against Iraq/Hozbullah etc with disregard to Britain and Europe. Therefore(stay with me on this), by intervening in Britain so early on, there is obviously a political agenda. Britain is but an island, could just ignore it. But, America's intervention shows the world their 'strength' and power in literally saving a nation, if Britain owed USA £50billion after the 2nd world war, what would it owe them for saving their very existence?? many years of subordination to USA. remember, Britain exiled/kicked people out for being too radical, those radicals were the founders of USA - what better than to be the saviour of the ones who kicked you out? etc etc etc! sorry for the longness but has to be spelt out with such historical examples in order for people to understand the point of going to an island which could have quite easily been left alone(by blocking all routes out) and restarting it.<br/><br/>I have only touched the surface and yes, I have written way too much about the political aspect(could have been a lot more concise but this is film, not history), but I have been hugely surprised at 28weeks later and think the director and screen play people deserve a lot more credit!"
"corner66","9","0","2","20 May 2008"," Answering the negative reviews
","Having read a number of the negative reviews here there seems to be a couple of points which are continually raised. The first is the shaky camera work. Which I do agree can be a gimmick and pointless an attempt to make the movie seem fresh and new whereas really its just ripping off what another director has done before, this is in some films. This is a roller-coaster ride of a film. When the camera is strapped to the side of someone sprinting away from the infected, you are too. Therefore in this movie I feel it is entirely appropriate and adds to the viewers experience and immersion in the instant of what is happening.<br/><br/>The second point that negative reviews raise are plot holes. Now there are a few small ones if you wish to watch the movie time and time again going through it with a tooth comb. But the ones that are raised by the negative reviews I would say are not plot holes. First I should say that this movie has within it a discussion around combat and events happening, still happening in Iraq. Taking this into account the infected become the 'terrorist' or 'freedom fighters' who can be confused among the civilians. As with the Iraq parallel it is hard to tell them apart from 15,000 ft or through a hazy night scope at 300m. The film tries to explain why Iraq is such a mess, why the situation is so complex and untenable. The mistakes that the soldiers the characters and the powers that be make in this movie are not designed to help advance the plot, I think the plot (the journey of the children to their escape) was bent to fit these events. And these mistakes I believe mirror the colossal mistakes which have happened in Iraq. The pilot, the sniper, seeing a group of unidentified people and being ordered to kill them, they're terrorists, they're infected.<br/><br/>Why repopulated London? Why fly coca cola reps out to the green zone in Baghdad? These are the points I feel the movie was trying to put across. And I believe the movie is far better for it. I feel that this equals the first movies quality and drive, but it does this in a more dangerous way. By massively increasing the scale to the real time fate of a city rather than the small band in the first movie."

They're only real thought is basic needs like to eat and that is why they attack. This movie is about the rage virus. It is a highly communicable disease that is spread through any body fluid. You then immediately mutate to a raging maniac whose soul intent is to harm others. They do bite and tear people to shreds but not for the purpose of feeding. If you want zombies, I recommend just about anything from George Romero, otherwise, enjoy this fast paced, edge of your seat, post-apocalyptic thriller about the restoration and devastation of Britain."

If you let yourself, you will go with the flow and experience the building dread. I understand that there is supposed to be some political subtext involving the soullessness of the U. S. military, but really, in the face of such a demonstrated, truly existential threat, what exactly else would a military command do? Militaries are there to do things in the performance of their duties that would otherwise be immoral, such as depriving others of life and/or liberty when it is necessary to do so. Anyway the film is well-acted, well-photographed (although I think that jerky camera shooting has run its course) and well-paced.

So the kids, a scientist, and a sniper try to find rescue before being infected. Much of it seemed like the same stuff from the first film. And how did the infected dad keep showing up where the kids were. made no sense.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you have to see every zombie movie ever made, then check this out, but otherwise there are much better horror movies out there."
"practicallypeach","4","0","1","23 April 2008"," It was indeed a bad movie...
","and it's a shame really since it had so much potential. But many things will irk you. Just a few things:<br/><br/>The beginning is great. Lots of action. The beginning was great but not flawless. First off, it pisses me off that a little boy is the reason for so much death. This movie almost makes you hate kids. Their choices and reasoning just makes you want to punch them in the face every time they do something stupid. But if I were to put myself in the survivors' shoes, I'd probably help him out, too. What happened in the movie was just bad luck. Whether they let the kid in or not, the zombies would have probably torn their way into the house anyway.<br/><br/>I hate how they project females in this movie. Okay so their are roughly 6 survivors in the house. One's infected almost instantly, which is fine. It lets the audience know how serious the virus is. She couldn't even get any words out before turning where as in the first movie, you had about 40 seconds. But anyways, back to the women. Grandma and Grandpa and the bald guy make it to the barn and are doing their escape thing. But Grandma doesn't want to leave Grandpa, who has bravely decided to stay behind and hold the do so that grandma and the bald guy have time to escape. I hate this kind of behavior because it's selfish (YES the Grandma IS selfish) and it slows EVERYONE (in the movie) down. Because now instead of using this time to escape, we've got to convince Grandma to let Grandpa go. Of course she refuses until the last second when she sees the zombies crashing in and realizes the real danger she's in. All of the sudden she needs help. HELP ME! HELP ME! Sorry old girl I'm already outside. At least 'I' would be if it were me. The bald guy does what he can but realizes that his life comes first and escapes. Then we center on a man and his wife. The man, the wife, and the boy that got them into this mess in the first place are all traveling together through the house and trying to get to an exit. Suddenly the little boy thinks he knows the house better than the people do and runs off to find his own way out. Wife follows the boy and the husband follows the wife. The Zombies are about 12 seconds away. All three make it to a bedroom where the child is hiding in the closet. The mother tries to go get him but the wise man realizes that there isn't enough time to save the boy and their own skins. The wife doesn't want to listen and goes in to get the boy. She grabs him just in time for the zombies to burst in. All of the sudden, she's ALSO crying out for her husband to help her. Sooooo let me get this straight. You want your husband to risk his own life and take on several zombies because you didn't want the little boy who got you into this mess in the first place to die. I would have done the same exact thing as the man and gotten out of there. This would have been a no brainer. But of course the husband is made out to be the bad guy when he really did the smartest thing that anyone does throughout the ENTIRE MOVIE!<br/><br/>Anyways, the husband is outside and running. The Zombies are right on his tail. The man runs to the creek where the bald guy is untying the boat and trying to start the engine. If he didn't waste so much time with Grandma, the boat would be untied and the engine would just now be starting. But nooooo. And because of this, the bald guy doesn't make it. Aw. The man does. Yay.<br/><br/>Then we jump to 28 weeks later. Why are people living there in the first place? If you found out that your country had previously been overrun with zombie-like creatures less than half a year ago, would you REALLY wanna go back? Would you? Not only that, they are moving people back in the city and STILL cleaning up hazardous material. Come on people. If your house was being sprayed for spiders would you really move back in before the house is completely aired out of poisons? I would hope not. So why don't these people apply the same logic? <br/><br/>It turns out the mother could hold the answer for a possible vaccine for this zombie rage virus. But wait a minute. What is there to cure? The infections gone. The people are just cleaning up now. No more infected. <br/><br/>Anyways, the rest of the movie is just stupid. The soldier and scientist spend the rest of their time trying to save these children who could be a possible cure. Lady. Have you learned nothing? If the quarantine works (which it most likely will since they're planning on nuking the country) there ONCE AGAIN will be no need for a cure. Also, de ja vu anyone? What if the same thing happens? You're trying to save some kids and bring them to a 'clean' country where they can potentially infect people there. JUST like their mother! What if that brat sneezes or coughs on someone? Then what? These people don't use their heads in this movie. They are either panicked or stupid. <br/><br/>The whole movie will upset you simply because, in reality, people just aren't this stupid. No way. I do recommend you see it just to see the messed up things I mentioned. But don't spend any money. Borrow it."

","As most people in these reviews will testify, this is one of those sequels that makes a rare event of surprising you by being a fitting continuation- The direction cuts a well-placed balance between those with 1-minute attention spans and those after something a little more dark and melodramatic.<br/><br/>The pre-credit opening scenes are a rapid escalation into the horror and violence that 'Later normally provides, and Robert Carlyle gives a solid performance as ever. Danny Boyle is a secondary producer on this outing so the look and feel has been kept faithful in what seems to have been a quite happy student-teacher partnership in direction under Juan Carlos Fresnadilla.<br/><br/>The plot synopsis revolves around the re-introduction of surviving UK members back to London, after the original virus victims/zombies have starved and wasted away. This makes for some tense moments when Carlyle's children escape the borders of their quarantine zone in search of their old home in the suburbs; typically great set-piece shots and empty streets being the series trademark.<br/><br/>Plot spoilers- sadly it's all about the inconsistencies that stop this film being 9 stars, but in fairness any horror film that slots neatly together in reasoning is a novelty. As someone commented- the US military presence are rather forced and stereotyped with their banter, and a lot of their quarantine methods are ludicrous. Whether this was intended or not is a matter for debate, as there is supposedly a latent political context.<br/><br/>So many things- * why do the soldiers even think twice before killing Carlyle's infected wife who causes the 2nd outbreak? this could be explained by him beating them to her execution and kissing her in a moment of passion.<br/><br/>There's also the US militarys' order to open fire on all civilians as 'valid targets' after they have lost control of the safe-house and people are flooding out. This was annoying and frustrating, even in the most trigger happy gun-addled mind this would never happen, and there were clear distinctions between the infected and non. Picky, but it did seem a little far fetched that they would just say ""kill everyone"" in an event which would see them internationally disgraced. Not to mention his friend's order to scrabble several miles to a drop point in the middle of a clearly open city. Thanks buddy...<br/><br/>There is a refreshing callous disregard for age, gender and relationship in this films; the killing is indiscriminate and the regular horror film rules of punishment-for-indulgence do not apply. This is one of the things that makes 28 Weeks Later an interesting branch of this genre along with its refusal to give in to god-awful CGI monsters and predictable shots.<br/><br/>You will not feel cheated by the end, but I am hoping they don't make it a trilogy; Nothing personal, it's just the natural downward decline of these lucrative films (think Aliens etc) ... A very enjoyable watch and a good gory melancholy romp"

","I wasn't a big fan of the first film, 28 days later, I thought it had some wonderful visuals in it, but ultimately I just didn't find it gripping enough in the drama. Although I did enjoy the early action sequences with the zombies which were well filmed and frightening. Maybe I've just seen to many zombie movies to have felt that it was so surprising, I remember the Italian ones from the seventies and then later films like Demons (although not strictly zombies it may as well have been) So I didn't hold out much hope when I saw this and I have to say I loved it. I thought it had a great dramatic centre to the film and I was totally fascinated by Robert Carlyle's character and situation. I became involved in finding out what would happen to him and his children in this post apocalyptic world. If you didn't like the first, I would still give this one a go."

Someone please tell me why no one put an automated machine gun on a pole. Or simpler still, bring a tank! As soon as a zombie appears, everybody starts acting like a scared kitten!<br/><br/>And there is a personal disappointment here as well. I knew the movie was with Robert Carlyle and I expected a larger, maybe lead role, as I know he is a great actor.

"Joejoesan","8","0","1","14 March 2008"," Robert Carlisle makes it special
","28 Days Weeks Later is not as good as its original, but still very entertaining. Key factor in this one is the very talented (and daring) Robert Carlisle. I don't see that many big American actors (like Tom Cruise, Will Smith or Bruce Willis for instance) taking up a role about a man who cowardly runs away from his wife in order to save his own life, who lies to his kids and at the end is even responsible for wiping out the entire surviving human colony. Even as a killing zombie you still feel sympathy for this man. Robert Carlisle is our man! If he does a villain (Trainspotting) or a sympathetic loser (The Full Monty), you always believe his character.<br/><br/>Storywise there are a lot of elements in 28 Weeks Later that secure enough scenes of suspense and action. Again, the deserted London looks great. Even though it's hard to believe that the two children manage to escape from the save zone, the scenes in which they drive through the deserted British capital make a big impression. Yeah, I loved this movie!<br/><br/>8/10"
"Navaros","2","0","2","18 February 2008"," Only one good scene in the whole entire movie: the very first one!
","28 Weeks Later has only one good scene in the whole entire movie: the very first one! In the first scene, you see a calm situation quickly descend into madness with infected zombies suddenly turning up and causing chaos. This scene is very suspenseful, scary, intense and brilliantly shot. Unfortunately, it is the only scene in the whole movie that has any of those qualities. Everything to come after this opening scene is abysmally stale, boring, not scary, and uninteresting.<br/><br/>I have been told that the opening scene was done by the Director of the original movie (28 Days Later), and the rest of the movie was done by the Director of the movie this review is about (28 Weeks Later). I have not verified this information to be correct or not, but the *vast* difference of quality between the opening scene and the whole rest of the movie certainly does bear out the correctness of that statement. The opening scene and the rest of the movie are like two entirely separate movies; one great (the opening scene) and one terrible (the whole rest of the movie).<br/><br/>After the opening scene of 28 Weeks Later, it is no longer a zombie movie. Instead, it instantly *devolves* into a movie about two clichéd, dopey, very annoying children and their quest to escape being murdered by the US Military; which has been ordered to kill all humans in the country because they are mixed together with infected zombies. If you were expecting a zombie movie from 28 Weeks Later, you have been misled. 28 Weeks Later is *not* a zombie movie. It's a ""Watch dopey kids try to escape being hunted down by the US military"" movie. Zombies in 28 Weeks Later are a complete afterthought. Aside from the opening scene, they might as well not have bothered to have any zombies in the movie at all, since the movie devolves to a point where it has nothing whatsoever to do with zombies.<br/><br/>This movie seems to be a nothing more than a ham-fisted attempt to paint the US Military as bloodthirsty monsters who murder civilians indiscriminately. That idea may or may not have legitimate roots in real-life. But a movie that is *supposed* to be a zombie movie is not a suitable venue to be exploring that idea. If a Director wants to make a movie that is a soapbox for promoting a point of view that ""The US Military is evil"", that is fine. But he *shouldn't* try to be cagey about it, and pretend that his ""zombie movie"" about that is *actually* a zombie movie. That is what 28 Weeks Later does. 28 Weeks Later *masquerades* itself as a zombie movie, but it's more akin to a skewed documentary pushing an anti-US Military agenda, like Farenheit 9/11.<br/><br/>Therefore, it should not have been masqueraded as a zombie movie, or had the ""28"" brand attached to it's title. The Director should have been honest about what he was making and not have tried to mislead consumers into watching a zombie movie, then once they've paid to see it, really they don't get a zombie movie. They just get to be subjected to his agenda to push a political message.<br/><br/>Best way to watch 28 Weeks Later: watch the opening scene, then turn it off. Once the man has escaped on a boat, you know all the good parts of the movie are done with. Press STOP right then, you've seen *everything* worthwhile in this movie by that point.<br/><br/>2/10 for the opening scene alone. Had the entire movie maintained the quality of the opening scene, this *would* have been a 10/10."

","There was no need to make this movie. Or if it was going to be made call it something else. The fact that it exists in the same world as 28 days later takes away from the world. The one intense scene was when the military personal started just shooting everyone. The rest of the movie felt forced and extremely poorly written. After the first movie I kind of a have a soft spot for running zombies, so that helped the entertainment value, but the rest of the movie was just poorly written. The subway scene was scary and the fact that everyone, but the kids died was surprising, but not all the potent in terms of story telling. I liked the fact that there was no cure in the first movie and the introduction of even the slightest bit of hope of a cure was sad to me. The point is that there is no cure for what is human nature. The way the story was pushed forward just did not feel good. It felt unnatural. There was some great direction at point and I loved the look of the women and kids eyes. That was kind of creepy for some reason. The best part of the movie was of course the helicopter tearing all of the zombies apart. That was totally bad-a$$ and probably one of the reasons this got a 6 and not a 5."
"dead47548","5","0","1","8 January 2008"," Just another example of a sequel losing any flare from the original.
","Four years ago 28 Days Later delivered a much needed revolution to the zombie flick. It's use of hand-held cameras, rapidly caffeinated zombies and pure isolation created a sense of dread and terror that I hadn't felt in years. It was widely acclaimed and became one of the best horror films in decades for the sole reason that it was such a fresh relief from the serial killer-of-the-week cheap thrill rides that had been pumping out since the early '90s. The film became a welcome relief of originality in a genre that had quickly become stale. Of course in creating a sequel, it loses all of this freshness.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later plays out as just another unneeded sequel to an already closed film. We see that everything is perfectly fine; London is quarantined and the virus is contained. Of course nothing can be that simple for long. The foolishness of children leads to a relapse of the virus in the American militarized zone and another outbreak is quickly on hand. As the zombies increase amazingly in numbers, the soldiers get orders to shoot everyone; infected or not. They need to contain any chance of the virus getting out, and the ultimate decision is to firebomb the entire district. In the midst of all this mayhem is a possible cure to the disease. A cure ironically found in the one person who introduced the infection back into the public after months of safety. This cure simply would've been unnecessary had it not been for the blind foolishness of children and inefficiency of a government that thinks they have control over everything. The desperate attempt at escape for the cure, living in the bodies of the two foolish children and led by an American soldier and an American military nurse, is the main plot of this seemingly insignificant story.<br/><br/>In turn the film ends up as an attempt at making some extra cash from the success of it's predecessor and fails miserably at trying to have any sort of unique quality. The camera-work from the first is thrown out the window, but a unique style of a faux-Greengrass/Mann cinematography pours the 'shaky-cam' on far too thick and does nothing but add nausea and confusion to what's happening on screen (the same exact thing that happened back in Sunshine, and just like Sunshine this film thrives on making the phrase 'style over substance' a gross understatement). This is a film that relies on the ambiance of fear and excitement that it attempts to create, but unfortunately it doesn't do a great job at that either. I will admit that it was entertaining for the most part and that the majority of the cast was excellent (particularly Rose Byrne and Imogen Poots) but the film just lost any kind of freshness that 28 Days had obtained therefore making it nothing more than another modern horror sequel that is completely pointless. The completely unbelievable ending (a soldier spends the entire film saying that he won't bring the kids on the helicopter, but then he lets them on without his buddy solider? Right.) that further provides the commentary of the foolishness of children, shows the virus spreading globally (in this case all the way to Paris) and practically insures another unnecessary, irrelevant sequel. Eventually we'll be able to see 28 Centuries Later. Zombies in space? I'm there.<br/><br/>I'd like to take time in this review to discuss my lovely sweetheart Rose Byrne. It really is coming to the point where she needs to get her role-choosing cap fitted, because this is becoming ridiculous. She is one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen and she constantly chooses these big mainstream pictures that range from terrible to barely above average, and her talent goes completely unnoticed. Big-budget features that put her in minuscule supporting roles while they pour and pour and pour the disgusting style that they try to create over the audiences head. It's revolting. She delivers one of the finest performances of all time in The Goddess of 1967 and since then it's been one big-budgeted stylized piece of tripe after the other (with the exceptions of The Dead Girl and Marie Antoinette). Ms. Byrne always delivers a knockout performance, even in something like Sunshine, but her brilliant work falls into the abyss unless you're precisely looking for it do to the disgusting need for stylistic attention these self-obsessed directors have."
"toolther","5","0","1","7 January 2008"," A Zombie Movie With Political And Social Commentary
","28 Weeks Later is the zombie thriller sequel to 28 Days Later. 28 Days Later set groundbreaking precedent by being a major horror film to tackle such deeply profound moral and social issues, such as sexism and rape.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later works to continue on the same track as its predecessor, taking on issues of political global influence and the moral and ethical issues of murder. Taking place 28 weeks after the INITIAL OUTBREAK, Great Britain is thought to be clean of the virus. This is due to the discovery that the infected cannot survive without continually ""infecting"" others or feeding. By this point, an American led NATO task force has already entered London and set up for reconstruction. The story centrally follows two new characters, Andy and Tammy, who are siblings. After returning to London, reinfection inevitably occurs with a seemingly new strain of the 'rage virus' decimating those who British who wished to return home. <br/><br/>My opinion: keep your social commentaries out of zombie movies and enough with the cliffhangers. Trying to make a zombie horror flick with pseudo-intellectual themes is the worst idea ever and creates a new subculture of pretentious movie goers, who think they have learned or felt something profound FROM A ZOMBIE MOVIE. We go to movie to be first and foremost entertained, not to choke down someone else's philosophical viewpoints.<br/><br/>Though this movie's social commentaries are nowhere near as nauseating or infuriating as the first one, this movie's failures follow suit to the first film in another way. It ends on a major cliffhangers, like not telling us what happens to Andy and Selena, whether Andy's DNA holds a key to a vaccine, or how the new outbreak will affect the world (i.e. implications that the infection has escaped Great Britain, somehow). Though cliffhangers can occasionally be irritating in a fun or exciting way, this film's ending is not.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 5 because of the entertaining graphics, camera angles, and new conceptualizations on what it means to be a 'zombie.' However this movie FAILS in making sense logically (just like the first movie) and makes me fearful from all the unanswered questions and cliffhangers that a third and equally asinine film may be in the works (28 Months Later, gag)."

New England? That's taken) is being secured by the best peacemakers around, the US Army. As you might have guessed, everything goes well in this resettlement and everyone lives happily ever after.<br/><br/>Or not. In this slightly interesting yet unnecessary sequel, Britain is again overcome by a second wave of the infected. How, you ask? Well, a woman with one brown eye and one blue eye also seems to have genes for an immunity to the ""Rage"" virus. How can one person in a million (two actually. Her son is also immune) have the genetic makeup to be immune to an artificially created virus, you ask? That's not important right now. However, while she is immune to the effects (dying and coming back to life, the whole killing other people by ripping throats and gouging eyeballs thing) of the Rage virus, she can still transmit it through blood, mucus, saliva, etc. The logic of that just blows my mind. Anywho, she's found by her two dumb kids who have basically doomed mankind with this idiotic act. Why we're supposed to identify with them and wish for their safety is also beyond me.<br/><br/>Anywho, her also dumb husband kisses her and then re-kills everyone that managed to survive the first wave of infected. A mark of good horror writing is when you can look at what a character on screen is doing and say ""Yeah, that's exactly what I'd do"". I liked the one army hero dude. He reminded me a little of Nathan Fillion. Wasn't crazy about the rest of the cast. Cillian Murphy wasn't here this time, and boy did I miss him.<br/><br/>The US Army is usually shown at the height of their competence in horror movies *cough*. This time around might be my favorite gaff. Though they are there for everyone's security, they are unable to do anything because (Surprise!) the infected look like normal humans. Except for you know, the whole slavering monster thing. The Head Army dude decides to kill everyone indiscriminately, Nazi-style. I guess it's supposed to be some sort of Iraq allusion. In this movie however, it comes across as lazy screen writing. Why would the Army not have foreseen every possible outcome? If the danger was so great, and the Army would be powerless in this situation, why try to re-populate Britain at all? It's been 20 years and Chernobyl is still abandoned.<br/><br/>However, for what it is, the mechanics of the movie are quite good. The directing (apparently Danny Boyle did some second-unit filming) is pretty good. The music seems to have been almost lifted entirely from the first movie. The zombie effects are great and the Infected remain a menacing force. The first 20 minutes of the film are quite good and scary. The last 20 are repellent.

","I never really understood why ""28 Days Later"" caused such a ripple in the horror genre back in '03--many saw some sort of masterpiece, while I just saw yet another movie piggybacking on the zombie mythos created by George Romero (some scenes were blatant steals from his ""Living Dead"" series); had it been directed by anyone besides the guy who scored accolades for ""Trainspotting,"" it probably would have been recognized as such. ""28 Weeks Later"" is slightly better than its predecessor (no difficult feat), and even contains an interesting (at times ironic) thematic arc that has some things to say about familial unity; too bad the characters are of the one-dimensional variety and the plot plays out like a simplified cross between ""Dawn of the Dead"" (the remake, natch) and ""Children of Men."" While director/co-writer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo keeps the film moving at a rapid clip, he can't seem to reconcile the main story of a family's joy and grief against the overwhelming urge to shoot every scene in overblown, ersatz-epic fashion (for the love of Pete, ENOUGH with the shaky-hand-held ""Saving Private Ryan""-style shots!); ""28 Days"" may have suffered from sluggish pacing and too many preachy monologues, but ""28 Weeks"" rips along in a seemingly endless string of jerky cuts that are more frustrating than exciting (what's there to be excited about when we can't tell what the hell's going on, or where it's happening?). The effects scenes are a mix of CG trickery that paradoxically come off as fake and realistic and always overblown (the firebombing of Britain in particular looks like a screen shot from a PS3 game). Despite this, there is an occasional flash of innovation (a creepy trek down a pitch-dark escalator lit by a gunsight's night vision), and the actors (including a criminally underused Robert Carlyle) are serviceable in their thinly-written roles. Make no mistake--""28 Weeks Later"" is an even pulpier ride than its parent, but worth a gander if you set your expectations really low; it's so fast-paced that it passes rather painlessly, but there's nothing very endearing about it."

","This film was below average at best. <br/><br/>Typical European liberal nonsense adorns this one. First, London is now a contaminated area and the UN, headed by the United States, of course, takes over. There is basically a police state where anyone who leaves the cordoned-off area is subject to immediate execution. The bumbling Americans are ""studying"" the virus. And by ""studying"", do we have scientists from every Ivy League school in the States over there? No. Perhaps doctors from Johns Hopkins, the best medical school on the planet? No. We have a handful of military scientists scampering around like morons to get some kind of idea what the Rage Virus even is. Leading the team of incompetent American military scientists is an even more incompetent team of American military officials who are portrayed as a bunch of trigger-happy buffoons, gunning down their own soldiers and innocent civilians in a frenzy.<br/><br/>Now, as for the plot...well, the beginning sequence is pretty rad. Other than that, it is absolutely lame! The same kids who escape London, end up finding their own mother and she's still alive, go figure.

After I saw the trailer I changed my mind. It was a very appealing trailer and it didn't reveal anything from the plot. Also, I think Robert Carlyle is an excellent actor so I couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>After watching the movie I was disappointed. The film starts off great and you think the main character's guilty feelings will play an important role in the future... but no! The scene when Don sees Alice has a lot of potential but ultimately fails and ruins the whole movie. I was shocked, not by the gore but of sheer disappointment with the course the movie took.<br/><br/>After that it becomes just another movie with forgettable characters, some confusing transitions and you just feel detached.<br/><br/>I was sad to see a story and characters with potential being wasted. Some individual scenes later in the movie (the power outage and the panic) could've been so much better.<br/><br/>The movie is unnecessarily more gory and has a lot of scenes where you think ""that's just stupid"".

OK, 1: The virus not being 'inter-species' although last time I checked, it started from monkeys/chimps. 2: Two children being able to escape from a military lock-down facility, being seen by only one guy? 3: The woman having an immunity that only partly makes her immune..... 4: Robert Carlyle having an AAA pass, then when he goes to see his wife, she is unguarded??? 5: Allowing the people to come back in when the whole place isn't cleared, bodies etc still not disposed of? In summary, I loved the first film, and love the genre, but this is a classic example of someone taking a good British film, and Americanizing it, turning it into something that's just nowhere near as good. I started writing this giving it a 4, but remembering the aspects of the film, dropped it down to a 3"
"bobbyallright","2","0","1","9 December 2007"," ending improves from 28 Days horrible 2nd half
","It kept my interest throughout and that's about it. 28 Days has a much better beginning that sets the scene and engages the viewer to try and figure out what's happening. 28 Weeks makes no connections in the beginning - unknown people in a house hit by the infected so except for the hefty rental price I had to pay I would have stopped watching. I had hoped for at least one, just one, character from the previous movie to bridge a connection but sadly there wasn't even one carry over from the first movie. Usually that is a heads up right there that the movie is going down hill. Some of the other writers have already mentioned the absolute stupidity and offense that the producers make of the viewers intelligence when the actors do such stupid things such as let the kids cross the river to the not completely safe portions of the city. Turn a blind eye! No, the armed guards just don't happen to notice two kids crossing the bridge right behind their backs! And a guard who does finally take notice takes his own sweet time (hours) to track the kids down and descend on them, and of course just in the nick of time after the kids have accomplished their objectives. 28 Days did much better with the 'return to family house' sequence. But to be fair I must slam the first movie for the horrible 2nd half of the movie at the soldiers camp. It was so bad that you'll actually find that the film makers added 3 different endings to the DVD of 28 Days, one of which entirely cut the second half of the movie at the soldiers camp (which is what they should have done). So 28 Weeks sort of makes up for this in having not so disaster an ending. But I did feel quite taken for a ride after watching 28 Weeks that I had just been fed a dose of Hollywood crap, with non stop pointless action gore and violence. So I give 28 Weeks two points. One point for not crashing and burning the 2nd half of the movie like 28 Days did. And one point for making this movie wider in scope with repopulating and crowd control efforts. Both movies really paint a horrible view of the military. This viewpoint in both films is developed very poorly, actually not even developed at all. Some movies that actually have some thoughtfulness and don't insult their viewers usually add some story as to why the military is such a 'bad guy' such as corruption schemes or hidden agendas or in cahoots with the scientists who developed the virus to begin with. All in all a terrible disappointment."

","In case you haven't seen it, you won't want to be eating if you decide to watch 28 Weeks Later. You know, I sometimes wonder what motivates people to take a role in a movie like this. I mean, spending almost 2 hours running around drooling and puking bloody gore all over the place, including in other people's faces would tend to make me a little uncomfortable later after the movie is out. I'd be embarrassed to show my face! What, is it the money? The idea of being a big time actor or some such baloney? Look, no five people could possibly contain in their bodies as much blood as the goalies do in this disgusting trash masquerading as a movie. There was absolutely no point to this flick whatsoever. It was all about shock. And where's the value in that?"
"sergiogarza_834","5","0","1","5 December 2007"," A lot of fails, but something good, at least.
","First of all, i wasn't supposed to see this movie. See, you can guess why, but i watched 28 days later when i was even younger, so what was the problem?<br/><br/>Anyway, i was really excited about watching 28 weeks later. I really liked the first part, but i would've liked to at least know what happened to the characters in the first movie. They were really good. But better than the ones in this second part. I just didn't feel their presence, not as in the first one.<br/><br/>Another thing that i felt, was that this movie was full of... stupidities. For example... Who would go back to that place, where a lethal virus was released accidentally, causing the infection and death of most of the people in th UK? And just 28 weeks later, come on. Nobody would do that. That's one of the first fails that i found. <br/><br/>The people in this movie, it seems to me, don't make wise decisions. With so much security, two kids were able to get out of the city. Well, i guess that was something they had to add, a reason, so they could find their mom hiding in their house. Their mom, who, apparently, survived the attack of the infected. I mean, yeah, she has the immunity, but, it didn't make sense to me that she made it out of there without something else than little scratches. We're talking about infected people that attack brutally to anyone on their way. But yeah, they needed another bad reason.<br/><br/>So, what's the job of the dad of the kids, that he can enter anywhere he wants in the place? I thought that a person like that would be a high ranked worker there, and would, of course, BE working there, doing at least something. ""I run the place"". That just didn't seem real. Another bad reason, for him to go and enter to the room were his wife is kept, his infected wife, who doesn't have any symptoms, but still, carries the virus. That was stupid too... if he's the one that runs the place, he would've known that they have his wife, and that she is infected. But, well, he gets infected. Kills her. And gets out, killing a guard, who carries at least 3 guns.<br/><br/>And the zones where they keep the civilians... aren't they supposed to be secured? How could the man get there? Another bad reason... And how could the man follow his kids all around the city? Infected aren't supposed to feel, right? And, it was completely unnecessary to kill all the people running out there. There are ways to recognize. For example, uninfected people are able to put their hands on their heads and run, so anyone running like that, isn't an infected, or something like that.<br/><br/>Well, yeah, this movie has a lot of fails. But it made me feel tension and goosebumps. I couldn't sleep the night i watched, not because of fear. Because i was thinking... what would we do in a situation like that? what if it happened to us? Certainly, i really don't know. And i wouldn't like to know, honestly.<br/><br/>A cliffhanger ending. Damn. Now, lets wait and see 28 months later. Can't wait."

","What can I say. I saw 28 days later on video and was pleasantly surprised and thought it was a really tight, entertaining horror flick. Rather than sit and compile a list of holes in the plot etc., I just sat back and enjoyed it for what it was. I really had low expectations for the 2nd one because so many sequels turn up lame. This was also a pleasant surprise. It was a different set of characters under a different set of circumstances but I thought it was about as much fun to watch and overall a good horror flick as the first! I don't want to spoil anything, but I did get into the characters, and felt sad for those that met their demise. Again, if you don't expect the greatest movie ever made, the most intelligent plot etc., but are willing to just take it for what it is, It was a lot of fun to watch, and I would probably be inclined to see the next one if it were to become a trilogy."

I just remembered hating the ending because it felt like they just ran out of time and money. I can say that 28 Weeks is better on that note. It has a real plot and a real ending. But it feels worse... because after seeing it, I felt I should have known better. It is a contradiction of terms to have a serious zombie movie. No matter how seriously the subject is taken, it comes off as silly. The overtones of seriousness don't help anymore than they did with The Blair Witch... They just add to the feeling that the viewer is being fooled into thinking they are watching a good movie rather than a dumb one. I like my dumb movies to be upfront... <br/><br/>This time I'll remember. When 28 Months Later comes out I'll remember to skip it."
"Caps Fan","6","0","1","11 November 2007"," Disappointing Sequel
","Danny Boyle's 2002 film ""28 Days Later"" was a startling and terrifying piece of work, combining interesting characters with a chilling situation and amazing photography, and taking care to provide something at least slightly upbeat for the audience to take home at the end. In other words, what it did, it did well.<br/><br/>""28 Weeks Later"" is not the worst sequel I've ever seen, but it is something of a disappointment. To begin with the good, it does inherit some of the strong points of the first film as an interesting cast turns in good performances to give us some pretty scary moments.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it just does not know where to stop. The plentiful, but rarely excessive, gore of the first film turns into seemingly unstoppable fountains of the stuff here. A charming scene near the end where a helicopter is used to slice a group of ""infected"" to pieces is particularly nauseating. Meanwhile, characters we like are shown dying horrible deaths to no good purpose, and the ending is a real downer. To add to the fun, half the dialog seems to consist of words beginning with ""F"". Perhaps no surprise, given the material, but at times the expletives really do seem to be just padding. The memorable soundtrack of the first film is nowhere to be found here.<br/><br/>So, I neither recommend this film, nor advise against going to see it. But if you do go, keep your expectations in check.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10."

","I went into this movie with high hopes. I liked 28 Days Later, so I was pretty excited to see this one. I was bummed that Danny Boyle wasn't on board, but hey, it could still be good, right?<br/><br/>The beginning showed promise. Then, it hit. Yes, the plot holes that everyone keeps discussing. HORRIBLE, humongous plot holes. And it wasn't just the plot holes that made this movie bad. It was the poor writing and the gore for the sake of gore...<br/><br/>First the writing. Where to begin. Ridiculous. The characters, the storyline, everything. I won't go into detail, just scan some of the other reviews (you know, the sensible ones not written by ""fanboys"" of the first movie). Why couldn't the story include other interesting bits and pieces to shed more light on the nature of the infected? Do they think? What do they eat, candy bars?? Do they feel pain? Are they faster and/or stronger than regular people? How can they tell the difference between themselves and normal people? Nope. Nothing. I thought the genetic mutation of the mother might have been a promising aspect to the story, but really, when it comes down to it, it need not have even been included in the plot, other than to get the mother to reinfect everyone.<br/><br/>And the gore. Hey, I'm all for shocking gore with my zombie movies, but this was just over the top. Done for it's own sake, really. Added nothing to the horror element of the film at all!! The chopper scene???? C'mon!!! I laughed my butt off!! Just dumb...<br/><br/>If you have any respect for the genre, and/or liked the first one, skip this one.

Incidentally, the same could be said of ""gangster/mafia/crime"" type movies, but that's for another review.<br/><br/>This was so brainless and unentertaining I couldn't even finish half of it. It all feels very 'distant' and detached, and some scenes scenes really felt like a music video. Not exactly entertaining. Up to the point where I stopped watching, there was not a single character portrayed in a way to make you care for them, it was so completely boring. I just don't understand how humans are so easily entertained by simple horror sequences. I'd rather have a good story that's written in a way that happens to be scary, than just having 'scary' scenes with the story being secondary.<br/><br/>Just like the first movie, I turned this off halfway through. I won't give it the lowest possible score though, I'm maintaining a small amount of objectivity in realizing that this crap just isn't for me, but in terms of what this movie was supposed to be, and who it caters to, just maybe it accomplishes that in a very small way (very small, hence the score)."

","This may be a spoiler but I am writing it after the movies release on DVD so I doubt it will ruin the movie for anyone. The first movie, 28 Days Later, was an extraordinary film. From the beginning, the characters were smart,creative and resourceful. You liked the characters in 28 Days and wanted to see them survive. You know bad things are in store when the original writer and director are not on board for the sequel. A really bad, stupid sequel at that. 28 Weeks Later starts off smart and then quickly jumps to really stupid. The main characters are all stupid and selfish. The only smart characters are in the U.S. Army defense force that is attempting to protect and reconstruct Great Britain. The Army makes all the right decisions but fails anyway because the primary characters are complete idiots. The Father is a sympathetic character that makes the right decision to save his own life when his incredibly stupid wife decides to try to save a boy they have just met instead of saving herself by listening to her husband. Sorry, but I would leave her behind also. But then the Father seems to be infected with stupidity when his children return from a safe haven in Spain. The children are complete morons and obviously have inherited their mother's stupid gene in addition to her immunity to the virus. You want to see the characters in 28 Weeks die quick, painful deaths so the movie will end. But they don't and you know they are setting you up for 28 Months Later, 28 Years Later and other never ending sequels."

The actors were very professional, Mackintosh Muggleton is a kid star on the rise no questions asked, He did a very good job for his first film and has a very bright future ahead of him. Imogen Poots did a fabulous job playing her role, she should be casted more often, she looks like she's going to be a very successful young women and both Mackintosh and Imogen should be very proud of what a terrific job they did. Jeremy Renner did a phenomenal job playing a hero, he was very convince able playing a soldier and should portray hero's more often, Jeremy is an excellent actor. Overall, I can honestly say this is and will always be my number one favorite movie of all time. The only killjoy would have to be when Jeremy Renners character 'Sgt.Doyle' is burned alive and when Rose Bryne's character 'Mayjor Scarlett' is beat to death. In conclusion this movie is a great piece of cinema and all the people who put this movie together deserve a round of applause and like I said before the kids in this movie have a very bright future ahead of them and so does the rest of the cast good job and keep up the good work."

"Michael Kenmore","9","0","2","14 October 2007"," This is a real movie adaptation of Resident Evil 2 & 3; sequel exceeds the original
","** minor spoilers but nothing crucial **<br/><br/>My interest in 28 Weeks Later peaked when I read Fangoria magazine on the making of 28 Weeks Later and I learned Spanish filmmakers were working on it which I thought unusual. It was a fascinating behind the scenes story, but then I forgot about it when the actual movie came out. I was too preoccupied with searching for gainful employment at the time.<br/><br/>I assumed that because of the four credited screenwriters, the movie would end up weak that turn out disappointing, as in many cases of past movies. I did not expect better when I decided to rent the movie (actually had to ask a video clerk if it's checked in yet at the counter) just to pass the time. I thought 28 Days Later was alright, nothing to write home about, except for maybe a lousy ending.<br/><br/>I popped the DVD in at around 3 a.m. Sunday morning because I had nothing to do. I believe watching the movie at night in the early morning was a factor in what turns out one of the most frightening and intense horror movies I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty of horror movies. I did not even see the trailer before the movie came out in theaters and I always assume horror sequels suck (Saw II the worst I've seen in years, thanks to hideously lame story and nauseating MTV rapid editing, Saw III just as bad for its excessive gore as torture porn) so these factors helped a great deal in lowered expectation.<br/><br/>The movie completely floored me after ten minutes intro. 28 Weeks Later is an adrenaline action horror thriller with high-octane intensity and more than adequate character development usually neglected in inferior horror movies. The only frightening horror movies I saw were standard haunted house (The Changeling), stalking killer ('78 Halloween, first four Friday the 13th movies) and sci-fi horror (Alien & '82 The Thing) fares. Gory horror pictures do not provide fright but only revulsion and disgust -- Haute Tension being a particularly execrable movie for this reason alone.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later have massive amount of gore, but strangely it did not repulse me. Sped-up motion editing helped in this case to make it much more intense and frightening. Honestly, there are scenes with so much severed limbs and gore the movie should have gotten a NC-17 (Canada and UK gave it 18 certificate). The gore actually served the story rather than simplistic throw-away gore to appease the gorehounds like the hackneyed horror movies that emphasize excessive gory violence and geysers of blood for the sake of gore. This time it *really works* in a horror movie, which is exceedingly rare. Because 28 Weeks Later is an unbelievably violent movie with gallons of blood and pounds of severed flesh, it's definitely not for the squeamish or average moviegoer with aversion to horror genre.<br/><br/>The story departs from the usual cliché in repetition already done in the original, and this is very uncommon. It's like the horror equivalent of Babe: Pig in the City in daringly original and refreshing storytelling when the torch is passed. Sure, there may be questionable plot holes and implausibilities (especially genetic immunity to the virus) in the sequel, but the story and action are so tense and compelling the flaw can be overlooked to bask in the wild ride.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly realistic in the depiction of the dystopian future of London, and I can imagine the same would happen in American and European cities where the cities brought to a complete standstill in barren post-apocalyptic wasteland feel eerie and depressing. The spectacular VFX effects and production design are excellent compliments to the story and action which made it feel like you are there in an alternative reality. However, the ending alone is very dark and depressing, so it shouldn't be a surprise. I did not expect the sequel to 28 Days Later which I thought was well-made but mediocre and I have no idea how the producers will come up with the second sequel to complete the trilogy since it's too much to think the virus might have taken over the entire planet to usher in the extinction of mankind.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later reminds me of Capcom's Resident Evil video game franchise (particularly 2 and 3 for PlayStation) I played several years ago. The firebombing of London is eeriely reminiscent of the nuclear attack on Raccoon City that conclude the ending of Resident Evil 3 as well as the atrocity of Dresden, Germany during WWII. I never saw any Resident Evil movie, not even Extinction, but 28 Weeks Later is true to the spirit of Resident Evil series in ""survival horror"" to put it in plain term. Resident Evil 5 for PlayStation 3 will be a great compliment to 28 Weeks Later, as the millions of views for the trailer of the game attest on YouTube.<br/><br/>All in all, a masterpiece of horror genre -- one of the best movies of 2007 and a supremely well-made film that not only exceed the original but a total triumph in movie-going experience where the combination of horror and gore is a legitimate form of storytelling without unnecessary abuse by sheer indulgence in the pointlessness of excess gore.<br/><br/>**** out of four stars<br/><br/>Postscript: upon further research, I found out the Spanish filmmakers made Intacto, which was a truly exceptional thriller suitable for double billing with Nine Queens. Kudos to Danny Boyle for enjoying Intacto so much he made a deal with the Spaniards to make the first sequel that's better than the first for some viewers for its taut & claustrophobic story with emphasis on emotionally complex outlook."

","Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto) is handed over the reigns by Danny Boyle, and he doesn't disappoint . In essence, I would describe the entire film as one entire family's curse. The film opens with a sequence showing us what Robert Carlyle's character, Don, was doing 28 days after the initial outbreak.<br/><br/>What the movie really delivers are just some fantastic apocalyptically beautiful scenes. However, the scene of the film I believe is of a tight-packed crowd becoming infected in one incredibly effective, claustrophobic and frightening sequence that brings home the terror. Instead of dealing with a small band of survivors, we get to see the effects of the Rage virus on an entire nation. You believe the plight of common people in the midst of pure mass terror and a nearly inescapable death.<br/><br/>The sound and music of the film is another highlight. It's silence, it's intensity.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later is not without it's problems though. For one, it's structure feels odd or off. Unlike 28 Days Later, Weeks Later does not have a main character like Cillian Murphy or Brendan Gleeson. Instead, we are treated to sympathetic soldiers Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and Scarlet ( Rose Byrne).<br/><br/>Both Renner & Byrne are in reality the heart and soul of this film...and both of them capture brilliant performances. Renner's line relating to something like "" It's all f**** up"" simply captures everything we're thinking. I also love the scene where he finally decides to abandon his post after his ordered selected shootings of the infected don't exactly work.<br/><br/>And then there is Byrne. Well. Fine. I'll go there. Rose is amazing. She has such a natural beauty, and her eyes capture everything. For instance, watch that scene where she is describing how the Army is going to execute a code red. All bets are off. There is going to be no favors done for anyone involved.<br/><br/>Well done to Robert Carlyle as well. The beginning scene of the film, gets me pumped every time.<br/><br/>Generally, 28 Weeks Later is one of those rare sequels that can stand proudly next to its predecessor."

Fresnadillo made it creepy, scary, stylish, suspenseful with some terrific action sequences as well. The characters in the film are well-written and the actors made their roles extremely likable. You do care for these characters, if they make it or not. Sadly, this well received film didn't exactly pay off at the box office. But it will certainly do much better on DVD and it will have an big cult following as the original did.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also has an running commentary track from the screenwriter/director and screenwriter Enrique Lopez Lavigne. Which it's a solid commentary track, they give many trivia of the movie and as well for how technical the filming was. DVD also has three featurettes, two deleted scenes with optional commentary by the filmmakers and more. This is one of the strongest sequels i seen in a while. Fresnadillo did a terrific job with making this sequel. There's some jolts, some strong pay-offs, good performances by the cast and an unexpected coda as well. Which it's a great set-up for a promising third picture. Good cinematography by Enrique Chediak (Down in the Valley, The Faculty, Turistas) and an strong score by John Murphy (Basic Instinct 2, Miami Vice, Snatch.) highlights this sequel as well. Which Murphy did the rich score of the original as well. Don't miss this sequel. Screenplay by Rowan Joffe, director:Fresnadillo, Jesus Olmo and Enrique Lopez Lavigne. (****/*****)."

","I thought that this movie would be the worst sequel to one of the best zombie flicks ever. I was DEAD wrong. This movie had everything, well almost everything that the original had. Its essentially 28 weeks after the original movie and the Rage Virus had taken to the streets in a rapid epidemic and Britain is on lockdown. With help from the US troops, they pose an equal chance to defend themselves while a family is being torn apart by these events and trying to get out of the country. But British scientists and US scientists may have found a cure to the Rage Virus.<br/><br/>It had great acting by Robert Carlyle, Mackintosh Muggleton and Jeremy Renner, which really made this movie work, the concept was dynamite and the post-apocalyptic Britain sets where amazing. At points it had me jump out of my seat with both jump-out horror and CG-horror and violence was superb. The actions scenes are masterfully done, effectively placing the viewer in the victims and the crazed, but still scarily human, zombies. It had sad, life-damaging scenes in the fact that a family is being torn apart because of this whole incident and beginning was beautifully done. The cinematic score and sound effects gave me shutters and whole thing was great. There where scenes (ie: the gas-bomb-car scene) that where brilliant but also quite frightening.<br/><br/>However, as much as I praise and love this movie I think that it did not have the sly humor or the character development as the previous movie, but aside from that, this movie is genuinely perfect. The emotions and the powerful disturbing images and cinematography really made this movie work, and the depiction of how human nature really is. In summation, I believe that this movie was one of the best sequels to a zombie flick since Dawn of the Dead and Land of the Dead."

","Wow, the same thing happened to me as Russell. I thought it was gonna be dire, then I got sucked in by the reviews and because of all the input by Doyle, Alex Garland and the fact that Doyle had apparently hand picked the replacement director my mind was changed. But I'm afraid this is as far as my similarities to Russell go. I really didn't like this film. I loved the first one. This one just didn't make any sense to me. There were definitely amazing visuals and great action. And, yes, I can see that there was a political under current about how governments treat people and how the military is made to act by politicians etc etc. But I don't really care. There was no actual real story there. What was this film actually about?! It felt like nothing really happened in this film and it just jumped from set piece to set piece. Non of the actors needed to be there as they did bugger all! I think it would have been a lot more enjoyable and wasted a lot less of some probably decent actors time if they had just had a load of infected running around and soldier shooting the crap out of them (and burning them and blowing them up and gassing them etc). I have so many questions that will go unanswered. Nothing that anyone did in this movie makes any sense. their actions emotions and ides are all completely baffling. This movie made me feel totally unconnected and unable to empathize with any of the characters. There is usually at least one in even the worst films that I can understand. So this film has at least accomplished this, something that not many films can do."

My feelings about that movie are some kind of divided.<br/><br/>One the one hand I expected some kind of stunning zombie-movie, but the zombie-factor isn't that huge. Like ""28 days later"" there are a lot of passages where no zombie appears at all. 28 days later is some kind of road movie in the middle.<br/><br/>28 weeks later is more thriller than splatter movie. Of course there is zombie-action, but - and there the movie lost some of it's stars in my rating - the shaking camera is so bumpy that you can hardly see anything. With might work for some movies - like Blair Witch - and might be an interesting thrilling element it did not work for this movie.

","All in all I found the sequel a let down. First of all, there really are some flaws in the logic: the general states the the virus would not cross species which is exactly how it broke out in the first place. And if it really doesn't where are all the animals? We are told that they are there but we never see them. Would London after about half a year and a couple of million dead people really look like it had been left yesterday? How did the mother survive? Even if she was immune to the virus why wasn't she torn to pieces? And how did the zombie janitor from hell mention to turn up wherever his family was? That's a bit too much of a coincidence. The other thing that I found a bit off putting was that -as opposed to the first part- violence erupted and there was basically no escalation. And at times there was gore for gore's sake. So all in all, the film was well timed, visually a bit too much cutting edge and a thinking man's gore fest. And of course it was a delight to finally see Garfield Morgan back on the silver screen."

","This movie is a terrible letdown. The fault not being in the movie but the fact that it was a sequel to such an exemplary movie like 28 Days Later. I had high expectations, but none were met except for the fact that they lifted the same sound track from the first movie and other rather simple cues which people who have watched the first movie can pick up.<br/><br/>As a stand alone movie it can hold its own, its got gore, action , thrills etc in the right package.....but then what does that become.......a typical Hollywood horror movie. The first one was really creepy, with distinct elements of fear, shock, great sound track, and etc which set it apart from movies like Resident Evil. It never felt like a commercial venture. When i watched the first one, i was glued to the screen and was in constant trepidation........in this somehow the outcome was more or less expected. Also the first movie ended hinting on hope, which leaves a really good feeling in your gut.........but this was like any typical ending.<br/><br/>Personally i felt that the first movie had more of a message to deliver.....the fact that people don't need a virus to kill others, as is evident from the way Cillian Murphy kills the soldiers in the end and Naomi almost mistaking him as an infected......we don't need a virus to enrage us. This movie had none of that........pity, or maybe i guess i was looking for too much."

I have to say though, that plot-wise - it is still better than any other zombie flicks, including classics like ""Dawn Of The Dead"", and unlike their, ""28 Weeks Later""'s creators were not afraid to tackle the explanation to the epidemic, or the bigger picture, and didn't focus just on a group of survivors. A well deserved 10! enjoy biatches."
"Protilius","7","0","3","27 July 2007"," Better than most zombie flicks... but not Dawn of the Dead.
","The movie begins with a small group of people just trying to survive in a cabin someplace in the U.K.,. Presumably just after the events of the first movie, Zombie's have already destroyed the local communities and British society as we know it, and we're introduced to some seriously stressed out yet hopeful people.<br/><br/>They all die save a single person... who consequently abandon's his wife to save his own hide in the process. It was suspenseful, tragic, and a good way to open.<br/><br/>Some time later (28 weeks) our ""hero"" (that so selflessly jumped ship and allowed his wife to be the main course for numerous evil creatures) is reunited with his children in London. The united states has moved in, set up a base of operations, and has established a functioning mini city inside the confines of Dog Island (someplace in London, never been there myself.)<br/><br/>They have water, electricity, and a sniper for every roof watching through ""your"" windows at night. It's a marshal law state... but it's a better solution than anything previously provided given the circumstances.<br/><br/>I liked that... It offered more presence than the low budget ""28 days later"" ever did.<br/><br/>Of course our ""hero's"" children turn out to be idiots... and after learning of a censored version of mom's fate through they're father, they feel the need to escape the compound and attempt to reclaim pictures of they're late mother from they're since abandoned home (presumably within the London city limits.)<br/><br/>The whole time, your watching this... shaking your head, knowing full well this doesn't turn out with a happy ending. It just can't.<br/><br/>They're escape doesn't go unnoticed though, so after allowing our viewers to tense up waiting for that ""moment"" when everything goes bad, our military friends manage to capture them at they're old house... and one more guest as well.<br/><br/>They're mother. But wait... how can that be?<br/><br/>Infected with the virus, yet somehow not hostile (save the madness from trauma of course), the army brings mom back to the compound of Dog Island and begins to give her the disinfecting you'd expect in any virus infected world.<br/><br/>The children know they're mother not to be dead now, Dad is declared a liar because his story suddenly doesn't add up, and mom is strapped to a chair with the sole desire to see her children as Dr's draw blood and run tests.<br/><br/>Good Drama... Also the perfect catalyst to send this movie into overdrive.<br/><br/>Of course, our ""Hero"" learns of his living wife and quickly goes to see her. Consumed in guilt and the need to be forgiven for his manly man courage 28 weeks prior, she manages an I love you, and our ""Hero"" moves in for that passionate kiss which consequently infects him with the virus only seconds later.<br/><br/>Perfect... Get's what he deserved.<br/><br/>Dad goes nuts, kills his strapped up wife, and then continues infecting the entire compound as he goes on the rampage that I like to call ""The BBQ of Dog Island.""<br/><br/>My favorite part about this, is the military decides to lock up ""the entire"" population in a basement of a large building, which ultimately make for a great slaughter house when ""only one"" zombie (coincidently turning out to be our so called ""hero"") gets inside the room and starts turning people one by one. Which in turn, infect more people, One... by... One... by... hundreds... <br/><br/>Very cool.<br/><br/>From there... It's a series of moral dilemmas as snipers have to figure out who's undead and who's struggling for dear life... and begin popping people once they finally bust out of the basement and make a mad dash to safety.<br/><br/>Eventually the problem is identified as the unavoidable equivalent of a crap load of collateral damage... and the order to kill anything moving comes down.<br/><br/>Mwahaha..!!! Very nice!<br/><br/>The movie then follows the two children of our ""hero"" through a series of escapes (with the aid of a military officer, a civilian, and a scientist/Dr.) <br/><br/>After the city is effectively bombed with napalm... the only really cool scene after that is a helicopter being used as a zombie blender. Another scene worth noting was our military officer getting torched by his own boys in an attempt to push start a car out of a flood of nerve gas.<br/><br/>Nice...<br/><br/>The kids make they're way to a previously established ride (through they're ""dead"" Military guide of crushed London,) and eventually are eventually forced to come face to face with our undead ""hero"" just before the son is infected ""by"" our ""hero"" (yet like his mother, doesn't turn.)<br/><br/>The sister witnesses her brother getting infected by good old dad, and puts a few bullets through his head... ending our ""hero's"" rampant slaughter of Dog Island.<br/><br/>That was pretty gay actually... like Dad was just gonna find them way the heck out there after everything that's happened since.<br/><br/>Yeah... what ever.<br/><br/>The movie ends with the children being helicoptered out of London and presumably to safety. Bringing death with them of course... It leaves a sequel wide open in case a producer out there gets funding for another one of these short yet mildly entertaining movies.<br/><br/>Better than the first... nothing in the shadow of the recent ""Dawn of the dead"" though..."

","At least as good as the first film this tells the story 28 weeks later and has the Americans helping the surviving Brits rebuild society starting with a protected zone inside of London.<br/><br/>There are a few plot points that you need to accept as happening, even though they make little common sense - like how the dad survives firebombing, how he always manages to be on the kids trail, why some victims (some soldiers for example) just seem to die whereas most become killing machines and the ending (which I won't give away) while a neat ending fits into that category a little as well.<br/><br/>But it feels like the original and while bits of it require switching your common sense off for it is a good fun horror film and the ""zombies"" (or should I say ""the infected"") are very well done - fast, vicious and intelligent. Indeed the infected are what take this film up a notch because this isn't just another zombie type film, the infected are ""zombies"" the way they should be to scare you - they move extremely fast, they're not thick and they never hesitate to kill.<br/><br/>The camera work is eerie as expected, it still amazes me how they get London looking so empty and lifeless and I liked how they didn't fully follow Hollywood convention and made it so you couldn't be sure which characters would or would not survive.<br/><br/>It didn't really make me jump, my wife was having kittens watching this though as for her it was very scary. It's a worthy sequel and good enough that I'd like to see another instalment, maybe they could make this a trilogy? Overall they have managed to do what so many sequels fail to do, they have kept the look and feel of the original while improving on it and that is a rare feat."
"bburns","8","0","2","22 July 2007"," Not the visionary masterpiece of the original, but still fun
","Five years ago, British auteur Danny Boyle re-defined the zombie film with ""28 Days Later"". No longer did the zombies conform to George Romero's template of unstoppable drooling undead idiots with disposable appendages. Instead, the zombies were speedy, smart, fierce and not even actually dead, merely ""infected"". It inspired other similarly-themed films, the best of which are ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Grindhouse"".<br/><br/>Now there is a sequel to this genre-busting masterpiece. Sadly, neither director Boyle nor lead actors Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccleston or Brendan Gleeson have returned for this one. However, that does not mean the film is worthless. Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo ably mimics Boyle's style from the original, from the use of hand-held DV and wide shots of blighted London to the documentary-like editing and cadences of the dialog. He even casts Boyle regular Robert Carlyle in the lead role (Ewan McGregor still being a bit young-looking to play the father of two teenagers). There are also good performances from Idris Elba, Catherine McCormack and newcomers Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton. <br/><br/>Since the story is basically a re-tread of the original, I won't bore you with a plot summary. But I will say that since this is a sequel, much of what was shockingly original in the first film now seems expected. There are only two new twists: The soldiers are now Americans and are genuinely trying to help, and--in an important plot point stolen from ""Grindhouse""--some people are immune to infection. This works for good and for ill. For good in that the main focus of the film is on a brother and sister who are immune (Muggleton and Poots) having to flee from their infected father (Carlyle) with the help of an army doctor (Rose Byrne) and a cocky sniper (Jeremy Renner). For ill in the fact that of all the Brits and Aussies playing American soldiers, only Elba and Byrne can do convincing American accents.<br/><br/>The original ""28 Days Later"" was a visionary masterpiece that revolutionized the horror genre. ""28 Weeks Later"" lacks the incomparable talents of Danny Boyle and the cast of the first film, but it is a good horror movie and a worthy tribute to the original. 8 out of 10."

This movie is the rare exception.<br/><br/>I liked 28 Days Later but didn't think it was great. I also didn't expect the sequel 28 Weeks Later to live up to the hype. I was dead wrong. 28 Weeks Later easily surpassed the first movie.<br/><br/>I am not going into specifics because I don't want to ruin this for anyone who has not seen this flick.<br/><br/>I think it is safe to assume that everyone knows this is about a deadly virus that turns people into flesh tearing vicious killers.<br/><br/>This movie was filmed beautifully (even being brutal). The director used great cuts, closeups, shaky cameras, loud audibles, etc but unlike many films he actually managed to create a feeling of dread and chaos.<br/><br/>The movie also makes you feel sympathy for several of the characters and pity. It does show the best and worst of human behavior and emotions.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This is a very violent flick and probably extremely scary to many. The movies characters action do feel real whether logical or out of panic. You have to have a level of suspension of disbelief in order to believe the premise but the director pulls you into this movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts out fast and furious and then builds the main plot before going back to the action, suspense, and gore.<br/><br/>I gave this movie and 8/10 which is about as high of praise as I could give to not a zombie movie per se but very close.<br/><br/>If you like good movies and/or like horror, this is a good one to catch.

"moimoichan6","7","0","3","17 June 2007"," Anarchy in the UK (from Spain).
","It's really nice to see that Britain could offer the world some good horror movies again, and not only social dramas (for festivals) or comedies (for the popular audience) like they passively do since the end of the Hammer company. I don't know why or even exactly when they stopped doing this kind of movie but I was really happy to watch ""Creep"", ""Severance"", ""Dog Soldiers"" or ""Shawn of the dead"" (a comedy, really ?). I have the feeling that those movies tried to rebuild a link to popular horror movie that England lost years ago. It's useless to recall to everyone that the master of suspense himself was born in London and that the best thriller of all time : ""Peeping Tom"" was done by Michael Powell in 1960 in England.<br/><br/>Since its very beginning, Danny Boyle seems really attached to this kind of popular culture, trying to expose it in a completely British environment. It's what he accomplishes with the Zombie/Survival movie with ""28 days later"", putting together two American movies : ""The World, the flesh and the devil"" (a late 50 horror classic, witch begins exactly like Boyle's movie, only in New-York City) and Romero's Zombie trilogy (with much more faster Zombies indeed) in a pure British environment. I was a little suspicious when I learn that a sequel will be done without him directing, but as soon as the movie started, my doubts were gone : after a most impressive first scene (that reminds us the talent of Robert Carlyle with a very strong emotional impact), the movie overcomes the first one from an horrific point of view and also manage to deal with Britain most contemporary problems, even if the new director : Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is Spanish.<br/><br/>It's useless to search for any plot link with the previous movie : the only common point between the two movies is that they both happened in a dead Britain, infested by the Rage virus. 28 weeks after the contamination, London seems safe again, and some people are allowed to come back in their city, fully protected by the US army. The first part brilliantly use the security system as a part of the editing, showing us a life were intimacy is banned for security reasons. When CCTV (security cameras you'll find in London buses, shops, streetsÂ…) now almost covers the all town, this metaphor seems to me a acid comments on contemporary Britain. And I'm not even talking about the fact that it's the US army who controls the all city. Horror movies has always been a good field for political point of view, and I think that Fresnadillo uses this field to express a comment about Britain through his survival movie.<br/><br/>But don't worry, the movie is also fine when it comes to blood and gore (a little confused in its editing maybe, but the chaotic style adds fear to the horror of the situation), and it's no surprise that the town doesn't stay calm for long, and that the Rage isn't very far in this pessimistic movie. I was at the end very pleased to see an intelligent and entertaining gore movie, particularly an English one, made by a Spanish director (Spain also produced some excellent horror movies this past few years)."

This is what i like to think of as a proper sequel! 28 Days Later was the basic zombie virus idea and this takes it to the next stage where it has slightly more violence, gore and shocks (in my opinion)! There are more characters and more of a selection of characters which is good, and i think the acting is really good too! There are a few twists which is a major plus (and is part of what helps develop the story from the first film), the action is continuous as need be, and i really think they found a perfect storyline for this film!

Some solid acting and storyline, make this definitely one of the best movies that you will this year.<br/><br/>Just a few places that i felt disappointed were in the storyline where i couldn't help but think to myself ""What The?"".

","I really enjoyed 28 DAYS LATER and in general I'm a huge fan of the apocalyptic it's-the-end-of-the-world genre.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of 28 WEEKS LATER had me hooked, but after the story moves to the Green Zone in London, with the family split up, the narrative loses focus and the film suffers for this.<br/><br/>And the goal of the kids traveling with the American sniper and medic left me with a big ""so what?"" - so they need to get to the stadium - why? What's the point? Escape from the city? What about the rest of the American military personnel? Did they all leave? (None of this is explained).<br/><br/>The ending also felt tacked on -- I really expected that the last third of the film had started when they took off from Wembley Stadium. The film must have tested so well that Fox wanted the opportunity to make a sequel -- but I can't wait to read the French subtitles for ""Pardon Monsieur, but I must bleed on you NOW! GRRRRRRRR!"" <br/><br/>Joking aside, what this movie does extremely well is create the spooky atmosphere of a civilization at ground zero and what it would be like to start over from scratch. Sure, it's set in London, but I could see the same situation applying to Los Angeles, New York or any other large metro area in the world.<br/><br/>This is not an up-with-people movie -- and if nihilistic blood and gore is not your thing, stay far away. If you enjoyed the first film, there's enough here to recommend seeing this on the big screen (they obviously had a bigger FX budget for this film and it shows during the fire bombing sequence). The storytelling itself is just not as strong as the first film."

I have to mention there are some, very well done approaches (fortunately all seem casual) to effective dark flicks like The Thing, Blair witch Project and Return of the living Death.<br/><br/>I've seen many modern movies driving the same style (e.g. resident evil franchise), but in spite of the great/massive elements shown (Great-expensive FX/perfect make-up/massive CG/bad performances/massive non-stop score), they can't get audience to where they are intended for...looks like they concentrate too much on facts I mentioned that they forget the main essence of the movie.<br/><br/>I do strongly recommend 28 Weeks...Your Heart at 100MPH.

"stevetseitz","9","0","3","1 June 2007"," Brutal, exhausting, brilliant and powerful
","Few movies can approach the level of brutality, suspense, horror or intensity of ""28 Weeks Later"". A follow-up to the brilliant, eerie, low budget ""28 Days Later"", the sequel takes us to dark places only hinted at in the first film. I must warn you this film is unsparingly violent and mercilessly horrific, with scenes of family members killing each other.<br/><br/>The film contains a scene that is truly heart-rending as a man's cowardice overpowers his love for his wife as we (and she) watch in disgust as he decides to bail out in the face of an insurmountable challenge. Later, this same man comes face to face with the wife he abandoned, now a carrier of the disease, not truly ""infected"". She transfers the virus to him in a kiss and she helplessly watches as rage consumes him and turns him into an infected. Strapped to a table, she is subjected to his fatal attack as he kills her for the second time.<br/><br/>Like I said, brutal, repulsive and extremely dark stuff.<br/><br/>Innocent people are senselessly slaughtered by the infected in a scene that almost re-creates the story told by the character ""Mark"" from the first film. In that film, he describes being in a mob as the rage virus spreads and panic is transformed into bloody mayhem.<br/><br/>Innocent people are also slaughtered as a military force comes to terms with the concept of collateral damage. To keep the virus from spreading they target those who have not yet been infected. The abhorrent idea becomes more of a pragmatic survival strategy rather than an difficult ethical question as the disease spreads.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have (and what keeps me from rating the film higher)is that too many coincidences happen throughout the film which bring cast members together and into ""yet another"" dangerous frightening circumstance. It makes for a scary and jolting film certainly but it stretches the audience capacity for suspending their disbelief. After all, you can scarcely believe people would continue to go into dark underground confined areas knowing that survival was unlikely.<br/><br/>The solution to this horrible infection is clearly smaller controllable populations that can be isolated. Imagine multiple, secure self-contained areas of one hundred people or less. If any sign of infection happens it's far easier to simply segregate a small section of the population and let the disease flare up and burn itself out in 28 days. Also, to easily identify infected from non-infected in a crowd situation a simple announcement over a P.A. with instruction would be required. Tell all non-infected to run with their hands over their heads (or some similar instruction that infected would not understand) and it would be relatively simple to pick off the infected while avoiding innocent casualties."
"NjsMostWanted651","9","0","2","30 May 2007"," the best movie i saw this year
","little can be said about this film. i've never seen the first one and didn't know what the story was about, but when i saw the previews for it, i thought ""ha what a waste of film. just another fake wannabe scary sequel"" im so glad my friends talked me into seeing it because it was worth every cent of my money. while the previews for this movie were rolling, i planned the whole story in my head..survivors of a ""zombie"" attack fight their way to safety and all of them will die accept for the main character and his soon-to-be girlfriend and they make out at the end..i was wrong. the movie was unpredictable and surprising. It definitely kept me jumping out of my seat. The rush of motion like a room of people getting eaten alive and not giving much time to examine the scene gives the movie a sense of chaos. The gruesome effects of people getting their heads chopped off by a helicopter or getting their eyes caved in by a pair of thumbs is intense. i Definitely recommend this movie for anyone who likes the ""thrill"" of a good cannibal virus (or ""zombie movie"" as people like to call them) this is far from a zombie movie. There are some things about the plot that didn't let me give this movie a 10. one was the fact that they let everyone back into Britain BEFORE the whole infected area is proved safe. In real life i would certainly hope that more precautions would be taken before continuing letting people live in the area. another is the kids getting by heavily guarded military member and trained snipers with night vision, running around undetected. i have to say though it set up an amazing plot so i cant complain about this much. the last thing is gathering everyone in the area in a small, undergaurded room with easy infected people access. were they ASKING to spread the virus? Although these small plot flaws i HIGHLY recommend this movie. I cant wait for it to come out on DVD."
"theglovesareoff","9","0","2","29 May 2007"," Stunning
","Absolutely stunning. This film was amazing. Right from the beginning, the audience is transported into the story until in finishes. The pace of this movie is dead on. The action sequences go fast, but there are still parts of the movie where there is silence and reflection on what is happening to help the audience process the events of the film.<br/><br/>The entire story follows a single family and their interactions during the whole ordeal, so there is a heightened sense of relation between the characters, and in many of the scenes, the zombies are not nameless. It makes you question what you would do in their situation. It makes you question what it means to he part of a family and what it means to be alive.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie twice now, and I don't know if I could see it again very quickly because the movie is so emotionally exhausting, and the violence, while it is the same thing happening again and again, never loses its effect. Each time you're left alarmed, scared, wondering what will happen next. I would highly recommend checking this movie out, as it is a carnal zombie movie, but there are deeper, dramatic developments and beautiful images to make this movie rise above the normal zombie flick."

","Great great follow-up of a film. Not quite as good as the original but many shining moments. The first 10 mins is spectacular as far as zombie films go and there are many more moments later in the flick where this thing shines. Where Romero left off with Night of the Living & Dawn of the Dead, this new zombie genre picks up. Romero completely lost his touch on his 3rd film and in 28 Weeks Later you can see what Romero's original vision should have been on the bigscreen. I am so glad someone finally took over the reigns (even through the course of 2 different directors) from Romero 25+ years later. The music in the film is incredibly rich and intense and gives the entire picture wings. Do yourself a big favor and watch this baby on the bigscreen. Please."

","I was really looking forward to see this movie.<br/><br/>But after 10 minutes in the cinema it was clear that it was another trash Hollywood remake of a good European movie. Ever minute it just got worse and worse, there was totally no suspense, it just focused on the zombies ripping people apart. There are no interesting twists in the story, just a never ending torture to wait until the movie finishes.<br/><br/>Also one more thing: What is wrong with this community to give a trash movie like this such a high ranking? 71% on rotten is also pretty high. It's bad enough standing for itself but if you compare it to the first part, it's a disaster."
"willy2004","Null","0","2","27 May 2007"," An entertaining and worthy sequel
","Many zombie purists will argue that 28 Days Later was NOT a zombie film. And in a way they're right, Danny Boyle first showed us the rage virus as being something that does not kill you, but turns you into a blood-thirsty maniac...in a matter of seconds. Not a slow walking, moaning, rotting corpse which wanders aimlessly looking for brains.<br/><br/>In many ways the human who is infected with the rage virus is a far, far more terrifying adversary. Mainly because when they spot you, they instantly run full pelt at you, and don't let up. They infect you by either biting or beating the crap out of you and then vomiting blood in your face. Not a nice way to go.<br/><br/>28 days later, was really a social commentary that hinted to the fact that millions and millions of people die from infectious diseases each year around the globe, and that we really don't know what's next on the natural disease list. Mother nature could finally figure out a way to tell us Homo Sapiens to ""get lost"" once and for all - and that was what made 28 days later so scary, so real, and so brutal.<br/><br/>So fast forward 28 weeks later, and what so we get, we get a ravaged England that is now under US military control and has been sectioned off. We get thousands of refugees streaming in from the countryside, to start all over again. People from all walks of life, who are trying to make a life again for themselves.<br/><br/>Yet there's a problem.<br/><br/>No one knows where the virus has gone. Has it evolved, has it a new carrier? Understandably tensions are still among the people. It only takes one outbreak to start the chaos - and, well...I think you know what happens from here.<br/><br/>But 28 weeks later is a very simple story, its a very straightforward and in many ways short plot line, but effective none the less. Its a lot more intense and violent that the original, and there are some scenes where you'll laugh out loud as the director clearly pays homage to the zombie genre - with plenty of gory head-shots! Its a well acted film, and the actors all play their roles convincingly - even the infected. For people wanting a deeper meaning to their horror, it won't deliver on that level. But for people wanting a good scare at the Friday night cinema, you'll get what's expected.<br/><br/>28 weeks later does what its supposed to do - and that is scare you, not necessarily with cheap scares, but the good old ""base under siege"" and the ""will they make it"" plot line.<br/><br/>Its a good horror film, and deserves to be watched in a packed cinema."
"dr_foreman","7","0","2","24 May 2007"," more of the same good stuff
","I enjoyed ""28 Weeks Later,"" even though it felt exactly like ""28 Days Later,"" only with more splattering blood.<br/><br/>This is, indeed, an action sequel to a thoughtful little horror movie. For me, the original version was better. ""28 Days Later"" had stronger characters and a certain freshness to it (even though it was obviously based on older zombie movies). This sequel feels like a retread with extra action tossed in. It's still good - the apocalyptic imagery is wonderful - but it's like good leftovers. You already had the same thing last night.<br/><br/>I shouldn't be too critical, though. The filmmakers saw they had a good formula with the first movie, and didn't change it. Better that than changing the formula into something dumb, right? <br/><br/>It helps that this movie has a strong cast. Robert Carlyle is good, as usual, and his role takes a rather interesting twist mid-movie. Jeremy Renner makes for a likable and quite unexpected hero. And, as a bonus for genre fans, Idris ""Ultraviolet"" Elba has a decent role as a military commander. Perhaps the only casting stretch is Rose Byrne; she's beautiful, and a good actress, but she looks too young to be the chief medical officer for a program to rehabilitate zombie England! <br/><br/>Another minor downside is that the film strains credibility on occasion; for example, the manner in which the infection breaks out again is vaguely outrageous. I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just moan in general that the army does a really lousy job of security in this film. Implausibly lousy, in fact.<br/><br/>Yet this is still reasonably intelligent, good horror. The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission - it's the stuff that nightmares are made on."
"megatemplar","10","0","2","23 May 2007"," Go see it!
","By far the best movie I've seen. 28 Weeks Later blows the original movie, 28 Days Later out of the water, which is a first for me in regards to a sequel. I know some people think it was too high budget in comparison to the first, but ignore them. For what was required for 28 Weeks Later, it is justified. What really brought this movie to its potential is how realistic the movie seemed. Most of these types of movies use maybe a mall and a few streets, but 28 weeks later used the whole city London. Which I'm sure was quite difficult to remove all signs of life from a real, active city. There were only a very few sections of obvious CG, the rest fit in perfectly. For movies, especially of this genre, I usually notice the music right away, but in 28 Weeks Later the scene were either almost over or already over before I realized that music was playing. The actors were all perfect for their rolls, especially Mackintosh Muggleton (Andy) who is now my favorite actor. The only complaint I have from 28 Weeks Later is that it left me feeling like part of the ending was completely skipped, leaving out a portion of what the movie was building up to. This will probably be fixed either the bonus features on the DVD, or in 28 Months Later.<br/><br/>I will be seeing it for a third time shortly."
"poe426","10","0","3","23 May 2007"," Better than the original...
","The first extended preview I saw of this one (featuring Robert Carlyle's less-than-heroic bid for an infection-free existence) was the proverbial ""grabber."" As adept at the dramatic as the funny (THE FULL MONTY had me rolling in the aisle), Carlyle was inspired casting and his all-out performance proves most satisfying (the filmmakers don't punk out when it comes down to the nitty and the gritty, either). For the first time since David Cronenberg's RABID, one gets the uneasy feeling of what it might actually be like to get caught up in a siege situation in a major metropolitan city- and, also like RABID, 28 WEEKS LATER manages to convey this sense of foreboding with a minimal ""show of force,"" as it were: the handful of rooftop snipers (voyeurs, who spy on their charges with telescopic sights at night), the solitary helicopter hovering over it all, the armed guards who usher the herds of humanity on to their holding pens, etc. Like 28 DAYS LATER, 28 WEEKS LATER makes the most of not a whole lot (by Hollywood standards) and proves, yet again, that imagination and talent can go a long way. It would be interesting to see what these filmmakers could do with a book like THE NIGHT RIDERS by M. Kelley (an Xlibris book about... well, read it and see). I can hardly wait for 28 MONTHS LATER..."

","IMHO this film was pretty bad.<br/><br/>Started off okay, with some promise of unseen terror, shock, and horror. Even some hope of deep characterisation with Robert Carlyle's character exhibiting cowardice in the face of terror.<br/><br/>However, that's about the peak of the storyline.<br/><br/>The entire plot concerning the civilian establishment, (Isle of Dogs I think), was ridiculous. Especially any scenes involving the military. Their dialogue, and their roles were just so clichéd. Take the African-American General for example. I'm sure I've seen virtually the same characters played out in so many useless American films.<br/><br/>So many plot holes big enough to drive a tank through. eg, unless I missed it, surely there were many ways that either soldier could have contacted their base to say where they were and that they were coming in...without having to fear being shot down.<br/><br/>All the jerky camera work just added to my annoyance! <br/><br/>Soundtrack was quite good, in fact it was the best thing about some of the scenes! <br/><br/>Perhaps worst of all was that I felt nothing for any of the characters. I didn't root for the 'good guys', nor scream at the bad ones.<br/><br/>The film just didn't have the scares, or tension that I'd hoped for.<br/><br/>No,I didn't have high expectations for this film before seeing it, and was still disappointed.

","I liked ""28 Days Later..."" and while not exactly eagerly anticipating a sequel but if one came out, I would definitely see it.<br/><br/>Regrettably, I didn't like it as much as the first.<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies, ""Aliens"", contains a line to the effect ""In case you haven't been keeping up with current events, we're getting our (bleep) kicked!"" That's my main problem with ""28 Weeks Later"". There are too many situations where the characters aren't keeping up with current events. A savage disease had just ravaged mankind on the island of Great Britain where the infected had maniacally spread the disease by attacking the non-infected. I'd think that would serve ample warning to those trying to repopulate the island.<br/><br/>But, no. And the Harris children were the worst.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the Harris family. Father Don (Robert Carlyle) and Mother Alice (Catherine McCormack) found themselves stuck in England but the children Tammy (bright-eyed Imogen Poots) and Andy (shaggy Mackintosh Muggleton) were able to be shipped off to a refugee camp in Spain.<br/><br/>The opening sequence shows Don barely escaping an attack from the infected but Alice is not so lucky. Don makes to an area in London where, after all the infected have starved to death, a NATO operation led by U.S. troops begins the process of starting over again. It is here that he is reunited with his children.<br/><br/>Trouble starts when Andy craves a memento of Mom. So the he and his sis sneak off the area that's supposedly a fortress to keep out the infected should they happen to still roam the country. These two should have been scared straight about the risks they are taking.<br/><br/>That's just the first instance and it's not just with the kids. To me this spoiled the movie. I need this movie to give me sense and sensibility because it sure needs to overcome its gloominess.<br/><br/>Another pet peeve is the many scenes shot with a jerky hand-held camera.

","I saw this movie with expectations that it wouldn't be as good as the first movie, but that I would leave the movie theater satisfied. I was completely wrong. The movie was completely pointless, the whole movie focused on a family who at the beginning are attacked by the infected. The story then veers off to a few weeks later when the children of the couple, come home after being evacuated from Britain. Their father picks them up and takes them to their new apartment in the area designated for reconstruction. The Kids soon venture off after hearing about their mother's death, only to return to their home to find her alive. The Kids are put in a containment area and their mother is put into the med lab where it is discovered she has the infection but it isn't doing anything to her. She's basically a carrier. However everything goes wrong when her husband comes to see her and kisses her, (bad idea). He now catches the infection and goes on a killing spree, infecting many people and all hell breaks lose.<br/><br/>I was really disappointed when I saw the movie, and left the movie wanting my money back. The Special effects were alright, but they were cut short to one scene. The t.v. adds give more to the imagination but the story is quite boring. Yes, there were times when I jumped in my seat, but most of the movie I spent laughing myself silly.<br/><br/>I don't know how this movie was given a better review than Spiderman (which Rocked!), but as I've said this was a very bad movie.

"mike-925","Null","0","1","21 May 2007"," Iraq War Politics and Family Values Mix Easily With Bloodstruck Zombies
","28 Days Later is one of the better, more serious horror films ever made.<br/><br/>But since its premiere, lesser zombie films have rushed to trade on the Zombie film's reputation. First there is Shaun of the Dead, a Brit kitchen sink comedy that shows us the lighter side of zombies and even how to deal with them if one ever encounters a real one.<br/><br/>Fox and the Brits are back with 28 WEEKS Later, a decidedly weaker effort than Days, with Iraq War failures intermixed with dabs of Family Values. The movie is bad but the politics are the cheekiest since the Full Monty.<br/><br/>What remained of Brit forces, wiped up the carnage of 28 Days Later. But this bigger production demands a mightier crew: Yes, I'm afraid they've brought in the Americans. The US Army with all of its smugness intact is ready to screw it up and make a mess. This way, see, we don't just have just a zombie movie here but a metaphor for the joint British-American Failures in Iraq.<br/><br/>Lets not forget family values. Robert Carlyle seems a bad choice for the father of two little girls. After all, Carlyle abandoned Frank and Malachy McCourt., left them to fend for themselves in Limerick Ireland. Carlyle wandered off to England for good when wife Angela and the family became a burden in Angela's Ashes. Also, he didn't provide the greatest fatherly example when stripped to the essential Full Monty in the movie by that name.<br/><br/>Six months after the quelling of the Zombie invasion, civilians return to the boroughs of London to find US Army helicopters circling over Big Ben and the Thames, and US Army sharpshooters on the roofs watching for re-emerging zombies to return for another blood feast.<br/><br/>Despite the American presence, the yanks in the cast don't seem genuine. Seasoned Americans- I'm one of those- can spot this instantly. Brit actors can fake the accent and the look the ticket in some varieties of American movies, particularly when there are other Americans in the cast. But these 'Americans' have to be modeled after signature American types. These GIS ARE Americans though. They just seem a lot like Brits. Without the f*ck*n' adjective in every three word sentence and the US uniforms, you wouldn't know they were yanks at all.<br/><br/>The problem is really that Brit filmmakers don't know that in a movie like this you make use of stock American types. They've got one guy, the Black US army general who is modeled on the authoritative figure, often cast as a cop, that Ernie Hudson plays in stateside movies. Hudson is macho. He's got all the cool left over from Richard Roundtree's portrayal of John Shaft in 1971 and some menace besides. This guy playing the general in command of US Forces in London is decidedly weak tea by comparison.<br/><br/>Carlyle's kids are angry at him for telling them their mother is dead, but tries to con them instead, saying he only said that the Zombie kissed their mom. When the mom turns up alive, apparently untouched by the zombie contagion, a combination of full-fledged AIDS with Rabies combined, a nurse decides that she and her daughters must be preserved at all costs. Their blood could be the source of a protective serum against the Virus.<br/><br/>The efforts to isolate and quarantine any stray zombie still operating go awry when Carlyle, overwhelmed by guilt for fibbing to his kids, tries to at least straighten it out with the suddenly alive missus. But she really did get kissed by a zombie, and for Carlyle, that's the rub. In the time it takes to passionately kiss his wife, Carlyle is transformed into the most rabid of zombies. He cuts himself a swath of victims-cum-zombies just in the hospital alone, that reignites the crisis of six months ago. Suddenly, the smug Americans on rooftops have to break away from the peeping tom role they've been playing with rifle telescopes and do some serious shooting. But like the Iraq venture, the sharpshooting soon runs amok. A rooftop shooter named Doyle stops shooting, realizing the sharpshooters are now killing innocent citizens, unable to separate zombies from human beings.<br/><br/>Doyle teams up with Carlyle's two daughters who are now fleeing poison gas attacks and rockets from those American helicopters overhead, along with sniper fire from his brethren still atop the city's major buildings. One sniper pumps a bullet into the statue of Lord Wellington in Trafalgar Square as Big Ben strikes the hour. Its all low comedy to make sport of the American GI ignorance of British tradition and landmarks. <br/><br/>Doyle is killed but the two daughters escape to a Soccer stadium where Doyle's friend, a black helicopter pilot, brings them aboard and the craft wends its way out to sea over the White Cliffs of Dover. I can faintly hear the strains of Vera Lynn singing When the Lights Go On Again, as the Yanks, aided by the pluckier Brits, mount a quick counterattack and end the film.<br/><br/>28 weeks later isn't a great film, but its a sly dig at the Bush Administration and the Poodle Acquiescense of Tony Blair."
"tainan","8","0","1","21 May 2007"," First Ten Minutes Worth Price of Admission - A Classic Scene!
","Contains spoiler! <br/><br/>These days if even five minutes of a movie excite me then I feel it was worth the price of admission. The first ten minutes of ""28 weeks later"" are so emotionally wrenching and inventively exciting that I could have left the cinema a happy man there and then. The grinding darkness and the kinetic rawness reminded me a lot of Lucio Fulci's classic zombie movies. There is such a crushing bleakness about this scene that is becomes a cinematic recreation of the kind of horrible dream from which you wake with a heart wrenching sense of hopelessness - which is in many ways worse that a waking crisis because when you are conscious there is always a glimmer of hope. But not in the dark realms of sleep. <br/><br/>And so this emotionally draining first scene plays out as if directly streaming from our worst nightmare - and that sense of claustrophobic doom is beautifully compounded by a repeated musical theme that gets louder and more insistent as distorted guitar is added and the volume becomes almost unbearable. The re-introduction of this musical theme at moments of peak horror late in the movie is also reminiscent of Fulci movies - particularly as the theme is a full of desperate melancholy which amplifies beautifully the tragic situation that Robert Carlyle finds himself trapped in - forced to abandon his wife to the flesh eating hordes. The camera then follows him across the English countryside as he runs for his life. What a poignant image - the pastoral beauty of the English fields and the dark shadows of the undead. And then we have the sublime editing during the boat sequence as Carslisle fights off the zombies, with the boat spinning round and the music pounding to a head splitting climax. I was left breathless and dizzy. <br/><br/>It was like Zombie Flesh Eaters all over again for the first time. Nothing later in the movie came close to this. I had ten minutes of heaven - worth the price of admission - and if I can take away just ten minutes of revitalizing, vibrant, inspired cinema that's more than I expect from most multiplex movies these days."

I love the concept behind the films - that its a virus and not some sort of weird radiation or something (please no hatemail from Romero fans, as I greatly enjoy NotLD and his other zombie films). For a summer film, in which we seem to expect SO MUCH, the sort of...almost minimalist feel to these 28... movies is refreshing. However...something about the movie as a whole just sort of fell flat for me. Maybe its because its a sequel and its sort of ingrained into my mind that sequels RARELY EVER live up to the originals or what it is but...I just liked the first film better. There were almost Blair-Witch-like scenes where the camera was jostled about and everything was shaky and I just wasn't into that at all. It was almost nauseating. Still, it had its good points. The opening sequence of the film in the farm house with Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack and the other survivors is quite tense and very enjoyable. I give it a solid 7."

The camera is so jerky and the editing so rapid that you can't even tell who is getting killed or how they are getting killed. I think an infected person just vomited blood on somebody, but I'm not sure.

Not as frightening and edgy as Days but packs a lot more in, plenty of George A Romero influences when George still knew how to direct a Zombie film... sorry George but Land of the Dead was an abomination.<br/><br/>Like it's predecessor, the pace is fast, furious and slams into your face like a hammer. A short lull to calm the nerves is soon dispelled aa the crazed, bloodied teeth, crunching bones and terrifying screams of pain and rage claw at your pummelled senses. <br/><br/>You like classic Romero, 28 Days Later & Dawn of the Dead remake then you'll love this :D"
"rb716488","8","0","2","19 May 2007"," As good as a horror sequel can possibly be
","Being a huge fan of the first installment, I eagerly anticipated 28 weeks later. The movie starts with a highly suspenseful and terrific introduction that lets the audience know they wont be disappointed. After that, it slows down dramatically for about a half an hour. This interim while slow, serves the purpose of introducing the audience to the main characters, and there are quite a lot of them... <br/><br/>In fact, I was unable to identify the protagonist of the movie. At first I thought it was Robert Carlyle's character, then Sgt. Doyle, then the very attractive medical officer, then Perrineau's character, then the boy, then the girl... and now that I have seen the entire movie, I still have no clue who the main character was. Perhaps this is a flaw in the plot, or perhaps it served to make the movie unique. I personally feel that the director intended for this to happen.<br/><br/>Acting wise, the movie definitely delivered. The action and gore far surpassed the original as virtually all horror sequels do. There were several plot holes that I noticed, but I was willing to overlook them as the plot overall wasn't too bad. It was a little over the top at times, but in general, the plot was fairly clever and easy to follow. <br/><br/>The movie was quite suspenseful with several shocking 'hearattack' moments. But it seemed to lack the underlying subtle terror that the original had. There was really nothing all that groundbreaking either. This film certainly didn't have the edge that 28 days later had but it made up for it with superior special effects and a more distinguished cast. While I really liked this movie as well as the original, I hope that there will not be a 3rd or 4th installment. I feel like it will only get much worse from here and the clever story, unique filming techniques, and everything else that made these two films solid will only get more mundane with another sequel. But be that as it may, a 28 months later seems all but inevitable."

","I saw this film last night and was so disappointed after being so impressed with the first film.<br/><br/>I won't put any spoilers here as someone else refers to the bigger plot holes and silly set ups in their comment, but I simply have to get of my chest how bored I was.<br/><br/>The first 30 mins or so were actually very good as it is set during the initial outbreak and has some decent characters and has a more personal feel to the situation. Then we cut to 28 weeks later and there is just so much talking rubbish, silly plot devices and boredom. No real characters are followed, the two children don't really do anything and are only the main characters because they repeatedly kill off anyone else who speaks.<br/><br/>THe camera work was terrible and over the top with the hand held grainy look. There was too much darkness, not just shadowy eerie darkness, but just plain downright blackness! Without any suitable eerie sounds because all you could hear was gunshots or LOUD POUNDING MUSIC! I just wasn't scared or interested.<br/><br/>Several people walked out of the showing but I only stayed because my girlfriend doesn't like watching half a film."

","I went into the theatres expecting to see a competent horror film (after all, it had been rated a 7.8 by the venerable IMDb voters at the time). To its credit, the movie starts off captivating. It begins with a cool follow up to the previous movie, which then makes you ask the question: how will the rage virus make its come-back? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is less than fulfilling. What follows are trite, illogical horror movie plot devices that would never, under any circumstance happen in real life. There was one point where I almost walked out of the theatre (when the son zig zags to fool the sniper, then sees his father). I've seen some bad/stupid movies before, and I've never felt like walking out of a movie so bad.<br/><br/>There were just so many stupid things happening to actually be able to enjoy this movie. I really wish it turned out good, as I kinda liked the first one. Plus, the movie was set up extremely well, and the writers just kinda threw it all away with the way they chose to bring the virus back.<br/><br/>Anyway, I tried not to spoil the horrible plot for those of you who still want to see it. Basically, if you generally don't like horror movies (regardless of if you enjoyed 28 Days Later), do not see this."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","1","16 May 2007"," As far as sequels go; it's impressive. Just don't expect anything too groundbreaking given the state of horror films these days.
","Five years after one of the most original horror films, arguably ever, was made; 28 Weeks Later does things most sequels don't do and that's manage to hold its own when compared to the first film. It does this through a series of conventions that hit and miss the mark.<br/><br/>Some things I was happy with, others I was not so impressed with. I was pleased that the basics were kept intact. Often a new director means new ideas or taking existing ones and messing around with them. Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, from Spain, hadn't had much work before he did this film but he'll get the jobs he probably deserves now. Fresnadillo has kept everything that made 'the infected' as creepy as they were in 28 Days Later as well as giving us a refreshing, 'return to the scene of the crime' feel as London gets an attempt at re-population now that Britain has become one massive ghost town. The empty shots of London have been recycled and have once again, worked very effectively; only this time with CGI being put to good use for a change.<br/><br/>28 Days Later is one of my favourite films and reasons for this include its atmosphere and its look. Although the idea of shooting on DV right up until the final scenes have been banished; 28 Weeks Later still manages to retain that eerie, dark and noticeably un-easy look its predecessor also had. This is put across using a string of close ups in numerous scenes, lingering camera work, delaying the inevitable to the point of minor frustration and actually having a scene in total pitch black to the characters that we can only witness through a night vision lens in the point-of-view format.<br/><br/>What also works is the way the film builds up the character of Don (Robert Carlyle) and his family, giving off a feeling of family ties/familiarity before completely changing suit and going with the kids and the survivors once the initial incident happens. This is quite similar to Hitchcock's tactic he used in Psycho (1960) when the character of Marion Crane was built up to the point the film centred around her; before changing its drive and going down a different route.<br/><br/>What I didn't like too much was the way the film has that oddly familiar feeling that most other modern day horrors have. Yes, it's a sequel to 28 Days Later which immediately gives it 'cred'. but the use of over the top (and extremely unnecessary) gore as well as the fast paced, all action second third the film threatened to succumb to was disappointing as most modern day horror films often give in to the temptation of having style over content. Some of the scenes I'm referring to are: when a sniper is pinning them down in the streets (when he should have been air evacuated minutes earlier) and when a certain character becomes infected and acts in an ultra-violent manner towards someone else yet when another character sees him at the end of a street later on; he doesn't run to attack them (like someone infected should do) but merely disappears. These things aren't ghosts; they're as close to zombies as you can get and can't vanish out of thin air.<br/><br/>What's also disappointing is it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously at times. Some scenes have flaws behind them and merely act as excuses for action (the sniper scene like I said and the fact the boy near the beginning states he was being chased yet nobody thought the infected would eventually arrive, thus attacking the place they were holed up in) which is a shame as in 28 Days Later; each action and event the characters did on their seemingly endless journey nearly always had a problem that had to be dealt with.<br/><br/>Also, the new Wembley stadium pops up in a painfully obvious attempt to identify some modern day iconography. In ten years no one will probably care or even notice but the clue is in the title, Mr. Screenwriter: '28 Weeks Later'; the film is still taking place in 2002 or 2003. The scene in Wembley was unnecessary as it could've happened in any open space or park; I mean, come on; even the goal posts were set up and ready! On the whole, 28 Weeks Later is a good film that provides scares, thrills and some excellent cinematography. Just don't be too put off by the flaws and frustrations."
"foxdie-uk","5","0","3","16 May 2007"," Insults the original...
","I'll try and be unbiased seeing as I wasn't caught up in the original hype of the first movie. However I do respect the ability of the producers of 28 days later to bind together a very low budget film that created almost cult status. So you can understand why 28 weeks later was highly anticipated among its dedicated followers.<br/><br/>First off, I could never understand why the first was so popular, under normal circumstances I felt the story was empty, and the characters bland. But for some reason you could interact with the emotions, the scenery and the behaviour. A large amount of the first film was pararamic views of the empty English towns and countryside, a shocking look into your back garden in a disturbing parallel universe playing out in front of you. All these things together meant it differed itself from your dawn of the dead, and resident evil's etc.<br/><br/>So how did the second go so wrong? Well, it all went wrong when they decided to give this film a budget they didn't need and actors too big for the role. I found the film getting more and more cringe worthy as the story stretched beyond the reality the first had created. The fact is when this film finished I was more interested in debating the similarities of 28 weeks later and resident evil two, which was the same film in a different location, and unfortunately as far mindless zombie frag fests go, resident evil 2 was a far superior film, which as it goes is not saying a lot for 28WL.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away. Producers have introduced the Americans (big sigh) into series in an attempt to re-colonise a small porton of London. Unfortunately as you can imagine there is an outbreak which is caused by a predictable carrier/host ploy, unfortunately the lack of judgment on the Americans causes outright chaos  least its realistic in some aspect. At times the mixed scenes went from a blend of frustrating blair witch project to all out action black hawk down, which was never going to work. That with the overly inflated action sequences seriously re-wrote to rules on reality, which was one of the biggest aspects, and an integral part of the first film. And if you tilted your head sideways and squinted it could be a political statement against the current occupation of Iraq and their failure to control the environment. The end is open to a third film, but I doubt any producer could put this movie back on track.<br/><br/>Overall I found the film lacking, the exaggerated Hollywood action sequences distracting from the point of the first movie. If you've got a night in with the lads you've got your guns and your fit bird. But as a sequel to a cult status British film it fails on ALL levels.<br/><br/>5/10 - mainly because its better than watching repeats of the Simpson's - just."
"refresh_daemon","6","0","2","15 May 2007"," Very good at one thing that matters in horror films: intensity
","Well, I guess I can tolerate the use of ""28 Weeks"" in the title of this film to keep it in line with its predecessor. And overall, it follows its predecessor pretty well, even adding on heaps more suspense throughout the film. In fact, I would have to say this is perhaps the most suspenseful and anxiety-inducing film I've seen in a while. And that's a good thing.<br/><br/>In fact, the opening sequence to this film is so packed with nervous intensity, even though nothing out-of-the-ordinary is happening, that I had to grip the seat in front of me out release some of the anticipation. Because you know of the first film, 28 Days Later, you know that you can't have a peaceful cottage anywhere. Rage-zombies will attack. And it will not be pretty. But the players and the direction handle that anxiety so well, that I was still quick shocked by the ferocity of the following events.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Weeks manages to avoid the pitfall of Days, that is trying to hold two separate overarching stories at the seams. On the minus side, major plot/story contrivances had me smacking my head in shock and ridicule. That and the overall point of the film is quite, uh, disagreeable. Days managed to tell a zombie apocalypse story very well, but then went into a story about how humanity can be real monsters as well. The switch wasn't very good, but each story holds together well. Weeks tells basically one story of running away from rage-zombies. It could've been that simple and effective, but some things just didn't sit well with me.<br/><br/>Without going into detail, certain characters survive when it wouldn't make any sense for them to, and appear in places where by their very appearance, they create a contrivance in the story. Furthermore, the plans of the U.S. Military in crisis situation only partially made sense. Some of the situations created were highly unbelievable and the story had to permit these unbelievable events in order to move forward. But it unfortunately took me out of the film long enough, wondering why things were done that way, that the intensity of the following efforts (that is, the last 2/3 of the film) lost their magic.<br/><br/>That's not to say that there weren't moments of genius in the film. I loved the use of darkness and light and a more integrated theme of how humanity can be a big monster. There was at least one set piece in the film that I'd already seen in Grindhouse's Planet Terror piece, which contrasted a little strongly with the otherwise tense zombie escape.<br/><br/>The ending further lost me because of how it contradicted many of the events and dialogue in the film. And it's clearly a setup for 28 Months Later, but I suppose being a horror movie, you just had to do something like that. Unfortunately, the ending also cements a series of messages embedded in the film that I found highly disconcerting. These include: authority is always right, never give too much power to the people, life is expendable, life can and should be extinguished to protect the greater public even if innocent, never trust your human instinct to protect others, children are only trouble, among other messages. Weeks is a very nihilistic film and I found that as I watched it and processed the underlying messages behind the events of the film, I disliked it more and more.<br/><br/>Still, the film has many merits, including managing to keep the intensity up through the course of the film. It has a powerful sense of menace--you never feel safe during the film, even when the characters appear to be safe. And, in the end, it is very good at doing what horror films do best: instill fear, doubt, dread, shock and terror. It just has to resort to a little contrivance along the way to keep it going. And say some things that I didn't like, but were woven into the situations that were set up. I honestly think that with some smallish changes in the story, entirely more agreeable messages could've come from the story.<br/><br/>But as it is, it's a very competent shockfest that doesn't suffer from the slowdown of its predecessor. An aggressive story about running away from rage-zombies. And if you're looking for intensity and the gore, this is a good place to go. Just try to ignore the occasional bits of stupidity. 7/10."
"CaptSC","6","0","2","15 May 2007"," A decent sequel
","I liked 28 Days Later because I have not seen any ""Zombie"" flickes before (I know they aren't technically zombies but whatever), but the scale of the movie was cool.<br/><br/>The opening scenes with the main character waking up and walking through an empty city were just brilliant. And it followed up with several strong characters and some good action.<br/><br/>For the most part, 28 Weeks Later is successful. It has rightfully been compared to the Alien and Aliens style of sequel.<br/><br/>If you have watched any trailers, you will know that the movie is taking place 28 weeks later, and the U.S. military is trying to repopulate England. Of course, this is not successful, and the ""Rage"" virus comes back with a vengeance.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized for the ""shaky-camera"" syndome, and in my opinion the ""shaky"" thing takes away from the movie. I want to see what is going on, what that zombie is doing to that person, etc., instead of seeing blurs of body parts and people moving around.<br/><br/>There are several really awesome cinematic shots, and the acting is decent for most of the movie.<br/><br/>In case you were hoping to see the cast from 28 Days Later reappear you will be disappointed, because no one returns. One thing I did like in 28 Weeks Later was that the military wasn't portrayed as bad as in the first movie.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you saw the first one see it, but if you didn't and don't want to pony up for a rental for 28 Days Later, it might be worth your time if you like Zombie or Survival type movies."

It held my attention throughout and the acting was decent. Robert Carlyle was his usual excellent self though he wasn't stretched all that much except in the scene where he has to tell the kids what happened to their mother - he was brilliant.

","28 weeks Later was a fine sequel to an equally good 28 Days Later. It is not too often that a sequel matches the first film, but I would say 28 Weeks does just that.<br/><br/>A portion of London, with help from the American military, has been quarantined off from the rest of the world. It has been cleaned of all the infected, and is a place where normal people can adjust to somewhat normal lives again. However something happens, you will have to see the movie to find out, and a mistake leads to the once clean area being overrun again by those infected with the Rage Virus which started it all in the first movie.<br/><br/>Where 28 Days Later moved slowly and built tension with interesting characters, 28 Weeks Later starts out fast with one of the best scenes in the entire movie, and never really lets up for its duration. The acting was well done and the pacing phenomenal. I actually cared about the characters this time around as well, and this will usually lead to good things.<br/><br/>Some people have complained that the rapid moving camera angles were a little nauseating, but I found that these scenes added to the chaos of the film and helped the quick fire pace that, among many others things, was one of this movie's strong points. The beginning of the film used this the most effectively, but the other scenes weren't bad either.<br/><br/>28 Days Later was not the perfect horror film, but it was one of the best of its kind. 28 Weeks Later, in my opinion, was its equal. Yeah there were some things I found hard to believe. Like how the two teenagers managed to escape the quarantine, and how the infection was finally able to spread, but I can forgive the movie these small things because the bigger and better things far outweigh them. Go see it. It's well worth it."
"Craig-9","9","0","2","15 May 2007"," Not as good as the original, but not as bad as some of these posts would have you believe.
","I love movies like this--downbeat, end-of-the-world, apocalyptic, hopeless films. And _28 Weeks Later_ is pessimistic in spades. It is also one of the bloodiest films I've seen in some time. Sure, it's hard to follow up a blazingly original movie with an effective sequel (_Aliens_ is one of the few successes), but this movie is a lot better than the haters would have you believe. I've read reviews that take the film to task for its alleged plot holes. For example, the ease with which the two kids escape the quarantine zone and head for home. Does no one recall the American sniper who sees them leave, reports it in, and the helicopter and bio-suited soldiers waiting for them when they step out of their house? Or the lax security measures surrounding the mother, a carrier of the disease but not affected by it? The American head of medical quarantine has only just confirmed that the woman is indeed infected, causing the general in charge to set off for the woman's room with the intention of killing her. All of this is happening at the same time that Robert Carlyle, the guilty father/husband is sneaking in to see his wife. Granted, he probably shouldn't have an all-access pass that allows him in, but the point is, they haven't at this point confirmed that she's infected yet. So the lack of security measures is not necessarily a fault. Once the infection takes hold and begins to spread, the movie becomes a roller-coaster ride that never lets up. My only gripe was when the helicopter starts shooting at the car as it drives down London streets--if a car is moving, that means someone is alive in there and that someone is normal and uninfected. So why shoot? The ""shoot everything"" directive makes sense at first in the big crowd, where the soldiers can't tell who is and is not infected. But after that, it doesn't make a lot of sense (which also leads to the completely unnecessary death by fire of Jeremey Renner's character). As with the first movie, I loved the scenes of a silent, empty London. Do you have any idea how difficult it was to shoot those? London is one of the world's busiest and most populous metropolises, so it's amazing to have those shots of silent, empty streets. I liked the ending, too. Hopefully, there will be a third movie in this series that will extend the story. Now that the infection has escaped the relative isolation of the UK, the potential for true terror has just been realized."
"samseescinema","8","0","2","14 May 2007"," Now this is the way to do a sequel.
","28 Weeks Later reviewed by Samuel Osborn<br/><br/>Now this is the way to do a sequel. 28 Weeks Later draws a terrific blueprint for future horror sequels to follow. As usual, it wasn't possible to bring on board the original director (Danny Boyle of Trainspotters fame) and the original writer (Alex Garland) to work on the sequel to 28 Days Later. Instead, the two worked as producers and found an apt replacement: Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. Not many saw Fresnadillo's startling feature debut, Intacto, but those who did remember it well. Intacto was compelling, dark, and precisely intelligent. The same adjectives can quite fittingly be glued upon Fresnadillo's second feature film, 28 Weeks Later.<br/><br/>The sequel fortunately doesn't require audiences to have seen the original. Days have turned to weeks and the story of Cillian Murphy's survival in posthumous England is finished; not continued maybe because of reasons similar to the non-return of Mr. Boyle and Mr. Garland. Anyway, 28 Weeks Later brings us up to speed with a concise recap of England's resuscitation by United States and NATO forces. The infected (i.e. Zombies) have been cleared of the island and citizens are slowly being allowed entry into what is called District 1. The United States Army inhabits this region, beginning what is a modest allegory running parallel to the present war in Iraq. The first children allowed into District 1 are Tammy and Andy (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton), rejoining their father after separation due to the infection. Their father, Don (Robert Carlyle), we learn through the grisly opening sequence, is a selfish twerp who abandoned his wife for the sake of his singular survival. But as a peculiarity in his wife's genetic ordering renders her semi-immune to the zombies' virus, the importance of his children's safety becomes a priority to the United States Army. Without giving too much away, this peculiarity sets off a reaction that brings the virus into District 1's core, causing another gory eruption of glorious, limb-tearing zombie violence. <br/><br/>The plot, like in any horror sequel, requires the help of a league of peripheral characters to shore up the holes and contrivances it leaves leaking. Along with the children, there are the parents, the scientists, the Army commanders and the snipers for the screenplay to shadow as the infection pierces the confines of District 1. Luckily, Fresnadillo and his writers shrug off most of the symptoms of sequelitis, leaving only a couple glaring plot conveniences that are cause for unintentional laughter. (Explaining these plot hiccups would spoil some hearty surprises). For the most part they manage to find cleverly plausible situations for all these characters to inhabit, each setting off a reaction for the other to deal with, making for a high velocity of smart storytelling. <br/><br/>As in the original, the scares come as frequently as the action, with both Mr. Boyle and Mr. Fresnadillo allowing the suspense to open the throttle onto full-fledged chases and action spectacles. There's no reliance on cats jumping out of dark closets and no reliance on nauseating, bucket-filling gore. His scares are clever and always compelling. The camera is continuously hand-held, finding the candid beauty in all the Zombie-fleeing and sometimes also finding honest emotion in the characters' stories. <br/><br/>About the same time I screened 28 Weeks Later I was close to finishing Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer-winning novel The Road. The book is another riff on post apocalyptic survival, a theme apparently at the forefront of pop culture's psyche. McCarthy rendered his characters subject to their environment, characters without control over their destiny, no plot convenience to allow them redemption. The novel is devastating and soulful, exciting and terrifying. 28 Weeks Later relies on convenience no more so than any other Zombie picture, but the convenience is still contrivance. The film kneels at the feet of spectacle; required to find shortcuts to flare reactions and achieve emotional benchmarks. It is more important that we don't see two zombies killed by the same means; creative extermination is more important than any character evolution. <br/><br/>But the comparison is maybe unfair. What is at stake artistically isn't much to 28 Weeks Later. The bottom line is still a zombie and his appetite. Except, both works employ similar devices to conjure realism: Fresnadillo's hand-held camera is the same as McCarthy's non-usage of punctuation. They're clever immersion tricks. Each auteur wants us to believe wholly in their world, zombie or not. 28 Weeks Later is near to such success as The Road, though hampered by its purpose as spectacle. The spectacle, after all is told, is still spectacular, however undeserving it may be. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"
"Chris Knipp","8","0","2","14 May 2007"," Wise and weird and scary
","In '28 Weeks Later' Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have stepped back and produced, consigning the sequel-making task to a Spaniard, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, of the ""wildly precocious"" 2001 ""cerebral occult thriller"" 'Intacto.' With his several co-authors, Fresnadillo has turned away from '28 Days Later's' sci-fi (though there's still a hopeless apocalyptic vision; but is that sci-fi any more?) to moral and political levels of blunt allegory, while still playing with the fate of an England besieged by the high-energy Rage zombie virus. Perhaps a hyper-kinetic zombie is a bit of an oxymoron; one remembers the good joke of Edgar Wright's 'Shaun of the Dead' that the north of England chaps wandering the streets of his film are so downbeat and sluggish zombies pass among them unnoticed. But the Rage virus is a thing for our times. These new zombies burn themselves out in an infectious fit of techno-mad impatience, A.D.D.'ed to the nth degree.<br/><br/>There were always betrayals within a family under zombie attack, and anybody who crosses over is a double-crosser, but what about a husband and father in a big house outside London under zombie attack who simply loses it and runs off to save himself, leaving his equally terrified wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) behind? Robert Carlyle, who has played Hitler since his stint as Daffy in 'The Beach' and who has a perpetually pained expression, has the role of this coward dad, Don. His young son and daughter, Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots), miraculously survive. But you'll never trust your mother or father again, and Andy and Tammy's parents combine physical and moral infection. In this highly suggestive story line, the sickness that infects the family and the corruption of the state are of a piece.<br/><br/>The infection of the personal level continues with a medical officer in charge, US Maj. Scarlet (Rose Byrne), who wants to save these siblings not because they're rather sweet but because she believes they may have a rare gene resistant to the Rage virus.<br/><br/>The political, which is to say military, level of '28 Weeks' is much more complicated and makes less sense till you hear one thing: the separated-off center of London -- guarded and controlled by the American military -- is called The Green Zone.<br/><br/>Thus the 28-week declaration that England is ""free of infection"" matches the idiocy and folly of George W. Bush's premature declaration of ""Mission Accomplished."" Why are Tammy and Andy, the only children allowed back in the country after lifting quarantine, able to sneak out at evening when the Zone is locked down, grab keys from a corpse in a pizza shop and ride a delivery motorcycle out to their old house? The same reason why everything was allowed to go haywire and looters had free reign after the US invaded Baghdad: S.N.A.F.U. Who's in charge? Nobody thinking with his head. Green Zone indeed.<br/><br/>Once there is re-infection, the black C.O. doesn't want to protect the siblings with the rare genes. That would be thinking too far ahead. Genes, smenes: everybody goes down. So, now that a new infection has appeared (always within this little family; the neat story construction requires no more), the snipers are called out. What's the point of shooting everybody in sight down there? Because it's a Red Alert: enough said. It's the rainbow sign. No more water: the fire next time. Why shoot everybody, friendlies and bad guys alike? Because the C.O. says so. S.O.P.= S.N.A.F.U. The only thing that's missing from this movie are Shiites and Sunnis and Blackwater.<br/><br/>Why fire-bomb the whole area when that won't work because people/monsters can still get out of the Green Zone? Same reason, every time.<br/><br/>This film has its share of fresh effects, including the sight of masses of fleeing people being enveloped with shooting flame. Hey presto: firestorm, as the late Kurt Vonnegut put it. Fresnadillo & Co. handle their tasks with relish and panache, and in the process evoke Dresden and Tokyo and, with its hovering helicopter, Mogadiscio and 'Black Hawk Down'. There is a conventional good-guy Delta sniper Doyle (Jeremy Renner), who's human enough to abandon his post and help the innocent, and he gets torched for his trouble. That kind of outcome, as well as the few swaying hulks, is a lingering tribute to Romero. But the manic kinetic energy of those possessed with the Rage virus is at such a high pitch this time those old fashioned shots of backyards full of looming, lurching zombie hulks are no longer to be seen (go back to 'Shaun of the Dead' for a good one). Instead, '28 Weeks,' as Nathan Lee comments in his admiring review, is great at balancing high and low, public and intimate, aerial shots with bloody in-your-face slam-bang close-ups. The sequence where Maj. Scarlet guides Tammy and Andy down through a big darkened Tube station knee-deep in infected corpses using an automatic weapon's night scope is wonderfully ghoulish and icky.<br/><br/>'28 Weeks Later' makes a metaphorical virtue of every conventional narrative fault. Nothing makes sense? That's because the solution to the re-infection of Tony Blair's constituency is under the control of the American military he kowtowed to. The ""solution"" just makes everything worse and worse? What did you expect? <br/><br/>The last shot: on to Paris. (For some Freedom Fries, perhaps?) <br/><br/>Don't listen to any naysayers: this is a good one.<br/><br/>(Best reviews of the film: by cool-guys Walter Chaw at Film Freak Central and Nathan Lee in The Voice. Liked Chaw's tribute to Joe Carnahan's first film: ""Fresnadillo adopts the hand-held ethic of Boyle's picture and injects it with the energy of the vertiginous opening moments of 'Narc'."" Right on.)"
"mockturtle","6","0","2","14 May 2007"," Mayor of Zombiebridge
","First thing that needs saying is that this was much much much better than the average sequel, but no not as good as the original.<br/><br/>Do yourself a good turn: go rent ""The Claim"" by Michael Winterbottom, based on ""The Mayor of Casterbridge"" by Thomas Hardy and you'll see exactly how sly the overall template of this story is.<br/><br/>Fresnadillo does not quite equal his fascinating ""Intacto"" but his stuff is sure worth watching and will undoubtedly stay that way.<br/><br/>Nice to see Stringer Bell and Augustus Hill, Danny Boyle must watch HBO.<br/><br/>Okay, the compliments out of the way, there are so many coincidences in this movie and the mechanics so poorly fumbled (not the cinematics, those are uniformly excellent) that it was hard to appreciate the morality play. Is there some sort of zombie telepathic APB? Why would they all know to go to Regent's Park? How could Robert Carlyle follow a speeding Volvo all around London? If the mother is infected and not cleared from quarantine yet would she maybe have 1 guard? Why would they put all of the civilians in an area that isn't actually secure? It's all lazy plot mechanics.<br/><br/>Now. I know everyone has fun with the topical story: nuclear family, US army, blah blah blah. Look further into it. If these two stupid kids never left the safe zone the mother never would have been found and the virus would be over. If the good people trying to get a cure for the virus figured out they were allowing the kid to bring the virus to the outside world, the virus would be over. It's almost like the Lars von Trier film ""Epidemic"" where a doctor goes around trying to fight a plague that he is carrying around with him unknowingly. A little compassion goes a long way to ending the world. People have been asking on here: would you kill 10 people to save 1000? Well would you kill 10 to save 1? If these people accepted that they should be purged for the safety of humanity, humanity wouldn't die. And the girl (Ms. Poots, teehee) knows her brother has an infection that can cause what she's seen but she doesn't want to admit her worldview is flawed, her selfishness dooms the world.<br/><br/>The two kids are completely selfish and stupid, they get person after person killed and don't care a whit, then they get everyone killed and don't care. They are reunited with their father and don't really care (and call him a janitor), they blame him for their mother without knowing one way or another just because they're brats. I guess it's appropriate these are the people that would be the cause of the apocalypse.<br/><br/>Now that's over: having Carlyle become a zombie then was really excellent and shocking. Way to go.<br/><br/>Problem with this one is that the zombies in Romero still have some kind of inner world beyond zombiehood and these ones don't (and screw you, they're zombies). So you can't really have Muggleston (is that his real name?) grow up to be the Dune Zombie Messiah in 28 months later, they don't really have the potential; but it's still cool that they run.<br/><br/>Just like in the Spielberg ""War of the Worlds"" it is always interesting to see our view of exactly how quickly everything everywhere could go to hell."

","28 weeks later, England is declared free of infection and rebuilding has begun. People are being shipped in from overseas under the protection of the United States Army to repopulate the island, and among them is young Andy and his sister Tammy, who were away on an overseas class trip while their parents were stuck in a cottage fighting off zombies. Once the kids get on the island, though, infection re-emerges (in a contrived but reasonable way) and the action is on.<br/><br/>28 Days Later could be said to be about a man who built himself a family and, when his family was attacked, defended it. 28 Weeks Later is sort of a mirror-reversal diptych of that concept, instead showing two children survive a dysfunctional and fragile family, but ultimately spreading their discontent into the future. 28 Weeks Later can't match up to Days' cinematography and mood, but the music far surpasses the original, and it holds true to the way the first film showed what people like that would do in a situation like that. In fact, 28 Weeks Later was very daring in being direct in how the characters in it deal with their respective situations, especially when it involves the military, considering how popular anti-militantism is right now.<br/><br/>However, the movie serves up a big enough serving of contrivances to make it, unfortunately, that lesser sequel that we expect. No, 28 Weeks Later is nowhere near as good as the original. But it's still a decent film, and even though it has an annoying tendency to provide easy exits for characters in awkward contexts, it also has such moments as the helicopter-blade-meets-zombie-horde scene, the beauty of which will bring tears of happiness to the eyes and eternal love to the hearts of every zombie-movie fan in the world.<br/><br/>So sit back and enjoy this next serving, and hope along with me that the bad cliffhanger ending will at least lead to some more movies that hold to the values of cinematography, post-rock music, and familial survivalism nature of the previous films.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"markrichley","8","0","2","13 May 2007"," Not so much a sequel, but more of a fan-fiction-satisfyer-thingymajig
","28 Days Later's eerie quietness and artistic license have not made it into 28 weeks later - maybe they were busy making other films? That's not to say that 28 weeks later didn't scare me at times.<br/><br/>The idea of the film was wonderful. Britain is given clear status and an efficient repopulation programme goes underway. The survivors are taken to the Canary Wharf area, guarded by a lot of American firepower that disappears at some point. The survivors are checked for illness and re-housed. The Americans musn't know that the virus started from a banana-starved chimpy, they think it only infects humans.<br/><br/>Two teenage girls (sorry, the boy looked like a girl and the whole cinema agreed) go to their old house, outside of the safe zone. There they discover their mother hiding. She was bitten by the infected but only carries the disease. The idiot military decides it's a sterling idea to take her into the middle of the green zone, and to not guard her. Her surviving husband, finds her and kisses her.<br/><br/>He becomes infected, and overcomes some slow-witted soldiers. Of course in that situation when you saw an infected man running towards you, you wouldn't shoot him, but you'd get in for a closer look.<br/><br/>The Americans lock all the British in a car park, complete with a stunningly strong front door, and a kitchen door at the back. The infected man runs in through the weak, unguarded door, and jumps on top of his daught....son. His son is somehow unhurt and runs.<br/><br/>The British are running for their lives and becoming infected. Since it is night-time the Americans decide that it'd be a lovely idea to turn off the lights, just so everyone can see what they're doing with no problems. A warm-hearted soldier then agrees to help some uninfected escape, and leads them out of the green zone before it is firebombed.<br/><br/>This is where you see the US command forces watching the explosion, but not dying. You never see anything of them after that. God only knows why.<br/><br/>So, now we're left with an American sniper, a scientist who is determined to save the two girls...yes, I know, because they are somehow only carrying the virus, and a couple of token characters to make it look more believable.<br/><br/>The American soldier and scientist come to quick and sticky ends. You'd think that they make it to the end - one minute they're strong, and the next minute they're dead.<br/><br/>Running from the American firepower, the girls end up in the London Underground Station where that nice man in the film Creep lives. What with it being pitch black and smelly because of corpses and all, they decide that it would be grand to go down to platform level. The infected have already had that idea though, you see them running for the tube long before this. They have common sense, you see, to take the tube and use their oyster cards - it helps you catch up with the uninfected so much faster, provided you don't have to change trains.<br/><br/>The kids are on the platform, after stepping on a mound of bodies on the escalators. The younger kid is then confronted by 'its' father, who managed to get all the way from Canary Wharf to Charing Cross by himself! It then comes to the elder daughter to shoot her dear old dad, and the two make it to Wembley Stadium, where a commander had agreed to meet his late friend in his helicopter.<br/><br/>The two girls arrive there alone and the seemingly one-remaining soldier flies them to Paris, despite their bloodshot eyes etc etc etc.<br/><br/>In my mind this leaves Britain safe, and continental Europe, Asia and Africa doomed. We see brief shots of infected French people racing through the Metro stations towards the Eiffel Tower, and the story stops, at least for another five years until they decide to make 28 months later, or 28 years later or something like that.<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDS The film was well made, and gave the fans what they wanted to know about the infected. The London Underground scene terrified me - that somebody was stupid enough to go down there in the first place. Clever scenes included Trafalgar Square, with weeds growing out of the fountains and the grass in parks being too long - since 28 days later happened just after outbreak, that wasn't an issue. London really did look like it had been deserted for half a year! It would be interesting to see the next film, where everywhere from Paris to Shanghai, Oslo to Cape Town, Moscow to Kuwait City was infected - although North Korea would probably be safe, what with not letting anyone in and all. It would leave Australia, Japan, all-important Sri-Lanka, and the Americas uninfected. Tuvalu will have sunk by then. Sorry.<br/><br/>The atmosphere wasn't the same as the first film. It felt completely removed from Jim and Selena - it would have been so good to see them being rescued and interviewed and all. Reading a preview review, I believed there was a scene in the Channel of people racing to Europe to survive but being shot down - that wasn't in the film.<br/><br/>If you're going to see it, get there 20 minutes before the film starts because the cinemas are packed at the moment. We had to sit at the back right on the side so the speakers were right in our ears. If you're going to buy a hot dog or something, get it eaten within a couple of minutes - I happened to scare the lady next to me when she saw ketchup on my face.<br/><br/>That's about it."

","I loved Intacto,and 28 days later.This sucked!,the shaky-cam that was so effective and used sparingly in the first was overused and annoyingly jarring...it wasn't scary. The over graining of the film,the texture of it was again overused and distracted from the film.The firebombing sequence was the best,especially the infected still attacking each other whilst on fire. The new 'intelligence' hinted at via Roberts character was weak and ineffective,in fact the film would have been far better if he had survived and was on the run with the kids. The first film I have on DVD and can watch again and again...this I'm not even gonna bother with it."
"jzappa","7","0","2","13 May 2007"," A Digression From The Original
","28 Weeks Later has a wonderful beginning. Before anything happens, there is already a quiet tension, a talent being displayed masterfully by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, the director in place of Danny Boyle for this sequel. There is great intensity and great moral conflict presented with Robert Carlyle's character. But then, as the film progresses, there is not much more that can be said about it.<br/><br/>Yes, when the inevitable gorefest begins again, there are some truly intense and disturbing sequences of rage-infected people and their attacks. Without spoiling anything, one of them involves a single bound person and an infected person's singular, fixated brutalization, and another involves a mass of people locked in a pitch black corridor with a growing number of infected people, the attack being in the dark with occasional flickers of light presenting only two or three frames of horrifying images. However, Fresnadillo becomes too reliant on strobing slow motion and grandiose computerized explosion effects, all of which are a bit dull, with the exception of a later sequence involving a helicopter's blades against a field of rage-infecteds.<br/><br/>The violence continues without relief and with a completely morbid atmosphere, and if it were not kicking to the side so many themes and strands, wrapping them up so quickly once the expository portion of the film ended, it would seem handled better. Unfortunately, however, it all grows old and stale after awhile. There isn't much thought given to much of it after awhile. We hear the same dialogue, see the same sort of undeveloped characters, and see the same buckets of blood and gore that we've seen in countless other group-survival-oriented horror and disaster films.<br/><br/>Where is the allegory and paranoid awareness of the underbelly of humanity that the original film had that made it so far above the average sort of film, the genre of which I mentioned at the end of the last paragraph? This one even seems to abandon a part of the plot that is presented early on that seems very important.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining enough as a gorefest, a very gloomy, depressing one, but if you're expecting a sequel that lives up to the substance of the original, then don't bother. This is probably just going to turn into just another sloppy slasher franchise."
"come2whereimfrom","7","0","2","13 May 2007"," The Infected are back!
","With a slow opening that lulls you in to a false sense of security its not long before we are reintroduced to the infected, the super fast zombies we first met in 28 days later, and all chaos breaks loose. With a pumping soundtrack hordes of the infected attack a cottage where survivors were hiding. Later we are introduced to the only person not to be killed during that opening frenzy, Don (played by Robert Carlyle) who is now a caretaker in an American controlled area of London. It's at this point in the story that we are told that the virus is under control, wiped out and gone for good. As with any horror film worth its weight that is not the case and the infected are back and in the quarantine zone and it's down to the army to try and regain control. One part of that army is their doctor convinced that Don's children may hold a cure to the virus and along with a rogue soldier and some general public they have the task of getting the kids to safety in the face of not only the infected but also an army who believe they have lost control and declare code red, destroy everything. With a keener sense of where it is going compared to the first film the pacing is brilliant, the zombie action is upped and the effects are pretty top notch. There is a great scene in the underground done with night vision which is part 'Blair Witch' and part 'Most Haunted'. There are some not so obvious metaphors for the war on terror and even a thinly veiled 9/11 reference hidden amongst the violence and mayhem. Just like in the first film there are all the familiar sights of London all empty and abandoned adding to the bleakness of the overall feel. The only thing wrong with the film as a whole is the kids who can't act for toffee, I'm not sure why the boy was chosen but I'm guessing his on screen sister was chosen because if you squinted she looked a bit like a young Denise Richards. With a ending in a traditional style leaving it open if anyone wants to pick up the mantle and make another, its over and what you have seen is a good horror film. Not the best but much better than its predecessor."

","The first half of 28 Days Later was excellent, the second half was like an old Dr Who episode.<br/><br/>I had read some good reviews of 28 Weeks Later but I was sadly disappointed.<br/><br/>Technically its a good film. The initial scenes were certainly credible. The Isle of Dogs is turned in to a British version of the Green Zone and London makes a great backdrop.<br/><br/>Overall, better than Children of Men but not as good as Land of the Dead. I just could not see through the flaws in the plot.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** <br/><br/>The movie hypes up the security of Sector One but the kids are able to walk out.<br/><br/>The containment area for civilians is in the basement which is where the zombies are. The area is not guarded and someone forgets to lock the back door.<br/><br/>A US army sergeant deserts his post and is willing to shoot his colleagues to save complete strangers.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle bumps in to his kids in a dark tube station. He can't have followed them. Come on! <br/><br/>Finally if there are so few people left alive where do all the zombies come from? Sorry Danny and co but I won't be rushing to see 28 months later."

"OllieZ","7","0","4","13 May 2007"," Good sequel, not as good as the first.
","28 Weeks Later was a sequel I didn't want to see.<br/><br/>The first film was so good in my books, that the idea of a sequel would undermine the whole thing. Fortunately, this film is hugely enjoyable.<br/><br/>The set pieces are thumping; the first ten minutes is a relentless siege upon a survivors den. The editing is extremely fast, which hardly gives the viewer any time to see what's going on. You're either going to love this or hate this.<br/><br/>The story is pretty good, considering it's a sequel. It revolves around a family - the father (Robert Carlyle), a cowardly figure, who you can actually sympathise with; the daughter, who looks after her brother, who apparently have special blood. I won't spoil any of the film for you, but suffice to say, when the family enter the quarantined district, things get a little out of control.<br/><br/>The involvement of American troops is not exactly inspired, meaning that we get some very clichéd military speak, which undermines the whole urban grittiness of the first film. Still, the actors are good and some of the best action sequences come from the military side of things.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very good film. It sometimes meanders - the film wanders into gung-ho action flick mode sometimes. But that's not exactly a big quibble - if you want a really entertaining film to see this week, see this one."

Seemed a little minimum security for something so tragically important for the welfare of thousands of people or the world?

","Went to see this last night. Pretty good. It's just not the same kind of thing as 28 Days Later. Less of a ""smart people getting pulled in to a Lord Of The Flies type situation and human nature takes over"" and more of a conventional ""stupid people doing stupid things that totally screw up everything."" Danny Boyle's protégé did a good job of emulating his directing style, and Boyle directed some of the 2nd unit scenes -- so if you like the feel of the scenes in 28 Days, you should appreciate the new movie. But it's a different writer, and it shows.<br/><br/>At this point, I'm curious about Boyle and (28 Days writer) Alex Garland's sci-fi epic Sunshine -- which seems to playing in every country right now except the US and Canada!!"
