","I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)"

","I usually don't write reviews but saw mostly negative reviews on here so far and that ain't right.<br/><br/>It is not a perfect movie and it's not artsy, or profound. However it is very entertaining, has wide appeal, will make you laugh, have you on the edge of your seat and might even make you cry. It's a slow build at the beginning but the tension soon rises and you will then be hooked. The effects appear to be realistic and mostly practical made with a production value that appears to be one of the most expensive films ever made (which alone is impressive given it is not a sequel or superhero movie).<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg works as an everyman lead, but it is Kurt Russel who steals the show. Maybe the performance of his career, and the strongest aspect of the film in my opinion. Malkovich is also amazing as the villain, stealing every scene he is in. The two of them along with the incredible story done with top notch sets, effects and sound is exactly why you have to pay the money to see this on the biggest screen possible.<br/><br/>If you need a film to be a character study or you want senseless action from start to finish then you might be one of the people who is disappointed. But if you are looking for a gripping story with great tension and action that can be enjoyed by a wide range then go see this film."
"lnvicta","7","103","138","1 October 2016"," Gripping and realistic, Deepwater Horizon works both as an enlightening documentary and a fun blockbuster.
","Deepwater Horizon is a movie that succeeds on two levels: as an action-packed blockbuster and as an honest depiction of a tragic disaster. It's the story of the BP oil rig that exploded and contaminated the Gulf of Mexico. The way Berg directs the sequence of events is well paced and purposefully developmental for a good chunk of the movie. It takes about 45 minutes before the crap hits the fan, during which we're allowed time to get to know the characters - their quirks, their personalities - so we can empathize with their situation. The stakes feel real, as they should (and were), which is a testament to the directing and the acting. Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell dominate in their roles, Russell given the opportunity to remind us why he's one of the biggest stars ever. The supporting cast is excellent, including John Malkovich, Gina Rodriguez, and Dylan O'Brien, who have chemistry and rapport between other characters (Malkovich and Russell sharing a couple intense moments where not a word is said).<br/><br/>The disaster itself is portrayed brilliantly. The tone remains frantic and the stunning special effects work puts it over the edge. Once things go south, it's a nonstop adrenaline rush till the end. The only reason it's not rated higher is because it's merely a depiction of events, nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary in regards to storytelling. But it didn't have to be. This was a tragic event and the gritty realism shown here is as refreshing as it is intense. If you're in the mood for a deeper-than-average thrill-ride, look no further than Deepwater Horizon."
"rgkarim","8","88","125","29 September 2016"," Dive Deep Into The Horizon Of Flames
","What is it about disasters that we enjoy watching? I could come up with a number of reasons, but the bottom line is that Hollywood has shifted to dramatizing former events as a means for more movies. Hi, Robbie K here bringing you another review of the latest films to grace the screen. Tonight we hit Deepwater Horizon starring Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, and a handful of other actors. Let's get started. <br/><br/>LIKES:  Great acting  Over the top graphics  Emotionally stimulating<br/><br/>You might be thinking that I have gone crazy, after all Wahlberg hasn't had the greatest roles. Deepwater Horizon breaks the mediocre streak and drops him into a position that may net him an Oscar nomination. Wahlberg's portrayal of Mike Williams is certainly a heroic one filled with wisdom, strength, and a calm edge that sets the stage for a natural leader. But there is also a realistic side brought out near the second half the screen that balances out the heroic theatrics of Hollywood. Kurt Russell no surprise plays his usual rugged role, making sure to add the hard edge testosterone rush all older actors need to bring. Hudson and Malkovich get A's as well, each bringing the needed involvement to round out the cast. All the extras and lesser billed roles complete the picture as a close oil crew, but much of their time is spent standing around or ducking from fire. <br/><br/>Speaking of fire, the visual effects are top notch in terms of computer graphic imaging. Deepwater Horizon's reconstruction of an oil rig succumbing to its doom is very realistic. For you technical folks, the directors have crafted scenes to mimic the daily operations involved with pumping oil, from watching gritty mud flow through the pipe to the cracking foundation floor. That sound boring? Well those looking for a little more suspense will be impressed when the whole operation blows to piecesliterally. You might be amazed seeing the rig, and its crew, get covered in oil before erupting into a fiery inferno you've seen in the trailers. My friend described the visuals being so good, he felt immersed into the disaster, wanting to duck or dive as explosions rattled the screen. <br/><br/>Of course the real magic to the visual effects are the emotions it brings with it. The various sequences and montages of the exploding metal certainly paints a terrifying picture as you wonder how much time is left until something falls. Now add our characters trying to traverse the obstacle course from heck, feeling horrifying chills run through your body as you watch human bodies hurled through the air and disturbing injuries protruding in gory details. However, it is not all dismay and dread, no Deepwater Horizon has plenty of sequences and montages of heroism that will make you a little proud to be a humanno matter how overly theatrical it could be. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:  Overdramatic at times  Already know the ending  Editing needs work<br/><br/>I'm probably sounding overcritical or nonsensical, but here it goes anyway. Deepwater Horizon is at times a bit on the overdramatic side. As I said, much of the movie will light a fire in your soul that will have your patriotism in full force. Unfortunately, some of these moments are a bit too fake and in your face to get my full backing, primarily making an effort to pan on the American flag flapping in the flames. Even the more heroic moments sometimes get a bit too corny, the overdramatic focus on the camera amid a symphony soundtrack blaring pride. Again, they get the message across and deliver the emotion, it just sometimes gets a little too Hollywood for me. <br/><br/>The special effects and the noble protagonist will certainly spread suspense and awe, but it doesn't help that you know the ending. If you paid attention to the news, you know all about what happens to the rig, and if you choose to ignore history take a look at the trailer. The opening sequence doesn't help things either by telling you the fate of a certain character that further adds predictability to the mix. What does leave in terms of suspense and surprise? Pretty much it is the fate of the crew that held any mystery to me, and that was scarce at times. Perhaps another minor dislike, but still one nonetheless. <br/><br/>In regards to the editing, this one is a tough call to make. On the one hand I appreciate the details they provide about the incident, from the development of the disaster to how they faced the inferno the rig became. And yet, I felt some of it was elaborated too much for my liking. The build up was a little too long and drawn out, making it slightly boring as we waited for the dirt to hit the pipe. As the oil begins to bloom into a fountain the pace picks up, but then hits a very slow, somewhat pointless, standstill at the aftermath of the situation. Yes, it provides realism and rounding out of the characters, but again is a little too extended after all the excitement. They probably could have spared about fifteen minutes, but hey that's just me. <br/><br/>THE VERDICT:<br/><br/>Despite this being the third historical event to get a movie this month, Deepwater Horizon will provide the emotional thrills you want. A fantastic CGI design that's brimming with emotion and suspense. However, the predictability and overdramatic moments fall in line with Hollywood's magic and takes away from the message of the movie. I have to recommend this one for the theater though, primarily for the technological achievements it brings. <br/><br/>Overall my scores are:<br/><br/>Action/Drama/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"
"dave-mcclain","7","48","69","30 September 2016"," The strengths of ""Deepwater Horizon"" are its strong characters and its extraordinary attention to detail.
","Peter Berg makes movies, but he also knows a lot about deep-water oil exploration. He'd have to, considering how complicated this dangerous activity is, and how well he handled those complexities and portrayed that danger in his film. Berg directed ""Deepwater Horizon"" (PG-13, 1:47), the dramatization of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil rig explosion which killed 11 people and resulted in the largest oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry and the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history. A combination of faulty equipment and human error caused the disaster. Methane gas escaping up the rig's pipes enveloped it, ignited and eventually consumed the rig, which burned until sinking into the ocean 36 hours after the initial explosion. The titular rig's owner, Transocean, and its client, BP, traded accusations of wrongdoing for years, while various cases worked their way through the courts – and a lengthy environmental clean-up of the gulf coast proceeded. No one went to jail, but, according to Wikipedia, ""To date BP's cost for the clean-up, environmental and economic damages and penalties has reached $54bn."" But that's all scientific and industrial detail. This film is mainly a story about people.<br/><br/>Berg (with his screenwriters, Matthew Michael Carnahan and Michael Sand) personalizes the story by focusing on a few key people involved in the events depicted. Master electrician Mike Williams (played by Mark Wahlberg, who Berg also directed in 2013's ""Lone Survivor"") is a devoted family man with a loving wife (Kate Hudson) and a sweet and precocious daughter (Stella Allen), who's very proud of her dad and his job. Radio operator Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez) is a young, single woman who has a steady boyfriend and loves her vintage Ford Mustang, even if she does have trouble keeping it running. Both Mike and Andrea work for ""Mr. Jimmy"" (Kurt Russell, appearing on film for the first time with Hudson, who is his adopted daughter) is the caring, but tough and diligent Transocean foreman on Deepwater Horizon, who often finds himself at odds with BP's corporate representatives on the oil rig.<br/><br/>As Mr. Jimmy and his crew arrive at the rig for their three-week-long turn on board, it's apparent that the departing shift (including Berg, in a cameo role, in which he briefly talks with Russell's character) hasn't done their due diligence in taking care of operation and safety concerns on the rig. While entertaining two BP executives who are visiting Deepwater Horizon (and who present him with a safety award during a brief ceremony), Mr. Jimmy locks horns with BP liaison Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich). Mr. Jimmy insists on a test of the pressure entering the well from beneath the ocean floor. When the test gives conflicting results and the results of an alternate follow-up test complicates the situation further, the stage is set for disaster. The rest of the film depicts that disaster with astonishing detail and realism as everyone on that rig fights for survival and for the goal of getting back safely to their families.<br/><br/>""Deepwater Horizon"" is a fascinating, entertaining and inspiring take on a real-life disaster. We get good character development and a detailed behind-the-scenes look at the considerations, disagreements and actions that led up to the catastrophic explosion, but there are a couple problems with all that. Berg does a good job with a combination of dialog, on-screen verbiage and impressive visuals to help us understand the dynamics at play, but it almost seems like too much, and the conversations, with a lot of technical jargon, characters talking over each other and seeming to mumble their lines, and some with various southern accents and some without, combine to make it difficult to tune one's ear to the dialog and understand everything that's being said. However, the main point of this movie is the survival story. Berg had a realistic version of the rig built (including many working components) for shooting. His attention to detail – in the set and in the film's visual effects is nothing short of remarkable. What's more, we care about the characters and the danger they're in feels real. For excellent acting, a well-developed story and incredible visuals, you should put this film on your horizon. ""B+"""

","""Full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing"" could be a summary of this modern-age disaster movie. In 2010 the ""Deepwater Horizon"" drilling rig off the coast of Louisiana failed in spectacular fashion, bursting into flames and spewing millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico in what was the worst oil-spill in American history. Mark Wahlberg plays the well-respected electrical 'Mr fixit' Mike Williams on the rig, reporting to the Operations Manager Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell). <br/><br/>The exploratory project is way-behind and BP are not happy. Big-wigs from the company add support to Donald Vidrine, the BP site leader, in applying mounting pressure on Harrell to press on regardless without all the necessary and time-consuming tests by Schlumberger being completed. Rogue numbers in further tests are waved away as 'glitches'. A familiar story of corporate greed and pressure overriding the expert's better judgment.<br/><br/>When disaster strikes it strikes quickly, with some spectacular and exciting special effects that leave the audience especially hot under the collar. Female support is provided by the comely Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez), given the almost impossible job of keeping the floating bomb on station as chaos reigns about her. As an audience we are back on familiar ground here from classic Irwin Allen disaster movies such as ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure"". Who will make it, and who won't?<br/><br/>A more telling question here is ""Do we care?"" and unfortunately for the film, the answer is ""Not really"". This feels a callous thing to say when this was a real and recent event and eleven people and – as touchingly illustrated at the end of the film in tribute – many of them family men with young kids, never went home again. But film-wise, we only really get bought into the fate of Williams, whose back-story, with cute wife (Kate Hudson) and cute daughter (Stella Allen) we get to meet and sympathize with. <br/><br/>We get a minimalist view of Fleytas's backstory, but only enough to provide a recurring ""Mustang"" reference. And that's it. All the other characters are just two-dimensional ""rig crew"": cannon-fodder for the special effects team. The screenplay by Matthew Sand and Matthew Carnahan really doesn't deliver enough heft to get us bought in.<br/><br/>While the special effects are good, the sound design isn't, with much of the dialogue being incomprehensible.<br/><br/>All the acting is fine, with the ever-watchable John Malkovich nicely portraying the corporate head you love to hate. Wahlberg as well delivers enough range to make you forget in this ""action mode"" that he was also in ""Ted"". And Rodriguez as a junior lead holds her own against the big guns in what is a creditable performance in a big film role for her. <br/><br/>While ""Lone Survivor""/""Battleship"" director Peter Berg neatly provides an insight into life on and around rigs, and (via subtitles) descriptions of the drilling process which I found interesting, this comes down to the sum of a tense build up, an hour of frenetic disaster, and then a whimper of an ending. Where were some of the dramatic scenes of conflict in the congressional hearing that the film's opening implies might come? Where are the scenes of ecological disaster and local financial ruin to add emotional angles to the story? None of this is really exploited and the whole concoction comes across a bit ""meh"" as a result. Not a bad film by any means. But not one I will remember in a month or two's time.<br/><br/>(Agree? Disagree? For the graphical version of this review and to comment please visit bob-the-movie-man.com. Thanks.)"
"mark-durfor","8","48","80","27 September 2016"," Deepwater Horizon Is Explosive
","In April of 2010, an offshore drilling rig named Deepwater Horizon exploded resulting in the worst oil spill in U. S. History. If you've read my previous reviews about Eddie the Eagle, Steve Jobs, The Big Short and Spotlight, you know that it's easy to get caught up in the details of how much of the story based on actual events really happened and how much was embellished or altered to make a Hollywood movie. Along the way, I have made a decision to do no research into the facts of the real-life story and just focus solely on the movie itself. I mean, the movie makes no claims to be a historically accurate documentary, so I shouldn't hold it to those standards. And this blog isn't about movies being historically accurate when they don't necessarily claim to be. It's based on two factors: how accurately the movie is portrayed by its preview, and the likelihood of the movie making it to my home collection. With that in mind, here's my review:<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays Mike Williams who works on the drilling rig the Deepwater Horizon. But that's the third thing we learn about Williams from the preview. He's a husband and a father first. He says goodbye to his family before being flown by helicopter with his crew to the rig. All his daughter wants is a dinosaur fossil. All his wife (Kate Hudson) wants is for him to return safely. Once aboard the rig, an executive named Vidrine (John Malkovich) and others from British Petroleum are more than anxious to commence with drilling. They skip a concrete test and excuse a failed system test. They are already 43 days behind and over budget and will do whatever it takes to not fall further behind despite Mister Jimmy's (Kurt Russell) stern objections. They should have listened to Mister Jimmy because everyone's worst nightmares explode into reality. <br/><br/>Deepwater Horizon marks the reunion of Director Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg who collaborated on Lone Survivor three years ago. It was nominated for Oscars for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best stunt team performance. While Wahlberg has been nominated for his roles in The Fighter and The Departed, he's one of those reliable actors who makes smart choices. If you've liked one thing Wahlberg has done, odds are,you'll like them all. Most of them won't get nominated for awards, but they will all be entertaining. Berg is in the same category. He's directed some really good movies (Lone Survivor, Battleship, Hancock,The Kingdom), but none that would really break into a critic's top 50 list. Like Wahlberg, if you enjoyed one of Berg's movies, odds are, you'll at least feel you got your money's worth with all of them. <br/><br/>From the preview, I said that Deepwater Horizon looked action-packed and visually stunning, but that it also looked predictable with pieces of the rig falling apart or blowing up blocking every turn as Williams and the survivors try to find a way to escape. I anticipated 3 Stars but I'm bumping that up to 4.0 Stars. It was exactly as the preview said it would be and it was absolutely predictable; however, even though you knew what was coming, it was so perfectly executed, it still shocked you. From the beginning, there was no doubt about the fate of the rig as not-so-subtle clues were dropped along the way from his daughter's school presentation, to the tie of the executive, to the helicopter ride to the rig. You knew it was going to happen, but when it did, it choked the breath right out of you and didn't give it back until the very end of the movie. It is worth the money to watch in theatres. Though I'm not sure I'll be owning Deepwater Horizon, I will be watching it again."

"ThomasDrufke","8","38","63","30 September 2016"," An Emotional Thrill Ride
","Deepwater Horizon is the first of two Peter Berg directed films this year, and if Patriots Day is anywhere near as good as this film we could be looking at quite a few nominations for Berg come February.<br/><br/>Deepwater Horizon tells the story of the crew members of the rig of the same name in April 2010, when the largest oil spill in U.S. history began. Berg is always a guy to count on with this type of harrowing true story. He has the skills of an action film director while also having the delicate hand for an emotionally powerful touch. And much like the recently released 'Sully', this film is a strong tale about the power of the human spirit.<br/><br/>Putting Battleship aside, Berg has always had a knack for directing high intensity sequences of trauma and thrills. Even taking that note into a smaller scale with Friday Night Lights, Berg is great at managing to balance intensity and emotion. Deepwater Horizon is perhaps his biggest scale film thus far, but it's also incredibly personal as well. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, Gina Rodriguez, and Kate Hudson. All of them get the opportunity to act in small intimate moments as well as physically demanding scenes. <br/><br/>Usually, it's those small moments that bring the emotions out of me, and that was Kate Hudson here. I feel like she hasn't gotten a lot to do since her breakout with Almost Famous, but this may be the best she's been since. She plays Wahlberg's wife, and it's simply her reactions to the devastation on the oil rig while she's at home, that really got to me. Powerful stuff.<br/><br/>With all that said, sometimes the high octane thrills feel to be heightened just for heightening certain situations. Berg never loses sight of the end goal here, but some 'action'-ish scenes are almost a little too much, considering how contained this story feels. It doesn't take you out of the film, but you will feel like it could have been handled differently.<br/><br/>Like Berg's previous film, Lone Survivor, it does a nice job of honoring those who died at the rig and the families severely affected by the tragedy. It's a powerful film with gripping performances from Hudson and the rest of the cast that will likely lead it right into the awards season come winter time.<br/><br/>+Berg's delicate touch<br/><br/>+Hudson<br/><br/>+Devastating<br/><br/>-Some heightened moments<br/><br/>8.6/10"
"bartonj2410","8","12","18","30 September 2016"," Very good disaster movie that highlights both bravery and helplessness
","It wasn't until the credits started to roll at the end of Deepwater Horizon that I realised just how severe this disaster actually was. I mean, the above poster shows just a glimpse of the devastation caused by an explosion and subsequent fire on the Deepwater Horizon, an oil rig around 40 miles southeast off the Louisiana coast.<br/><br/>As a result, an oil spill that released an estimated 210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico lasted for 87 days and went down as the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Not only that but eleven workers on the rig died trying to get to safety from such a powerful environmental occurrence.<br/><br/>Peter Berg's Deepwater Horizon follows the crew on that infamous day; firstly as they debate with BP executives over the stability of the rig and then as they try to survive the inferno. <br/><br/>Like his last film, Lone Survivor, Peter Berg tells the story of a real life event with a huge amount of respect for the people that were caught up in it all. Once again, Berg has teamed up with Mark Wahlberg and it's no coincidence that Wahlberg gives his best performance since he last worked with Berg. The two will work together again in Patriots Day, a film about the Boston Marathon bombing, and if they stick to the trend of their collaborative relationship, we should be in for another very good film.<br/><br/>Wahlberg is joined by a pretty impressive ensemble cast that includes Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, Dylan O'Brien and Kate Hudson. It's Malkovich who stands out as the detestable BP executive hell bent on getting the crew to drill for oil, even with the signs of an unstable rig.<br/><br/>The film is well made and ends up being pretty spectacular when it gets going however, what Berg does best is the tension he creates as the disaster draws ever closer. You feel the presence of the oil blowout as this unstoppable monster that brings with it an extreme wrath of fire.<br/><br/>As he did with Lone Survivor, Berg closes the film out with photos of those lost in the events that have unfolded to give the film a real sense of respect and honour. Maybe it's just me but I found it pretty disrespectful for people to be leaving the cinema as these showed on screen. Do you really need to get to your car that quick?<br/><br/>Deepwater Horizon isn't trying to show off at all, as it probably would do if Michael Bay was at the helm. Instead, it's a film that does well to depict the desperation and bravery of those on board the Deepwater Horizon oil rig during a time of helplessness against such a force of nature."
"sne-14344","1","198","409","30 September 2016"," NO plot and highly misleading
","VERY impressive: NO plot and highly misleading. Promulgates the idea that oil comes from dead dinosaurs and gives the impression that it was just 2 low-level BP guys on the rig that made the decision to cut costs by skipping a cement test and failing to keep routine maintenance top notch. No clear indictment of BP's criminal company culture of safety negligence for the benefit of stock dividends and executive remuneration, as established by Lord John Browne and continued by Tony Hayward.<br/><br/>Much urgent and heroic pushing of buttons and switches and discussing gizmos with no explanation of what is going on or how this drilling target was geologically any different from all the other offshore locations on Earth (Macondo being unlike most other drilling targets because of extremely high fluid pressure in the formation, just below the fracture threshold of the rock layers holding the oil in). So from this movie, we get the news ALL oil drilling is SUPER dangerous. The usual Hollywood negligence to script-writing. Might be meaningful to rig workers, except I have the suspicion that anyone knowledgeable would smell plenty of foni- baloni cooking.<br/><br/>And then the solemn photo-tribute to the 11 guys killed as the credits roll. Fine, but were they brave as they died one-by-one fighting to control the well, as the script implies? I understand that all 11 were instantly killed in the initial blast. Of course, 99.99% of the viewers will of have no idea that the Alexander Kjelland (1980) and Piper Alpha (1988) rig disasters each killed an order of magnitude more.<br/><br/>And the only environmental representative in the movie is one bird (who, nevertheless, gave an Oscar-worthy performance)."
"brankovranjkovic","3","72","139","4 October 2016"," Environmental disaster? What environmental disaster!
","This is a tribute movie about the 2010 BP oil disaster that focuses on the events leading up to and including the terrible explosions that created the oil spill.<br/><br/>It shows the human side of the riggers, as they go about their daily routines. Their thick Texan accents were hard to follow (for me at least), and their dialogue definitely was designed to shows how tough oil riggers really are. The BP corporate management staff on the rig are all portrayed as 'idiots', who were continuously taking shortcuts trying to moderate the project deadline (already overrunning by 43 days).<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was a slow burn, building the characters, which were very cliché. The 'disaster' second half section plays out more like a Michael Bay's noisy action movie, with loads of special effects and the standard 'shaky' cam.<br/><br/>After a while, I actually got a bit tired and bored of all the stuff exploding, banging, and smoky scenery. This movie is more concerned with the special effects, rather than the environmental fallout from the disaster."
"deschreiber","4","80","156","5 October 2016"," serious subject turned into empty action flick
","This was a major disappointment. Despite so much of the story depending on technical details, the movie communicated next to nothing. In the early scenes on the rig, people were shouting at each other, unable to understand each other because of the background noise. However, the audience was made to suffer the same thing, having no idea what people were saying. It turns out they were asking if a ""cement test"" had been completed, and after some time, after they were indoors and checked with various people, they discovered that the test had not been completed. So why was the audience made to go through the nonsense of not hearing what people were saying? It seemed a ridiculous plot point to portray in such an annoying way. The significance was that the test had not been completed, not that it took a few minutes to find that fact out because it was too noisy outside for people to talk.<br/><br/>Then began a number of discussions about technical matters. Little effort was made to help the audience understand any of it. Even the few diagrams and supposed shots of what was happening beneath the waves were far from enlightening. I think we were just supposed to let us the technical talk slide over us as mumbo-jumbo only engineers would understand. For my part, I began to think I'd rather have been watching a PBS documentary about the incident that so that I would know exactly what happened.<br/><br/>Once the disaster begins, very little effort is made to continue the narrative. There's a skeleton story of a few crew members saving each other and trying to get off the rig, but the vast majority of the time we just see explosions and flying debris, over and over and over, an endless series of quick cuts, each scene lasting only a few seconds, with lots and lots of noise, of course. Despite the action and colour and noise, it all became a tiresome. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie we see photos of the actual people involved in the incident. None of them, of course, looked like glamorous movie stars like Marky Marky or Kate Hudson. The roles required no great acting talent. Did the producers really have to hire big-name Hollywood names to fill those roles (one of the producers was Marky Mark). It seemed to be a great opportunity to use some lesser-known actors."
"richardcloete","3","62","121","24 October 2016"," Just a load of booms, bangs and flashes
","I will keep this short as most aspects have already been covered.<br/><br/>In short, this was a terrible film. It could have been fantastic, but instead of focusing on the massive political, economic and environmental issues that followed the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the film focuses solely on the life of riggers and the explosions. Lot's of explosions. There is really nothing to this film... just a load of way over the top special effects with flashes, shaky camera action, explosions and whatnot. <br/><br/>To make it worse, the camera is zoomed in - making it almost impossible to tell what is happening... although, it was probably just some piece of the rig blowing up. <br/><br/>Additionally, the dialogue was absolutely rubbish! There was no depth or substance to it - all that we were fed was how stupid BP is. To top it off, the characters all sounded like African American gangsters, even though most of the cast was white! <br/><br/>Finally, for some reason, the director decided to play a list of the 11 victims that lost their lives in the accident... fine, but he chose to do so at the end of the film, most of which died in the initial blast and therefore one is left wondering, ""hmm, who was that again?"".<br/><br/>If you are looking for an interesting, well-thought out and dynamic plot, turn away! This film is for people who do not have a thought of their own and just want to watch some things blow up."

So they drag the captain up to the bridge so they could hold his busted hands and push the button with his finger...now that's nonsense. They want to portrait these guys as heroes, no way they did that in real life.

","I saw this had a 7.5 rating on IMDb so I thought it would be worth a shot. How wrong I was!<br/><br/>First of all, the casting is awful. The lead by Mark Wahlberg is so off-base from the person he is based on, not to mention Kate Hudson does represent who she is supposed to, I mean it is just all off in every way. The acting could have been better, but with such a terribly generic script, who could tell.<br/><br/>Next the story is overly simplistic. I was hoping that the movie would have more substance than it did. There is no thematic depth and they took a complex story that lasted months and had incredible political and commercial repercussions and boiled it down to a good-guy-bad-guy movie.<br/><br/>Wayyyy too many special effects. Compared to the actual footage, it looks completely unreal. I also despise when movies have explosions going off constantly to make boring scenes exciting.<br/><br/>There is more depth in a Bond movie, better effects in Jaws, and just about any movie is better than this. Really disappointing. At least I saw it in ""4D,"" where the chair movements, vibrations, smells, and air blowing in my face distracted me from what I was watching."

","We all remember the images of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Millions of gallons of oil spewed from the ocean floor for 87 days all captured and broadcast with a live internet feed. It was the worst oil spill in US history and BP oil has paid over $70 billion in fines and clean-up efforts.<br/><br/>But what you might not remember is that the spill occurred when the floating oil rig Deepwater Horizon suffered a catastrophic explosion which resulted in the loss of 11 crew lives. Director Peter Berg (Lone Survivor) again teams up with actor Mark Wahlberg in an attempt to bring the fascinating and heroic story to audiences in the action-biopic Deepwater Horizon.<br/><br/>Wahlberg plays Mike Williams who was the chief electronics technician for Transocean on the Deepwater Horizon. Scheduled to work upon the oil rig for just a few weeks, Williams along with Transocean offshore installation manager Jimmy Harrell (played by Kurt Russell) quickly identify that BP has cut corners with safety measures in an attempt to hit production targets. ""Money, money, money"" one of the operators sings as his conclusion to BP's negligence.<br/><br/>Concerns represented by Williams and Harrell do little to convince on-site BP officials to radically change course and slow operations until all safety precautions have been taken. Their disregard resulted in a high pressure methane gas explosion that engulfed the rig platform. One hundred and five crew members were on board when the explosion took place at approximately 9:45PM CMT. Ninety-Four were rescued. Eleven crew were never found.<br/><br/>Wahlberg and Russell are both convincing in their respective roles. It might be difficult in theory to rationalize Wahlberg as an electronics technician, but the versatile actor convincingly plays a smart family-oriented blue-collar worker and the ultimate hero of the film.<br/><br/>Much of the first reel deals with BP's neglect and the conflict with the experienced workers aboard the rig. The unflattering digs are not discreet and we imagine that BP in no way will be exultant to see how Matthew Michael Carnahan and Matthew Sand's screenplay shines the light on corporate greed. Berg does his best to try and describe the safety tests that took place aboard the vessel, but it's not until the first explosion that audiences will become engaged in the horrific ordeal.<br/><br/>Berg is no stranger to blowing things up. We all want to forget 2010's Battleship, but it likely did expose Berg to A-Level special effects and they are on full display here. The Deepwater Horizon replica is considered the largest set ever built and Berg most have took delight in completely devastating the platform with pyro techniques and theatre rattling explosions. Kurt Russell ran through fires and explosions in 1991's Backdraft, but things are turned up a notch here.<br/><br/>As an action film, Deepwater Horizon works wonderful well. For certain, audiences will not bored through the blasts and heroics of our protagonists. Where the film does falter is in its emotional appeal. Although we get a small glimpse into the home life of Mike Williams (his wife is played by Kate Hudson who acts with father Kurt Russell for the first time), the film doesn't pull at the heartstrings for the eleven souls lost that fateful April evening. They are memorialized before the end credits role, but they are lost in the shuffle of action packed sequences that consume the 107-minute running time of Deepwater Horizon.<br/><br/>The film is still important. It is important that we learn from our mistakes and that we remember the fallen. It's just unfortunate that Berg was unable to take a gallant story and turn it into something that acted as historical reference, casual entertainment and emotional groundwork that would evoke change in big industry standards."

","First of all, this is one of the kind of movies where the trailer promises more than the movie is able to fulfill.

Then, when you are just about to fall asleep, everything explodes for the next couple of minutes. And in the end we get a bit of heroism, patriotism and the good old cliché of ""good worker vs. greedy bosses"" For a movie where you already know the plot beforehand, the makers weren't able to create a thrilling or even interesting movie. <br/><br/>In sum: waiting, exploding, roll credits."

","This is an action movie first of all, not a documentary. So while I wasn't expecting historical accuracy, I expected some complexity as in the serious nature of the subject. The filming, the set, the stunts/action, acting of Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell are exemplary. But it is a very simple plot- you know straightaway who the good guys are and who are the baddies- e.g. John Malkovich with usual sneering looks and snarky comments. Again, not surprising BP are made to be the total villains (typical of many US movies where the British are villains) while forgetting that Transocean, Halliburton and regulatory bodies were also to be faulted as well for this disaster. That only 11 people of the 126 present died despite the terrible conditions, is a testimony to the fast thinking bravery of the land based rescue teams- again underplayed due to the overemphasis on Wahlberg's character. That an actor of Kate Hudson's calibre is reduced to a pouting housewife seen from time to time (she even manages to change her nail colour in those 36 hours despite everything), is a big shame. But the biggest shame of all is that the movie barely touches on the huge environmental impact of the disaster- the only thing we see is one oil soaked bird. People's livelihood were affected- from fishermen to tourism- and the world changed. That a huge disaster on environmental and personal levels has been reduced to an big action movie, is itself a tragedy."

","Turned up at the cinema to find that our chosen movie was sold out, so decided to take a punt on Deepwater Horizon. I'm not sure whether it's possible to put a spoiler into this as most people will already be fully aware of the story line. I really can't see the point of the movie because of this. If you have spent the past few years is isolation then the movie tells the story of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling platform in the Gulf Of Mexico. They are drifting behind schedule and starting to take short cuts in an attempt to reduce costs and save time.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Wahlberg and Malkovich, so some of their scenes were enjoyable to watch. Think the movie may have been better if it focused more on Mike Williams and less on the event. A lot of the dialogue was a bit clunky though and felt like it had been lifted from the investigations. There were also a couple of very contrived scenes. The film does give you a flavour of what it must have been like to be on the Deepwater Horizon. Maybe that was the point of it."

","Although what I stated in my above summary line may make you think that I thought that ""Deepwater Horizon"" was a bad movie, that is actually not the case. It's more of a misguided movie instead. The movie can be basically divided into two halves, and each half doesn't really work.<br/><br/>The first half suffers from the fact that it is way too long and talky. Yes, some time should have been taken to set up the situation and try to educate the audience what is going on, but I don't think it had to be to the extent (about fifty minutes) that the movie thinks it had to run. As a result, it's often quite boring. <br/><br/>The second half of the movie (when the disaster starts) is a bit better - there is some excitement and suspense, though it suffers from the fact that a lot of the CGI special effects are not really all that convincing. Also, it ends a bit abruptly in some regards before the closing credits start to roll.<br/><br/>I think the movie may have worked better if its 107 minutes were divided into three equal length parts - the first part setting up the situation, the second part devoted to the unfolding disaster, and then a final part showing the characters adjusting after the disaster. But as it is, the movie is kind of misguided. As I said, it's not an awful movie - there is some genuine merit here and there, like some good acting and sympathetic characters - but the whole package is somewhat unsatisfying."

On board the Deepwater Horizon, Mike and Mr. Jimmy (Kurt Russell) bode ill tidings when they discover that the departing drill team left without doing a safety check on the hole.

She adds nothing to the story whatsoever, only serving to drag it down and spoil the pace at times. This leads to the film's opening sequence, which is literally the worst part of it, totally boring and without merit. The story should just have started with Mark Wahlberg arriving on the oil rig for work. Still, things only get better, and when the disaster occurs in the second half this is thrilling stuff indeed, hard-edged and complemented by strong CGI effects.

","Peter Berg is a fairly streaky director. He's had some pretty bad films (both Hancock and Battleship) come to mind but then again Lone Survivor was not bad and had some gripping action. I think Berg is in a place where he trusts an actor and trusts the formula of bringing a real life event to the screen. That's basically where Mark Wahlberg and his past, present and future film is (Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day). As mentioned earlier Lone Survivor's depiction of war and the action based cinematography kept your eyes glued to the screen, so how would the followup film stack up? The trailers for the film were not interesting. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill and explosion was obviously a disaster and a sad event but was it worth a film? The build to the events of the disaster are slow. You sit through a lot of the jargon of the oil drilling world. I'd say its easy to lose interest in the first third of the film, especially if you don't get invested in the film's characters. You also have to sit through some bad accents (which is a pet peeve of mine). The films got a fairly good cast to boot and for the most part there are no faults acting wise. Gina Rodriguez was convincing, I haven't seen anything with her previously but she delivered. I also liked Kate Hudson in the small doses of the film that she appears in. She seemed like a raw character who was genuinely afflicted with her husbands situation and the up in the air nature of his safety really showed through in the emotion of her character.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Mark Wahlberg. He doesn't always choose the best projects but he might be on to something co-oping with Peter Berg for a few films. You won't complain about Wahlberg being the hero here. Once the disaster occurs the pace picks up which is a good and bad thing. I'd say the first act was not very engaging and sort of set the tone for the rest of the film. The action depiction is great. There are moments of it that will captivate you and depending on who you are you will be moved with the raw emotion depicted in the film. Be warned though, that the event is prolonged so there's not much else going on outside of the event. I saw a lot of similar camera-work from Berg in this and Lone Survivor. The camera at times seems to be a spectator just set as a fly on the wall for the events. The camera-work also becomes frenetic and pacy, which adds to the atmosphere set by the very scary and unpredictable event.<br/><br/>Once the disaster occurs and the film really starts rolling, there is decent satisfaction. I thought this film was better than I hoped, which is really much better than my expectations going in. However, its not a perfect film and can't stay wholly engaging. Worth a watch for the peeps who like Berg/Wahlberg or are fascinated by the event. Otherwise, your response to this film may (much like mine) be rather indifferent.<br/><br/>6/10"

We get to know the characters, like a grizzled Kurt Russel who manages the rig, Wahlberg who is the chief electronic technician, and John Malkovitch, who is not one of the worker ants but rather seems to represent the suits who own the rig, Burns Phillips. It's a little hard to tell. It's a little hard to tell anything about the people or the operations or the rig itself. You see, I am only five years old and I need the pace of the exposition to be slowed down so I can understand the meaning of terms like crack block, feeder pump, boom, operative covering, and cement block. I'm smart, so I figured out p.s.i. all by myself. I never did figure out why some of the jiggling needles on the gauges caused concern while others didn't. Malkovitch is treated as the villain of the piece but I don't know why, since his suggestions sounded sensible enough to me. But then, though I'm smart, my intuitive faculty is impaired.<br/><br/>There's a lot of bonhommie aboard the Deepwater Horizon, which floats and isn't set on piles, and which has a bridge from which the screws are operated and all that. It's really a big flat boat. There's even an attractive young lady who works on the bridge. Everybody knows everybody else and there are running gags expressing the extent of Gemeinchaft. It all reminded me of the opening scenes of ""The Perfect Storm"" except these blue-collar types are pretty well set. Life aboard one of these rigs is deliberately made pleasant for the crew, otherwise why would they work on them? The cuisine is described in other sources as four star. There's booze available too. Everything is as comfortable as practicable only no smoking.<br/><br/>That's the first twenty minutes. The rest is a breathless explosion of CGIs and special visual effects. The wretched drill blows out and we see a gusher of mud and/or oil, which then is ignited and burns eleven men to a crisp, while wounding most of the others. There is no pause. The structure blows up piece by piece with no explanation of what the hell is going on. An hour of solid flame, terror, flying debris, and blood. As a five year old, I loved it. It's hard to imagine what other audience it's aimed at. It's just that even at my tender age it's possible to reach a point of genuine satiation. Of the performances, only one stands out.

"grantss","4","4","7","5 July 2017"," More filler than drama
","In April 2010 the exploration oil rig Deepwater Horizon, stationed in the Gulf of Mexico, suffered a catastrophic disaster, exploding and being set on fire. This is the story of the lead-up to the disaster, the disaster itself and the individual actions involved, and the aftermath.<br/><br/>More filler than drama - essentially a 40-50 minute short docudrama turned into a 107 minute movie. The remainder is just padding. Yes, I know, the idea is to engage you, the audience, by getting you to know and like the characters and thus empathize with them when disaster strikes, but here it doesn't really work. The lead-up here is dull, and the attempts at engagement overdone and overt. It also doesn't help that, having introduced you to all these characters, other than the main ones it is difficult to tell who is who when the tragedy unfolds.<br/><br/>On that point, the action itself is difficult to follow. By trying to make things as realistic as possible, director Peter Berg also makes things more confusing, with dim/dark lighting and random, unexplained things happen. It becomes hard to tell which characters are involved or what the dangers are (other than the obvious ones, of course).<br/><br/>While a tragedy, there's not enough detail and drama involved to make a complete movie, but it got made anyway."

","Let me just say it bluntly. I sat there, I cried, nay sobbed, at 2 crucial points when I saw this film last night. What a mind-boggling, epic, powerful, personal, emotional, amazing performance by Mark Wahlberg (who I've met in person actually, he's a really great guy). His gut-wrenching, visceral depiction of the worst ecological disaster in history truly personalizes something that was so remote & distant for so many people. The full fury of the explosive fire, the sudden, overwhelming, animalistic drive to survive, and each raw, scraping fire-singed step towards the lifeboats are all nearly something you can nearly tangibly taste. The terror of the unknown, of being hit by debris at any moment, of dying, is projected into your very psyche, sweeping you along with the heroes and villains alike through each minute. Wow. I don't think I've ever had my heart beat up so thoroughly by a film that reduced me to an emotionally tearful wreck."

The story is about the happening itself and loss of life (which is the very sad reality) but nothing on the nature catastrophe? This is a miss, this ignorance probably sponsored or controlled by MNC. Basically miss the main point of that catastrophe - recent event in Berlin - some crazy kills 11 people in the Christmas Market - make a movie? I don't think so.

"Samiam3","6","3","5","28 May 2017"," Shallowwater Horizon
","Director Peter Berg gives us the story of the greatest oil spill in American history. He succeeds in delivering all the damage, but fails to showcase the impact. <br/><br/>On the grounds of drama, A movie like Deepwater Horizon will only strike oil if it is constructed as a drama about human beings, rather than a two hour treatment of a Wikipedia article. It's not a bad movie, but it has no soul. Something is missing. <br/><br/>Deepwater horizon feels like a two act structure for a story that warrants three acts. There is a distinctive beginning, a middle and then it's just ... over.<br/><br/>In the first part, we meet our main character (Wahlberg), his family and his co-workers. He hops a company chopper for a short flight to the Gulf of Mexico, and onto a doomed oil rig. It is there that we meet the unfavourable oil executive (Malcovich) who orders drilling to proceed after conducting a drilling pressure test that yields unsafe results. The teams starts drilling, and then mother nature fights back; flames go up. <br/><br/>While the real person was in fact charged with criminal inelegance, Deepwater Horizon relies on our knowledge of the outcome to make Malkovich seem like the kind corporate 'bad guy'; that Hollywood loves to hate. To make matters worse, John Malkovich gives a lousy performance with an accent so phony and untraceable that you'd think he came from a planet in the Star Trek universe. As for Mark Wahlberg, for the most part he is playing himself, but in fairness the script doesn't give him much. <br/><br/>Once the oil rig starts to go up, Deepwater Horizon succeeds in conjuring up some peril, but the camera work and lighting are highly disorienting, so after a while these scenes get tiresome. <br/><br/>There is a brief moment near the end of the movie that is memorable because it gives a hint of what is missing. A bruised and battered Wahlberg gets out of a car, squeezes through the press and in to a building where he is met by a man who asks him what happened to his son. When he doesn't get the answer he wants, he attempts to man handle Wahlberg. What Deepwater Horizon needs is a sense of emotion impact from the turmoil, because you are left wondering how the survivors repaired their lives. another half hour of material would have helped with this. the fact that the movie denies us this renders all the family introduction scenes in act one a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>There is more to this story than Peter Berg is able to deliver."
"p-jonsson","6","3","5","2 March 2017"," Anti BP propaganda but watchable.
","As expected this is a bit of a propaganda movie against BP but that was of course rather expected. It is still watchable. The dramatization is fairly well done and the effects are believable as well as enjoyable. If you watch it as a disaster drama and special effects movie it is definitely okay.<br/><br/>As a documentary, well I would say that it falls short. The movie only covers the initial explosion. Once the platform is evacuated the movie stops. I am somewhat disappointed at that. I would at least have liked to see the attempts to put out the fire. Where are the scenes with the boats trying to douse the rig with water for instance? I would also have liked the film to cover the attempts to close the well, the technical challenges involved and the fight against the oil spill. This is not at all covered.<br/><br/>I feel that the film attempts to ride on public opinion, pretend to be a action/disaster movie as well as a fact telling one and cash in on the accident. The action/disaster parts were well done but the movie left out a lot of the, perhaps less spectacular, drama around the accident. It is a shame because now it became a rather ordinary movie as well as giving a distasteful feeling they were just trying to make some quick bucks on the disaster.<br/><br/>That also made the factual parts somewhat in doubt. I feel the movie is making a strong effort to portray BP as willful criminals. I am sure there is plenty of blame that should fly BP's way but at the same time one can read that ""On November 8, 2010, the inquiry by the Oil Spill Commission revealed its findings that BP had not sacrificed safety in attempts to make money, but that some decisions had increased risks on the rig."". As always, things are not black and white and oil drilling is risky business after all.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough ramblings, I found the movie okay, nothing more and nothing less."
"Semisonic","6","3","5","2 March 2017"," Too technical, too messy, and arguably too glorified
","Here we go again, Deepwater Horizon is a film that claims to be based on true events. Indeed, there was an oil rig by such name that made a huge mess in the Gulf of Mexico. The question is, how close this film stays true to what really happened there on April 20, 2010.<br/><br/>Because if we judge this film by its cinematographic merit only, then it could easily be described with a concise formula: a catastrophe flick, brutal but generic. The typical build-up, with lots of banter, friendly and not so much, and a ton of techie jargon you'll hardly understand even if you could pause every now and then and look up every word. And then the typical climax, when the hell breaks loose and everyone gets their chance to reveal themselves and to be either @ssholes or heroes. And the typical finale, grim but happy, with the survivors hugging their wives and kids and exchanging those meaningful looks. <br/><br/>If that was the first disaster movie I had seen, well, I'd probably feel absolutely satisfied. Because the disaster part of Deepwater Horizon, finally devoid of the mumbo jumbo talks and turned into a big quest of survival in a burning hell above water, is definitely gripping enough, thanks to the solid performance of Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell, and the impressive visuals. However, I've seen such films before, both dramatic and ridiculous, so I'm bound to wonder whether Deepwater Horizon is able to bring something new onto the table.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the answer is no. Last year we've seen another catastrophe film based on a real story, Sully. Well, it was not a typical catastrophe indeed, more like a catastrophe turned miracle. Still, it was a demonstration of a different approach to telling the stories of such events. And while Sully was definitely less dynamic and much more political, it was at least original. And that is the quality Deepwater Horizon isn't really able to boast.<br/><br/>If only we could only know how much of this film is fiction and how much is based on reality indeed. Because if the filmmakers had shot Deepwater Horizon strictly in accordance with the real events, then all that purely American heroism and even the techie talks would've felt... different. That way we'd actually be able to assess the scale of stupidity and greed of the people who let that disaster happen, and the scale of heroism and sacrifice of those who were doing their best to avert that disaster, and, when the worst finally happened, were risking their lives to save those of their fellow men. That would've been a true feat deserving every praise possible. But I know Hollywood. And, while I'd like to believe that some of the exemplary behavior shown in this movie did take place that day, I'm more inclined to think that Deepwater Horizon is just a rough outline of the true story, and all those inspiring and noble actions done by Wahlberg and Co are there just for the show."

I just failed to buy the hackneyed story of BP oil execs pushing and the rig crew pushing back and then just caving to the pressure.

","Firstly the explosion and fire is filmed in a way that makes one seem right in the thick of things. Quite scary. Unfortunately things are confusing both in terms of dialog and direction.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with some family time with Kate Hudson in a fairly convincing blue collar wife role although she is a bit slim for the role. Mark Wahlberg looks short and out of shape - he let himself go a bit for the role and that's realistic. John Malkovich plays an evil BP guy who was in a rush and caused them to proceed despite supervisor Kurt Russell's misgivings. Liked Gina Rodriguez as one of the bridge personnel caught up in the explosion.<br/><br/>2 major faults:<br/><br/>Confusing dialog One of the main faults is the dialog is needlessly difficult to understand with all the technical speak bantered quickly around by the cast. Didn't understand much except a few words by Kurt Russell in the meeting. There must have been an easier way to explain the problem with the pressure. <br/><br/>Hard to tell people apart during the disaster sequences A major fault in the direction is having everyone's face covered by mud and soot. I couldn't tell who was injured and killed and when especially when it came to Ethan Suplee's character.

","Yes, I walked out of this film knowing something I didn't know before. However, I didn't care very much about it, when I really should have. And I certainly didn't care about too many of the characters.<br/><br/>We have Mark Wahlberg and we like him because he loves his wife and daughter. And we have Gina Rodriugez who we are introduced to when she has a twenty second argument with her old, run down car and another twenty second exchange with her boyfriend. Besides that, we know nothing about her.<br/><br/>And we know nothing about the lives or personalities of virtually anyone else on the oil rig, so we have no reason to care if they live or die. We want Wahlberg to go home to the wife and seven year old daughter who love him. We care little about Gina and nothing about anyone else. Yes, there is also the character of the corporate cold codfish who puts profits above people. We've seen him hundreds of times and this guy is no different, in spite of John Malkovich's history of creating unique, interesting characters. And we have Kurt Russell as the hardworking, dedicated, gruff, manly team leader who we've also seen two thousand times.<br/><br/>THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, the arguably campy disaster flick from the seventies was the first film that came to my mind. Thirty five years after the last time I saw the movie, I can still remember specific details about a dozen of the characters. Hundreds of people were on the boat, at least twelve of them were carefully defined with life histories and unique personalities and because they advertised that there would only be six survivors, you sat at your seat's edge pulling for the people you liked. When the faces of the actual real life casualties are shown at the end of DEEPWATER HORIZON, you have no idea which characters, if any, were based on which people.<br/><br/>Have audiences become so dumbed down and is HBO our only salvation? There were at least twenty active, carefully defined, unique characters in any given season of BOARDWALK EMPIRE, there were just as many on THE SOPRANOS and there were at least thirty or forty on OZ. Do contemporary directors actually believe that 21st century film audiences can only follow one character at a time? Again, you cared if Mark Wahlberg lived or died. You didn't know much or care much about anyone else in DEEPWATER HORIZON. And you barely thought or cared about the actual issue. I walked out of STAR TREK IV wanting to save the whales and I left PROMISED LAND wishing I could do something about fracking. Do I care about the greed of major oil companies? I did before I saw this movie. I don't care much more or less now."

","Reuniting with his Lone Survivor (2013) leading man Mark Wahlberg and telling another true-life tale of down-to-earth, blue-collar guys caught up in a horrendous, avoidable situation, Peter Berg tackles the events leading up to and during the explosion of the titular Deepwater Horizon Mobile Drilling Unit and the subsequent offshore oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Berg opts to tell the story in the mould of a classic disaster movie, introducing the various characters that are inevitably destined to be caught up in the chaos, before delivering the movie's big set-piece; a massive, devastating explosion of fire and oil, dramatically and realistically brought to life by the 85%-to- scale set. While it makes for an entertaining and exciting picture (hardly necessities for a true-life tragedy), it misses the opportunity to explore the bigger picture.<br/><br/>Returning to Deepwater Horizon after shore leave, engineer Mike Williams (Wahlberg) arrives at the floating rig to find that not all the workers are happy or comfortable with the actions of the company men. Mike and respected supervisor Mr. Jimmy (Kurt Russell) are shocked to learn that the men responsible for conducting a pressure test have been sent home early under the orders of BP man Vidrine (John Malkovich), without carrying out the routine safety inspections. A lot of the dialogue is naturalistic but muffled, meaning that the necessary exposition required to understand the workings of the rig and the reasons for the pending disaster can confuse. One of the opening scenes sees Mike explain his job to his young daughter who is preparing for a class talk. She seemed to get it but I didn't, but it's clear enough that something isn't quite right.<br/><br/>Berg's decision to keep the CGI trickery to an absolute minimum certainly pays off, and allows cinematographer Enrique Chediak to capture the sheer scale of the event to full effect. While there are some invisible special effects at work, the whole ordeal feels entirely real, bolstered by some terrifying, Oscar-nominated sound editing. Yet in aiming to deliver an action movie so focused on the immediacy of the event and the swift actions of those on board, it loses sight of the bigger picture at play. Namely, the unforgivable misconduct and irresponsibility of BP, who endangered the life of every man and woman on board in fear of being behind schedule, and the resulting oil spill which devastated wildlife and could be seen from space. For me at least, that sounds like a more interesting and engrossing movie. Still, Berg's picture is well made, handsomely performed, and, most importantly, doesn't feel superficial."

","Based on one of the worst environmental disasters, Deepwater Horizon does well enough - largely due to its casting and well-directed climax. From what I have read, the movie made some technical mistakes, but that may be noticeable to people who have read about the disaster in detail.<br/><br/>Story (7/10): Deepwater horizon brings back the memories of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster that was perhaps one of the worst environmental disasters till date. The story revolves around the Chief Electrical Engineer, played by Mark Wahlberg, and general operational supervisor, played by Kurt Russell, and their futile efforts to convince the money minded BP officials about the potentially fatal dangers of trimmed down inspections and distorted tests. Unfortunately, the inevitable happens and the story moves around how the Chief Electrical Engineer goes beyond the call of duty to save every single life possible. In real life incident based movies - research can make or break the movie. The movie falls a little short in terms of the accuracy and details of the events and the cause of the explosion. <br/><br/>Acting (8/10): Kurt Russell and Mark Wahlberg did great work in lead roles. Mark Wahlberg has this subtle honesty that gets projected in almost every movie and has helped him a lot here with the kind of character he played. Kurt Russell, complementing Mark, projects a strong leader who survives some of the most brutal blows as the rig sets ablaze. John Malkovich, playing the negative role, is impressive with his dialog delivery. However, what was more noticeable was the screen presence of the supporting cast around these two. I felt this was a movie where everyone gave their best, or at least tried to. In such movies, the lead actors tend to take over the entire movie but that didn't happen here. <br/><br/>Direction (7/10): Peter Berg does a decent job with a slow and vague build up to the plot. However, once the disaster hits, the direction of sequences and the special effects is very impressive. In patches, the director stretches it too far in terms of showing the protagonists survive intensely fatal blows - but I guess that's why they make movies. The use of supporting cast and allowing them to show their presence makes the movie a little unique. <br/><br/>Overall (7/10): In spite of some technical mistakes and below par first half, this movie is a decent watch for the sake of the subject and acting."

","This is one of the best movies I have seen in years. It is very well made with great actors, scenes, and graphics. It is definitely a movie worth watching more than once. Deep water Horizon depicts the true events that occurred during the horrific oil spill in the gulf back in 2010. Even if you did not know much of the events, this film is sure to educate you on those events that took place. There were some parts that seemed too predictable and you were able to continue guessing the plot/story line, but it was still an eye opening movie. The main character, Mike, is the chief electrician and he seems to be a leader on the Horizon. So, it only made sense that he would be one of the heroes that gets the other crew members to safety when the vessel blows. This movie is definitely worth seeing. Not only for entertainment, but for education as well. Everyone should see this movie to learn the true facts about what happened back in 2010 when the tragic oil spill occurred."
"leosmith-11166","Null","3","6","9 October 2016"," A bit of a sinker
","First off, I want to give my condolences to the families and the people affected by this disaster.<br/><br/>Alright, now for my review:<br/><br/>I honestly walked into this film expecting to rate it a 4 or even 5 stars. The trailer promised everything that a good disaster film would have. It seemed to me that Peter Berg's ""Deepwater Horizon"" would be this generations ""Poseidon's Adventure"". And while the film did promise in the technical area, with visual and audio effects, it lacked in almost everything else,from characters we can connect to, to the basic form of entertainment.<br/><br/>Now, as i said before, the technical and special effects in this film are fantastic, and could possibly(and should) receive an Oscar nomination for them. But for all the awesome effects,there is a less then awesome counterpart. The first half of the film is extremely slow, and attempts to allow the audience to get to know the characters and the situation. I've never disliked slow starts to films like these, because i often know that there will be a rewarding payoff. But there was no payoff. After the disaster begins to unfold, the film turns to mindless action and effects to tell the story. It becomes very boring because the amount of action portrayed on the screen is of sloppy quality and lazy film making. It all too much felt like a Michael Bay film. Explosions and disasters are going off at a rapid pace, and without time to either empathize with the characters or to even care about them.<br/><br/>The poor juggling of multiple stories of the different characters is one of the major downfalls to this picture. There are far too many ""in depth"" characters to actually understand any of them. And, when there is far too much of something, we seem to not care as much. The success of any Disaster film(such as ""Poseidon's Adventure"", ""Titanic"" or even ""Independence Day"") doesn't only lie in the disaster itself, but in the development and connection of the characters experiencing that disaster. And the situation in ""Deepwater Horizon"" is all but worsened when you realize that the characters portrayed aren't just characters, but real people. In seems to make ""entertainment"" out of these real people's death, and attempts to cover up this with an admittingly emotional funeral like tribute at the end of the film, with the real peoples faces and names on the screen.<br/><br/>Before i wrap this review up, i realised that i never acknowledged the actors in this film. The cast was stunning, and they live up to their reputations, and the likes of Mark Whalberg, Dylan O'Brien, John Malkovich, and an all time favourite of mine, Kurt Russell, help make this film more enjoyable.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Deepwater Horizon"" fails to create any emotion or entertainment, and tries to cover up its shallow characters and ""entertainment"" out of real peoples depth with special effects and a somewhat patronizing funeral tribute. If there was any justice, ""Deepwater Horizon"" would sink to the bottom of the box office."

","As a Louisiana resident, this industry is vital for so many families. We watched this play out on television for months. This is the first time I went to the movies on an opening weekend, and I did NOT regret it. The theater was packed. No one made a sound from the first scene to the last. It was like being in a funeral. I cried, a lot! This movie succeeds on every level. As an emerging screenwriter, the main thing writers want to do with our scripts is evoke emotion in the reader/viewer. Deepwater Horizon achieves that goal. It's a roller-coaster ride of emotions, from silly relatable family time, to gut-wrenching courage and bravery, and you will find yourself holding your breath throughout the action. My dad worked on offshore rigs when I was a child. A great uncle was killed in a rig explosion in the 80s. A first cousin does this for a living. So many people can relate to this industry. This film is not for the faint of heart. It is raw, gritty, LOUD, EXPLOSIVE, and real. I can only imagine what the real survivors and victims went through on that day. A tribute at the end is dedicated to the 11 people who died. What a story! I loved this movie and found no flaws, nothing negative to report. It is touching, exciting, scary, courageous, moving, respectful, and hopefully will enlighten this industry and the dangers associated with it. I hope it garnishes Oscar buzz, because it deserves it. Everyone has his/her opinion about films but I hope movie-goers will see for themselves what a profound film this is. Kudos to the cast and crew, and thank you for bringing jobs to Louisiana as this was being filmed."

I was so excited about this movie and I like Peter Berg's direction. My personal favorite is his ""Battleship"".That was science fiction movie but I liked that movie. His next venture is ""Lone Survivor"" and that was a critically acclaimed movie. The way he executes the story line and the script sometimes that was very imposing that's why I was eagerly waiting for this movie.<br/><br/>It is the story of ""oil spill in U.S. history"". In April 2010 the explode happened and there are many political and social problem created for this reason. The story is about this and I am not revealing the story. The story very catchy and full of emotion. You can see the opposite reaction to this incidents and feel the emotions of the involved persons. I think this is a thriller and equally a drama movie.<br/><br/>The story is good but the director failed to catch the opportunities. He just missed making this movie a gem. The continuation and the emotions of the characters are sometimes like fake. The chemistry between the characters are not so imposing and not engaging. The character development is not authoritative and sometimes the dialogues are very cliché.<br/><br/>Performance wise Mark Wahlberg has done an OK job but nothing to shout about. John Malkovich and Dylan O'Brien has done a wonderful job and I think John Malkovich steals the show properly. Rest of the cast's acting is very average and nothing to applaud about. The background score is very poor and not matched with the story.<br/><br/>If you want to know the story of that explode and you are not aware of that then this movie is for you and don't tell me anything after watching this."

","Matt Damon (here disguised as Mark Wahlberg) saves an ethnic chick from a flaming inferno.<br/><br/>I liked it.<br/><br/>The trailers make it look like an action film, but it's nothing like that; it's a ""disaster movie"", where the background, actions of the various players, and events are more important than the acting. Here is a simple test to determine if you will like Deepwater Horizon: ""if you had to watch Titanic again, and you get to pick whether to watch only the first half, or only the last half, which one would you choose?"" If you pick the second half, you will love Deepwa... DH.<br/><br/>DH is all about how a bunch of idiots from BP (and some friends of theirs) managed to mess up a simple enough operation, and wound up causing $41Billion of losses just to save a few bucks on a couple extra days of routine work (which would have netted them something in the region of X billion dollars SOLELY IN THE DAYS when the hole needed to be plugged).<br/><br/>Mark ""Matt Damon"" Wahlberg is a nondescript, hillbilly-speaking engineer which has a non-relevant role in the story; he says a couple things, then goes to take a shower. When stuff blows up, he saves the girl by being the Hero(tm), in one of two completely unnecessary scenes which holliwoodize the film.<br/><br/>John Malkovich is the BP aforementioned idiot, who causes the loss of the rig. No spoiler, as this is evident from page 1.<br/><br/>Many, many supporting actors doing a fine job.<br/><br/>The real spectacle is the set, with the rig going on fire, seems absurdly real. The film is a bit too long, there is NO need at all for the initial half hour (Wahlberg's wife establishes that Wahlberg has a reason to live other than, you know, get the f* out of a burning oil rig), but once the explodin' stuff starts happening, you will be in a trance.<br/><br/>I would recommend DH to .. just about anyone over 18. It's not Michael Bay enough for kids, but it will do for couples and dudes. Very cool, strong film that knows what it wants to do (and i'm 99% sure those 3 crap scenes were forced in by some idiot producer).<br/><br/>My vote: 8/10"

Berg makes an camera appearance as the crew shift takes place upon the ridge. Mr. Jimmy (the always terrific Kurt Russell) and Mike Williams (Wahlberg - again at his heroic best) feels somethings wrong at the shift change, especially with several BP big wigs aboard, particularly Vidrine (John Malkovich - successfully pulling of an accent). Berg is terrific at filling time and space with rapid dialogue, thus making the audience wait for the action. Gina Rodriguez (""Jane the Virgin"") is Andrea, top crew person who created the floating ridge, while back home Mike's wife Felicia (Kate Hudson - we can never get enough of Ms. Hudson) awaits. Special Effects, Sound, Visual stimulation, Cinematography (Enrique Chediak - ""127 Hours"") and more are all on fire here (sometime literally), pushing the viewing experience to their limits. If there is a fault here, it lies in the initial camera work that is to close to the actual drilling making it impossible to visually understand what one is looking at. Writing credits are in abundance here, bringing the story and lives of the on screen characters to realistic life. ""Deepwater Horizon"" is an action packed film for all.

","I didn't expect the film to be that much of an action movie, even though the Deepwater Horizon incident remained at the national forefront for over three months. After the characters are established and the premise of the story is set, the semi-submersible offshore oil drilling rig known as Deepwater Horizon turns into a veritable fireball with employees scrambling for their lives, or in the case of the eleven who didn't make it, a final, forbidding resting place. There's just enough well drilling science interspersed throughout the story to guide the uninitiated about what happened, with a thorough indictment made against the cost cutting maneuvers of the British Petroleum honchos calling the shots. Besides what we see here, I was also expecting in some way the eventual successful effort that shut the oil spill down, but the picture really only followed the tragedy through the first few days until the surviving crew members were all rescued. One's visceral response to the blazing inferno that consumed the oil rig is tempered by the fact that this was a real event that claimed eleven lives. What's impressive is the mammoth undertaking director Peter Berg accepted when offered the challenge to make the film. Extra features on the DVD describe the formidable task, putting you right in the middle of the disaster."

It's a slow build at the beginning but the tension soon rises and you will then be hooked. Deepwater Horizon is a movie that succeeds on two levels: as an action-packed blockbuster and as an honest depiction of a tragic disaster. It's the story of the BP oil rig that exploded and contaminated the Gulf of Mexico. It is great movie.<br/><br/>On April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon, an oil drilling rig operated by private contractor Transocean, is set to begin drilling off the southern coast of Louisiana on behalf of BP.

","From a general perspective I would say that this was quite a good movie trying to relate facts that were unfortunate, not in fiction, but this time in the real. It shows a reality in which unfortunately a small group of fortunate rich guys are willing to talk only profit or revenue for themselves at risk of people losing lives. For whatever reason, I would guess that this is a common case in the petroleum industry.<br/><br/>From a overall perspective I found the acting to be good and story to be captivating. Quite frankly, there are many times where I ranted, felt pity, sadness or concern -; and I would guess that these are the types of emotions that make you realize that the movie was particularly interesting.<br/><br/>The action scenes were overall quite dynamic though some were a little bit pushed to the limit.<br/><br/>The end is probably the most gripping from an emotional standpoint. It definitively makes you realize the amount of suffering and pressure in which ""black gold"" puts some individuals for the sole purpose of consumers who then spend a large spectrum of their lives enjoying the destruction of our planet through pollution. This movie really makes us realize that we do not deserve that and should almost certainly take another kind of direction."

","DEEPWATER HORIZON: Real events - real people. We know what's going to happen, but the exciting thing in the telling is how and why it happened. The events leading up to one of the worst man made disasters in history are suspense-fully told in brilliant fashion by director Peter Berg and his film editor and that's what keeps us on the edge of seats throughout. I learned more about blow out preventers and the fascinating workings of an off shore oil rig than I ever thought I would. The all star cast gives their all which allows us to buy in to every moment. We even get to know these folks on a personal level and the hazards they face daily. The movie also makes a compelling statement about corporate greed. More importantly, eleven people were killed and the closing credits pay a fitting tribute to them. Had it not been for the heroic actions of a few, that number surely would have been much higher. It's probably too much of an ensemble piece for actor noms, but I wouldn't be surprised if Berg gets a directing nom for his work. Score: 8.5. GO."
"Quinoa1984","8","2","4","14 October 2016"," honest and harrowing, led by three remarkable performances
","Deepwater Horizon can't help but be compared to Clint Eastwood's Sully if only because they each came out within a month of each other (if that), and they both involve hard-working, dedicated professionals at their job who pay a varying degree of prices for being at the right place but the most wrong time possible. While one certainly carries the Pedigree of Legends(TM) at the helm, I think that what makes Horizon the better movie is that Berg doesn't muck around with telling his story: these men went to this oil rig (after a safety team left very prematurely), and after a couple of Negative Impact tests the entire rig went to s*** and caught fire.<br/><br/>No, more than that, it turned into the kind of disaster we often take for granted in big 100+ million tentpoles. Only difference here, it's not oil riggers drawn up by Michael Bay - these guys were real, and goddamn it, Peter Berg will make you KNOW it! This is a somewhat manipulative film emotionally speaking, but then Berg isn't out to make something subtle - he can't when it involves a story that is (do I have a synonym I can use for this word, nah, fine) explosive as the one he has here. Like Sully too it's not overlong, clocking in at 96 minutes. Unlike that film this doesn't have such detail into the investigation of what happened after the fact, probably because Berg and his producers and team know there's WAY more than enough drama in just detailing what happened to lead up to the explosion and how it got so out of control. It's a film cut in half structurally: the first is all set-up, giving us the dedicated workers (Mark Wahlberg as our hero, which is emphasized because he's the only one with a wife apparently with Kate Hudson on the other end; Kurt Russell as the character who may be missing from a Howard Hawks movie; John Malkovich playing his best kind of villain, which is slimy and yet icily intelligent), then the second is when things go to hell.<br/><br/>I think the structure works well most of all for the film, and all the actors bring not just emotional intensity; Wahlberg isn't always Olivier (who ever said he was on the other hand), but put him as a commanding but unassuming blue-collar guy and he can give it a great degree of truth. It almost (no, what 'almost', it does) goes into overload in the final minutes of its climax as he and one other character are left on the oil rig, and his character hits the apex of being a Mega-Hero (part of the manipulation I think is strategic - Berg and co. know nearly everyone seeing this movie won't know if Mike Williams comes out alive at the end or not, so all the set-up with his wife and kid at home makes it seem both very obvious and very not). Meanwhile, Russell and Malkovich make good opposing figures, one all about safety as his character in the New Webster Dictionary definition under IRONY gets a safety award within minutes of the devastation, the other all about... well, his own kind of logic, but deep down all about money.<br/><br/>If anyone brought a degree of dimension it actually was Malkovich, who certainly doesn't appear to be someone we are going to have much sympathy with - he comments at one point that BP's worth of 185 billion will go up to 186 with some extra time shaved off to get the oil out - but he also has a job to do, in his way. He seems more pathetic by the end of the film than someone who has been crushed by any other opposing force, and really the villain of the story is fate and pressing against nature: you f*** with the Earth too much and it will fight back. But there's also in Berg's vision not a heavy deal of commentary there either; if you feel guilty driving in your car from the movie theater after seeing this, it's less a direct result of the film's message than it is a by-product.<br/><br/>If there are marks against the filmmaker it's that he brings the same hyper-kinetic shaky-camera style and editing, how he brings us into the filmic space of this location and as the situation unfolds so tragically, and it gets to be much. At times. I say that qualifier because there are some moments, mostly when characters are finding one another in the darkened and chaotic mess right after the explosion, how Mike finds Mr Jimmy and the others, and there it works well. It's when Berg has to cut between so many multiple points of view - the Coast Guard getting things together, men getting on to lifeboats, the woman being put under immense pressure at the station to get things moving (or not, under direct orders), and Kate Hudson at home - that it goes into over-drive. Not so much that I ever lost the thread or felt an emotional disconnect, but it did remind me in an uncanny way ""hey, it's STILL a movie... mostly... you know, right?!"" I think Deepwater Horizon is a good movie. It's honest in its presentation and the depictions of these men on the rig before the explosion, with just enough humanity to them (not to be confused with depth) that you can get invested when it kicks into 1000x gear, and near the very end there's some hard gut-punches that are more about how this *is* a trauma for those who lived through it and it may never go away completely. Could it have been a masterpiece? Not sure... maybe if James Cameron had been there."

I was right.<br/><br/>While I believe this was a great movie and deserves a high rating, to me, it is one of those movies you only need to watch once.

I know that every movie, technically speaking, is an experience, but a lot of movies seem to tell us a story with us looking in from the outside of the films events. This film literally places us in the middle of what is happening, and it does so with style!<br/><br/>There are a few things about this movie that I really enjoyed. First and foremost, the acting! My word, this is by far the most surprising element of the film for me. Every member of this cast does a good job. The two standout performances come from Kurt Russel and John Malkovich.<br/><br/>Kurt Russel is an actor that I haven't seen in ages, and so I'd kind of forgotten about him, but his performance in this movie is so brilliant that it redeems his lack of activity in the past few years. <br/><br/>The special effects used for the explosions in this movie are superb. The film has an extremely realistic feel to it, thanks in know small part to the cinematographer Enrique Chediak, who, while rushing things at times, captures moments of beauty at others.<br/><br/>This movie also does a great job at portraying the oil rig explosion in a very humane way, getting us to sympathize with the characters and their circumstances.<br/><br/>It is just this combination of elements that makes this movie so good. While any other Hollywood director could have made it feel very ungrounded, Peter Berg came and turned it into a thrilling experience with a lot of heart."
"RforFilm","6","2","4","3 October 2016"," Oil and fire create a floating hell in Deepwater Horizon, which creates gripping recreation of the tragedy
","In this day and age of climate change, the world still runs around the oil wheel. It's easy to see why it's called Texas gold; it powers so many elements we live on (vehicles, houses, machines, etc), and it's use only tends to grow. Because it's taken millions of years for this fossil fuel to develop, it's getting scarcer then ever and we've engineered ways to retrieve it deep in the ocean. As I learned at EPCOT when I was nine, most of the oil rigs in the ocean are taller then the Empire State Building. I can certainly admire how far we've come to make that vision become a reality.<br/><br/>The darker side of the picture is that these oil rigs are owned by major companies and they make a lot of money off of this energy. This has made it easy for their greed to make the majority of the decisions, regardless of the environment. <br/><br/>One of their decisions caused the 2010 Oil leak of the Gulf of Mexico. It spewed millions of gallons of petroleum making it the worst oil disaster in US history. The story of the ship that started it is retold in the dramatic disaster film, Deepwater Horizon. <br/><br/>We start on the morning of April 20, 2010 where Chief Electronics Technician Mike Williams (played by Mark Wahlberg) is waking up with his wife Felicia (played by Kate Hudson). He's leaving for another round on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which is out on the Gulf of Mexico. Some of the other people joining his is supervisor Jimmy Harrell (played by Kurt Russell), navigation worker Andrea Fleytas (played by Gina Rodriguez) and the rest of the oil workers. Coming on board in BP (the company in charge of the Deepwater Horizon) is corporate man Donald Vidrine (played by John Malkovich).<br/><br/>Jimmy and Mike make it clear to Donald that the ship and it's machines are in need of great repair and that it's errors have placed a lot of strain on the oil well. It seems to be releasing gas pressures higher then usual, but Donald see's this as routines and orders to run tests as scheduled. Just as history as taught us, the pressure of the petroleum proves too much, causing it to erupt and set off a series of explosions. Or that night, Deepwater Horizon became a floating Hell as the surviving oil workers get off before it's too late.<br/><br/>Directed by Peter Berg and staring Mark Wahlberg, Deepwater Horizon has a similar feel to their previous collaboration, Lone Survivor. Again, the focus seems to be more about the experience rather then a character study. While the later felt more empty then it should have been, this style works much better here. This film is set up more like a disaster film, which means you know your going to get an exciting series of action, but not so much in character. This proves similar here as it was hard to distinguish personalities from the various people on that ship (I think they were hoping the actors playing the real life characters would fill the gaps).<br/><br/>Much of the dialogue consists of a lot of how the oil rigs work and the controversies surrounding the age of their equipment. A lot of that was hard to follow, with the exception of the material aiming to make BP the villain here. Though I was alright with that, I could tell the majority of the audience was waiting for the rig to go off and get on with the action scenes. Had more work been put into the first half, I would have proclaimed this as one of the best of the year. But as a simple disaster movie, it was an entertaining story about survival.<br/><br/>I'll give this six oil spill updates out of ten. Overall, I felt like the experience was genuine, but I wish the characters would have been more interesting to follow. While I'm sure they took creative liberties, this is a case in which I would have wanted more in order to make a better movie. Sometimes changes are needed to tell a better story. If you can, see this on the big screen if you really wanted to know what being on the Deepwater Horizon before that tragic oil spill."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","8","2","4","1 October 2016"," More than just a disaster movie, but could have been so much more.
","I have always enjoyed Peter Berg's movies, even the not-so-well received films like Battleship and Welcome To The Jungle. Hancock, The Kingdom and of course, Lone Survivor are my favourites of his work. Here he reunites with Lone Survivor, Mark Wahlberg to give us a visual account of the largest oil disaster in U.S. history. <br/><br/>Yes, it is a disaster movie but there's quite a firm message here, and an outstanding tribute to the people who both lost and saved lives on that horrific day. The films spends a portion of it's 107min running time going through the corporate politics in an attempt to point accountability. This actually works in creating tension and tells more of the story than just the oil rig blowing out, even though we know what's going to happen. <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg takes the lead role of Mike Williams, the chief electronics technician on board the impressive semi-submersible oil drilling rig, who is still haunted by event today. Kurt Russell plays Jimmy Harrell, the Installations Manager, responsible for the 126 souls on board the South Korean built, Swiss owed rig. Both are met with friction when confronting BP heads about taking short-cuts and ignoring safety measures which eventually leads to the uncontrollable eruption that took 11 lives and caused catastrophic damage on some many levels. John Malkovich always does so great at playing the hard, unlikable, no polite way of putting this, but arsehole, the corporate appeasing dictator more concerned with profit margins than the safety of people and the planet. You just want to punch him in the face. <br/><br/>We get the idea the crew know each other well and that they're part of tight community of veteran oil rig workers. In real life the rig had been operational for seven years prior to April 2010 without any serious incident and had broken the record for deepest well ever drilled just several months before. <br/><br/>The main character in this film though, is the oil itself, the ferocious beast that's unleashed and is shown how it devours everything, destroying people's lives, the rig and setting the ocean ablaze. The action was incredibly intense, violent and unforgiving, reminding me very much of James Cameron's The Abyss, but a hundred times more relentless. <br/><br/>The story attempts to gain empathy with all involved but there wasn't enough emotional investment with the family and I'm sure that was the purpose of Kate Hudson's part, to add a realistic humility to the happenings that would normally go amiss when watching this on the news. It tried again at the end but misses it's mark, however there is still a very strong message here and I think I got it. <br/><br/>The film focuses on the individuals involved which is honourable and understandable but I feel they should have included the consequential aftermath of this event, the massive operation launched to help protect the marine ecosystems, the spill spanning 68k square miles. Not only did it have a devastating impact on the environment and marine life, but damaged the tourism, international relations and in more ways than one, the economy. <br/><br/>BP was ultimately held responsible, being deemed negligent and reckless, and fined the largest corporate fine of $18.7billion bringing the total settlement payments to over $60billion. They also suffered a 40% drop in American revenue due to the public boycott. But who cares about the money, it's not about that, it's about the people who were on board at the time she blew. <br/><br/>In light of this, President Obama set things in motion which resulted in the halting operations of 33 rigs and Canadian officials scrutinised offshore drilling companies, even Arnold Schwarzenegger withdrew his support from expanding offshore drilling. I feel if this film wanted to hammer the point home, they should have been more copious with the amount of guilty facts laying it on thick and hopefully gaining the full empathy the crew deserves. <br/><br/>The sets are amazing, resurrecting the rig by building a replica, the largest set piece ever built just off the coast of Louisiana. The effects are stunning, if not frightening, capturing the horrors the crew faced during the incident. Everything looked so very real and accurate. <br/><br/>I loved Steve Jablonsky's score, who composes a similar triumphant theme to Lone Survivor. It does amazingly well creating pressure with building crescendos and then exploding with violent noise only to be follow by calming running beats that sound like helicopters that offers some relief. Definitely one of my favourite scores of the year. <br/><br/>It's an amazing tribute to the 11 lost souls they never found after Deepwater Horizon and to the key people who tried to regain control and heroically saved lives from the tragedy. It's a little more than just a disaster movie but it could have been so much more. <br/><br/>Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 9 Direction: 8 Story: 7 Script: 7 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for being a good tribute to the individuals involved. Would I buy the Bluray?: Yes <br/><br/>78% 8/10"

","I saw ""Deepwater Horizon"", starring Mark Wahlberg-Daddy's Home, Boogie Nights; Kurt Russell-The Hateful Eight, Tango & Cash; Kate Hudson- Mother's Day, Glee_tv and John Malkovich-The Red movies, Jonah Hex.<br/><br/>This movie is based on a true story about the offshore oil drilling rig- Deepwater Horizon-that was responsible for the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. It happened in April of 2010. It's directed by Peter Berg, a former actor himself who has directed Lone Survivor, Hancock & Friday Night Lights, just to name a few, and he directs this movie just like it was an action packed disaster movie. This also marks the first time that Kate has worked on screen with her step-father, Kurt. I was a little familiar with the incident but this goes into more of the details that led up to the disaster. Mark & Kurt work on the oil rig that is about 50 miles off shore. Kate plays Mark's wife and John is the corporate BP executive that is more interested in profits than anything else. Kurt is the boss of the rig and when John pushes for results-they are 43 days behind schedule-corners are cut and safety precautions are ignored. Besides the approximate 5 million barrels of oil that leaked during the ecological disaster, 11 people died and they are acknowledged as the end credits start with their names and photos. FYI: If you are a country music fan, keep an eye out for Trace Adkins-some know him as Tracy Adkins but in the credits, he uses Trace. He has a small cameo near the end of the movie-he picks Mark up and shakes him pretty violently. It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense disaster sequences, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. Although I don't think I would buy it on DVD, it was better than I was expecting it to be and it would be a great rental."

","1st watched 10/15/2016 :
Well done recreation of the BP oil rig that blew up in 2010 and started a major investigation. The movie is ""not"" about the investigation, but about the oil rig(called ""Deepwater Horizon""), and the people who worked on it and were a part of the disaster. This movie shines because it focuses on this aspect of the incident(the disaster itself). It stars a bunch of capable actors including Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, and Kate Hudson - who encompass a story, I believe, that people want to hear. The workers knew they weren't in for a cakewalk when they boarded the hovering ship. Right away - the 2 big dogs(Russell & Wahlberg) question the lack of a concrete stress test. The bigwigs are interested in getting the drilling done as quickly as possible, but the ones that know what they are doing won't easily falter. Eventually - after a few stress tests - they allow the drilling to happen, but things soon fall apart. The rest of the movie is the action of the disaster - unknown by most folks, without seeing this movie. This is why the movie is so interesting and effective. Not to be missed."

","This movie was great in showing the disaster happened in April 20,2010 intially and was followed by oil spill in Gulf of Mexico for a few months! the movie clearly shows what happened and why this happened. I just saw this movie and I enjoyed it. during the movie the crew on oil rig ran a negative test( a test which basically is done before the mission starts to see if the pipes can handle the pressure and if there is any pressure on the main pipe). They say that there is a huge pressure on the main pipe but the coordinators on this event asked them to run this mission anyways without really think of how dangerous the situation is. What worst is the manager of the crew team (the one who has to give the crew permission to start the mission) thought that pressure would be okay. He was under the pressure of supervisors because the project was behind about 51 days. So they started pumping up the oil and eventually the pressure built up and pipes broke down. massive amount of pressure was on pipes and oil started flowing out. following this the generators started to work faster than normal and the heat they produced made a massive fire and then a explosion and one second later the whole rig was on fire. the movie pictured all these events just fine and what is sad is that 11 crew members lost their lives and about 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled out in the ocean. It was the greatest tragedy in oil industry for the U.S. I personally recommend to definitely watch this movie."

"davideo-2","7","0","0","7 June 2017"," Efficient, well handled but not completely satisfactory dramatisation
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In April 2010, on the titular oil rig off the coast of Mexico, the worst oil disaster in US history occurred, that cost seven lives and had enormous environmental and sociological repercussions for months afterwards. Peter Berg's film follows the story of Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), an oil worker whose job has estranged him from his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) and young daughter. He and site inspector Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) raise concerns about the lack of training of the crew, and the inadequacy of the safety checks, but BP crony Vidrine (John Malkovich) insists the job goes ahead, leading to the cataclysmic disaster which they are lucky to escape from alive.<br/><br/>Before this year's second Mark Wahlberg/Peter Berg true life tragedy drama Patriot's Day, they had made this account of a major disaster that occurred at the start of the decade, but still rings a solemn chord in the hearts of many today. Like the aforementioned film, it provides plenty of meat on the bones in terms of potential for making a film, a story of gross corporate negligence and blue collar sacrifice that was begging to be told. Whether it's been made by the most competent crew is for the individual to decide, but it's certainly got an all star cast at its dispersal to cover plenty of ground.<br/><br/>Berg certainly succeeds in building up plenty of tension and anticipation of the main event, establishing some believable, accurate depictions of everyday, blue collar rig workers going about their normal business, slinging their normal slang/banter and venting their usual spleens. And when the big explosion does arrive, it still takes its time before enveloping into the big, earth shattering spectacle that it is even if, like Titanic, it's bad taste to think 'wow' about it, since it's a reflection of a real life tragedy. In spite of this, the characters themselves do feel a bit Hollywood stereotype, especially Wahlberg's impeccably selfless hero. It would also have gained a bit more dynamism if it had shown some of the aftermath of the tragedy, in the shape of the courtroom dynamics between the BP executives and the aggrieved workers/families. This would arguably have made for a more interesting film all in itself.<br/><br/>It seems as if Berg/Wahlberg may want to make a franchise out of these dramatisations of real life disasters/heroism. He's not really the best director for it and he's not really the best actor for it, but their ambition to shine a light on the plight of the downtrodden victims is still admirable, and this is still an efficient and well handled effort. ***"

","Peter Berg's directing style is incredibly similar to that of Michael Bay's, no matter how much one tries to ignore it, Peter Berg makes it very difficult to brush off. This time round however, instead of always coming second to Bay in almost every way, when comparing Deepwater Horizon to 13 Hours, Deepwter Horizon blows 13 Hours out the water, so to speak... Sadly, Peter needed a budget 3 times higher though, to accomplish that.<br/><br/>The build up in the movie and the character interactions, are very reminiscent of films like Armageddon, Transformers and 13 Hours... Peter Berg tried this before with Battleship, and failed dismally. This time though, it came across as a whole lot more natural... And, he has the cast to thank.<br/><br/>Unlike Battleship, that was helmed by Taylor Kitsch, Brooklyn Decker and the oh so terrible Rihanna, Deepwater Horizon had Mark, Kurt, Dylan and John; nothing, but a talented cast all around.<br/><br/>The rig explosion set piece was, amazingly wonderful. Cinematography was on point, even though there were quite a few mechanisms I didn't understand, that translated into visual jargon.<br/><br/>While watching the movie, I wondered to myself; is Vidrine really in the wrong here? When arguing with Mr. Jimmy, he presented arguments that nobody could oppose, and on top of that, even suggested a second test, to prove his theory. But then I remembered, that, from the VERY moment Mr. Jimmy set foot on that rig, he constantly wanted to know the ""cement"" situation, because of how vitally important it was, just to find that, Vidrine and Kaluza were behind that suicidal decision to begin with.<br/><br/>I appreciated that Deepwater Horizon didn't go on longer than it needed to. The directing was perhaps Peter Berg's best, the cinematography was on point and the cast, top notch. Why Kate Hudson was such a misrepresentation of Felicia Williams however, I guess we'll never know. Anyway, well drilled 7.5/10."

","This movie based on real events of the biggest oil spoil in US waters was pretty good. I thought it introduced the secondary characters as best it could, mainly the wife and kid of Mike Williams. The film even tries to relay to people via the kid's school project, what exactly is going on at the rig, but the whole kill line and pressure still didn't make much sense to me. Anyways the action was good and great special effects with all the fiery explosions. It'a wonder the whole rig just didn't explode right away with the gas in the air and most would have died. Instead 11 didn't survive, which was amazing considering all the explosions. <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Interesting topic and good special effects. Worth a viewing."

","I really enjoyed this picture and will recommend it. Peter Berg had a factual event to bring to the screen and he did so without lots of Hollywood dramatization and kept to the facts. There is enough drama in the real disaster that it does not require embellishment. Mark Wahlberg once again works with Berg and the two seem to work well together. Kate Hudson got to work with Kurt Russell who she calls her dad as he raised her and it was good to finally see them in a scene together near the end. The event is well documented so I will not get into that but the movie gives you an inside view of what happened but not exactly why it happened. Suffice to say that BP Petroleum is responsible for the 11 mens deaths."
"Turfseer","7","0","0","1 May 2017"," Despite lugubrious first half, chronicle of oil rig explosion and heroic crew member actions, hits the mark
","If you want to learn about the greatest oil spill ever as well as the greatest environmental disaster in US history, Deepwater Horizon is the film to watch. The most incredible thing about this film is the set—a reproduction of the semi-submersible Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) which blew up—it's as if you're watching the real thing!<br/><br/>Deepwater is basically a great technical achievement. As far as the story—a good part of it has a documentary feel. Our protagonist is the real-life Chief Electronics Techician Mike Williams played by Mark Wahlberg. Early on we meet his wife and young daughter and unfortunately the beginning of the film is quite lugubrious as there isn't much drama involving William's family life. <br/><br/>Only after Williams ships out to the oil rig do things become moderately interesting. Director Peter Berg, utilizing inter-titles, informs us that the rig is run by a private contractor, Transocean, and led by the stalwart safety engineer, ""Mr. Jimmy"" (played by a convincing Kurt Russell). Ironically the day the rig blew up, Mr. Jimmy was receiving an award for his excellent safety record on the rig.<br/><br/>A conflict erupts between Mr. Jimmy and the BP (British Petroleum) Manager Donald Vidrine (played by a not so recognizable John Malkovich). Mr. Jimmy wants Vidrine to conduct a ""pressure test"" which will ensure the stability of the entire platform. Vidrine really wants to cut corners and gives a not so plausible explanation as to why he feels the test isn't necessary.<br/><br/>I've read that Vidrine actually didn't give the orders not to conduct the test —that was attributed to some other manager; ultimately, it was BP execs offshore who had the final word on that. But Vidrine makes a nice foil to Kurt Russell's character so there is a bit of dramatic license taken here.<br/><br/>No need to go into great detail as far as the depiction of the explosion and its aftermath. Suffice it to say that Wahlberg does an excellent job highlighting William's heroic actions saving crew members as well as himself by jumping from the rig into water laced with burning oil.<br/><br/>If disaster movies are your thing, then Deepwater Horizon should be for you. As a fitting memorial to those who perished (11 in total), director Berg makes good on depicting the sacrifice involved. A good half of the movie is exposition but there's enough heroic derring-do to keep you glued to your seat in the second half."

","OK I hate the reviews everyone gives for this film. What did y'all expect when you decided to buy a movie ticket to go watch this movie. If you thought this movie was all about the economical side of it all then your stupid enough to realize that it wasn't. From the moment I saw the trailer I knew that Peter Berg was geared tired more of the life of the riggers and what happened on board of the rig and I knew he was gonna portray that. Did it seem like a typical Michael Bay movie, yes. I knew a fire broke out and all but what Peter Berg did was add all this big explosions and fire shooting at them and the camera shaky effect kinda made it a little bit non realistic in a way but still I bet that did happen on that rig and how the big fire erupted and caused a lot of destruction, we know that happened. <br/><br/>The plot could've been better and well written I can give you that but acting wise I think everyone did a great job and Peter Berg put up an amazing cast for this film. It gets deep and emotional and it will cut right into you if you pay close attention. This film had my heart racing. Every second watching it and seeing how Mark would maneuver past those fires and how everyone was trying to stop the flood of oil and all these fires erupting from different places had me at the edge of my seat. What Peter Berg wanted for us to see and feel is there pain on that rig and what happened on that day on April 20th, 2010. He wanted us to feel there pain and have us at the edge of our seats just waiting to what will happen next<br/><br/>All I gotta say is if there were more options for rating this film I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10 but since there is none I'll settle with a 9. I definitely recommend this to anyone"

On the other hand it does seem a bit cliché to call out a big company like that. And you really do need a great actor to represent that company so it doesn't fall short on many aspects (and the movie did a good job at casting one).<br/><br/>It starts off pretty easy and slow, but early on you can tell that something is about to happen. Foreshadowing like at the breakfast table is almost not necessary, but it does add an extra touch. When the mayhem begins though, there is no stopping and the effects are up for it.

","The development of the situation -- in which safety and maintenance corners were cut because of project delays, is realistic, and quite well done.

We couldn't hear much on our newer Sony Bravia with or without Philips sound-bar. So we watched it on our older Panasonic Quintrix TV (with LG DVD player), and that was A LOT better. However, I still had to ramp the sound up for some quieter conversations; and then down for the deafening explosions and other sound effects (chopper noise etc). In that sense it was one of the poorer movies we've ever watched. Maybe it was aimed at movie audiences...with ear-plugs. One of the other reviewers commented on the poor audio, as well.

","It was a surprising film. Because it was based on a real event, but there's nothing much about heroism which is essential for most of this kind of film and its success to inspire the viewers. I liked that. They just wanted to tell the story. Not to create a hero nor a villain. But due to the casting, Mark Wahlberg looks the centre of the story. And also points out a negative character without confirming anything properly. But if the film is depicting the real incident correctly, then it was no man's fault. It should be a technical error that led to the man's push over the limit.<br/><br/>It's April 20 2010 about 60 kms away southern coast of the US in the Gulf of Mexico. A new batch arrives to continue drilling in the deep sea as part of oil exploration. When they felt they have got it, but it's only a back foot. Small small errors, following a big blow, the entire crew with the greater effort to stop it ends in vain. Finally, it is a matter of saving their own life than the drilling platform. With lots of action, how one of the biggest man made disaster in the recent time comes to end covered in the remaining part.<br/><br/>From the director of 'Lone Survivor' and his part in the project was appreciable. It is another sea disaster theme like the recent 'The Finest Hours'. The film was mainly developed from the articles and also got nominated for the Oscars in two categories, but did not win any. Visual effects were the key for such film and I liked those parts. I appreciate for recreating the event for the world know what really happened. It is a must see, not for entertainment purpose, but it will work for that as well. Recommended!<br/><br/>7½/10"

","This film is fairly close to as advertised. It deals with a real-life disaster, brings you close to the action, show the explosion with some special effects, keeps you in some suspense, and adds some ""feel good"" element that some people are ""ok"" at the end of it. It stars Mark Wahlberg, and this is right up his alley. However, the film seemed too long (it is not that long). The lead-up to the explosion was too slow and the technical jargon used during that section of the film did not help as I think it was lost on the audience in general. The draw of a real-disaster is understandable; however, this movie is nowhere near thought-provoking, political or anything like that. It does summarize some facts at the end, but those facts don't say much either. I do find it unfortunate that the movie was not made to be more thought provoking, but I understand that was not the focus of this movie. Unfortunately, by having such a superficial focus, the movie needed to be about a half hour shorter. The acting performances were fine, but nothing special."

","Real stories about tragic events have the advantage of being harrowing without much effort because the accounts of the truth do much of the job for them. It takes a distinct type of filmmaker to raise the film above the standard. While director Peter Berg doesn't completely connect the dots, he promotes a tale of responsibility that will antagonize the wrath inside of all of us. ""Deepwater Horizon"" rallies emotion in the wake of truth.<br/><br/>""Deepwater Horizon"" tells the tragic true story of the oil driller that due to negligence and fault of the BP Oil Company, created the worst oil spill in history.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is an actor I've tended to be harder on than most lately with his choice of roles. Here he puts forth a genuine, heartfelt portrayal. Always placing himself in the ""hero"" position, he manages to tap into a delicate enactment of a man desperate to survive. He gets to show off a new accent that isn't south Boston, while digging deep to show real emotion. It's his best performance since ""The Fighter.""<br/><br/>The film boasts an all-star cast, some of which are doing adequate work. As the ship's captain, Kurt Russell continues to explore lively, vigorous roles in his later career. John Malkovich does all but twirl his mustache as the corrupt and pushy executive. Gina Rodriguez steps out of her ""Jane the Virgin"" motif to investigate a new, compassionate character and achieves a noble offering. Oscar nominee Kate Hudson plays the famed ""woman on phone,"" but in some cases, just ""woman on Skype.""<br/><br/>Berg's direction has been problematic on bigger blockbusters like ""Battleship,"" but with penetrating and vital material he gets to show the world what he can truly attain. Arguably not as emotionally resourceful as ""Lone Survivor,"" it is perhaps cleaner in its assimilation of story and filmmaking technique. He runs the bases with his editing and sound team. They pulsate tension like there is an unlimited supply. Ingesting the central concept will undoubtedly infuriate the viewer as we're shown another key example of money corrupting our beloved Mother Earth. It provokes a sense of a revolution within yourself in exchange for liberating your own customary ideals of the standard ""based on a true story"" movie. It just presents the facts, and not much else.<br/><br/>""Deepwater Horizon"" has heart. It has passion. It has a willingness to take the viewer into the dark and terrifying scene of that fateful day. With a more comprehensive script or more deeply natured approach in the future, Berg may be able to create his masterpiece, whatever that may end up being.<br/><br/>GRADE: (★★★)"

","It's odd that this movie, DEEPWATER HORIZON, arrives on DVD this week. We're in the middle of a world where the definitions of words like hero or brave are being tossed about in the most ridiculous manner. Without saying she was right or wrong, Meryl Streep just gave an impassioned speech after accepting a lifetime achievement award and used her time to speak poorly of President Elect Trump. Afterwards people in Hollywood talked about how brave she was. She was speaking in front of an audience almost all of which agreed with her in a town that felt the same. That doesn't seem brave to me.<br/><br/>What does seem brave are people who lay their lives on the line everyday to get the job done. What makes some of them even braver are the actions they display in situations of adversity. That's what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>Unless you were living in a cave from 2010 on you are well aware of the decimation of the offshore oil drilling rig Deepwater Horizon off the coast of Texas that led to the largest oil spill in history. While most of us were concerned with what happened the focus of that story was on the oil spill itself and on the responsibility of the companies who owned the rig to answer for that spill. This movie takes that story to a different level and talks about the people who were on that rig.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) at home as he's about to head out to the rig for a 21 day tour. He sits with his daughter and talks about what he does for a living, helping her out with a report she has to write for school. Saying goodbye to her and his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) he takes off for work.<br/><br/>We also focus on two other people in this story of what happened. The first is Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez), dealing with a car she's rebuilding before going in to work. The second is Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell), the grizzled veteran in charge of the safety for the rig. The three meet up at an air base where helicopters fly them out to the rig to get to work.<br/><br/>When they arrive things aren't going as planned. The construction of the rig is 40 odd days behind schedule. The team responsible for checking the concrete substructure is on their way home which upsets Harrell since he knows they didn't have time to do a full inspection of the rig. This brings about a confrontation between Harrell and the company men from BP led by Vidrine (John Malkovich). Vidrine, concerned more about the delays and the costs involved, insists that the test be run on the rig and it begin to pump drilling mud.<br/><br/>Harrell concedes but before he can make sure things are running smooth he is escorted to a hall below where other members from the company bestow a safety award to him and a celebration is set, cake and all. Shortly after the party begins Mike heads for his work station and Harrell heads for a shower.<br/><br/>When the inevitable happens, the foundation not being ready to stand up to the pressure involved, a geyser of mud, water and gas blow from the drill and disaster follows. Men are tossed about and wounded, including Mike and Harrell. It doesn't take long for things to go from bad to worse as the rig explodes and catches fire. Now it is up to the crew to do what they can to seal off the drill site and make their way off of the rig before they die.<br/><br/>As I said the story is well known so there is no chance of spoilers with the exception of who makes it off alive and who doesn't. Sad to say that on that day 11 crew members lost their lives. In some cases it was immediate and in others they had an opportunity to display the heroism that is real, that means something at the end of the day. The film offers a nicely placed tribute to each of these men, showing their names and pictures just before the credits roll and before the names of anyone else.<br/><br/>What I found unusual about the film is that with the star power involved none of the actors felt like they took center stage here. Perhaps Wahlberg could be said to do so because of the backstory involving his family and the fact his image was used to sell the movie. But all involved have a chance to bring to life this story of a tragedy on one hand and a display of bravery on the other.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film might be a bit slow for some but we're not being offered a thought out story here. This is real life, this really happened and the events that flowed happened in real time not made up story land. While the movie is well made with some creative special effects put to good use, I'm not sure it's a movie you'll want to watch over and over again. It brings to life what could be painful memories for some. But it does need to be seen once in order to learn what real heroism is all about. It offers that story in spades."

"sddavis63","8","0","0","16 January 2017"," A Good Depiction Of What Happened On The Rig
","When we think of the Deepwater Horizon incident I suspect that most people tend to think of the massive leak, that leaked literally hundreds of millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of several weeks before the leak was sealed. It was one of the most massive environmental disasters in American history. What doesn't stand out in my memory, though, is what happened on the oil rig itself. This movie tries to fill in that gap, and does so admirably.<br/><br/>Much of it is told from the perspective of Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), the chief electrician on the Deepwater Horizon. It opens by giving us a glimpse of his family life (enough to make this a very human and poignant story, but it's not overdone.) Once on the Horizon, we're introduced to various crew members, as well as a couple of executives from BP, who own the rig and the well. There's a lot of technical content, much of which went over my head, but I wonder if that might have been very deliberate. I may not have understood exactly what was happening, but I understood clearly enough that there was a problem building. <br/><br/>The early tension comes from conflict between the crew (especially ""Mr. Jimmy"" - the captain, played by Kurt Russell) who know something isn't right, and the BP execs (the most important played by John Malkovich) who push the crew to keep going because their primary concern is that the project is over budget and behind schedule. When money takes priority over safety the result usually won't be good. In this case it's not. The well explodes, the rig is caught up in a massive fire, and the crew is left in a desperate struggle to survive.<br/><br/>Everything is very well portrayed and the cast does a very good job of drawing the viewer into the story and making you care. I've never been on an oil rig, but the set seemed authentic and gave the viewer the sense of being there. The buildup of tension is well done and once disaster strikes this becomes fast-paced and exciting. Peter Berg did a good job directing. Well done all around."

"CineMuseFilms","7","0","0","16 October 2016"," as spectacular a dramatization of an oil-rig explosion that digital effects allow
","The moral of most man-made disaster films is that when civilisation disrespects nature the results can be catastrophic. Such films work best when we get both sides of the story: the why and what happened on humanity's side, and nature's response and effects on the other. It is clear that big money was involved in the 2010 oil-rig disaster that is examined in Deepwater Horizon (2016). In fact, there is so much at stake that the most significant part is left out of the film: the immediate and long term effects of the worst ecological disaster in American history.<br/><br/>Instead of the full story, the film offers as spectacular a dramatization of an oil-rig explosion that digital effects allow. The one-day plot line is simple and tight. It starts with a human interest back story of Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) having time off as boss of the Deepwater Horizon oil-rig, and his home life is sweet. Kissing wife and daughter goodbye, he heads off for a 21-day rig shift and on the helicopter ride we meet the British Petroleum bad guy executives. Tension lines are drawn immediately between Mike's safety maintenance role and the 'hurry up and make more money' pressure from the company.<br/><br/>A great strength of this film is its ability to convey the dirty, claustrophobic and technology- dependent world of offshore oil-drilling. It is full of whiteboard diagram explanations, fear-inducing instrument dials with pointers drifting into red zones and grim-faced technicians who sense something calamitous is near. It also shows a grimy environment in which humans strip non- renewable resources from deep in our planet, all for profit. When poor safety and maintenance practices lead to the massive blowout and explosion, the film is at its best in portraying a veritable Dante's Inferno on water. Hyper-realistic imaging conveys uncontrolled gushing oil, roaring flames, and flying bodies in ways unimaginable just a few years ago.<br/><br/>The camera-work draws you into the rig with a colour palette that leaves the taste of petroleum in your mouth, but the chaos during the worst of the explosion is beyond cinematic capture. For a large part of the film it is difficult to know what is happening, but that would have been the case when it really happened. If this film intended to be a tribute to the heroic crew, both those who survived and those who did not, then it falls short. Typecast performances are effective in distinguishing the good guys from the bad, but that is all. Nor does it acknowledge the devastation that followed the disaster. It does, however, fill a gap in public awareness about this catastrophic event and that is an achievement."

","""Deepwater Horizon"" (2016 release; 107 min.) brings the story of the 2010 oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. As the movie opens, we see Mike and Felicia wake up, shortly before Mike is off on his next 21 day stint on the rig. Mike and other gather at the Bristow heliport, where they leave on the 45 min. flight out to the rig. On the flight are also 2 BP senior manager, who are coming to take a look why the rip is 43 days (and tens of millions of dollars) behind schedule. Once on the Deepwater Horizon, it doesn't take long before tension mounts between the BP guys and the Transocean guys who are operating the rig. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this movie marks the reunion between director Peter Berg and Mark Walhberg (who stars and produces), as a few year ago they brought us the excellent ""Lone Survivor"". At the beginning of the film, we are told that this is ""based on true events"", which for me typically means ""this is the Hollywood version of what happened"". I have no idea how much artistic liberty the film makers have taken to make this into a compelling movie. As long as you can live with the fact that this is perhaps (or likely) a condensed or partly-imagined version of the truth, you are in for one heck of a film. Indeed, the film is roughly divided up equally between pre-disaster, and then the actual disaster. Just when you think that it can't get any worse, it does, and I found myself at the edge of my seat on more than one occasion. The photography is pure eye-candy from start to finish (quite a bit must've been CGI but it sure looks incredibly real). There are some great lines in the movie. When asked by the BP guy to assess the rig, Mike says ""It's like a plane running out of gas as it's landing"", wow. And someone else comments that the rig is sitting on ""the well from hell"", ha! Walhberg is his usual solid, but the best performances for me came from rugged Kurt Russell (as ""Mr. Jimmy"", the rig's manager) and, even better, John Malkovich as one of the BP meanies.<br/><br/>""Deepwater Horizon"" opened a few weekends ago, but scheduling conflicts and other commitment kept me from seeing this until now. The Thursday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not attended well (not a surprise, given the time and day). What is surprising is that, despite mostly positive reviews and reactions from the critic and the public at large, it has vastly under-performed at the box office, even more so if you keep in mind the movie's astronomical (north of 100 mill) budget (and the movie looks its budget). I was looking forward to seeing this, and I ended up liking it even more than I had expected. A movie like this needs to be experienced on the big screen for maximum impact. ""Deepwater Horizon"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

","I usually hate CGI, but the director and his team got it right on this one! WOW! Wahlburg keeps playing these hero characters and has taken below average talent as an actor to the limit. Evidently, he is box office gold because he works consistently.<br/><br/>For those who want this to be Lone Survivor, guess what...it is a different movie! Yes, it played like so many other movies where the director lays the first thirty mins with backstory, hoping to develop identity. This played very similar to Ladder 49 years ago.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see Nic Cage with such a small role. Same with John Malkovich, but we got to see some classic Malkovich'isms in his character. Kurt Russell never disappoints. He can become believable in a minute to his character.<br/><br/>This movie was very emotional (again, credit to the director) and Wahlberg did a good job, especially when he broke down in the hotel room. The relationship he had with his wife laid the foundation that this was a man of character and that they were deeply in love with each other.<br/><br/>The BP oil guys seemed cliché, but if that really happened, and I believe it did, we see how; ""you cannot get a man to understand something when his career depends upon him NOT understanding."" Bottom line, one's loyalty to company blinds him/her of truth. We are all guilty of this in some manner.<br/><br/>Watch this movie in the theater. It is very intense! That said, how many commercials can one take before the movie starts? Are you kidding me? No wonder people stay home. I paid the price of admission, leave the commercials to TV! Absolutely ridiculous."

","This film pleasantly surprised me by giving more entertainment value than expected, considering it's a true story, we all followed the news at the time and we know what happened. In trying to decide why it was such good entertainment, I think it's 70% due to the sheer realism of the scenes, and 30% due to the acting. I don't mean to imply the quality of the acting was only 30%, no; it was pretty good in my opinion. The quality of life and routine on the rig was covered very well, we should remember that even the helicopter trips there and back are a risk in their own right. In the post-accident scenes there's a tremendous sense of the sheer violence of the environment, more resembling a war zone during a bombardment than a workplace. The downside, though, at least for me, was that all this confusion led to a sense of my not knowing anything, really, about what was going on. Rather than a linear story line moving along a sequence of locations, we're in multiple locations with multiple story lines which blur into one another; with this technique the director does transmit the terrifying sense of ""OMG what do we do now"" that those on the rig must have suffered. Definitely worth watching."

","Director Peter Berg's approach to the real-life oil rig disaster is about as sober as it is possible to be in a movie that gets its rocks off by blowing stuff up. Mark Wahlberg, reuniting with Berg after the effective army picture Lone Survivor, is on fine form as everyman hero Mike Williams; John Malkovich tackles the antagonist role of a cynical BP company man with a lip-smacking relish. The visual effects are solid, but the sound design is where tension builds – we become so accustomed to the constant creak and crack of tortured metal that a moment of silence fills us with dread. What's most impressive is the fact that the screenplay refuses to talk down to the audience. The men and women on the rig talk pretty much as they would, with no handy translation for our benefit. It's the most gripping discussion of cement integrity since. Erez Harosh"

","Deepwater Horizon is about the drilling rig that exploded in 2010, causing the worst oil spill in US history. <br/><br/>The movie is, despite being quite a big deal when the event happened, actually rather boring. It starts off with the characters all doing their job. And that's fine because we need to develop these characters, right? But the problem is is that it spends half it's total run time doing so. Meaning we get to see the main characters doing their job for a full 50 minutes before anything of real significance happens. So for the first half it's just kind of a terrible movie. It's so incredibly boring with nothing really going for it. <br/><br/>Even when stuff starts happening though, it's still kind of boring. Sure everything's blowing up, but it never seemed like the characters were in any real peril. I know that they were in real life, but when it seemed like all they had to do was jump into the water and swim to the nearby boat, it didn't really seem like what was happening was really that perilous. Sure there were a few scenes that were kind of epic, as in the last 10 or so minutes, but that's not enough to carry an entire movie. That, and I was probably still almost asleep from the first half. <br/><br/>Despite this, the make-up was pretty good, and so were the special effects. Visually, it is a pretty good movie, but as a whole not so much. <br/><br/>Overall Deepwater Horizon was boring and uninteresting. It did a poor job of portraying how much danger the main characters were in, and while I know that in real life they were, the movie really didn't do it justice.

","You can tell the story of the BP oil spill in several different perspective. It can be about the events that leads to the spill, or it can be about how the spill was stopped.<br/><br/>This movie is none of the above. Although it may seem like the movie explained the sequence that led to the spill, unfortunately it was explained in terms that most moviegoers won't understand. For example, do you know what a negative pressure test of the drill pipe is supposed to do? Or what a kill line is? Or the significant of ""mud""? Nothing is explained. All I know is a lot of people are doing a lot of stuff and eventually something went wrong. I assume the movie maker didn't really want the audience to understand what was going on, or else they would have explained in more detail.<br/><br/>So what's left for the audience to understand then? A lot of explosion and people trying to escape. And there is really no ending. It's like watching a news footage of a fire.<br/><br/>I have seen a documentary about this disaster and it was way more interesting than this movie."
"servaasstrobbe","8","2","5","28 December 2016"," A very unexpected great movie!
","This is my first review ever on IMDb. I never could have thought it would be this movie, mainly because after hearing about it and seeing the trailer I had such low expectations for it. I don't really like Mark Wahlbergs acting, the director Peter Berg hasn't made a lot of movies that were any good and the plot seemed a bit weird at first, the heroic story of the people responsible for the biggest oil spill in recent history. Also 2016 was the year of movie let downs, I think most of us can agree on that.<br/><br/>So I went into this movie quite skeptical, thinking it would be as close to true facts as Harry Potter and would treat its audience as dumb children. And yes the first 10 minutes showed the childish metaphor from the trailer with the coke can to explain the oil spill, but after that it became much more scientific and complicated. For me it was just on the right level, but I think for people without an engineering background as myself, this would go over their heads. <br/><br/>Not a big problem honestly, because one of the things this movie does best is keeping tempo and building suspense. I liked the quick interactions with the crew in the first act, they were a bit to ""perfect"" but still believable. Also Mark Wahlberg was perfect for this movie, he seemed very believable and I was pleasantly surprised by his acting. The first 15 minutes or so were a bit cliché, but as soon as they were on the rig the movie kept surprising with no rushed romances and a realistic view of the after math when coming home. <br/><br/>There were not a lot of things I didn't like. In the first act it was a bit cliché that everybody had a ""bad feeling"" about the upcoming job and took away from the realism. Also the special effects, especially the fire (the water was great), although probably good enough for the average movie watcher, didn't convinced me. Also a bit of Amercain patriotism, but not enough to take away the realism. <br/><br/>It's weird, this isn't the best movie I've ever watched, but because it exceeded my expectations so much I am as enthusiastic about it as if it was, maybe even more. Go watch this movie with low expectations and it will be amazing."
"nejclozarslo","9","2","5","1 November 2016"," A dramatized documentary about the disaster on Deepwater Horizon with spectacular visual effects driven action
","Deepwater Horizon isn't an action movie by definition. I would much rather call it a dramatized documentary of the incident.<br/><br/>The first half of the film despite it's lack of action is still very meaningful as it takes it's time to properly set up the characters so that when bad stuff starts to happen you can really care about them. It also does a great job building tension by showing all the necessary precautions not being taken in order to save money as oppose to avert the disaster. All of it is done through some of the most mesmerizing editing I have seen all year.<br/><br/>Once the inevitable disaster finally happens we are in for some of the most intense action sequences this year has to offer. I admire Peter Berg's direction of it. One wide shot of a huge explosion, a quick look at the outside world responding to the situation and after that you are looked in with our heros. What I appreciate the most about Berg's direction is the fact that at no point he ever lets the explosions outshine our heros. They are the ones that are always in the foreground, they are the ones we should care about.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my one small issue I have with the film, though the more I think the more I realize that it's probably just me who went into this film expecting a bit too much of an action movie then what this film actually is. So basically soon after the disaster strikes the action doesn't go on for very long, or at least I felt like it didn't. But let me emphasize again the action that I did get was nothing less of spectacular and I will gladly take quality over quantity. Once again, I don't think I have seen or will see a film this year with better visual effects, sound design and editing (maybe Rogue One).<br/><br/>Deepwater Horizon tells a brilliantly executed story of a struggle workers went through on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that April in 2010. A perfect follow-up to the first collaboration of ""The Bergs"" (Mark Wahlberg and Peter Berg), Lone Survivor, which if you liked but found it somewhat disturbing at times, then Deepwater Horizon fixes all that and you nor anyone else should waste no time before seeing this film. It's one of the best of the year, period."
"DavidLindahl","6","2","5","12 October 2016"," Too much technical stuff and good vs bad prevents it from being a perfect emotional ride
","Yesterday it was time for a visit to the cinema, it's been a while. The film I saw was Deepwater Horizon, the story of the oil platform that started leaking in 2010 and caused one of the biggest oil disasters in modern time. In the film we get to follow Mike Williams, played by Mark Wahlberg. He is an electronics technician onboard the platform and leaves his daughter and wife (Kate Hudson) to go and work for 21 days. Kurt Russell is also in the film playing the manager of the platform and the top ranking employee. After what they first believed would be three normal work weeks, things take a turn of events when the platform explodes from the oil pressure.<br/><br/>At first I could not understand what kind of film Deepwater Horizon wanted to be. Many family emotions, friendships and relationships at the beginning and after that a very technical part begins. About 20 – 30 minutes of the film is about technical aspects of oil drilling which frankly I think goes straight by most of us. Sure It's a little exciting when they are talking about oil pressure and performs test whether to start drilling or not. BUT, the problem is that we already know that everything will go to hell. Therefore I think that when they are building drama and tension on things that really should be standard procedures onboard an oil platform, it gets a little cheap. I'm convinced that had we not known the outcome of the film, these scenes would feel strange and over exaggerated. To but it simply, they are building drama on pure trifles just because we already know the outcome. Clever and viable, but still cheap and boring.<br/><br/>I think it's a shame how black and white Deepwater Horizon is. It's crystal clear who's good and bad. Despite everyone being soaked in oil and mud, BP's logo is still clearly visible on the ""villains"" helmet. Somewhere here they touch a very sensitive subject without ever really developing it more. Who's fault was it really? Political and environmental impact? The reactions of the world? None of this is included in the film. Now I've arrived at the things that I actually think the film does really well and what could have made it even better, had it been even more focused. Somewhere in the middle of Deepwater Horizon I realized what kind of film this is and should be. A strong emotional drama. We get to know these people and their families. We follow them onboard the platform and gets affected in the same way they do. We suffer, feel their pain, their loss and eventually at the end we also also get emotional scars. This is the real strong points of the film. To take us on an emotional journey that plays out our whole register, from laughter to crying. Skip the politics, the parts too difficult to understand and the good vs bad. Show us, don't tell us. Finally I want to say that the sound in Deepwater Horizon was also one of the things that impressed me the most. So good and strong sound quality that the speakers in the theater barely could play it. Thumbs up for that.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

"TheMovieDiorama","8","2","5","3 October 2016"," The worst oil spill in US history makes for a technical spectacle.
","The biographical disaster film about the titular oil rig, Deepwater Horizon is about the blowout and explosion of the oil rig and how it became the largest oil spill in US history. The trailers showed this to be an epic disaster film, but it is so much more than that...in fact this actually touched my heart. For the majority of the film it is a technical spectacle of explosions, fire, mud and more explosions, but then the last 10 minutes happen and it hits you right in the heart. There is not much to spoil, everyone knows what happened...but I shall not mention any specifics. This was a great chance for Mark Wahlberg to show off some acting and he did so reasonably well, but it was actually Kurt Russell who really showed his on-screen presence. The rest of the cast were also great, no one bad here. What everyone comes to watch in a disaster film are the effects, the visuals...and this film delivers by the bucket load. Plenty of fiery explosions and plenty of danger to keep viewers enthralled by the experience and just to try and empathise with the real people that went through this. That's where the film shines, when it reminds the viewers that these people were real and these events actually happened. The last 10 minutes showcases this beautifully with a touching tribute to those who lost their lives. The first half of the film builds up the suspense of the inevitable and actually informs us on what working on an oil rig is like, it was rather informative and I enjoyed it. From time to time the script does struggle in connecting Kate Hudson to the story and the family life of Wahlberg's character, it was as if they were trying to force it and sometimes it did not work. What did not work at all though were many of the camera shots, it seemed extremely zoomed in as if it was trying to enhance the frantic mayhem but if anything it just infuriated me that I couldn't see what was going on. Thankfully this did not happen all the time, but director Peter Berg (who directed Lone Survivor) knows better. Overall, Deepwater Horizon is a technical spectacle of a biographical disaster film with an emotional payoff that I did not see coming.<br/><br/><ul><li>Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</li></ul>"
"aharmas","4","2","5","2 October 2016"," The technical overrides the emotions
","Mark Whalberg and Kurt Russell are two of the most likable actors out there, so there should be no reason why we couldn't establish some type of connection with them. At first, we got a little bit of an introduction to the Whalberg's happy family. We really don't know anything about Russell or any of the other workers, except that there seems to be no problem among them. It's not quite the case with some of the touring executives, and there lies the conflict.<br/><br/>We are given a light tour of the facilities, somehow going into very simple explanations of what goes on inside the place. For what it must be the longest and most tedious scenes in an ""action movie"", we sit through endless discussions relating to technical and managerial issues that might be accurate but are only confusing and tedious to the average viewer. We can't wait for the station to explode so they can stop talking.<br/><br/>When the fireworks finally arrive, we given what should have been a grand display of technical effects: visual and audio. There are some good minutes here and there, but it's too dark, the editing is a bit sloppy, and we are hardly able to see who is going through what because I suppose it would have been easy to tell it was a stuntman or stunt woman.<br/><br/>I keep thinking back to movies like ""Titanic"", ""The Poseidon Adventure"", or ""Life of Pi"", where careful direction and bit of restraint got us involved, caring a bit for whatever is going on. ""Deepwater"" is not the type of movie that requires details to get too complex. We go in to relate to those involved, to care for the heroes, to hiss at the villains, to feel like we're part of the ordeal. The hints are here, but we never go beyond the surface."
"burlesonjesse5","5","2","5","1 October 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Deepwater Horizon
","I admire Peter Berg's passion for being the dude that honors real-life heroes. It labored in his box office hit Lone Survivor but with Deepwater Horizon (my latest review), it just feels like hackwork.<br/><br/>Berg is the art film director's version of Michael Bay. He's the guy who made Very Bad Things and ""Horizon"" is a ""very"" humdrum movie. This $156 million dollar release is based on true events and depicts the biggest oil spill in U.S. history (circa 2010). There's lots of nasty fire, flying nuts and bolts, broken bones, plenty of crew member speak, and mud covering the trouper's faces. Oh yeah, it's hot as heck on that oil rig. Pay attention though because as a viewer, it's hard to tell what's going on via ""Horizon's"" stilted camera-work and darkened cinematography.<br/><br/>Now for kicks and giggles, I read somewhere that a critic referred to this vehicle as ""a poor man's Towering Inferno"". Makes sense. ""Inferno"" has more compelling characters, doesn't come with a disjointed and clunky script, has more suspense, doesn't have its actors mumble their lines as if they have cotton in their mouths, and has a climax for the ages (""Horizon"" not so much). Plus, The Towering Inferno (1974) is longer in length with stupendous editing. Talk about a cinematic oxymoron.<br/><br/>In regards to Deepwater Horizon, well Peter Berg shortens his film to 107 minutes. By explaining everything that happened to certain drillers in the closing credits, it feels as though he's trying to get this thing over with to get to his December release (see sixth paragraph).<br/><br/>So OK, ""Horizon"" is a BP subjection, a moviegoer's guide to drilling rig mumbo jumbo. It's also a rushed tribute that thinly honors the eleven people that died in one of the world's biggest man-made disasters. Disappointing is the word I thought of as I left the theater.<br/><br/>Anyway, Deepwater Horizon has odd Louisiana accents from big name actors (Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, John Malkovich), horrific images that have become Peter Berg's staple since Lone Survivor (mentioned earlier), and special effects that are technically efficient yet chaotic and messy. It's disaster porn but not in an eye candy sort of way. You sense that Berg wants to project things to be more realistic, more mechanical in nature. He's a filmmaker mired in being up to date and he makes his proceedings feel military even if it's about grubby, dirty oil riggers. Here's the problem though: He can't seem to wring any emotional response from me (I know I'm not alone on this). Let's hope that his next real- life salute being Patriots Day, fills that void. Rating: 2 stars."

","'Deepwater Horizon' (already sounds like an ominous novel!) is a disaster film about the BP oil rig off Louisiana, in the Gulf of Mexico, that blew up in 2010 and caused the largest oil spill in US history (800 million litres). Mike (Wahlberg) is the Chief Electronics Technician on the floating rig and they set-up his home life (Hudson is his wife and gets a few token scenes), as well as Andrea (Rodriguez), the helmsman. When they get to the rig, the Transocean rig workers - Jimmy (Russell) is the boss - are clearly distinguished from the BP visitors/owners, including Vidrine (Malkovich).<br/><br/>The film is intentionally overt in painting BP as careless, profiteering ""sons of bitches"" and almost the sole cause of the disaster, which is probably not 100% accurate, but can't be too far off. Great line from Mike: ""Hope is not a strategy"". After 40min of setting the scene - with the set apparently one of the biggest ever built - the action begins and the pace doesn't slow at all after. There's some great underwater shots and the issues with pressure are explained well enough. The last hour is a hectic and tense amalgamation of explosions, gushing oil, people getting thrown around by explosions and Mike and Jimmy trying to evacuate everyone off the rig.<br/><br/>This is Berg and Wahlberg's second film - after the great 'Lone Survivor' - and it's a well-made disaster film, with no dead air, not too much posturing, a likeable lead in Wahlberg, builds tension well and then has some awesome shots of the rig burning and exploding. Nice memorial at the end."
"jac-44480","4","1","2","23 December 2017"," Pointless Documentary with lots of explosions
","A movie that focuses on a single binary event- the Deepwater Horizon explosion. The film avoids delving into the political, social, or ecological ramifications of the disaster and its aftermath. This is a major disappointment for me. The directors could have made so much more of this movie. <br/><br/>The film stars Mark Walhberg as a technician who works on the Deepwater Horizon. Wahlberg's character has no special skills that are apparent or ever explained. He has no interesting dialogue. He sits around surfing the web and chatting with his wife half of the movie. When things go south, he suddenly morphs into a super hero with super human skills who saves lives. But I digress. Wahlberg's role in Deepwater Horizon is virtually identical to ""The Perfect Storm"". He has a Suzy-homemaker wife played by Kate Hudson who sits at home watching soap operas all day worrying about him while Wahlberg is out at sea trying to earn a paycheck for his family. It was like they carbon-copied his character from ""The Perfect Storm"", but changed the scenery to an oil rig. <br/><br/>Other stars include Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, and Gina Rodriguez. Russell is the good-guy rig supervisor who the workers love. He is at odds with Malkovich, a BP executive, who only cares about corporate profits at the expense of safety and the environment. The most passionate scene of the movie involves a heated exchange between Russell and Malkovich, but this exchange is done awkwardly. It is not classic Kurt Russell. Both Russell and Malkovich have bizarre accents that are difficult to understand. Russell tries to speak with a Southern accent and Malkovich uses a New Orleans Creole accept. Both work poorly. It is nearly impossible to understand what they are saying, but you get the gist of their dispute. <br/><br/>Gina Rodriguez's character is also a tech of some sort. There's really not much else to say on her. She is boring like Wahlberg. The other characters in the movie are background props. They are cannon-fodder. The characters do all sorts of tests that are never explained to the audience. You have no idea what is going on and it is never explained what caused the failure. <br/><br/>The action scenes as the disaster begins are well done. Lots of blood, shrapnel, etc. There is a scene that looks like it was stolen right out of the movie ""Titanic"" where a worker is blown off the side of the rig into the sea and hits a propeller of some sort before bouncing off to his death. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is an easy paycheck for Wahlberg and Russell. They are asked to do very little as the film focuses more on explosions. With a letter effort, the writers could have added some scenes in the beginning and the end about the politics and environmental consequences."

Millions of liters of oil devastating marine wildlife and this for decades. The movie doesn't mention anything about that, but it still remains a good movie to watch. Just to have an idea on what happens on an oil platform like that. That the big oil concerns like BP are faulty in every way is obvious. That they will never face consequences doesn't bother anybody. That's just the way it is. The mighty lobbyists win again. Mark Wahlberg gives us a good performance, as well as the other actors. The catastrophe scenes look like they are all real so for that the movie gets big credits. The story is poignant and will make everybody think about the disaster that happened there. A good catastrophe movie, even for the people that are not really into this kind of movies."

On board the Deepwater Horizon, Mike and Mr. Jimmy (Kurt Russell) bode ill tidings when they discover that the departing drill team left without doing a safety check on the hole. This film is entertaining at certain moments but as a whole, one must be invested in the type of film this is, which is a real based true events disaster film. With a large budget of over $110 million and only making over $120 million worldwide, this film did not make as much as the studios hoped for, or was not praised as much either, as they intended some Oscar nominations. Overall Deepwater Horizon has its moments but as a whole is quite boring, which is shameful because the film is quite well made and we can notice much research was done. The main problem is that they waited a few years too long to make and release this film, which is a reason for its flopping at the box office. As a rewatch 06/17/20 opinions remain same. The film starts off relatively slow as it builds then gets quite engaging. Overall the story as tragic of a disaster as it has been doesn't quite provide such an interesting tale."

","Peter Berg's ""Deepwater Horizon"" would've been better had it concentrated directly on BP's irresponsibility and ensuing cover-up. Instead, most of the movie is more like an action flick, with explosions and people running in every direction. While the movie did make clear the executives' disdain of safety concerns, it should've shown the complete destruction caused by the spill, and how BP stationed armed guards to prevent anyone from filming what was going on. Not to mention CEO Tony Hayward's tone-deaf remarks (""The Gulf of Mexico is pretty big, so not much got damaged"" and ""I want my life back""). This unnatural disaster was a second major blow to Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.

","Add to the line-up of disaster films that actually took place, Deepwater Horizon in my opinion is like Titanic, if you took out the romance between Jack and Rose. Peter Berg proves he has talent and should stick with films like these. However, it wasn't perfect by any means. It's about as rhythmical as a disaster film gets. The story is pretty basic, we know the beginning and the end. All we care about is the in-between scenes. And, it delivered but not on a scale like Titanic, where its literally an hour of nonstop chaos. The film is realistic in it's interpretations. That's not a bad thing, I actually praise it for that. In that it didn't add a clichÃ©d romance, or explosion upon explosion. So, truthfully I'm kind of in the middle of the road on this one. It's interesting, but not nail-bitingly intense, it's nicely realistic and serves the event well. It's a good film but not spectacular, but I hope to see Peter Berg back to direct another one of these. Enjoyment is present, and everyone does a fine job. I guess what I'm trying to say is, to me it was underwhelming. But kudos to Berg for tackling such a sensitive topic that just recently happened in 2010. Now to grade: Story: B+ Acting: A- Effects: A Music: B Directing: A Overall: B"
"alexandrearenafilho","6","1","2","14 January 2017"," Not a bad movie technically, but feels disrespectful towards the real people involved in the tragedy
","I have very mixed feelings about this movie. I wonder how the families of the deceased in this tragedy feel about the dramatization of the oil spill. Because I'm pretty sure the average moviegoer did not see the movie as a means to paying respect to these dead. This is a disaster movie with explosions, and that's why the studio thought it would be worth spending 110+ million dollars. The movie feels a lot like ""Final Destination"", without the supernatural elements (the levels of violence are pretty much the same, even though Deepwater Horizon is shockingly rated PG-13). The ""Final Destination"" feel would be fine if this was fiction, but to have the memories of real people turned into a spectacle that works like the 6th installment of a horror franchise is not exactly tasteful. The performances are OK, direction is OK, all around an OK movie if you can ignore the morality issues (which I can't)."

Honestly, the frequent shots of pipes underwater are more interesting than the test scenes! After an hour, the disaster finally happens, and it gets adrenaline pumping. The inclusion of the oil stained bird is a good touch as it reminds people of the environmental impact of the oil spill.

The remaining portion of the film is surprisingly flat and monotonous. The situations the characters find themselves in lack dramatic value and don't add up to anything memorable.<br/><br/>The lack of scope is underwhelming, and it feels like a more in- depth look at the event would have given more value to the film beyond cycling through action film clichÃ©s.

","As someone who lives on the Mississippi Gulf Coast I can assure you that this movie is only a fraction of how terrifying this disaster actually was. The men on the Deep Water Horizon are incredibly lucky to be alive as this was possibly the most catastrophic event to the coast since Katrina in 05. <br/><br/>To the movie point: The performances are good and believable. Everyone feels like a real person except the BP executives who seem to be slightly embellished in how ""evil"" they seemed but then again I was not on the rig so who am I to say that's not exactly what they were like. <br/><br/>The tone is controlled perfectly. This is one of those movies that knows what its about and has fantastic tonal control. It stays eerie and foreboding through the slow buildup because everyone knows whats going to happen so it wants to capitalize on those emotions from the audience as best it can. <br/><br/>The actual disaster occurs around the last 45 minutes or so of the movie (out of its 1hr 45min run time) and is played out very well, and from what I can remember of the stories being told about the event, pretty accurate. <br/><br/>Overall this movie is spot on with its tone, gripping, and overall incredibly sad and may leave you feeling pretty much the way we all felt about BP back in 2010."

","Deepwater Horizon is based on a true event which happened in 2010. It is considered the largest accidental marine oil spill in the world, and the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history. <br/><br/>The film is made in such a way that you will be attached to the characters before 'anything explodes' and when it does, you stop moving and hope that your favorite character survive. <br/><br/>The first half is slow, a little too much some would say which I think, was vital in this case as it will make you feel more connected to the characters. But, a thought will be there in your mind that the second half better be good.<br/><br/>It is. It is mind blowing!<br/><br/>The second half of Deepwater Horizon is so thrilling that it made me sit on the edge of my seat the entire time. It was impossible to take my eyes off it. It is jam-packed with explosions, fire and gas leaks. It is rather technical what caused the explosion but you'll get it as it is explained in the first half very efficiently.<br/><br/>The movie is also well equipped with a stunning star cast including Kurt Russell, Mark Wahlberg, John Malkovich, Dylan O.

"Therru_Babayaga","6","1","2","16 October 2016"," Nice call-back to the old disaster movies concentrating, more on the human tragedy
","This movie is based on a true disaster that took place in 2010, where a drilling rig (Deepwater Horizon) exploded and caused one of the worst oil spill in history. However, the movie concentrates solemnly on the human aspect and on what happened on that day to the people involved. It's not about the politic, the environment or the impact of humans as a specie, but about the human pettiness and greed as well as its courage and resilience in the face of danger. All the ingredients to make a good old- fashion disaster movie.<br/><br/>The structure of the film itself is pretty standard. As most disaster movies, we are first introduced to some of the main characters that we will follow during the mayhem that will ensue. Then something bad happens because of a bad decision motivated by greed/power or outside forces. Finally, we get our action scenes in all its explosive and deadly splendor. Nothing that we haven't seen before. <br/><br/>The real force of this movie is its focus on the human element. In more recent movies, CGI and effects have been the real star of the genre, with no need for big acting chop or real emotion. ""Deepwater Horizon"" revives this aspect seen in classics such as ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"". Now, unlike those, there are no big inspirational characters that is boasted as the hero. There is just one main character, a simple family man (played by Mark Wahlberg) who is doing his best to survive and help the few people he can help on his way. <br/><br/>As a reenactment of a real tragedy, this movie seems mostly respectful of that aspect, downplaying the ""hero"" aspect and enhancing the reality feel. The camera is always close to the people, and there is never a moment where we feel a sense of ""aw"" in face of the fire and the destruction, only dread and horror of how insignificant we are against nature, no matter how much we want to believe we have it under control. <br/><br/>Don't expect a pop-corn flick such as ""San Andreas"" or ""The Day after Tomorrow"", or you will be most likely disappointed. Overall, ""Deepwater Horizon"" is a decent movie concentrating more on the human aspect of a real event. Pretty standard in its structure but well-paced and with a good focus on its characters and an emotional ending, it is a good old-fashioned disaster movie, well worth a watch."

","""Deepwater Horizon"" tells the true story of the crew of what was the offshore drilling rig called 'Deepwater Horizon' that in the April of 2010 exploded and created one of the worst oil spills in history. A good portion of the crew managed to save itself. this film tells their story.<br/><br/>Peter Berg is back with another collaboration with Mark Wahlberg on a true story film and it won't be the last we get this year since ""Patriot's Day"" is coming out later this December. I was a big fan of Berg's last effort in ""Lone Survivor"" and whilst this film does not live up to many standards set by its predecessor, it still makes me excited to see Berg's next effort.<br/><br/>What is very clear from the film is how Berg manages to be delicate and touching at the same time, maintaining the uttermost respect for everyone involved. The result isn't heavy handed, it isn't pointing fingers or trying to exploit the events. It is clearly a story of these people and that's where the focus lies (literally as the camera is always shifting focus between people). This makes for a very thrilling experience since you really feel like you've entered these people's space and that you want to get the fu*k away from the platform as much as them.<br/><br/>What he filmmakers are also incredible at doing is not loosing you in the mechanics of how the drill works and how what happened, happened. They make a real effort to make it clear for you and whilst there are aspects of this that faulted the film, I can confidently say I understood what was going on, the stakes were always clear and ultimately the escalation of the tragic events feels completely authentic and most importantly it fuels the story forward.<br/><br/>Technically the film is very remarkable too, you never felt like you were watching a CGI explosion, now that I think of it, the whole setting on the platform was absolutely seamless, it felt realistic and the geography of the place was very clear to me thanks to great setups and attention to little details that really help the viewer in understanding the whole dynamic of the place.<br/><br/>The whole cast is another great element the film has to offer. It is quite a large one, but just as the rest of the film is clear so every one of these roles manages to be easily understandable. Yet, it doesn't stop there and all of these people get to feel like fully rounded individuals and that is what probably makes the last ten minutes of this film so touching. After having spent all of this time with these people, at the end we get such a gut-wrench, also thanks to incredible performances, especially and surprisingly by Kate Hudson who really shines despite her small part.<br/><br/>Where I had more problems with the film was in its first half. I think the filmmakers just spent way too much time in trying to setup the incident and I understand it is delivered clearly, but there were times where it just felt like overkill. There are also a couple of setups that are way too on the nose and didn't really have any place in this film. What also was incredibly bothering was how tightly this film is edited. It is fast paced to a degree that kind of makes your brain weary. Forty minutes into the film I was just struggling for some breathing space and some time to let things sink in. That is why some of the bigger character moments in the third act don't hit as hard as they should. I mean the of dialogue and information you are asked to digest is really heavy and whilst I will admit it's all well written and thought out dialogue, it was just too much and there simply wasn't a reason to have this kind of exaggerated fast pace to the film.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Berg remains a good director with an eye for these kind of stories and making the human element take the forefront, making the audience attached to these people and having them go through intense cinematic experiences."
"themovieparadise","8","1","2","9 October 2016"," A Solid and Respectful Depiction of a Tragedy
","I really liked this movie. I think the element of it I appreciated the most was how it was told. In the hands of anyone else (looking at you Michael Bay), this could have been very disrespectful. It could have turned into an over-the-top action movie, that would have been insulting to the victims and casualties in this horrific accident. But it was not done in that way. Director Peter Berg treated this almost like a documentary: he's just there with a camera to witness this event, not to stylize or enhance it. I never felt like Mark Wahlberg was being portrayed as an action hero. It could have been very easy for this movie to slip into that mold. But instead, he was a victim of a tragedy, and he was forced to act and survive in an impossible situation."
"Troy_Campbell","8","1","2","11 October 2016"," An intense, insightful and entertaining true-story disaster flick.
","With a fairly cheesy trailer and Peter ""Battleship"" Berg at the helm, early signs weren't positive for this based-on-a-true-story disaster flick. But those negative expectations are blown out of the water by what is a fascinating and nerve-racking motion picture. The first half is both a meet and greet with our ensemble cast and a quick (but enthralling) lesson on how a deep-sea oil rig operates, building up the camaraderie that forms our emotional connection to the story whilst also imparting just enough technical knowledge to help understand the severity of the forthcoming catastrophe. Then, when the proverbial hits the fan at the halfway point, it's intense action and nail-biting tension for the remainder of the film; a series of unfortunate (and worse, avoidable) events that escalate the situation from bad to worse. Berg shoots his fiery action with a claustrophobic immediacy that accentuates the truly frightening position in which the people aboard the rig find themselves, whilst also utilising wide shots (full of convincing CGI) to demonstrate the overwhelming scale of the calamity. Tropes of the disaster flick subgenre – shaky cam, flickering lights, heroic moments, and sudden silence – are certainly present but they're utilised as judiciously as possible by Berg, although he still manages to sneak in a shot of an American flag softly flapping in the breeze. There are no standouts amongst the cast, everyone from leading men Mark Whalberg and Kurt Russell to offsiders Gina Rodriguez and Dylan O'Brien offer solid performances, however John Malkovich has to battle with a completely underwritten and shallow role as the greedy BP company man. At a relatively snappy 107 minutes, Deepwater Horizon is a pacey, insightful and thrilling recount of a deadly man-made mishap that should have never happened."

","The heyday of the disaster movie was the mid 1970s when we had the likes of ""The Poseidon Adventure"", ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""Earthquake"" - all fiction but convincingly engaging. More latterly the best disaster movies have been based on real- life incidents - think of ""Apollo 13"", ""Titantic"" and ""The Perfect Storm"". So the latest work in this genre, ""Deepwater Horizon"", portrays a true and high-profile incident that occurred on 20 April 2010 on an oil rig 41 miles off the coast of south-east Louisiana.<br/><br/>There are many ways in which this story could have been told, including an indictment of cost-conscious management and weak regulation to the economic and natural impacts of the biggest environmental catastrophe in US history. Director Peter Breg, writer Matthew Michael Carnahan, and instigator, producer and star Mark Wallenberg have chosen a narrative that focuses on the oil rig workers themselves and the heroism shown by them in the face of an utter inferno. Eleven men lost their lives and their names and photographs appear at the end of the film as a silent tribute to their sacrifice.<br/><br/>Almost all of the movie is located on the oil rig and the film-makers spent eight months constructing an 85% scale model of the rig which provides a sense of realism. Much of the dialogue is hard to catch and difficult to understand but I guess this adds to the sense of verisimilitude. When hell breaks lose, we no longer have any sense of where we are and what is happening but I suppose that was the case for the workers themselves.<br/><br/>This is a movie that should be seen at the cinema where the impressive visuals and convincing sounds will sweep around the viewer who will feel the heat and noise personally. ""Deepwater Horizon"" does what it sets out to do very effectively, showing in an 'entertaining' manner how even, in the face of utter chaos, some can still care about others, but it fails to represent sufficiently the bigger picture: that so often private corporations put profit before people and governments are too weak in regulating them."
"jtindahouse","7","1","2","9 October 2016"," Weak characters are all that let it down
","'Deepwater Horizon' has a very patient first half. It takes a lot of time to familiarise its audience with the characters and also the basics of the oil rig, in particular the things that are going to be important later on. Then all hell breaks loose. Once the action begins, it never stops. The only problem with all of this is that despite all the time taken at the start to attempt to make us, I never cared enough about the characters. Now this is all based on a true story that is very fresh in all our memories. And admittedly being a true story does bring things closer to the heart and brings out more emotion in the audience naturally. I still don't think the actors and writers did a good enough job though of dragging us in and making us care. 2015's 'Everest', one of the finest 'disaster' movies I've ever seen, was also based on a true story, but would have worked equally well had it not been, because the characters were so strong. That's really the only thing letting 'Deepwater Horizon' down.<br/><br/>The scenes involving the actual disaster are extremely well directed. There are some impressive visuals and never a dull moment. Just how terrifying being a part of the event in real life is well illustrated and really brings home just how awful this was. There's really not a lot else to say about this film. It's tidily made and an enjoyable watch, but I don't think it will stick in my mind like 'Everest' managed to."

","I should have felt it more, right from the beginning, that this is very near to being a documentary (such as, for example, ""United 93""). But it is only during the ending credit roll that I saw the sincere effort to pay tribute to the survivors and the missing (presumed dead) in this worst ever old rig accident in history.<br/><br/>While mega-action director Peter Berg (""The Kingdom"", ""Hancock"", ""Battleship"") has sensible stayed away from the melodramatic, the establishing scene are sprinkled with small details to enhance the dimensions. There is the cutest 7-or-8-year-old (Stella Allen) who tells her parents that she didn't knock on their bedroom doors because she wants to have a baby brother. There is the attractive oil rig crew member (Gina Rodriguez) who is almost fetish about her Mustang. There is the polite request for a visitor to remove his purple-red tie as this is the color that signifies emergencies on an oil rig. There is also an inconsequential bird-collision in the helicopter flight to the oil rig that reminds me immediately of Captain Sully flying over the Hudson River! <br/><br/>It is all these little details that take the dryness out of a documentary. But as we move into the disaster, telling the story simply and honestly would suffice. This is the BP oil rig disaster that began on April 20, 2010 that led to the worst oil spill ever, on the Gulf of Mexico. The sound and visual of the infernal mayhem need no dramatic enhancement. And then there are also details that will send a shiver down your spine: someone trying to push into his boot a foot that is covered with shards of shattered glass (the poor soul was in the shower when the explosion came). This film is an honest and realistic effort to bring to the screen this tragic event, without overly dramatizing the villainy, although BP did plead guilty to 11 counts of manslaughter. The real photos of the 11 victim were shown in succession during the ending credit.<br/><br/>The cast is solid. Mark Wahlberg as the chief engineer is heroism personified. Kurt Russell as the in-charge of the oil rig still has a lot of fire in him and is a joy to watch as he shines with resilience and leadership. John Malkovich displays excellent seasoned constrain in portraying the BP man whose dictionary has only one word: profit. Kate Hudson is in a familiar role of the hero's helpless wife. But she is in good company i.e. talented Laura Linney in a very similar (but not as desperate) role in ""Sully""."

","In this age, it is not easy to create films about catastrophes, without sliding into expensive but uninteresting CGI effects, or getting cheap and nasty. Deepwater Horizon is a very fine example of exquisite balance between excellent actors' performances (Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, Mark Walberg and Kate Hudson all show definite depth and sophisticated valor, depicting their parts decently and with a great gusto) and awesome CGI effects. Without going deeper into technical details, I have to admit the film has achieved its main goal - to show true heroism, valor, valiance and also cowardice and shallowness in the wake of doom and death. Excellent depiction of Lousiana nature, exactly right balance of mundane, tragic, heroic and stupid all add certain flavor to the very tough and nutritious broth of a film. I do recommend this fast, deeply tragic, decent and sobering film to all who want to think and would like to watch something serious and thought-provoking."

The operation of the drilling is explained early in the film by Mike's daughter using a coke can and honey for a school project.

"peterp-450-298716","6","1","3","19 January 2017"," No spoiler alert needed ... the oil rig turns into a deadly inferno
","""The Runner"" was about a congressman who tried to provide financial support for local fisheries after the BP oil spill. ""Deepwater Horizon"" displays in a consistent manner the pure facts on the day of the fatal accident with this oil platform. It could have been just another disaster movie, like I've seen a lot before. Full of heroism, spectacular scenes and emotionally charged images of families at home, waiting for some good news. Ultimately, it wasn't that kind of a movie. They managed to make a film without any Hollywoodian, exaggerated situations. In short, no tricks to make it more spectacular in terms of action and emotions. It's an accurate reporting of the facts that took place before and during the disaster. Sometimes I feel like watching an action-soaked disaster film where people end up in a very explosive situation, both literally and figuratively. On the other hand, I would have enjoyed a piece about the aftermath of this disaster as well.<br/><br/>As in any disaster movie we get to see two different groups of people with opposing opinions. First we have those who predict the danger and who tried to point out to the others what consequences will result from making rash decisions. And then there's the other party rejecting any danger and trying to nip any protest in the bud, which ensures that the whole situation derails. In the group of individuals who are using common sense and where safety is top-priority, we find Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) and Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg). Harrell is a hardened foreman on the rig, who insists on checking the cement layer that'll protect the rig against a blow out. You don't have to be a genius to know this test isn't carried out properly and what consequences it'll bring. Mike Williams is the technician who's responsible to make sure everything that needs to function will function perfectly (including the toilets). It's no surprise he transforms into the person who keeps his nerve when the trouble begins and acts in an effective way to prevent worse.<br/><br/>The sad thing about films like ""Deepwater Horizon"", is that the outcome is already known in advance. It's quite annoying when your wife peeks around the corner once again and calmly asks the same question over and over again : ""And? Is it already happening?"". But isn't that the moment you're waiting for in the first place? The moment the mayhem starts? The prelude only has an educational purpose (with a can of Coke explaining how drilling oil from an platform works) and merely serves to gradually build up the tension. When hell breaks loose, you'll witness a chain of explosions with such destructive force that walls, iron structures and workmen literally fly away in all directions. There's nothing so annoying as when you're enjoying a refreshing shower and the wall blows up right in your face with broken glass and twisted iron leaving a trail of destruction and death. That's what some of the crew members experienced the first minute.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays a terrific part as the indifferent technician Mike, who isn't is impressed by the rather authoritarian tone used by the big shots from BP. I'm not Wahlberg's biggest fan, but now I felt like this was a suitable role for him. Ditto regarding Kurt Russell who stands his ground against these BP representatives. John Malkovich (who I always will remember as the provoking Russian poker-player Teddy KGB in ""Rounders"") plays the arrogant, pedantic BP man who at first acts extremely haughty and self-confident. But when the sh*t hits the fan, he runs off like a scaredy-cat, realizing he escaped a certain death. He looked like one of these male passengers who sneaked in the rescue boats with the women and children when the Titanic hit that giant ice cube. Pathetic.<br/><br/>Don't expect much profundity in this movie. No blame directed towards the managers of BP whose only concern is to make a profit. That's more important to them than the safety of the staff. No epilogue in which these bozos are held responsible for one of the largest environmental disasters ever. And no real character development when talking about the main characters. The only goal they had in mind, was to escape from the flames and survive. But the special effects, action sequences and nail-biting race against the clock will blow you away. Exactly what the crew experienced.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

Also this film has allot of important subject matter that should be seen. Also there is some nice character interactions in the first act of the film. The script has allot of great dramatic dialogue that does make you care about the people that are involved in the situation. Also when the film tries humour it works for the most part. The style of the film has great action scenes and truly scary visual scenes when this event happens.

"virek213","9","1","3","4 October 2016"," The Blowout In The Gulf
","With the emphasis on producing alternative forms of energy in the 21st century to avert the consequences of climate change and global warming, the drilling for oil and natural gas nevertheless continues to be a real thing—and, inevitably, a real problem, in terms of oil spills. The massive 1989 Exxon Valdez catastrophe off of Alaska, and the blowout of an oil rig off of Santa Barbara, California in February 1969 all demonstrated how catastrophic the consequences of oil drilling can be, not only to the people who work in such a profession, but also (and much more importantly) to the animal life that is destroyed. But the most catastrophic example in this arena occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, fifty miles off of the Louisiana coastline, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig suffered a massive blowout on the evening of April 21, 2010. The blowout, which basically destroyed the rig, lasted eighty-seven days before it was fully contained; and in that time, eleven workers on that rig died, and some 210 million gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf, and eventually onto the Gulf Coast itself, destroying tons of marine and other forms of animal life, and severely crippling the region's economic livelihood for years to come. That story is the basis of DEEPWATER HORIZON.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell portray, respectively, Mike Williams and Jimmy Harrell, two of the most important workers on the Deepwater Horizon, who are mightily and rightly concerned about the safety corners that have been severely curtailed by the cost-cutting measures of the rig's owner, British Petroleum, whose American representative (John Malkovich) agrees with the orders coming from the company's main headquarters in London. Despite being a $186 billion company, British Petroleum, or BP, apparently either can't afford to, or finds it totally unnecessary to, run the necessary safety tests in order to ensure that something catastrophic doesn't occur. And then on that fateful night, during a pressure test, mud and a little bit of crude oil start gushing onto the top part of the rig, whose pipes extend some five thousand feet into the depths of the sea. Then a monstrous blowout occurs, and the entire rig becomes a flaming pyre on the surface of the Gulf. Both Wahlberg and Russell are badly injured in the blast, but Wahlberg does manage to rescue the systems captain Andrea Fleytas (portrayed by Gina Rodriguez, the star of the TV sitcom ""Jane The Virgin"") in time. Though most of the workers do get off the rig before the worst occurs (albeit barely), eleven of their colleagues are left to perish.<br/><br/>In its depiction of this environmental horror story, DEEPWATER HORIZON does a fairly good job of showing how a typical crew of oil rig workers operates fairly far away from the shoreline; but it also points out how corporate greed can also trump safety and why, even though it is the right of the workers to speak up about safety without fear of losing their jobs and their livelihood, it can sometimes be just a little too easy to look the other way. Wahlberg, Russell, and Rodriguez, along with the colleagues they are responsible for, have a huge amount of qualms about the integrity of the cement casing of the pipes that is supposed to protect the right, along with the electronic and mechanical safety procedures; but their concerns are ignored by Malkovich until it is basically too late to stop an environmental and human catastrophe of staggering proportions. The screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan (who did the script for Robert Redford's 2007 film LIONS FOR LAMBS) and Matthew Sand doesn't exactly paint the workers as being without fault, and Peter Berg's direction almost seems to say as much,. Despite that flaw, the horrific disaster itself is well staged, and the video clips of the real-life incident well integrated into the editing.<br/><br/>Both Wahlberg and Russell, not surprisingly, are quite good, as is Malkovich in what could be called the ""heavy"" role; but it is Rodriguez, normally thought of as a comedic actress, who really seems to stand out among all the machismo, providing a more human (as well as feminine) face amongst the testosterone. Even more, DEEPWATER HORIZON, besides being an (albeit mild) indictment of corporate malfeasance, is also very much an indictment of the dismissive attitudes of the oil/gas industry towards the harm their activities do to other peoples and businesses, and why such an industry perhaps needs to be shut down forever."

Deepwater Horizon is arguably the most harrowing film of the year. This film is tension packed dramatic With a real docudrama feel, Lone Survivor director Peter Berg brilliantly builds up the tension on the 'well from hell' as events unfold. Technically, this is a tour-DE-force but, more importantly, it feels like the crew have been honored in the right way. This film is a must see at 1hr 38mins of real |Action, plenty of Drama, and the edge of your seat on the high sea Thriller I will give this 9/10 for effort because the oil in the sea bed leaked because BP didn't do any safety checks on the sea floor cause it was 67 days the oil exploratory drill was meant look for oil but the deep water horizon was falling lithely apart and costing to much keep a float as the executives on board were cutting corners to much to the ecolocial disaster that was about to happen 210billion gallons of oil leaked .

Makes a documentary-style, based-on-true events film into a stunning special FX action-thriller with the sort of technical detail that you'd expect Star Trek nerds to demand and enjoy.<br/><br/>Berg is in the same category. He's directed some really good movies (Lone Survivor, Battleship, Hancock,The Kingdom),. Like Wahlberg, if you enjoyed one of Berg's movies, odds are, you'll at least feel you got your money's worth with all of them. <br/><br/>2 people really impress here: Peter Berg for putting this film together and John Malkovich his acting. Is UN believable his rang is quite remarkable show that his character only cared about money not safety Berg clearly expresses a passion for this that brings to life a film based on an investigative news article. They definitely released this at the correct time. Those looking for horror and gore without being stuck. You will feel truly scared and surprised watching this film without a single gimmick. you know that it's easy to get caught up in the details of how much of the story based on actual events really happened and how much was embellished or altered to make a Hollywood movie. Along the way, I have made a decision to do no research into the facts of the real-life story and just focus solely on the movie itself. I mean, the movie makes no claims to be a historically accurate documentary, so I shouldn't hold it to those standards. And this blog isn't about movies being historically accurate when they don't necessarily claim to be. Mark Wahlberg plays Mike Williams who is blue collar worker on the drilling rig turned into an action hero the Deepwater Horizon. But that's the third thing we learn about Williams from the preview. He's a husband and a father first. He says goodbye to his family before being flown by helicopter with his crew to the rig. All his daughter wants is a dinosaur fossil. All his wife (Kate Hudson) wants is for him to return safely. Once aboard the rig, an executive named Vidrine (John Malkovich) and others from British Petroleum are more than anxious to commence with drilling. They skip a concrete test and excuse a failed system test. They are already 43 days behind and over budget and will do whatever it takes to not fall further behind despite Mister Jimmy's (Kurt Russell) stern objections. They should have listened to Mister Jimmy because everyone's worst nightmares explode into reality. Because the standard safety test leads to mud coming into the pipes causing every kind of disaster<br/><br/>Deepwater Horizon marks the reunion of Director Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg who collaborated on Lone Survivor three years ago. It was nominated for Oscars for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best stunt team performance. While Wahlberg has been nominated for his roles in The Fighter and The Departed, he's one of those reliable actors who makes smart choices. If you've liked one thing Wahlberg has done, odds are,you'll like them all. Most of them won't get nominated for awards, but they will all be entertaining. Great cast mark whalberg as tech engineer Mike Williams goes around to john Malkovich character pointing out everything that's wrong Kurt Russell who is safety manager Jimmy Harrell Gina Rodriguez Andrea Fleytas John Malkovich VidrineEthan Suplee Jason Anderson<br/><br/>From the preview, I said that Deepwater Horizon looked action-packed and visually stunning, but that it also looked predictable with pieces of the rig falling apart or blowing up blocking every turn as Williams and the survivors try to find a way to escape. Stars but I'm It was exactly as the preview said it would be and it was absolutely predictable; however, even though you knew what was coming, it was so perfectly executed, it still shocked you. From the beginning, there was no doubt about the fate of the rig as not-so-subtle clues were dropped along the way from his daughter's school presentation, to the tie of the executive, to the helicopter ride to the rig. You knew it was going You knew it was going to happen, but when it did, it choked the breath right out of you and didn't give it back until the very end of the movie. when faced with the darkest hour hope is not a tact.<br/><br/>It is worth the money to watch in theaters."
"kgprophet","6","1","3","2 October 2016"," Bluster Action Film of Personal Tragedy
","Peter Berg of ""Battleship"" fame tries to get personal by focusing more on crewmember Mark Wahlberg, and his wife, than on the bigger picture that was the Deepwater disaster. I half expected Wahlberg to shift into his eastern accent from ""The Perfect Storm"". Of course, Wahlberg's character is everybody's buddy on the ship (""say hello to your Ma for me""). We spend 20 minutes with Wahlberg and his wife for the big goodbye scene before he heads off to the oil rig. Although he is only off the coast, not on the other side of the world, and is constantly live streaming his wife. Berg only slightly gets a pedestrian feel here, certainly better than director Michael Bay did with Wahlberg in Transformers 4 (2 hours and 45 minutes of my life I will never get back). The photography is straight action material (compare to the documentary feel with ""Captain Phillips""). Unfortunately, so is the dialogue. Much of it sounds like the corny dialogue from a dumb action movie.<br/><br/>Leave it to John Malkovich to personify a character better than anyone else. He was genuinely creepy as a mid-level corporate shill. Kurt Russell is the responsible member of the crew that stands up to the corporate moneymen. I'm sure most of these characters said similar things in similar situations, but it stills sounds cliché; ""The safety of my crew comes first"" (or something like that).<br/><br/>If you judge this film as a disaster film, and are ready to be treated to nonstop action and explosions for the entire second half of the movie, you will be well satisfied. The effects work is very well done, and the nonstop explosions create serious tension as the crew tries to first reattain control then try to escape. I mention ""Captain Phillips"" in comparison to this movie, because that film also tried to bring to the screen a real life event. But comparing the editing, the choice of music, the casting and acting, and the documentary feel of the cinematography, Deepwater Horizon feels staged in places. Expectations were for this film to attract big action moviegoers, and the first weekend box office showed soft results when I wrote this review. It seems that it is either too soon, too personal, or lifelike to find the ""Diehard"" audience. I felt it held well as an action piece with a decent budget, but maybe I should judge it for the Oscar audience, which in that case forget about it."

Of course, Mark Wahlburg's character is front and center, however there were numerous bonds built with the other key players of the film such as Gina Rodriguez's character & Kurt Russell's character. Also, as the film draws on you quickly find yourself engulfed in the realistic nature of the film as if you were actually there. A lot of respect for the behind the scenes people who make the realism possible. To go along with the character development and realism of the film, a lot can be said for the plot line.

Here, Whalberg plays Mike Williams, who was the chief electronics technician of the oil rig. The good looking actor puts his rugged charm to good use, while maintaining the dignity of playing a real life character. He is joined by Kurt Russell's Jimmy Harrell, who was the offshore installation manager when the disaster happened. The two veterans are put in spotlight as they go all out to ensure the safety of the crew.<br/><br/>Playing the baddie is John Malkovich, the sneaky villain you'd love to hate. There are also family members (Kate Hudson, who plays Walberg's wife) worrying back home. Oh, there's also a heroine played by Gina Rodriguez to appeal to a wider demographic.<br/><br/>Most of us are not familiar with how oil rigs work, and the filmmakers have done a decent job with bringing us close to the action. The movie does not waste much time explaining the whys and hows – you will be coming face to face with non stop explosions, raging fires and lots of shaky camera shots to get a taste of what it might have been like to be near the disaster. Although there isn't much to expect with the predictable storyline, you are engaged from start to finish because you know this is a true story.<br/><br/>When the movie ends with descriptions of what happened to the key characters, as well as a list of the deceased, you can only sigh and ponder how much life is really worth."

","Mark Wahlberg teams up, once again, with director Peter Berg to bring a gripping true story of heroism and ""against all odds"" survival to the masses in ""Deepwater Horizon"". Much like ""Lone Survivor"" and the often overlooked ""The Kingdom"" this movie starts off slow and steady but once the action starts you won't have time to look away. Mark Wahlberg does his best to play the ""every man"" Mike Williams, but he pretty much acts like Mark Wahlberg throughout the film. Honestly, every actor plays who we expect them to be. Kate Hudson is the playful wife (who does get a few dramatic scenes). Kurt Russell is the tough and ornery supervisor who wants to keep everyone safe. And no one does over-confident ""bad guy"" like John Malkovich. But each actor made it easy for you to love (or hate) their character from their first scene. I do think the ending of the film was a little too quick. It packed a powerful emotional punch, but it left me feeling there was more story to tell. Overall, this is a solid film and a sure crowd-pleaser."

","""They said the black oil wouldn't come ashore. Well, it is ashore. It's here to stay and it's going to keep coming."" Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish.<br/><br/>The worst ecological disaster in history provides us with one of the exciting American disaster films in history: Deepwater Horizon. Director Peter Berg so authentically recreates the oil-rig explosion and its aftermath that, if you see it in IMAX, you will feel as if you were there, and possibly cry over the loss that could have been avoided. Eleven deaths and countless others wounded, along with millions of gallons of crude are consequential.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg (remember him as hero in Berg's Lone Survivor) gives another heroic performance, this time as Transocean chief electronic technician Mike Williams, more like Kurt Russell's (what is it with his mustaches?) usual disaster profile, who is here as skipper Jimmy Harrell. With an impressive supporting group, they give the feeling of ordinary people caught in unimaginable hell as Mother Nature explodes oil and methane to completely destroy the floating rig.<br/><br/>The most interesting part of the film precedes the 2010 explosion off the coast of Louisiana: The representative administrators from BP are led by the usually bad-boy John Malkovich, playing Donald Vidrine, an official more interested in the bottom line than the humans who will end up on the ocean floor. The BP officials have let slide a crucial test of the cement supporting the rig, and subsequent events prove them wrong to avoid a test that would have cost the multi billion dollar corporation a pittance compared to the cost of disaster.<br/><br/>While the opening of the film is filled with jargon-laced repartee among the crew and the usual homely scene between Mike and his wife (Kate Hudson) and daughter (an impressive Stella Allen), the latter part of the film emphasizes Mike's heroics, important to the genre but hardly the point the film should be making. Deepwater Horizon should have in part been a cautionary tale about corporate greed and a wake-up call for safety upgrades. Maybe even a small emphasis on the lives of ordinary working citizens off the rig affected by the blast would have been in order.<br/><br/>Actually the film shows Peter Berg a modern master of fire and mud with some lethal gas thrown in. As a social commentator, not so much."

","Just looked upon as an action/drama movie it is reasonably good, because the stunts and special effects are pretty impressive and the sentiments (violins, crying houswives and children) about the loss of 11 people is done with much effective melodrama towards the end. Great photography and editing and quite good acting performances by Kurt Russel and John Malkovich. Mark Wahlberg, as ever, just looks plain dumb, but for his standards he acts good as well. So just judging it as an action/drama it will make pass the time enjoyably, without ever getting really bored.<br/><br/>The biggest criticism I have is what this movie does NOT show. What is not being shown? What is not even mentioned one single time? The devastating permanent impact on the environment. None of that is ever mentioned. That is ridiculous and whitewashing the actual events as they have happened. As if this was only a human drama and not also the worst environmental oil disaster in recorded history. I have got a bitter after taste because of that whitewashing of this historical environmental disaster."

"Mike_Devine","7","0","1","22 July 2018"," Berg highlights heroism in 'Horizon'
","We all know the story from the headlines - the April 2010 BP oil rig disaster off the Louisiana coast that left 11 dead and many more injured. In Peter Berg's 'Deepwater Horizon,' we see the circumstances that led up to the moment when the rig malfunctioned, as well as the heroism that took place as the events unfolded in the black of night.<br/><br/>The focus of 'Horizon' is not on the politics behind the disaster, nor is it about the technical aspects of working on an oil rig (although there's a little bit of both mixed in here). It's about the people. Chief among them is Mike Williams, portrayed by Mark Wahlberg, who oversees electrical engineering, and operations supervisor Jimmy Harrell (played by a banged up Kurt Russell). The Williams/Harrell duo try to raise awareness of the state of the 'Horizon' to the BP bigwigs, including one middle manager played by John Malkovich. But where the cast really delivers is showing how people acted when everything went to hell.<br/><br/>'Horizon' has the signature marks of a Berg film. From shaky-cam effects and aerial shots to Michael Bay-esque sound effects and heart-pounding soundtracks. The action sequences are enough to keep you interested throughout, and visual spectacles cause by a structure in chaos. People's heroic actions are highlighted, like Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez) and Caleb Holloway (Dylan O'Brien), and the fact that there are actual real individuals who were able to make a difference as employees escaped the inferno is a positive aspect to focus on.<br/><br/>Sure, some could say 'Deepwater Horizon' is over the top and melodramatic, and it languished at the box office. But the fact that it pays homage to those who lost their lives or were forever impacted by this disaster - something that was lost in the aftermath as covered in the media - is a solid reason why this film was made."

And when the hero, Mike, finally reunited with his family, I felt like crying for joy with them.<br/><br/>It is an important story to tell.

"shakercoola","7","0","1","30 June 2018"," Blowout to tremendous visual effect. A tragic story
","An American action drama; Deepwater Horizon was the largest oil rig in the world and had been digging the deepest well in history beneath the Gulf of Mexico. The crew had been shutting down the exploratory Macondo Well, which potentially had a high yield of oil, when disaster struck.<br/><br/>Patrick Morgan, who was an assistant driller on the Deepwater Horizon rig, said of the movie before it was released: ""I just don't want to see politics and political correctness and all that crap play into it."" The film focused on the tragedy of the explosion and honouring the 11 men who lost their lives.<br/><br/>Despite some cumbersome schmaltz early on, the film settles on the story, precisely documenting the stages of the disaster. These scenes are accompanied by a fast dialogue that feels authentic with tossed around shorthand and lingo. Tension rises with clever editing as each step of mechanical failure is shown. The film achieves works very well on a special effects level, but as with many real-life films there are some inconsistencies in the factual telling which are worth noting.
The explosion came about due to years of cutting corners and not one careless mistake. The villain of the piece, BP Executive Donald Vidrine, played by John Malkovich in a gumbo-thick Louisiana drawl, in reality was not to blame. Vidrine spoke by phone to a BP engineer in Houston with regard to the problematic 'negative test' which proved fatal for the oil rig workers. Government investigations concluded that it was his BP superiors in Houston who were largely giving the orders for the crew to get work completed quicker on the well, which was 43 days behind schedule. BP's company man Vidrine certainly didn't expect that his decisions on the fateful day would lead to an inferno. The filmmakers could have found a better explanation for why intelligent people sometimes make such terrible decisions. Alas, this was an action movie with a story than needed someone to blame. In spite of this, several oversights and missteps were made by BP, and Halliburton - the American multinational corporation, and the Swiss company Transocean.
U.S. federal regulators who supervised drilling in the Gulf of Mexico signed off on Transoecean's plans at every stage, but this would not feature in the film's story and neither would the fact that all oil rigs were not fit for purpose.
The blowout preventer, which failed to stem the flow of oil when the wellhead erupted (widely used throughout the industry) was likely to be declared not fit for purpose.
All in all, an engrossing film and an affecting drama on human folly and obsession."

"theresamgill","7","0","1","12 June 2018"," Well-executed, thrilling, and a true story
","Don't be confused: above all else, Deepwater Horizon is a disaster film. Unsuspecting characters mingle harmlessly and provide exposition about themselves and their surroundings to allow a second-half non-stop action fest. There are movies that follow the formula conventionally and do a good job at it, others do a poor job at it, and even some others try putting a twist on the formula. This film-for the most part-is successful.<br/><br/> For a clear disaster film, what works the most is actually the beginning. It takes awhile for the action to start happening, so this means we have to care about the characters so that we're worried about their fates when death closes in in the second half. The writing is solid and engaging, Wahlberg has chemistry with everyone, and Kurt Russell brings the soul and spirit into the film. John Malkovich plays a rather conventional white collar antagonist, but needless to say, the buildup for the inevitable is really well done.<br/><br/> If you've been living under a rock for the past decade, I'll quickly explain the point of this film. In 2010 an offshore oil rig exploded and resulted in the worst oil spill in U.S. history. This is the story of the workers on-board when it happened, and how pressure from executives to meet deadlines and cut costs ultimately led to the explosions that tragically killed and injured too many.<br/><br/> The set for the film is basically the biggest ever used in a film, and it certainly adds to the film. There are plenty of shots of ordinary workers doing their job when mud and oil rumbles and rumbles until it finally blows. And it's presented without holding back. This is a very strong PG-13 film as you watch workers blown back, saved by their helmets; they desperately try containing the oil that blocks their vision and slips them up. I'm simplifying the action and don't want to describe everything that goes on, but trust me when I say that this film is engaging from start to finish. The climax was predictable, and therefore lacked some tension, but your heart will race as you root for the characters you spent the first half of the film getting to know.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The movie won't revolutionize anything, but that doesn't have to stop it from being a solid film. It's a disaster film you will enjoy watching, only amplified by the well-known fallout that took place afterward. It's a testament to tell the story of real people in an unbelievably traumatizing situation, and for executing it with confidence and poise, I applaud the filmmakers and their efforts.

","The movie is great as I can relate it to myself and my working environment. Since it is a dramatisation of a real accident, the director couldn't add extra things to viewer's taste. Many factual errors are there. It would have been better if they would have done some more research by some experienced personnel working in Offshore Oil rigs for the technical knowledge to make the script."
"blrnani","7","0","1","25 April 2018"," Above all, a tribute to the 11 men who lost their lives
","The film makers wisely focus their main effort on portraying the very real dangers involved in the offshore E&P business (even down to bird strikes that can play havoc with equipment) and how things can so easily go wrong, risking the lives of the people at the front end.
Unfortunately, they did fall into the trap of following the US business and government narrative at the time, throwing all the blame onto a foreign oil company that was making serious inroads into 'their' business. While not wishing to excuse BP from their significant responsibility, subsequent investigations have shown culpability in the series of errors that led to the disaster to be shared among a number of companies involved, most of them American.
Nevertheless, since the film mainly follows the technical complexity of the operations taking place and reactions under the severest stress, it is an action movie that stands as an effective tribute to those 11 men who died so tragically, as well as the heroism and professional competence of many of those who survived.
My main spoiler is to point out that the Wahlberg character, while representing a specific individual, actually incorporated several individuals on the platform and is shown doing numerous things that were actually done by others. Why can't Hollywood just recognise the heroism in most people, working together as a team, instead of concentrating it into a single superhero? This is supposed to be a 'real-world' event, after all!"

","Deepwater Horizon <br/><br/>There are some disaster movies that are straight up disasters.
Hollywood likes to feed us a steady diet of them.
Usually from the guys and gals that brought us Independence Day regurgitated or ridiculousness like Geostorm!<br/><br/>Here director Peter Berg has brought us a fantastic film that tells the story of a real life disaster. An explosion that occurred in 2010 on the off shore oil rig named Deepwater Horizon, which created the worst oil spill in history.
Like I said, a real life disaster.
A story that is told by firstly introducing us to real life characters that are developed before any chaos ensues.
This is masterfully done by Berg and scriptwriters Matthew Sand and co to cement the audiences care for what happens to the lives on screen.
There's no hot shot scientists here played unconvincingly by Hollywood's latest Beef cake!
Instead Mark Wahlberg proves that he can actually act when he's not too busy getting caught up in Transformers nonsense.
We also get a commanding performance from the always brilliant Kurt Russell as Mr Jimmy, the man in charge.
Peter Berg takes his time setting the movie up before events unfold.
He gives the audience a chance to learn a little about oil extraction and the pressure that is applied by multi billion dollar companies wanting their payload.
John Malkovich gives a solid performance as the BP executive named Vidrine who is applying such pressure to Russell's character.
A great performance even if Malkovich's accent seemed a little erratic at times.<br/><br/>When disaster does eventually strike it is incredibly staged and this movie looks and sounds fantastic.
The special effects are some of the best I've seen in recent years.
Sound design is ear shatteringly good. 
If like I, you missed this movie at the cinema, please watch this on the biggest TV you can find with a good 5.1 surround sound set up.
This film deserves that much.
Deepwater Horizon is as much as an immersive experience as it is good story telling.
The Dolby Atmos sound mix is a tool wonderfully utilised.
Picture quality is top notch too with rich colours accentuating the unbearable heat caused by the devastating explosions.
I thoroughly enjoyed Deepwater Horizon and this movie is proof that when done right a disaster movie doesn't have to be a disaster."

","Deepwater Horizon approaches its real-life subject matter like a deep breath before the plunge, exhibits a sense of apprehension from its opening moments, and provides an incredibly intense, thoroughly unrelenting & ruthlessly aggressive cinematic experience once things go south.<br/><br/>Based on the man-made disaster that took place on the titular oil drilling rig back in 2010 and was responsible for the worst oil spill in US history, Deepwater Horizon provides a dramatised account of the event, what ultimately caused it, and the measures that were taken to save & evacuate the numerous lives on board.<br/><br/>Directed by Peter Berg, the movie moves to the site of disaster real quick once the characters are introduced and from that point onwards, it steadily keeps ratcheting up the tension which then ultimately explodes on screen in a spectacular fashion. Berg directs the segments without holding anything back and keeps things engaging at all times.<br/><br/>Further elevating the experience is the way Berg shoots those moments of carnage. The explosion, the destruction, the suddenness of it all is vibrantly photographed & masterly edited while sound design is top-notch & effectively utilised and works in tandem with its silently brewing score. CGI isn't overblown and only assists in magnifying the elements of the disaster as it unfolds.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Deepwater Horizon features a fine cast in Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, Gina Rodriguez, Kate Hudson & others but only Wahlberg & Russell are able to stand out. Wahlberg plays the central character with sincerity and is brilliantly supported by Russell who chips in with a strong performance of his own. The rest play their part competently.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Deepwater Horizon may not feature taut screenplay or memorable characters but it sure packs a powerful punch that leaves a mark when it finally lands. Add to that, the story depicts the real-life incident without diluting it with poor dialogues or excess melodrama that many examples of its genre are guilty of, and instead opts for a serious, direct & no-nonsense approach in bringing it to cinematic life. Definitely worth a shot."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>We all know the real story and this movie put you right in the thick 'oil' of it. The first half builds up the characters and their backstory so in the second half the movie can tug at your heartstrings as you watch them try to handle and survive the explosions and endless fires. Very good and realistic production and effects. It was really believable. The script was a little too narrowly focused. It is mainly about the worker's heroics and their escape. I would have liked to learn a bit more about why the drill failed. You get a little bit in a couple scenes but they could have added more time to flush that out more in my opinion. They also pitted BP vs the Deepwater crew as BP the cost-conscience big oil company vs the downhome American blokes. My understanding was BP was most at fault but Deepwater wasn't totally innocent of fault but this doesn't claim to be true to life so can't fault it too much. It was good and entertaining and emotional; an above average Hollywood blockbuster movie."

Kurt Russell is the ever vigilant, all knowing alpha male safety consultant. Kurt Russell's character was a hard edge in a serious Charlton Heston way. Mark Whalberg is the family oriented caring professional loved by his crew. John Malkovich is the the push for it's costing us profits manager and is manipulative. The management team does not answer why the safety team's check was cancelled. Deepwater Horizon background of the rig, processes, and extras gave the realism of the oil platform. Berg directs the foreground and background of oil rig procedures and characters into a realistic disaster story so well, that Deep Water Horizion is hard to Watch! Eight out of ten. There is even an explanation that the well is so deep that the pressure of the earth and oil was too great for the dig."

","True stories always have a special effect on me. If the director is able to capture the exact amount of reality needed for this kind of movies, then it becomes more than a film, but an experience that everyone should go through. Peter Berg does a brilliant job, I can't praise him enough.<br/><br/>Everything from the character development scenes from the first act (which is surprisingly interesting and captivating) to the amazing visuals and controlled pacing, is near perfection. He gives time for us to care enough about everyone so that when the ""accident"" starts, we truly care about the characters and we want them to survive.<br/><br/>I love that there's no time for us to breathe or have a more relaxed scene from the moment the mud kicks in because that's how they felt when they were in the middle of the disaster. I love that there's never a ""Hollywood"" scene, everything seems real and frightening. I love that the movie takes its time to explain how everything really went wrong, step-by-step, even if we aren't BP's scientists/engineers (there's a perfect analogy done with a Coke and a straw). I honestly love everything about Peter Berg's direction and I can't wait for Patriots Day (it seems that he's doing a ""true story trilogy"" with Mark Wahlberg ... great!).<br/><br/>Speaking of him, Mark Wahlberg is amazing in this film as well as Kurt Russell. Both of them have performances so heartfelt and REAL, they really give everything they have into this movie and that just makes it even more fantastic. John Malkovich is also present and I gotta say: he perfectly captures the arrogant, stupid, ""bad guy"" from the BP company. I hate him, he's a total asshole. If he truly was like that in real life, well ...<br/><br/>Deepwater Horizon deservedly honors the brave workers and heroes of that day. The story is detailed perfectly, the first act might be a little bit slow, but it compensates with the amount of characters that we care about by the beginning of the disaster. The performances are great (an Oscar for Wahlberg wouldn't be a surprise), the unbreathable pacing, from the moment of the first mud kick, is as real as it can be and Peter Berg's direction is flawless at all the other levels.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"

","As usual, Peter Berg does another excellent job keeping the audience involved in his movies. There were a number of individual personal stories and interplay between characters. What was needed was more names and titles as the main characters appeared on screen. It was difficult to hear and understand a lot of dialogue as the movie moved quickly along from scene to scene. It was important to me to know who the 11 who died were while they were on the screen. Having a brief name and title as was done with the lead actors would have helped us relate to those who lost their lives. Or perhaps in the end - show the actors along with the real pictures of the fallen. Great excitement and visual portrayal of a real disaster that should not have occurred. May God bless those who lost their lives. Very emotional in the end."

","I wanted to encourage anyone who thinks something like, ""another beat-up"" or ""Hollywood goes disaster"" (again...) -- In other words hollow film skimming on what is a Major World Wide event -- Wrong.<br/><br/>To my surprise I found the film gripping. It wasn't as engaging as the producers may have indented. It definitely (still) pulled me in. What would make it ""engaging"" as well? That's up to you; for me I thought that while the jigsaw parts to engage me were present, the treatment was very superficial (even dismissive).<br/><br/>Another point for me is technology -- An oil rig like that is MORE complex and sophisticated than any Nuclear Reactor. Perhaps you can't cover it in a film; you must however explain the critical elements central to the story itself. Things were going well until the absent concrete test report issue was miraculously supplanted by a ""Negative Pressure"" test. WHAT?! WHY? Motivation? Engineering? Science? Who explained how the release valve mattered more (or was a management fop?) Gaps in story telling. <br/><br/>As I said I still found it grabbed me; may be I just need to read the court transcripts, etc. I definitely recommend watching ""Deepwater Horizon"" more than once."
"jboothmillard","7","0","2","11 June 2017"," Deepwater Horizon
","I remember seeing the short trailer for this film, I remembered the leading actor and that it was about an oil rig spillage and explosion, the real events that made the news in 2010 didn't even cross my mind at the mind, knowing this made it all the more worth watching, directed by Peter Berg (Welcome to the Jungle, Battleship, Lone Survivor). Basically on 20 April 2010, on oil drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, operated by private contractor Transocean, the workers begin drilling off the southern coast of Louisiana on behalf of BP (British Petroleum). Chief Electronics Technician Michael ""Mike"" Williams (Mark Wahlberg) and rig supervisor James ""Jimmy"" Harrell (Kurt Russell) are surprised that BP managers Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich) and Robert Kaluza (Brad Leland) have insisted that workers assigned to pump the cement, intended to keep the well stable, are being sent home early, without conducting a pressure test. While Mike prepares the drilling team, including Caleb Holloway (The Maze Runner's Dylan O'Brien), Jimmy meets with Vidrine and persuades him to conduct a test, but cement has already been poorly placed, this will only serve to weaken it more, but Vidrine is impatient waiting for Jimmy to confirm the results, he orders the well to be flowed. Initially the operation goes smoothly, but the cement job eventually fails completely, triggering a massive oil blowout, that overpowers and kills six workers. The oil is ignited by a chain of equipment malfunctions and a failed attempt to seal the well, five more workers, including Jason Anderson (My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee), are killed. The rig's navigation officer, Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez), tries to alert the Coast Guard, but she is overruled by her superior, Captain Curt Kuchta (Dave Maldonado), on the grounds that the rig is not in any imminent danger. Oil spews out into the ocean, a frightened, oil covered pelican flies into the bridge of a nearby vessel, the workers begin a frantic evacuation, Jimmy is still alive, but was seriously injured in the explosion, Mike rescues Jimmy and he takes control of the situation, but the rig cannot be saved. Aaron Dale Burkeen (Jason Kirkpatrick), a close friend of Mike's, sacrifices himself to keep a burning crane from collapsing onto the surviving crew, while Mike and Caleb rescue Vidrine and Kaluza and get them to safety. Night falls and burning oil lights up the area, the Coast Guard now aware of the incident sends a ship to pick up the survivors, with the lifeboats full, Mike locates an emergency raft, but is separated from the rig before he and Andrea can board it. The fire is burning out of control, Andrea suffers a panic attack, but she and Mike jump off the rig, just as the oil in the well is ignited and the rig is destroyed, they land in the water and are picked up by rescuers, who ferry them to supply boat the Damon Bankston. The surviving workers are reunited with their families in a hotel lobby, Mike suffers a panic attack when confronted by one of the angry killed workers' relatives, but his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) comforts him, the film ends with clips showing the aftermath of the disaster, including the testimony of the real Mike Williams, none of Transocean or BP were prosecuted, and the eleven men that lost their lives are shown. I only heard a few things about the oil spill on the Gulf of Mexico, including the strange ways they tried to plug the gap, using things like nylon tights, golf balls, rubber tyres and human hair, before they settled on cement, but now I know the real danger and fatalities that occurred, it is shocking. Wahlberg, Russell, Malkovich and all the other stars give convincing performances as the engineers trapped on the rig that goes from spilling oil into a blazing inferno, it is actually suitable that melodrama isn't ramped up, it is very realistic, with technical dialogue, it really shows the negligence of those taking short cuts for budgetary reasons, and of course you are completely caught up in the chaos of the disaster, that ended up with 200 million gallons of oil spilling, a plausible and most intense biopic disaster drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound. Very good!"
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","2","4 April 2017"," Overdue movie, solid execution
","""Deepwater Horizon"" is an American film from 2016 that is actually based on an article and was directed by Peter Berg. Berg has worked with Mark Wahlberg on other occasions as well, so it is not really a surprise the two reunited for this one here. The film managed (a bit surprisingly if I remember correctly) two Academy Award nominations in the technical categories, but lost out to ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Arrival"". It runs for 107 minutes, but admittedly this includes almost 15 minutes of credits at the end, so the real runtime is just slightly over 1.5 hours basically and nowhere near Wahlberg's longest works. The title already gives away a crucial reference to the subject here, namely the oil rig catastrophe from April 2010, roughly seven years ago now. This is definitely a subject that deserves its own movie to let more people know about it, also for future generations in the next decades. The execution was okay overall. I agree that there are moments when the film becomes a bit generic and feels like it could have been about any other catastrophe too, but as a whole, it's still a solid movie.<br/><br/>The film depicts the time directly before the catastrophe and shortly afterward. There is no emphasis on the massive environmental damage that was done. The first 60% of the film, i.e. everything before disaster strikes, were probably better because afterward it develops into a bit of a generic action film really, even if these later sequences probably resulted in the Oscar nominations. Then again, the first half has John Malkovich (and Kurt Russell), so naturally it is the superior part of the film. Wahlberg is okay as well, but sadly his character is a tad too perfect once again as he sees through the problems, is not scared of authority (i.e. Malkovich) and just turns into that huge savior at the end. But he is still a million times better than Golden Globe winner Gina Rodriguez in here, even if it is not really her fault as her character was completely insignificant and pointless the way it was written and probably only included to have any females in here at all. Then again, Oscar nominee Kate Hudson would have been enough as she does a pretty solid job too with the little she was given. She is the connection between Wahlberg's professional and family life in here and even if she is seen only on a webcam except very early and very late, she still manages to be 10 times as memorable as Rodriguez. All in all, the film is probably not as good as it could have been, but overall the focus was right and it's a good thing that it was made. I give ""Deepwater Horizon"" a thumbs-up and recommend it particularly to those with an interest in the subject or those who like fact-based action films or just those who like Mark Wahlberg and/or the supporting players. If neither description fits you, you can skip it."
"SnoopyStyle","7","0","1","26 March 2017"," compelling real life disaster
","It's April 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater Horizon is an exploration oil rig hired by BP oil to drill a well in the deep ocean floor. Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) is the supervisor and Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) is the chief technician of Deepwater Horizon. BP managers Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich) and Robert Kaluza (Brad Leland) are cutting corners and canceling vital tests. They push the delayed schedule which leads to a big explosion and environmental devastation.<br/><br/>The action, the true-life story, and the characters are all very compelling. I rarely wish for more expositions but the film could use some to lay out the ocean oil drilling operation. Peter Berg tries to do a little with the can of soda. The film is not actually confusing but a detailed explanation could help lay down the foundation. This is more of an action thriller. The crew of the Deepwater Horizon is left blameless while BP and the two managers are made as the sole villains. I don't disapprove but it's a little simplistic. Overall, this would be a good disaster movie even if it's fictional."

","Peter Berg's ""Deepwater Horizon"" is a not only a movie on a great suspense level but it is also a movie of deep emotion and sadness with some aspects of the movie in which Berg uses to his advantage in order to make this into a very effective movie which is his best movie that I have seen since his 2003 film ""The Rundown"". The movie stars Mark Wahlberg in one of his very best performances as Mike Williams who is the chief electrical technician on an offshore oil rig called none other than the ""Deepwater Horizon"". The opening scenes of the movie are probably the most emotional that I have seen where he is talking with his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) and his daughter (Stella Allen) when he knows after he says goodbye to them it could be the last time he may ever see them. Once they get to the rig the person in charge of operations on the rig is a man named Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) whose job is to make sure that things are going smoothly at all times. Then Mike ends up meeting a man by the name of Vidrine (John Malkovich). As the film progresses things end up getting more suspenseful and the person who is watching the film ends up being on the edge of their seat because the oil pipe tests aren't indicating anything good and then all hell breaks loose and the rig is engulfed in flames. The movie was based on true events which makes me feel like while watching the movie that I was actually with the characters during the explosion. The most effective scenes are in the end of the movie where no words are spoken just shocked and saddened facial expressions and music which to me personally makes it one of the most emotional endings in a movie that I have ever seen along with ""Schindler's List"" (1993), ""The Green Mile"" (1999), and ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004). This was a very good movie and I am hoping to see more from Peter Berg in the coming days and years, this is one of the best movies of 2016."

The action and the drama that's conveyed in this film is gripping and Kurt Russell and John Malkovich definitely brought the drama. This situation was an ecological disaster and in one part of the film where and oil drenched pelican crash lands on the disabled rig illustrates the capacity of how terrible this whole thing was. This film definitely brings this true story to life."
"artmania90","9","0","2","16 January 2017"," The best disaster movie ever made
","DEEPWATER HORIZON is about as good of a disaster movie as I think I have ever seen. Recounting the tragedy in 2010 in which an oiler rig caught fire and claimed the lives of 11 men on board, the movie follows the events in sequence as an ensemble cast brings to life one of the most horrific events I think I could ever imagine. Stuck in a fire is bad, but imagine being stuck in a fire 45 minutes from land, with the ocean 3 miles deep below you? That's terror.<br/><br/>The movie is told from the perspective (mainly) of one man, Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), who is now regarded as a hero for his quick-thinking and rescue of several of the crew on board. We are introduced first to his family. His wife, a stunning Kate Hudson, and his whip-smart daughter who wants her dad to find a fossil at sea for bragging rights at school. Before Williams leaves at work, the daughter demonstrates the way an oil rig works using a can of soda and a metal straw. Like that scene in Titanic where a computer generation simulates the entire sinking of the ship so that the audience knows what to expect, so does this throwaway scene give us a rudimentary knowledge of the happenings on the rig later on. When they are talking about cement and pipes and negative pressure, we have less cause to question what is happening. It's brilliant filmmaking.<br/><br/>On board, we meet the rest of the crew, captained by Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell), who argues constantly with the BP executives on board about cutting corners. The construction of the pipeline leading to the ocean's floor is already 43 days behind, and construction is abruptly finished to cut corners and save the multi-billion dollar company a little money. BP is, of course, the villain of this story since their actions led to the largest oil spill in US history. The face to the company is John Malkovich playing a conniving investor with a Cajun accent and knack for time saving. His dialogue with Russell is great, and we see the rival sides of two arguments: the crew is trying to work in the safest environment possible. BP wants the job done on schedule.<br/><br/>The events on board play out in the course of 24 hours or so. We meet the workers on board, all chummy and casual with each other. They practice songs with each other, joke, work like friends... The atmosphere is that of comfort, and there is lots of clever writing in the way small talk turns into startling character development and the candor of speech places these characters so specifically in southern Louisiana.<br/><br/>All the while we see bubbles slowly rising from the ocean floor, an omen of what is to come. When performing a standard 'negative pressure test' to gauge the strength of the newly-built pipe, a surge of pressure forces mud and natural gas to erupt into the Horizon with the force of a bomb. The facility fills with gas, and the overdrive of engines causes an explosion. In the darkness, we see massive amounts of black oil rise into the sky thousands of feet above the platform. With a spark, it is ignited... The entire ship is a floating firebomb.<br/><br/>Luckily many survive, and the action once the flames start is less plot driven and more or less a fight to escape. With Mark Wahlberg's character, he is knocked unconscious in his bed chamber and must work through the darkness to find safely. Kurt Russell, caught in the explosion in the shower, is nearly blinded and impaled by shards of glass and metal. It's utter chaos.<br/><br/>The most effective aspects of this film (and there are many) is the set piece of the Deepwater Horizon, itself. It has been called the most expensive movie set ever built, and watching the movie I would never have second-guessed that this was not a real rig that has been long weathered and worn. We learn it is not anchored to the oceanbed but rather a floating raft of sorts that uses propellers to center it constantly above the delicate pipeline bringing oil to the surface. Without propellers, the craft shifts off-centered, risking the pipe bursting and oil flowing freely into the ocean. In a moment of absolute startle, we are with the pilot in the control room when suddenly all power goes out. The silence is matched in terror by the instant knowledge of an oil spill unlike anything they had seen before and the dire need to regain power of the motors.<br/><br/>This is surely an intense film, but it is matched equally with heart, which is an aspect I think many disaster movies gloss over in the end to create a cookie-cutter ending with a bow on top. Here, when the survivors are rescued and brought to safety they are not happy and cheering to be alive. Mike Williams breaks down on his hotel room floor and is unhinged by the horror he had just lived. Families become angry in an attempt to locate their son or daughter on board. Yes this is a true story, and the filmmakers respected the subject enough to give it a bit more weight that a typical blockbuster might have bestowed.<br/><br/>It's hard to rate movies on a scale since it's purely objective and driven by emotion. Deepwater Horizon may not be a perfect movie, and it may have slight flaws, but the feeling of immersion into the story and the characters left me breathless from opening to the final credits. The visual effects add to the story and create images that I won't soon forget. The final moments brought a tear to my eye. From the movies I know are currently playing in theaters, this is the one movie I would want to go back to a second time."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","16 January 2017"," Dramatization of the April 2010 disaster. Failure to properly audit.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from a Redbox rental. No extras, just the movie. <br/><br/>The Deepwater Horizon was a semi-submersible rig for drilling oil and gas wells in very deep water, as deep as 8,000 feet, and designed to drill as deep as 30,000 feet, more than 5 miles deep. Its above-water platform was roughly the size to two football fields placed side-by- side.<br/><br/>I live near the Gulf Coast, my career was in the oil industry, so this event almost 7 years ago is still somewhat fresh in my mind. In April 2010 in final operations to seal off a new well and begin production, some shortcuts were taken. The sealing cement was not properly tested and when the incident happened high-pressure natural gas, methane, flooded the platform and resulted in a fireball, eventually destroying and sinking the platform. The largest oil spill in history resulted. Today it rests on the bottom of the Gulf about 5000 feet down. There had been 126 aboard and 11 died, the rest escaped via lifeboats.<br/><br/>I found the first half of this movie most interesting as it deals with the characters, their lives, how they traveled back and forth, how they interacted on the job, the depiction of the disagreements on well readiness. Most of the second half is the disaster and as such it becomes the somewhat typical disaster movie, showing the explosions, the falling rigs, the injuries, the escapes. All well made but nothing that we haven't seen before except we know this was a real event.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is the co-main character, Mike Williams, chief instrument guy, and Kurt Russell as Jimmy Harrell, almost always called ""Mr Jimmy"", who it seemed was the chief supervisor on the rig. Both of them are excellent, I particularly liked Russell."

","Ahhh, this movie reminds me of when I was on an oil rig disaster and we were trapped with little oxygen left. Suddenly a mana man literally on fireshowed up out of nowhere and led us to the Coast Guard's helicopter. But, we wouldn't have made it out alive if he hadn't single-handedly held up the metal tower that would've surely crashed down on the transportand us. He stayed behind so we could escape. What a super-man he was<br/><br/>Oh, shoot. That was Man of Steel. This was real life.<br/><br/>My biggest regret in this movie was that I did not see it on the big screen. Well, okay, that and me making a poor joke reference up-front on an incident that claimed eleven lives and destroyed a tremendous amount more in the 3-month spill following. <br/><br/>The first half is setup leading to an inevitable disaster. Backing up, sadly, I didn't know any hardcore details of this incident. I knew of giant man-made oil spills and a BP-caused catastrophe(s,) I just didn't connect the dots here. It was just obvious from the get-go: this won't end well.<br/><br/>At any rate, normally when I watch a disaster-film, I am generally impatient and want to get to the goods. As soon as possible. Not this time, though. I found the first 50 or so minutes fascinating. A day in the life of these drillers and the technicalities of the oil drill rig was quite interesting and both believably and beautifully shot. And then. Then the mud hit the fan and the movie gets enormously and horrifically brutal. <br/><br/>And the movie never lets up. I already felt this was well-shot, albeit a grown-up Michael Bay film. And it continued to have great cinematography through explosions, massive damage and heroism. Again, it sounds like a Michael Bay movie, but again, it was far more mature filmmaking than that man-child will ever achieve.<br/><br/>Yes, I wish I saw this on the big screen and I wish more had. This movie was incredible with its grand-scale spectacle of the rig going haywire around these workers. But the movie is not without its flaws.<br/><br/>Yes, there are big-bad businessmen out there who make colossal-sized mistakesI know of a few in the many jobs I've had (though, not to cost lives, mercifully) and these were a tad over-the-top. And on the flipside, while I wasn't there, the heroism touched on the Man of Steel reference I made above. I truly hope this is what happened – the men going after other survivors to save lives and the ""Captain"" more concerned about his crew than his potentially life-threatening injuries. <br/><br/>I got past my own negative thoughts and even couldn't help but tear up at the end. Thankfully, the movie knew when to quit and not make this an unnecessary and padded three-hour, overblown (no pun) drama. It had just enough screen time to introduce and fascinate us, take us through bad- decisions/bad-outcomes and give us the on-screen facts I was looking forward to thorough. Especially since I was completely ignorant on these events.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this action/true-life film. More so for people with a HUGE entertainment center at home since it was sorely missed on the big screen. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: When I first heard the premise and especially since it was a true story of an oil rig tragedy, unfortunately, I dismissed it as ""not my kind of movie."" EVEN with my knowledge of the film starring John Malkovich, Kurt Russell and Marky Mark. This all when it was in theatres. Trust meI'm gonna rethink my life. This movie already impressed me wholeheartedly at home. It would've blown me away on the silver screen. (Again, no pun.)"

The thing i like most about this film is that i do not know anything about oil drilling,but the director has found a way to translate the complex engineering stuffs that goes on the oil rig to the extent that a layman like me has almost a complete understanding on what went down. The film also has proper execution of the action, that feels real, as in am not sure if they used CGI or they were actually performing the stunts.Without forgetting an excellent depiction of life of a human in different life situation, the film has good arguments you can almost feel the tension between the characters, true depiction of family love, dynamics and it has carried itself well when it comes to the emotional aspect that it might make u cry.

Indeed, I'd say this movie is the most interesting if you have some personal interest in or memory of learning about the real story back when it happened. What makes this movie engaging is knowing that this story really happened and the characters in the movie are real people (who in reality look nowhere near as attractive as the actors chosen to play them, amusingly enough). Otherwise, it's just a well made, but fairly standard disaster movie.<br/><br/>Personal BP anecdote: I was a geology student when this story happened. In 2011, one year after the incident, I attended a presentation by BP representatives who came to my school to recruit geology students. They gave a presentation on 100 years of BP's company history, during which they gushed all about all of BP's accomplishments throughout the century. But conveniently for them, BP was founded in 1909, so the presentation ended at the year 2009. Not a single word was uttered on the disaster and oil spill. Anyway, I thought that was amusing."

","I had the opportunity a few months ago to see Deepwater Horizon in theaters during a college strike day. I love watching films that are based on true stories because afterwords I love to do some research on the actual stories themselves and to compare and contrast the Hollywood version and the actual events. <br/><br/>So Deepwater Horizon was based on a semi-submersible drilling rig owned by Transocean off the shores of the Golf of Mexico about 250 miles away from Huston, Texas. April 20, 2010 there was a large explosion causing the largest oil spill in the United States. <br/><br/>Directed by Peter Berg there was an excellent cast that included Mark Wahlberg,Kurt Russell as the main characters. The whole movie was set on the oil rig and what the crew members had to go though in 2 days. The head crew members knew something was wrong with the drilling machine but the cost was adding up everyday they were not drilling so the owners of the rig were pushing hard to drill even though there were red flags of the drilling being unsafe. The movie added real life clips from news channels. Also, at the end of the film before the credits the director added actual pictures of the crew members and their stories of what happened to them after the explosion. The director did a great job keeping the suspense and action pack through out the film. Trying to keep details such as when the explosion happened you see the slush of mud and water exploding out all over the crew members and the fire on the rig. There was not much of a love story going on except the opening scene with the crew members saying good by to their loved ones as they make there way to the oil rig. There was also the occasional phone call or Skype while on the rig.I liked how the story was based on the rig and the explosion without the extra Hollywood love story added in. This kept the viewer focused on the events that were played out. As a viewer you almost feel as though you are standing on the rig with them. I really thought the details were great the camera angels and lighting were well done to give you that action pack suspense feel of being part of the movie. Deep water Horizon kept ya on your toes especially knowing that it was based on actual events watching the crew members struggle to survive gave me a more emotional feel towards the movie. <br/><br/>Like any Hollywood film representing a true event you will always see added scenes that were not part of the actual events to keep the movie watcher engaged but doing some research on the actual event i thought that the director did an excellent job keeping it pretty realistic. I was surprised on how fast this film came out when the actual even only happened 6 years ago so its still very fresh in peoples minds. I would recommend this film to anyone to watch!"
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","0","5","4 December 2016"," heartbreaking account of a needless disaster. one of the best so far this year
","Peter Berg's Deepwater Horizon floored me. Combining stirring heroics, meticulous procedural reconstruction, thundering big style special effects and a rock steady, salt of the earth cast who fire on all cylinders, Berg and team have successfully sent one of, if not the best films this year down the pipe (oily pun intended). The 2010 disaster aboard the mammoth Deepwater Horizon oil rig was a tragic, foolish and achingly avoidable event that was the product of carelessness, stupidity and resulted in the unnecessary death of eleven souls. Berg clearly weeps for the loss, and every frame of his film is filled with empathy and compassion, a reluctant condemnation of the Big Oil company men whose actions led to life lost, a rock jawed testament to the blue collar heroes who gave shot rays of hope through the darkest day with their brave deeds, and a celebration of the rip roaring set pieces possible in telling this story. Mark Whalberg has never, ever been better, playing the engineering honcho of te Deepwater, madly in love with his wife (Kate Hudson) and daughter (Stella Allen) The early scenes build their relationship with near effortless interactions and a thoughtful, compassionate eye. From the minute his chopper touches down on the rig and it becomes clear that safety protocol has been grossly neglected, he is a bundle of nerves and fears for every life on board above his own. Kurt Russell is right alongside him as a dogged senior operative with a short rope and no time for the headstrong, greedy and unprofessional actions of Big Oil honcho John Malkovich, giving his best, and insipid work in years as a guy who plainly and simply doesn't care, putting everyone in harm's way in the process. The best and most surprising performance of the film comes from Gina Rodriguez though, an actress who has mostly swam under my radar up until this point. Playing another senior engineer, her raw terror and naked uncertainty in the face of looming calamity and possible death is rough to watch, utterly convincing and made me want to just give her a big hug. If her work here is any indication of where she's headed, make way folks, because we're in for great things. The cast also extends into terrific further work from Ethan Suplee, J.D. Evermore, James Dumont, Dylan O Brien, Berg himself in a quick cameo, and many more.Berg wisely wraps the story up not with one final action sequence, but with a hair raising emotional gut punch that tallies the loss of life and psychological damage of such an event with the care required. There is one final action beat to then story, but it's swift, necessary and sensible, never feeling overblown. The story is kept wisely focused on the people trapped aboard this explosion waiting to happen, their struggles and efforts in the forefront. When the fireworks do show up, they're not to shock and awe the audience, or for cheap thrills, they serve only to illustrate such an event in a minimal fashion, which is still a deafening roar. My kind of disaster/procedural story, and one of the best so far this year."

","Very good movie, based on a real story that goes in some way into detail, shows the emotional side of the characters and plays with a tremendous tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Very well made Biography Genre Film. Not only Typical Action movie. Perhaps the film critics do not like that it only covers the initial tragedy and does not cover the natural disaster afterwards or its doesn't go into detail about why those perforations were more risky than usually, but it is a feature film not a documentary. Solid acting from Wahlberg, Kurt Russel and John Malcovich. The only thing I did not like, was the excess of explosions at the end. A little less would have been even more realistic and would have given same amount of tension. If there is a word to define this movie it would be ENTERTAINMENT at its fullest."
"CANpatbuck3664","9","0","2","14 October 2016"," Deepwater Horizon is an Masterful Example of How to Do a Disaster Movie Right
","We all remember the news of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It dominated news coverage and was a terrible tragedy. It changed the course of many lives. It absolutely deserved a movie, I just didn't anticipate it being about the crew of the Deepwater Horizon. If you're going to do a movie of this type, the combination of Mark Wahlberg and Peter Berg seem like as natural choice. I really liked Lone Survivor and although I'm not going to defend Battleship, Peter Berg gets a bad rap. He knows how to tell a story and provide the big budget thrills you want from a blockbuster. I was just that much more stoked to see Deepwater Horizon after seeing the reviews. I walked away from the theatre impressed with both the heroism of the crew of the Deepwater Horizon and the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a couple of opening shots of the Deepwater Horizon rig and the drilling pipe it uses to test for oil we join Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson). It's April 2010 and Mike is about to head out for 3 weeks out on the rig Deepwater Horizon. He's an employee of Transocean who are working for BP (British Petroleum). Before he leaves, his daughter is doing a presentation about Mike's job and how they are able to extract the oil from the land at the bottom of the ocean. He ""tames the dinosaurs"" as it were and his daughter begs him to bring her back a fossil so that she can trump another classmate of hers. <br/><br/>At the same time, other crew members such as Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez) and Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) are heading to the airport where they ship out via helicopter. On the ride out the crew catches up and shoot the breeze about what they've been up to. When they get there, they run into the team who were supposed to test the some of the safety precautions. The tests were skipped in an effort to streamline the process under the direction of some visiting BP representatives being led by Vedrine (John Malkovich). Mr. Jimmy objects but makes an effort to compromise. Both he and Mike leave the bridge angry but resolve to do the job efficiently, unbeknownst to them the fate that lies ahead.<br/><br/>So whether you saw the trailers for Deepwater Horizon or not, you know how the movie's going to end. The first thing I want to congratulate the movie for is that the setup is so well done. The movie introduces and develops characters that you like. The actors have such a strong camaraderie and they feel like a crew that could have been working together. The script provides them with some great dialogue and although some of the talk about the processes on the rig can be confusing, the fact that the script takes the time to do these things is great by itself. Most disaster movies treat people like cannon fodder but in this one while certain people meet their demise, you can't help but feel sorry for these unfortunate people even setting aside the fact that some of this happened.<br/><br/>The movie does the extra work of bringing in good dialogue and interesting characters but you also have to credit the actors for bringing them to life. This is a role that fits Mark Wahlberg perfectly, Mike Williams is the blue collar hero that Wahlberg excels at playing. It's because Mark is so great that when the plot turns and Mike has to step up, you know he'll succeed. Kurt Russell is just as good as Mr. Jimmy. He's the right balance between authoritative and compassionate. He represents the audience in many ways, questioning the relaxed safety practices of BP and trying to make judgment calls on whether they can risk looking past a sketchy test result. Russell is well cast and I was impressed. The movie also features some great supporting performances. There are a lot of people in the cast but the two that stood out to me were Gina Rodriguez and Dylan O'Brien as Andrea and Caleb respectively. They were both great and stole the scenes they were in. Kate Hudson was OK, John Malkovich has got the brunt of the criticism as Vidrine. I think he strikes a nice balance between being too aggressive or too complacent but I would agree his accent isn't the best.<br/><br/>The part of the movie that I haven't mentioned yet is that when things go south and the disaster happens, its not only well filmed but its really terrifying. The movie keeps flashing to the drilling pipe and the ground around it (maybe even a little too much) and with every crack or air pocket being released you grow that much more scared. There were times where I just kept flinching, expecting something to go horribly wrong at any minute. Deepwater Horizon does an excellent job of ratcheting up the tension even though we know something is going to go wrong. When it does happen, the action is brutal and you can almost feel every shot the crew takes from this gigantic machine self-destructing. Berg and crew know how to shoot these kind of scenes and the movie wouldn't be the same if things weren't as scary.<br/><br/>I didn't find much to complain about when it came to Deepwater Horizon. Some of the lingo was hard to follow and certain things felt exaggerated for the sake of the drama but this movie is nothing short of astounding. Excellent movies are produced when you can work with interesting material and you can get talented people in the right roles. Deepwater Horizon nails both. I'm glad that Berg and Wahlberg are continuing to collaborate and that we got a movie that showed how there can be humanity and heroism in moments against overwhelming odds."

You feel the disaster as it goes along, although it builds up to the disaster quite well. Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell and Gina Rodriguez all give solid performances, even Kate Hudson on what she was giving, so does John Malkovich.

Nothing major but it did pull me out of the moment a couple of times. 2) A scene where a guy sticks his hand in a spout of mud being sprayed at 1200 ish psi; which was earlier stated to be enough to cut a car in half, without suffering injury."

"sleeplessdave_2000","9","0","1","10 October 2016"," Peter Berg's Finest Film
","Director Peter Berg has made some very good films (Lone Survivor, Friday Night Lights), but in Deepwater Horizon he delivers his best film about the worst oil disaster in U.S. history. Making smart choices in story flow, creating possibly the most immersive disaster in cinema history, and avoiding preachy environmental messages, Berg delivers at the end of September a sort-of bookend to September's opening hit: Sully. Except aside from both being outstanding films, Deepwater Horizon is in every way the anti-Sully.Read more<br/><br/>Berg chooses to focus on only the disaster incident of Deepwater. You could do a mini-series in the decades of negligence and corporate greed that caused the conditions that set the dominoes to topple. You could do an equally long mini-series on the environmental and economic impact to the Gulf and Gulf states. Any of those tangents would cause us to lose the laser focus of cascading disasters that Berg propels the film through. Using Deepwater Horizon's Chief Engineer Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) as his every-man in the chaos, Berg, from the very opening credits begins imparting the audience with the bare minimum of education they'll need to understand what's going to happen.<br/><br/>First, and I forgot this, Deepwater is not an oil platform. It's a ship. A harvester of sorts that's piloted from well to well. The crew of that ship were British Petroleum contractors. What happened on Deepwater is, beyond dispute, BP's fault, and everyone knows it. Berg quickly makes a distinction between the crew of the ship and the BP brass pushing the captain (Kurt Russell) to undertake dangerous drilling after skipping critical maintenance tests and ignoring well-explained red flag after red flag. This exposition could have bogged the film down, but it's well-written and also used to introduce the crew, and without it, you wouldn't feel the dread slowly creeping into your bones once the ship connects to the pipeline and attempts to drill.<br/><br/>In this film, the event is the star, but Wahlberg and Russell (who I love in small character parts where he gets to act) anchor a strong cast. No one is showy or Hollywood; they all look like they belong on the rig. John Malkovich serves as the face of BP, and you could argue he went a little over the top, but they DID do this. If anything, having read about the case, Malkovich could have twirled a Snidely Whiplash stache and had a pet bat and not been as evil as BP was/is. I honestly didn't have a whole lot of respect for Wahlberg at the beginning of his career, but in the right role.....he's still not as good an actor as his brother Donnie, but he's closing the gap.<br/><br/>Explaining the cascading series of failures of untested cement sealing the well, skipped maintenance and inspections, a ship that already was 10% broken before anything began, and how all that comes together into an oil platform that explodes would take far more mechanical expertise than I have or you want to read. I seriously urge you to check this out in the theater, because as disaster, after disaster, after disaster beset the Deepwater, Berg has so wisely positioned you with the knowledge you need that you're immersed wholly in the event in a way I don't think I've ever experienced on film. The only thing missing is blasting heat pummeling you as you watch the crew first try to save the vessel, then contain the disaster, and then just try to get off alive. It's unbelievably tense, and even though it's been years and we know what happens, that knowledge leaves your head at some point as you watch these contractors, put in a deathtrap by BP, try to do everything they can to avoid what we know will eventually beset the ill-fated vessel.<br/><br/>After the explosion, for 87 days, the well under the remains of Deepwater continued to pump oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Over 210 million tons of oil went into the Gulf as the result of this catastrophe. The heroics of the crew may be the only good story to come out of this disaster. It's a dim silver lining when BP executives should be sitting in jail, but at least it gives us the human side of that fateful day. Deepwater Horizon is currently the 10th film I've given a 9.0 or above rating in 2016 thus far. With the Oscar riches of fall yet to come, I think 2016 is going to finish strongly as a very solid year for cinema (with some long gaps). Bring on the fall!"
"mattslim333","9","0","1","9 October 2016"," Intense and moving
","Deepwater Horizon is based on true events- the explosion of an oil rig in 2010, which created the worst oil spill in US history. The first act of the film is rather character driven and explores the life of Mark Williams, played by Mark Wahlberg. He does a great job in the role and as usual puts in a great performance. Other actors include John Malkovich and Kurt Russell who also do well with the solid script, which relies largely on banter in the opening part, and the film can be funny despite the sensitive topic. As the film continues, you know what's coming and the way tension is built though mechanical shots of the inner workings of the rig are clever, as this builds the tension.<br/><br/>The actual explosion is the rig is incredibly intense, and the film is gripping all the way through. Even though most know the story, Deepwater Horizon never lost my interest and this is credit to the director Peter Berg, who showed his action style with the also gripping Lone Survivor. The action was largely not done through CGI and therefore looks very realistic and this is crucial for a personal film such as this. The aftermath and closing section of the film is very moving- after the high tension of the explosion, the personal tragedy caused by the event comes to the fore here and makes for a terrific ending and tribute to those who lost there lives. The soundtrack is touching here, and this is no surprise with the excellent Steve Jabolonsky on scoring duties.<br/><br/>The film's only fault is there is little development of most characters and they rather get lost behind the weight of the story, apart in this case from Wahlberg's character. Overall, Deepwater Horizon is a intense and moving tribute to those who lost their lives in this tragic event, and it's personal touch is clear which makes for an excellent film."
"Screen_Blitz","9","0","1","9 October 2016"," Deepwater Horizon boasts an authentic and terrifying disaster into a gripping action-heavy vehicle
","There's only a handful of filmmakers who manage to tap into real-life events and adapting them to the silver screen in a way that effectively balances sheer authenticity and gripping emotional heft. Peter Berg is certainly one of them, and his treatment on the war genre in his previous film 'Lone Survivor' supplies fair evidence. This action-heavy disaster tale focusing on the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that occurred in April 20, 2010, spilling hundreds of millions of oil into the Gulf of Mexico; shows Berg further expanding on his ambitious gift on springing terrifying events to life in a way that not only shines diligently with realism, but also pays a respectful tribute to the men and women who either suffered or lost their lives in this tragedy. And Berg does so without feeling the need to regurgitate on tired disaster clichés and contrived sentimentality. Collaborating with Peter Berg for the second time, Mark Wahlberg plays Mike Williams, a father and husband who takes a four-week job at the oil rig forty miles off the coast of New Orleans. Set with a crew of 120 men including operations supervisor Jimmy Harrell (played by Kurt Russell) and BP executive Donald Vidrine (played by John Malkovich) who Mike warns about the various machinery issues that could put the employees in danger. Unfortunately, he ignores these problems. When the BP executives test out the oil pipes, they witness an alarming increase in the oil pressure that within moments, causes violent explosion that not only severely injures several crew members including Mike and Jimmy, but sends the entire oil rig engulfed in flames and the large crew in a harrowing escape for their lives as the U.S coast guard journeys across sea for help.<br/><br/>Terrifying is barely enough to describe the heart-pounding intensity and realism Peter Berg captures in this disaster thriller, and how efficiently he is on capturing characters you come to care about with more than the single reason being the fact of they are inspired by real-life figures who had suffered this horror. During the first thirty minutes, the film spends its time introducing the characters and who they are, along with systemically explaining the components of the oil rig; this includes tapping into Mike Williams and his relationship with his wife (played by Kate Hudson, Kurt Russell's step-daughter) and his young daughter who passionately admires him. This also involves establishing the carelessness of John Malkovich's character, a BP executive who basically made to be the villain of the whole situation when he ignores all the warning signs that eventually lead to the nefarious catastrophe. The rest of fellow oil workers are left with virtually no character development, which is almost predictable considering the large number of characters we're force to swallow. Above this minor flaw, Peter Berg does a magnificent job on the setting up for the the prolonged disaster sequence in which we are treated with some of the most anguishing moments ever brought to screen in the disaster category; with very infrequent opportunities to breath. Machines exploding, metal flying, oil splattering, and bodies tossed around and about; there is absolutely no sugar-coating in Peter Berg's depiction of the hellish disaster. If you can the remember the anguishing cliff dive scene from 'Lone Survivor', that is close to what the disaster here feels like. With gruesome imagery of the character's injuries including Kurt Russell's disfigured face and the immersive cinematography by Enrique Chediak to capture the atmosphere of the brutal inferno, the film effectively pulls you into the heat of the character's fight for survival, and does so without igniting into Michael Bay-style mayhem but instead treating the explosive catastrophe in substance. Each time a character is battered or thrown thrashed, the pain hits you hard. And though Peter Berg inserts a fair share of sentimentality in the heat of the moments, especially at the end; it all feels real and never contrived. The performances, while nothing particurily special, also bring the things of beauty; primarily Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell who don't necessarily steal the show, but stand out amongst the cast in this powerfully executed action thriller. John Malkovich gets his fair share of ingenuity, but perhaps not the level of his main co-stars.<br/><br/>Deepwater Horizon is an authentic and terrifying disaster flick on the account of America's worst environmental disaster in history. Peter Berg successfully captures the sheer realism of the horrifying events and effective technical aspects, while offering some gripping performances by the cast."

The film is absolutely gripping and you'll be on the edge of your seat before you know it. Fire and exploding metal almost comes out of the screen towards you....without having to go to an Imax. No doubt, screened at an Imax this effect will be even more pronounced. Frightening and heart stopping in turns, this is a definite must see."

"matthewssilverhammer","8","0","1","7 October 2016"," BP Sucks
","Deepwater Horizon can seem like a ""rah-rah humanity"" movie whose ceiling of quality is ""pretty good"", and more likely just a forgettable thriller-drama. Imagine my surprise when that it's not only good, but actually kinda great. Combining the harrowing real-life thrills of the sinking boat in Titanic with the humanity and tone of Captain Phillips, this is the one of the best American heroism story in years. With enveloping dialogue, likable characters and heart-pounding scares, DH hits all its targets with concrete precision. Shot in a steady cinema-verite style, the story of the oil-slick disaster that lead to the 2010 BP spill is one that greatly benefits from slam-cuts, hand-held shooting and sweeping aerials. At times, this almost POV cinematography creates some confusion, but usually it just places us within an effectively disorienting state surrounded by explosions, hysteria, and screaming. What makes the intensity work is the characters. We care about them because of their relationships to each other. Wahlberg gives an unpretentiously solid performance at the center, Russell stands affably strong throughout, Rodriguez continues her deserving ascent to superstardom (checkout CW's ""Jane the Virgin""), and Hudson is better than ever in a heartbreakingly authentic role. Her line reading of ""Not now, baby"" is an emotional gut-punch. As a citizen on the Gulf Coast, it's impossible not to feel this story more intensely. This may explain why it's not too big of a problem that every white-collar BP man is portrayed so one-dimensionallyalthough it wasn't great, and Malkovich's Cajun accent was almost the death of me. However, this story-we-don't-know-behind-the-headlines-we-do adventure is such a well-oiled, character-based thrill ride, it's hard not be engulfed."

","Movie: Mark Walberg's big movie hit based on the biggest oil spill in U.S history, along the Gulf of Mexico was a massive hit which surprised many critics and movie watchers around the world, as you see a convincing and terrifying dramatization of what happened on the Deepwater Horizon. This movie was very dramatic and full of action which means no pee breaks and no blinking, because you don't want to miss a bit of it as the story unfolds. The director: Peter Berg and along with Mark Walberg taking part in producing the film, they put out a thrilling, and exciting film which has everybody on the edge of their seats. The first half of the movie is a ticking time bomb and when everything goes out of hand, the last 40 minutes are you gritting your teeth. The events in this movie as you may of noticed are based on true events and were truly shocking and Mike Williams, (Mark Walberg's character, the main character) performs truly heroic actions for the sake of his work mates.<br/><br/>Actors: Mark Walberg has to be one of my favorite actors, and even though it slides off the comedy genre, in this movie everything works brilliantly with the actors. You cannot really doubt any actors in the movie; the cast for the movie was great, Including: Mark Walberg, Kurt Russel, Kate Hudson, John Malkovich and several appearances by Dylan O' Brian. <br/><br/>Editing: The editing and work in this movie was pushing me off my seat in the cinema with huge explosions, big bursts, people getting blown away, it just has your heart beating through your chest.<br/><br/>Feedback: I strongly recommend people to see this extraordinary movie, also its best in cinemas so you can get a better experience for the movie. Something that I thought was a great feature of the film was at the end it shows the real hero, Mike Williams and has a tribute to the 11 people who died during the shocking event with their names and picture which really was a great thing to add.

"danielharden","8","0","1","6 October 2016"," Dear BP screw you Love Peter Berg and co.
","What do you do when you are in some really deep water, not just in the metaphorical sense but in the literal sense as well? Director Peter Berg and Actor/Producer Marky Mark Walhberg bring us the answer as they adapt the story of Mike Williamson and crew aboard the BP owned, Deepwater Horizon oil rig on the day it exploded and created the worst oil spill in U.S. history. This disaster movie brings both the action and emotion of the event brilliantly and it is safe to say Berg has bested his other ocean adventure film Battleship by a mile with this true story.<br/><br/>The action packed portion of the movie was excellently executed. The action isn't only good because of the relentlessness of the event but mainly due to the emotion embedded within it. This also is down to the film building to the incident by building on characters so you actually care about them when the mud starts to rise. The emotion behind the action is what makes the film great and to me a specific moment that stood out was the man who died moving the crane, we do not know his name but we know he's one of the 11 casualties of the event.<br/><br/>Peter Bergs direction of this film was simple but effective. The event is built to and happens, but the way that Berg is able to embed emotion within the action really stands out as it constantly reminds us that these are real people and this event (although dramatised) actually happened.<br/><br/>The acting all round was great. Mark Walhberg does good this time especially at the end on the hotel floor. Kurt Russell and John Malkovich made perfect enemies, Russell's performance as the extremely competent and passionate Jimmy Harrell is easy to get behind, and equally Malcovichs power abusing and corner cutting Vidrine is a character you easily come to hate. These two characters stand out as the best as their rivalry is massively entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>The only real issue I have with this film is one of Bergs directing staples. Berg ruins the ending of his biopic films in the opening scene. In Lone Survivor the opening scene is the ending and also the marketing of star Mark Walhberg in a film and the title spoil the events of the film before even watching it. In this film the film opens with audio from the real life court hearing and through the mention of names you know who survives the event. I do understand this is a true story and so the ending has already been written by life itself, but for those who don't know who Mike Willaimson is or who have forgotten it (which would be the majority of people) would bring more tension if they are left unaware of the characters fate.<br/><br/>Overall, Deepwater Horizon is an explosive and emotive disaster movie with great acting and direction despite the opening audio. Berg and Walhberg are becoming a pretty good film making duo and look forward to their next collaboration. I highly recommend this movie so if you love disaster movies and hate BP then you are in for a treat."

","Deepwater Horizon is a biographical disaster film starring Mark Wahlberg. Based on the 2010 explosion and oil spill of the titular oil rig, the film is a fitting, yet somewhat sensationalistic look at what is now the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history.<br/><br/>On April 20, 2010, the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, located in the Gulf of Mexico, suffers a major blowout, resulting in a huge explosion which kills 11 workers and causes thousands of gallons of oil to leak out into the ocean. The film depicts the events leading up to this incident and the workers desperate to escape the raging inferno on board.<br/><br/>While the film does tend to overly-dramatise certain moments involving the disaster, the performance from the cast kept the film from straying too far into unbelievable territory. Mark Wahlberg, who also co-produced the film, gives a solid performance in the lead role of Mike Williams, as does Kurt Russell playing crew member Jimmy ""Mr. Jimmy"" Harrell. After the explosion occurs, you can really feel the sense of panic and shock emanating throughout the characters as they try to deal with surviving far out in the ocean. Surprisingly, the film barely focuses much on the oil spill itself but rather on just the blowout and the explosion. I would have liked to have seen more emphasis on the aftermath of the spill rather than only on the destruction of the rig. Overall, the film is still a worthwhile tribute to all those on board who died and to those who tried to save their fellow co-workers on that fateful night in April.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10."

","'DEEPWATER HORIZON': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The new disaster flick about the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (which also caused a humongous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico); the catastrophe is the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history (which also killed 11 workers, and injured 17 more). The movie stars Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, Gina Rodriguez, Dylan O'Brien, John Malkovich, Kate Hudson and Ethan Suplee. It was directed by Peter Berg; who's also teamed with Wahlberg on the 2013 war film 'LONE SURVIVOR', and the upcoming historical disaster flick 'PATRIOTS DAY'. The script was written by Matthew Sand and Matthew Michael Carnahan; it was based on the The New York Times' article 'Deepwater Horizon's Final Hours' (written by David Barstow, David S. Rohde and Stephanie Saul). Due to it's $156 million budget, the film is a pretty big disappointment at the Box Office; but it has done well with critics. I'd say it's about as good a film as I expected it to be. <br/><br/>The true story takes place on April 20, 2010; on the oil rig Deepwater Horizon (about 40 miles from the Louisiana coast). The drilling unit was owned by Transocean, and drilling for BP. The blowout, and explosion (on the rig that day), caused it to burn and sink; and release thousands of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This film focuses on some of the 120 crew members, that were on board; including Mike Williams (Wahlberg), Jimmy Harrell (Russell), Andrea Fleytas (Rodriguez) and Caleb Holloway (O'Brien).<br/><br/>The film is technically impressive, and it's well made. Berg is a talented director, at making this type of movie, and Wahlberg and Russell are great at acting in them. Although the performances are good, I don't think there's enough character development to really care about the characters. So the movie is not nearly as emotional as it wants to be. I also think spending $156 million on a film like this is ridiculous; how did the producers ever think they were going to make their money back?! It is intense, and suspenseful though.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/MPT8bbqblmM"

","Deepwater Horizon thrives because of the tension crafted through the impressive ensemble cast and the realistic action, stunts and effects. It has a number of flaws though, which prevents it from excelling and becoming a memorable picture, although the spectacle will tide you over long enough to enjoy and appreciate this disaster flick. It is impressive and it is immortalising for those killed in the disaster, but it doesn't fully embrace the scope of the disaster as much as one wants it too. As I previously mentioned with this summer's Nerve, Lionsgate continue to craft a post-Hunger Games slate and while this is a critical success so far, I'm still unsure they have crafted a model that will have them in line with their competitors. It's expense may be its letdown but I do believe its a story that needs to be heard (and seen - on a big screen!).<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW - http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.com/2016/10/deepwater-horizon-2016- review.html"
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","0","2","1 October 2016"," An Okay Movie
","Call the month of September gear shift month for big-budget Hollywood. Somewhere just before school begins and the auspicious start of award season, larger outfits worth their salt release otherwise decent films that don't quite fit neatly into the defined high and low tides of Blockbuster season and Oscar-bait season respectively. Sometimes that's a good thing, giving us under-appreciated gems like Pawn Sacrifice (2015) or out-of-nowhere emotional powerhouses like Room (2015).<br/><br/>This month, the movie Gods have blessed us with not one, but two nuts-and-bolts features, based on true, ripped from the headlines stories existing as examples of American selflessness and elbow- grease, but whose movie adaptations prove underwhelming. The first was Sully (2016); now the second is Deepwater Horizon.<br/><br/>In the wee hours of April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, a semi- submersible offshore drilling rig exploded 40 miles off the southwest coast of Louisiana. After the initial catastrophe, 126 workers found themselves trapped aboard the rig which was quickly consumed by a raging fire that lasted more than 24 hours. The film centers on the stories of the 126 crew members and their challenges to escape danger in the explosion's immediate aftermath.<br/><br/>These stories include that of Chief Electrician Mike Williams (Wahlberg). The beginning of the film portrays him as a blue-collar every-man whose expertise and caution pegs him as one of the main flies in the ointment to impatient company men. When he first arrives on the Deepwater, he and rig foreman Mr. Jimmy (Russell) appropriately ream BP overseers for ignoring (among other things) a leaky blowout preventer, an untested wellhead and, most egregiously calling back the exploration crew before they could test out their concrete job.<br/><br/>If that all sounds too technical don't worry, director Peter Berg seemingly unaware that audiences can pick up on context clues, plugs in handy title cards to help explain the intricacies of drilling for oil on the open seas. Information that cannot be conveyed via tile card is helpfully scribbled on chalkboard by main BP lackey Donald Vidrine (Malkovich) and surmised by Russell's ""working-man knows best"" proclamations. This is despite knowing full-well, the Deepwater's crew presumably knows how to do their job.<br/><br/>In fairness to Mr. Berg, the technical abilities of an oil rig crew is a pretty insulated set of engineering expertise. A profession whose lingo doesn't quite lend itself to an audience like a writer or lawyer or airline pilot does. It's even more of a wonder the movie is as harrowing as it is when you consider Berg's recent pivot from being a poor man's Michael Bay to a pretty convincing mimic of Paul Greengrass. Only the arrival of Patriots Day (2016) will confirm if that transformation is complete but as of now his mimicry remains sorely undercooked.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is an inability to marry subject with scale. Berg likes to play it tight with his camera, focusing on frenzied in- frame movements, microcosmic gear-churning and bloodied wounds instead of the grandeur of a gigantic rig lighting up like Burning Man. Despite there being a concerted attempt to explore every nook and cranny of the Deepwater, when s*** really hits the fan, you're never quite sure where you are or where the characters are in relation to one another.<br/><br/>What's worse, there's also no time for character in Deepwater Horizon. There's a sense of peril but every time a poor soul gets engulfed by flames, we're never clear on who exactly is in peril, or why we should care. Only Russell and Wahlberg get the chance to emerge from the grime and grease as recognizable faces. Russell in particular is pegged early by virtue of a pretty nice face caterpillar; that and a performance that perfectly captures the zeitgeist of gruff and grizzle we truly need.<br/><br/>As our default protagonist, Mark Wahlberg is given every chance to display his personal brand of everyman heroics. He's basically played the exact same character in Berg's much better Lone Survivor (2013), where he was able to mix aspects of his natural masculinity with his inner Tony Robbins. Here however he's sabotaged by an innocuous presence, slurred speech and indecipherable jargon. I'm sure in a film script less tethered by the limitations of docudrama realism, he could have made it work. Unfortunately oil rig electrician is simply another STEM field job Markie Mark just isn't suited for.<br/><br/>Despite it's many faults however, Deepwater Horizon is an okay movie made just a smidgen more relevant by its real-life story and the fact that it's September and there's not all that much out at the moment. Watch it, enjoy it, and realize that five years from now you'll probably get a question about it at your local tavern's trivia night and get it wrong."
"MichaelNontonMulu","8","0","1","4 October 2016"," The True Story Behind The Largest Oil Spill Incident in History
","This movie was having very slow pace for the first part which took around 45 minutes. Peter Berg, the director whose works included The Rundown, Friday Night Lights, Hancock, and Lone Survivor, seemed to be a very detailed oriented person and I think he wanted to make sure that the events prior to the incident were mostly captured. The thing is, those parts seemed to be very technical and for people who are not accustomed to works at oil rig (offshore), the scenes became too long and resulted to a little bit boredom. As someone who is working at the back office for companies in oil & gas industry, I was personally interested in seeing this part, but I do not think the general audience would enjoy it. <br/><br/>However, the second part of the movie when the incident started to be shown, the pace of the movie suddenly become so fast, and the tense feeling totally crept our mind. My feeling when seeing this part is that people would forget about the slow pace in the beginning and totally enjoyed the rush, the scary moments, the sadness, the relief, the dramatic & touching moments and so many other feelings later. <br/><br/>I also loved the special effects and the sound effects of this movie. The creation of Deepwater Horizon seemed to be very real life. The makeup effect also was very believable. We also would be enjoying the performance of John Malkovich portraying a BP executive who just want to save some money (though I understand that BP also released a statement highlighting that the events in this movie seemed to be only putting the blame on BP when it was due to multiple companies fault). I believe the moral of the story here is that you can never be too cheap when dealing with safety, especially in a high risk environment such as an oil rig. <br/><br/>So for those of you who enjoy watching movies of accident based on true events with good special effects, sound effects and dramatic moments, then this movie would certainly be a good choice. But if you want to have high paced full action movies from beginning till end, then you have to be patient for a while in the beginning before you can enjoy it. As for people who are working in the oil & gas industry, I would recommend to watch this movie to just have our minds opened (especially for back office people).<br/><br/>For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"

","The tragedy of the Deepwater Horizon and the Gulf of Mexico will continue to happen as humanity refuses to acknowledge the dangers of oil drilling and pursues more fuel beneath the ground. Peter Berg takes on another harrowing event of historical significance in this intense historical spectacle.

The movie takes a news story and brings down to a personal level showing interactions between Mike and his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) right before he leaves to work on the rig.<br/><br/>The story also revolves around bridge officer Andrea Fleytas played by rising star Gina Rodriquez. Kurt Russell plays the cautioning Offshore Installation Manager Jimmy Harrell who demands more tests and wants the company to give him more time.

"monstermayhem32","Null","0","1","2 October 2016"," The worst oil spill in us history
","I do recall hearing about this oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico six years ago, I will say that the film generates excellent performances from its cast particularly make wahlberg and Kurt Russell whose character James grows concerned that the be executives seem more interested in profits than the well being of its 126 workers that work at the deep water horizon oil rig. However tragedy does indeed strike during an old rig testing which explodes causing the evacuation of the place. I will say when watching the explosion of the oil rig, I will say those scenes were rather intense as the crew manages to survive such a horrific disaster, I wil, say from my own personal experience. It was a great movie but probably benefits from the IMAX experience. Thought provoking and well acted."

","Peter Berg may have just delivered his best film since ""Friday Night Lights"" or just maybe his best film to date with ""Deepwater Horizon"", an intense, well crafted, well detailed, and emotional spectacle, not often are we treated to big effects heavy spectacles with a firm emotional grip, and characters that feel very well realized. The film takes a while to get to the devastation on the Deepwater Horizon but it's totally worth it thanks to its surprisingly hefty focus on character development. Mark Wahlberg once again provides a good lead performance along with fine supporting performances from Kurt Russell, Gina Rodriguez, and many others."
"Lewis_Heather787","7","0","1","2 October 2016"," Visually terrible.............but in a good way.
","After seeing how capable director Peter Berg is in bringing a true story to the big screen, i.e. Lone Survivor, I was extremely keen in seeing how his second team up with Mark Wahlberg would go. Going into Deepwater Horizon I personally didn't no any specific details about the disaster other than there was a huge explosion and gallons of oil was leaked, which I believe benefited my viewing experience. Firstly the positives of the film, the performances across the board are all solid, with the stand outs being Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell and John Malkovich. Next the directing which again is solid with some stunning camera work, this links into the next and most impressive part of the film for me. The visuals of the film are, as seen in the title of this review, terrible. However I believe that is the point, the visuals of the workmen being covered in mud and oil is visually horrible and really makes the audience feel for the characters. As well as people being flung around by the pressure of the mud and oil, the gruesome injuries of the some of the survivors are needed to even more to show the devastating impact of the leak. Both the extreme visuals and the goriness were not over used but were excellently choreographed and shot through the entirely of the film. Finally the major reason why this disaster occurred is the saddest part of the film, the fact that some senior staff members at BP wanted to make more money. The fact that the workers were bullied into bypassing safety procedures and to make the safety checks come out to the results the managers wanted and not actually what was reality is disgusting. Then too top it off after the investigation of the disaster the worst part of this story occurred, the fact that John Malkovich's character, the main reason why the disaster happened, gets acquitted from the manslaughter charges against him/BP, disgusting again! If your interested in going to see a film with a interesting story and thrilling action I would personally recommend this one, a good solid film with no major negatives to it with a good telling of a true story. However I don't think BP will like this film............ somehow."

","Saw trailers & previews for this film & made plans to go see it as soon as.<br/><br/>The film is about an Oil Rig named Deepwater Horizon which suffered a catastrophic explosion on the 20th April, 2010. The film is based off of the real life events of those involved in the disaster over 6 years ago & the 11 who were killed. <br/><br/>I found the film to be decent, not the greatest. I never knew about the disaster until the film & even then never knew it was based off of true events. But it was a decent watch.<br/><br/>I found the film took a while to get going & dragged with too much dialogue until it got to the action pack explosion parts. This seemed to carry on in certain areas of the film til the end. I also felt some scenes alone dragged on a bit too long, it could have done with a trim in a lot of areas being honest. Get to the point is what I say!<br/><br/>The explosions & action parts were pretty good & spectacular. I did like the survival theme going on & the fire/explosion effects used. Though though all that, I found myself getting a bit lost at points in what was going on & what was happening & basically who was who. It was a bit confusing in areas through the explosions & fire. <br/><br/>The film's rating to a 12 was a turn off also. If they wanted to truly capture the dramatic effect of the horror & disastrous chaos that took place & unfolded that day, then why not kick the film up to a 15 rating? I found some parts of this film, the injuries to be too subtle & toned down which I found to be restrained. I'm not saying it has to be Saw gory, I'm saying that it could be beefed up a bit more.<br/><br/>I overall found this to be a great film, it was a watchable film based off the events of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. 7/10"
"cdcrb","8","0","1","1 October 2016"," good job
","what might seem like a throw back to the big disaster movies from the 70's, is instead a thought provoking serious study about what happens when the almighty bottom line comes before everything else. and unlike those 70's movies, there are no back stories here, just the meat and potatoes of what went wrong on the bp rig in the gulf of Mexico and the tragedy that follows. because the job is falling behind schedule and bp is losing money every day, corners are cut and when the tests of the integrity of the drilling fail all hell breaks loose. why many more people weren't killed is a miracle. as usual mark whalburg is very good and kurt Russell is fine, also. this is a very sturdy effort by peter berg. he's very good with technical details and respectful of the men and women who risk their lives to provide us with the oil we so desperately seem to need. I am not being political, here. we are just very dependent on it."
